As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles.  Although it is a [[street-legal vehicle]] in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states, territories, and provinces of [[Australia]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]].\n\nBy the current ANSI definition, ATVs are intended for use by a single operator, although some companies have developed ATVs intended for use by the operator and one passenger. In some countries, the passenger is not required to wear a helmet.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}  These ATVs are referred to as tandem ATVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|title=Standards for All Terrain Vehicles and Ban of Three-Wheeled All Terrain Vehicles; Proposed Rule|publisher=Consumer Product Safety Commission (Federal Register)|date=10 August 2006|accessdate=26 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113022054/http://www.cpsc.gov/businfo/frnotices/fr06/066703.html|archivedate=13 January 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds.

With the introduction of straddle ridden ATVs, the term AATV was introduced to define the original [[amphibious ATV]] category.\n\n===Three-wheeler era (1967\u20131987)===\n\n{{Main|List of Honda Three-wheeled all-terrain vehicles}}\n{{globalize|section|US|reason=the CPSC is a U.S. agency, the 3-wheeled ban was a U.S. ban; it needs coverage beyond the U.S. in the end of the era, and what \"end\" means|date=November 2019}}\nThe first [[three-wheeler|three-wheeled]] ATV was the [[Sperry-Rand]] Tricart.  It was designed in 1967 as a graduate project of John Plessinger at the Cranbrook Academy of Arts near Detroit.  The Tricart was straddle-ridden with a sit-in rather than sit-on style (similar to the contemporaneous [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel toy]]).  In 1968 Plessinger sold the Tricart patents and design rights to Sperry-Rand [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] who manufactured them commercially.  Numerous small American manufacturers of 3-wheelers followed.  These small manufacturers were unable to compete when larger motorcycle companies like Honda entered the market in 1969.\n \n[[File:1984 Honda 200s.jpg|thumb|1984 Honda ATC200S, one of the many three-wheeled models made by Honda and other manufacturers]]\n\n==Recreational ATC Development==\n[[Honda]] introduced their first sit-on straddle-ridden three-wheeled All Terrain Vehicle in 1969, known as a [[Honda US90|US90]], as a 1970 Model. Variations would be popularized in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] movie, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and TV shows such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' and ''[[Hart to Hart]]''. In 1973, Honda would trademark the term \"All Terrain Cycle\" (ATC), applying the moniker to all Honda produced Three-wheeled ATV\u2019s, and creating the universal name which now  associated with all vehicles of this type. Being directly influenced by earlier 6-wheeled [[All-terrain vehicle#Six-wheeled AATVs|AATV's]] of the sixties, it utilized balloon tires for both a low environmental impact and to compensate for a lack of [[Suspension (motorcycle)|mechanical suspension]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html|title=ATC90 History|author =Chris Cooper|accessdate=2 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061216144600/http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html| archivedate= 16 December 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nTrademarking of various design features by Honda hindered other Japanese manufacturers from entering the market. By the 1980\u2019s, other companies would paid patent royalties to Honda to enter the lucrative ATC field with their own machines.\n\nAs the popularity of ATC\u2019s increased dramatically around 1980, rapid development ensued, and machines originally designed for recreation were were developed into Sport and utility models. Suspension and lower-profile tires were introduced. The 1982 Honda ATC200E Big Red was a landmark model. It featured both suspension and racks, making it the first utility three-wheeled ATV. The ability to go anywhere on terrain that most other vehicles could not cross soon made them popular with US and Canadian hunters, and those just looking for a good trail ride. Soon other manufacturers introduced their own models. Sales of utility machines skyrocketed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSport models were also developed by Honda, which had a virtual monopoly in the market due to effective patents on design and engine placement. The 1981 [[ATC250R]] was the first high-performance three-wheeler, featuring full suspension, a {{convert|248|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} air cooled [[two-stroke]] engine, a five-speed transmission with manual clutch, and a front disc brake. For the sporting trail rider, the 1983 ATC200X was another landmark machine. It used an easy-to-handle {{convert|192|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] that was ideal for new participants in the sport. The ATC200X was the first high-performance [[four-stroke]] ATV that featured full suspension, front and rear disc brakes with single piston calipers, an {{convert|18|hp|kW|1|adj=on}} engine, sporty looks and is widely considered one of the best ATVs ever produced. Today, ATC200Xs can be found on the market in all conditions and prices, and is still highly regarded and followed by the aftermarket community.\n\nIn 1985, Honda also introduced the new ATC350X. The ATC350X was another high-performance three-wheeler, similar to the ATC200X, but as an entirely new machine. The 350X featured a {{convert|26|hp|kW|1|adj=on}} air and oil cooled {{convert|350|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] engine with a 4-valve head; impressive technology for the time. The engine was so good, it found its way into many hybrid race four-wheelers in later years. The engine was a torque monster, and Honda wasn't afraid to call the 350X \"the King of the Hill\" in its marketing of the machine. The suspension was a step in between the all new ATC250R (which featured a {{convert|246|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} liquid-cooled 2-stroke engine and nearly 10 inches of travel in its suspension, front and back) and the ATC200X, with {{convert|8.5|in|mm}} of travel in the front forks. The 350X featured disc brakes with dual piston brake calipers for superb stopping power. However, the 350X suffered in handling with an underbuilt chassis which made the machine unpopular with racers, except for those who chose to be different by racing a [[four-stroke]] machine as [[two-stroke]]s were the engine of choice at the time. The aftermarket came out with a custom gusset kit that significantly strengthens the frame at its weakest points for riders that wish to build a race machine.\n\nIn 1986, the ATC200X got a complete redesign. The machine shared nothing in common with its predecessor than the name. It got an all new {{convert|199|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] engine, white plastics which were notably sportier, longer suspension travel, and a completely resigned \"box\" frame, which was made of square tubing instead of round tubing for a significant strength increase. The ATC350X also got various updates, including white plastics and most notably a revised oil pickup point in the engine, to help reduce engine oil starvation when riding long wheelies.\n\nOther models, such as the ATC250SX were sold. The ATC250SX was the first sport utility ATV. It featured a {{convert|250|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} air-cooled [[four-stroke]] engine that like the later revised Big Reds, were shaft propeller instead of chain. It featured larger balloon tires and a sportier look than the similar Big Reds, but could be ordered with cargo racks if the buyer chose to.\n\nFor 1985 and later 1986, Honda introduced an all new ATC250R. Different from previous generations, the new machines was most notably larger, sportier and now featured a liquid-cooled {{convert|246|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke]]. At a light weight of {{convert|292|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}, the machine was a capable competitor, with its {{convert|38|hp|kW|1}} drivetrain. Collectors today rank the 1985\u201386 ATC250R among the most desirable ATC\u2019s of the era, and aftermarket support still follows the machine. The bike is widely raced across the United States.\n\nOver the next few years, all manufacturers except [[Suzuki]], developed high-performance [[two-stroke]] machines, but did not sell as many due to the reputation already secured by Honda. These models were the Yamaha Tri-Z YTZ250 with a {{convert|246|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} two-stroke engine and a [[Manual transmission|manual]] five- or six-speed gearbox and the Kawasaki Tecate KXT250 with a {{convert|249|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} two-stroke with a five or 6 speed gearbox. However, the Honda ATC250R still proved to be more popular than both others, with owners and racers citing that it had a more usable power band and handled the best of the three. It continued to outsell both the Tri-Z and Tecate in large numbers, including when the machines were converted from three to four wheels and sold side by side.\n\n===American Based Manufacturers===\n\n{{Main|Tiger ATV LTD|Polaris Scrambler 250R/es}}\n\nAmerican-based manufacturers also produced ATC\u2019s in this period, abet in small numbers. [[Polaris Inc.|Polaris]] offered the [[Polaris Scrambler 250R/es|Scrambler]] in 1985 and 1986, producing appx 1600 units. Speciality manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger ATV]] also produces a range of ATC\u2019s,, but their liquidation in 1991 left no official record of how many units were produced. The collector ATV market estimates vary drastically, from 300 to as many as 1000 units total production.  Tiger ATC\u2019s were offered for three years, with models using {{convert|80| to |500|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke]] engines provided by [[KTM]] and [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]].\n\nThe Tiger 500 is notable for being the fastest consumer ATC available, with tested top speeds of +80&nbsp;mph from the stock  {{convert|42|hp|kW|1}}@6500rpm engine and 5 speed gearbox. With Final drive gearing changes, the ATC could produce speeds exceeding 100mph.  However, due to the rarity of the machines, much of the public was and remains unaware of the brand, and as all Tiger Models were custom ordered and built to the buyers specifications for the purpose of factory ATV racing, Polaris is generally known as the first American \u2018Production\u2019 ATV producer. \n\n===Voluntary Cease of Production===\n\nProduction of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987, in light of safety concerns, and ahead of any legislation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle fatalities\u2014West Virginia, 1999\u20132006 |journal= Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=312\u20135 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18368006 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5712a2.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> Though future studies would show that three-wheelers were not considered more unstable than four-wheelers (although accidents are equally severe in both classes),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganos D, Crady S, Poortenga S, Hoffman G, Mann R |title=Trauma associated with three- and four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles: is the four-wheeler an unrecognized health hazard? |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=429\u201333 |date=July 1988 |pmid=3389591}}</ref> manufacturers agreed to a 10-year moratorium on production, as well as collectively financing a +$100 million ATV safety campaign. Despite the moratorium lifting, manufacturers have not returned to the ATC market, focusing instead on four wheeled ATV\u2019s. A ban on sales of new or used three-wheelers and a recall of all remaining three-wheelers has been proposed by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle injury prevention: two-, three-, and four-wheeled unlicensed motor vehicles |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1352\u20134 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10835081 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.6.1352|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, it was determined in a CPSC study that three-wheelers are no more dangerous than other ATVs. Because of the cessation of production, it is widely assumed that the machines are unregistrable, uninsurable, and even illegal, despite a lack of any federal restrictions. All ATC\u2019s continue to be governed by the same laws as ATV\u2019s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese safety issues with three-wheel ATCs caused a shift in the buying public, as the sales of recently introduced four-wheel ATV models grew rapidly. While three-wheel models ended production in 1987, agreements between the major manufacturers and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]\u2014to officially cease production and finance safety campaigns moved forward. While the lighter weight of ATC\u2019s made them popular with certain riders, manufacturers continued to focus on ATV production. \n\n===Safety Concerns of ATC\u2019s=== \n\nSafety courses and educational literature has reduced the amount and severity of accidents among ATC and ATV riders. As cornering is more challenging on an ATC than with a four-wheeled machine, properly leaning into the turn is required, to counterbalance the weight and keep the machine stable. Operators may roll over if caution isn't used at high speeds. The lighter nature and smaller footprint of ATC front end\u2019s of ATC\u2019s present both a flipping and steering hazard Under acceleration and on inclines. Rollovers may also occur when traveling steep incline. However, in most terrain with the proper riding technique and safety gear, this issues can be mitigated. ATC\u2019s require unique techniques to ride properly, and turning lean requires more exaggeration than ATV\u2019s; Throttle steering is another technique commonly used on ATC\u2019s in soft terrain and at high speeds, leaning to the inside of the turn and manipulating the throttle to break traction with the rear tires, resulting in the machines turning on axis while maintaining a forward direction.\n\n===H.R.

It sold the first model, the 1982 QuadRunner LT125, which was a recreational machine for beginners. \n\nAdventure Vehicles of Monroe, Louisiana made the first quad ATV in 1980. They called it the Avenger 400. Prior to that, Adventure Vehicles made 3 wheel ATVs and a dump body utility 3 wheeler using Kohler 8 hp engines and Comet drive systems (Comet centrifugal belt driven clutch and a Comet forward, neutral, reverse transaxle with a rigid rear axle or rear differential option.) The Avenger 400 was a rigid suspension vehicle with a fiberglass body and welded tube construction. It was a rudimentary vehicle reminiscent of the Tote Gote of the 1960s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hc9EJcgig8 \n\nSuzuki sold the first four-wheeled mini ATV, the LT50, from 1984 to 1987. After the LT50, Suzuki sold the first ATV with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission, the LT80, from 1987 to 2006.\n\nIn 1985 Suzuki introduced to the industry the first high-performance four-wheel ATV, the [[Suzuki LT250R]] QuadRacer. This machine was in production for the 1985\u20131992 model years.  During its production run it underwent three major engineering makeovers.  However, the core features were retained. These were: a sophisticated long-travel suspension, a liquid-cooled two-stroke motor and a fully manual five-speed transmission for 1985\u20131986 models and a six-speed transmission for the 87\u201392 models. It was a machine exclusively designed for racing by highly skilled riders.\n\nHonda responded a year later with the FourTrax TRX250R\u2014a machine that has not been replicated until recently. It currently remains a trophy winner and competitor to big-bore ATVs. [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle & Engine|Kawasaki]] responded with its [[Kawasaki Tecate 4|Tecate-4]] 250. The TRX250R was very similar to the ATC250R it eventually replaced, and is often considered one of the greatest sport ATVs ever built.\n\nIn 1987, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a different type of high-performance machine, the [[Yamaha Banshee 350|Banshee 350]], which featured a twin-cylinder liquid-cooled two-stroke motor from the RD350LC street motorcycle. Heavier and more difficult to ride in the dirt than the 250s, the Banshee became a popular machine with sand dune riders thanks to its unique power delivery. The Banshee remains popular, but 2006 is the last year it was available in the U.S. (due to EPA emissions regulations); it remained available in Canada until 2008 and in Australia until 2012. The Warrior 350 was introduced in 1987 and went on for years as a light and fast ATV.\n\nShortly after the introduction of the Banshee in 1987, Suzuki released the LT500R QuadRacer. This unique quad was powered by a 500&nbsp;cc liquid-cooled two-stroke engine with a five-speed transmission. This ATV earned the nickname \"Quadzilla\" with its remarkable amount of speed and size. While there are claims of 100+ mph ({{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|disp=out}}) stock Quadzillas, it was officially recorded by 3&4 Wheel Action magazine as reaching a top speed of over {{convert|79|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in a high-speed shootout in its 1988 June issue, making it the fastest production four-wheeled ATV ever produced. Suzuki discontinued the production of the LT500R in 1990 after just four years.\n\nAt the same time, development of utility ATVs was rapidly escalating. The 1986 Honda FourTrax TRX350 4x4 ushered in the era of [[four-wheel drive]] ATVs. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit, and 4x4s have remained the most popular type of ATV ever since. These machines are popular with hunters, farmers, ranchers and workers at construction sites.\n\n[[File:Spreader AF.jpg|thumb|ATV with a [[tow spreader]] mounted]]\n\nModels continue, today, to be divided into the sport and utility markets. Sport models are generally small, light, [[two-wheel drive]] vehicles that accelerate quickly, have a manual transmission and run at speeds up to approximately {{convert|80|mph|abbr=on}}. Utility models are generally bigger [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles with a maximum speed of up to approximately {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. They have the ability to haul small loads on attached racks or small dump beds. They may also tow small trailers. Due to the different weights, each has advantages on different types of terrain. A popular model is Yamaha's Raptor 700, which features a nearly 700&nbsp;cc [[four-stroke]] engine.\n\nSix-wheel models often have a small dump bed, with an extra set of wheels at the back to increase the payload capacity. They can be either four-wheel drive (back wheels driving only), or six-wheel drive.\n\nIn 2011 [[LandFighter]] was founded, \"the first Dutch/European ATV brand\". The largest part of production takes site in Taiwan, to [[European standards]]; the ATVs are finally assembled in the Netherlands.\n\n== Safety and legal regulation ==\nSafety has been a major issue with ATVs due to the high number of deaths and injuries associated with them and the negligible protection offered by the machine.\n[[File:USMC-12093.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Roll cage|Roll-over protection]] fitted 4x4 used by the US Marines Special Operations]]\nThe modern breed of ATVs was introduced in the early 1970s and almost immediately realized alarming injury rates for children and adolescents.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirkpatrick R, Puffinbarger W, Sullivan JA |title=All-terrain vehicle injuries in children |journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=725\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17878773 |doi=10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181558856}}</ref> Based on analysis of the [[National Trauma Data Bank]], ATVs are more dangerous than [[dirt bike]]s, possibly due to crush injuries and failure to wear safety gear such as helmets.<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/EmergencyMedicine/EmergencyMedicine/22593 \"ACS: Off-Road Injuries Worse With Four-Wheelers\"] article by Crystal Phend, Senior Staff Writer, ''MedPage Today'', 6 October 2010.

To be successful at fast trail riding, an ATV must have light weight, high power, good suspension and a low center of gravity. These machines can be modified for such racing disciplines as [[motocross]], woods racing (also known as cross country), [[off-road racing|desert racing]] (also known as Hare Scrambles), [[hill climbing]], [[ice racing]], speedway, Tourist Trophy (TT), [[Short track motor racing|flat track]], [[drag racing]] and others.\n\nThroughout the United States and the United Kingdom there are many quad racing clubs with [[enduro]] and quadcross sections. [[Grand National Cross Country|GNCC Racing]] began around 1980 and includes hare scramble and enduro type races. To date, events are mainly held in the eastern part of the United States. GNCC racing features many types of obstacles such as, hill climbing, creek and log crossings, dirt roads and wooded trails.\n\nATV National Motocross Championship<ref>[http://www.atvmotocross.com ATVmotorcross.com]</ref> was formed around 1985. ATVMX events are hosted at premiere motocross racetracks throughout the United States. ATVMX consists of several groups, including the Pro (AMA Pro) and Amateur (ATVA) series. Friday involves amateur practicing and racing on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday also involves racing for the Pro Am Women and Pro Am Unlimited classes. Sunday involves racing for the Pro and Pro Am production ATVs, but are scored separately. On average weekend over 500 racers will compete.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] organizes the [[Quadcross of Nations]] at the end of the year. The competition involves teams of three riders representing their nations. There are three motos with two riders of each nation competing per moto. The location of the event changes from year to year.\n\nChampionship Mud Racing/CMR saw its infancy in 2006 as leaders of the ATV industry recognized a need for uniformity of classes and rules of various local mud bog events. Providing standardized rules created the need for a governing body that both racers and event promoters could turn to and CMR was born. Once unified, a true points series was established and lead to a national championship for what was once nothing more than a hobby for most. In 2007 the finalized board of directors was established and the first races were held in 2008. Currently, the CMR schedule includes eight competition dates spanning from March to November. Points are awarded throughout the season in several different competition classes of ATV and SxS Mud Racing. The 2008 year included Mud Bog and Mudda-Cross competitions, but the 2009 and future seasons will only have Mudda-Cross competitions. Classes range from 0\u2013499&nbsp;cc to a Super-Modified class which will allow any size ATV in competition. The ultimate goal of The CMR is \"to see the growth of ATV Mud Racing as a competitive sport and give competitors a pedestal upon which they can receive the recognition from national media and industry sponsors that they have long deserved.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |title=CMR \u2013 About \u2013 Championship Mud Racing |access-date=24 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306181505/http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |archive-date=6 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the [[FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship]] started with a Quad Championship and the [[Dakar Rally]] added the Quad category in 2008. Because the [[2008 Dakar Rally]] was cancelled, the [[2009 Dakar Rally]] was the first [[Dakar Rally]] with Quads.\n\nAmateur and professional three-wheeler racing across the United States has also spiked in popularity once again, at levels not seen since the factory teams raced in the 1980s. Part of the appeal is the cheapness of parts, and how easy it is to get into. Races are held at various local and large venues, particularly in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and California. Payouts are sometimes awarded to winners.\n\nEach year in June, the world's biggest three-wheeler gathering is held at Haspin Acres, in [[Laurel, Indiana]], for the Trikefest event. Over the course of 3 days complete with camping, hundreds of people gather for the event which features competitive racing such as MX style racing, drag racing, mud racing, hill climbs and other events. For those who wish not to compete, there are also many trails a person can ride. as many as 100 or more three-wheelers show up each year, some built and restored to be raffled off, others brought to ride.\n\nThe fastest speed recorded on a quad cycle, or ATV given a flying start, is 315.74&nbsp;km/h (196.19&nbsp;mph), by Terry Wilmeth (USA), at the Madras, Airport in Madras, Oregon, USA, on 15 June 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101 101]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amphibious ATV]]\n* [[Car]]\n* [[Dune buggy]]\n* [[John Deere]]\n* [[Motorcycle]]\n* [[Motorized tricycle]]\n* [[Non-road engine]]\n* [[Off-road vehicle]]\n* [[Side-by-side (vehicle)|Side-by-side vehicle]]\n* [[Tomcar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|All-terrain vehicles}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!

The Tricart was straddle-ridden with a sit-in rather than sit-on style (similar to the contemporaneous [[Big Wheel (tricycle)|Big Wheel toy]]).  In 1968 Plessinger sold the Tricart patents and design rights to Sperry-Rand [[New Holland Agriculture|New Holland]] who manufactured them commercially.  Numerous small American manufacturers of 3-wheelers followed.  These small manufacturers were unable to compete when larger motorcycle companies like Honda entered the market in 1969.\n \n[[File:1984 Honda 200s.jpg|thumb|1984 Honda ATC200S, one of the many three-wheeled models made by Honda and other manufacturers]]\n\n==Recreational ATC Development==\n[[Honda]] introduced their first sit-on straddle-ridden three-wheeled All Terrain Vehicle in 1969, known as a [[Honda US90|US90]], as a 1970 Model.

In 1973, Honda would trademark the term \"All Terrain Cycle\" (ATC), applying the moniker to all Honda produced Three-wheeled ATV\u2019s, and creating the universal name which now  associated with all vehicles of this type. Being directly influenced by earlier 6-wheeled ballon-tired ATVs of the sixties, it utilized balloon tires for both a low environmental impact and to compensate for a lack of [[Suspension (motorcycle)|mechanical suspension]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html|title=ATC90 History|author =Chris Cooper|accessdate=2 January 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061216144600/http://atc90.tripod.com/hondaatc90/id17.html| archivedate= 16 December 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nTrademarking of various design features by Honda hindered other Japanese manufacturers from entering the market. By the 1980\u2019s, other companies would paid patent royalties to Honda to enter the lucrative ATC field with their own machines.\n\nAs the popularity of ATC\u2019s increased dramatically around 1980, rapid development ensued, and machines originally designed for recreation were were developed into Sport and utility models. Suspension and lower-profile tires were introduced. The 1982 Honda ATC200E Big Red was a landmark model. It featured both suspension and racks, making it the first utility three-wheeled ATV. The ability to go anywhere on terrain that most other vehicles could not cross soon made them popular with US and Canadian hunters, and those just looking for a good trail ride. Soon other manufacturers introduced their own models. Sales of utility machines skyrocketed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSport models were also developed by Honda, which had a virtual monopoly in the market due to effective patents on design and engine placement. The 1981 [[ATC250R]] was the first high-performance three-wheeler, featuring full suspension, a {{convert|248|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} air cooled [[two-stroke]] engine, a five-speed transmission with manual clutch, and a front disc brake.

It used an easy-to-handle {{convert|192|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] that was ideal for new participants in the sport. The ATC200X was the first high-performance [[four-stroke]] ATV that featured full suspension, front and rear disc brakes with single piston calipers, an {{convert|18|hp|kW|1|adj=on}} engine, sporty looks and is widely considered one of the best ATVs ever produced. Today, ATC200Xs can be found on the market in all conditions and prices, and is still highly regarded and followed by the aftermarket community.\n\nIn 1985, Honda also introduced the new ATC350X. The ATC350X was another high-performance three-wheeler, similar to the ATC200X, but as an entirely new machine. The 350X featured a {{convert|26|hp|kW|1|adj=on}} air and oil cooled {{convert|350|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] engine with a 4-valve head; impressive technology for the time. The engine was so good, it found its way into many hybrid race four-wheelers in later years. The engine was a torque monster, and Honda wasn't afraid to call the 350X \"the King of the Hill\" in its marketing of the machine. The suspension was a step in between the all new ATC250R (which featured a {{convert|246|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} liquid-cooled 2-stroke engine and nearly 10 inches of travel in its suspension, front and back) and the ATC200X, with {{convert|8.5|in|mm}} of travel in the front forks. The 350X featured disc brakes with dual piston brake calipers for superb stopping power. However, the 350X suffered in handling with an underbuilt chassis which made the machine unpopular with racers, except for those who chose to be different by racing a [[four-stroke]] machine as [[two-stroke]]s were the engine of choice at the time. The aftermarket came out with a custom gusset kit that significantly strengthens the frame at its weakest points for riders that wish to build a race machine.\n\nIn 1986, the ATC200X got a complete redesign. The machine shared nothing in common with its predecessor than the name. It got an all new {{convert|199|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[four-stroke]] engine, white plastics which were notably sportier, longer suspension travel, and a completely resigned \"box\" frame, which was made of square tubing instead of round tubing for a significant strength increase. The ATC350X also got various updates, including white plastics and most notably a revised oil pickup point in the engine, to help reduce engine oil starvation when riding long wheelies.\n\nOther models, such as the ATC250SX were sold. The ATC250SX was the first sport utility ATV. It featured a {{convert|250|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} air-cooled [[four-stroke]] engine that like the later revised Big Reds, were shaft propeller instead of chain. It featured larger balloon tires and a sportier look than the similar Big Reds, but could be ordered with cargo racks if the buyer chose to.\n\nFor 1985 and later 1986, Honda introduced an all new ATC250R. Different from previous generations, the new machines was most notably larger, sportier and now featured a liquid-cooled {{convert|246|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke]]. At a light weight of {{convert|292|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}, the machine was a capable competitor, with its {{convert|38|hp|kW|1}} drivetrain. Collectors today rank the 1985\u201386 ATC250R among the most desirable ATC\u2019s of the era, and aftermarket support still follows the machine. The bike is widely raced across the United States.\n\nOver the next few years, all manufacturers except [[Suzuki]], developed high-performance [[two-stroke]] machines, but did not sell as many due to the reputation already secured by Honda. These models were the Yamaha Tri-Z YTZ250 with a {{convert|246|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} two-stroke engine and a [[Manual transmission|manual]] five- or six-speed gearbox and the Kawasaki Tecate KXT250 with a {{convert|249|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} two-stroke with a five or 6 speed gearbox. However, the Honda ATC250R still proved to be more popular than both others, with owners and racers citing that it had a more usable power band and handled the best of the three. It continued to outsell both the Tri-Z and Tecate in large numbers, including when the machines were converted from three to four wheels and sold side by side.\n\n===American Based Manufacturers===\n\n{{Main|Tiger ATV LTD|Polaris Scrambler 250R/es}}\n\nAmerican-based manufacturers also produced ATC\u2019s in this period, abet in small numbers. [[Polaris Inc.|Polaris]] offered the [[Polaris Scrambler 250R/es|Scrambler]] in 1985 and 1986, producing appx 1600 units. Speciality manufacturer [[Tiger ATV LTD|Tiger ATV]] also produces a range of ATC\u2019s,, but their liquidation in 1991 left no official record of how many units were produced. The collector ATV market estimates vary drastically, from 300 to as many as 1000 units total production.  Tiger ATC\u2019s were offered for three years, with models using {{convert|80| to |500|cc|L cuin|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[two-stroke]] engines provided by [[KTM]] and [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]].\n\nThe Tiger 500 is notable for being the fastest consumer ATC available, with tested top speeds of +80&nbsp;mph from the stock  {{convert|42|hp|kW|1}}@6500rpm engine and 5 speed gearbox. With Final drive gearing changes, the ATC could produce speeds exceeding 100mph.  However, due to the rarity of the machines, much of the public was and remains unaware of the brand, and as all Tiger Models were custom ordered and built to the buyers specifications for the purpose of factory ATV racing, Polaris is generally known as the first American \u2018Production\u2019 ATV producer. \n\n===Voluntary Cease of Production===\n\nProduction of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987, in light of safety concerns, and ahead of any legislation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle fatalities\u2014West Virginia, 1999\u20132006 |journal= Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report |volume=57 |issue=12 |pages=312\u20135 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18368006 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5712a2.htm |author1= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)}}</ref> Though future studies would show that three-wheelers were not considered more unstable than four-wheelers (although accidents are equally severe in both classes),<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganos D, Crady S, Poortenga S, Hoffman G, Mann R |title=Trauma associated with three- and four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles: is the four-wheeler an unrecognized health hazard? |journal=The American Surgeon |volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=429\u201333 |date=July 1988 |pmid=3389591}}</ref> manufacturers agreed to a 10-year moratorium on production, as well as collectively financing a +$100 million ATV safety campaign. Despite the moratorium lifting, manufacturers have not returned to the ATC market, focusing instead on four wheeled ATV\u2019s. A ban on sales of new or used three-wheelers and a recall of all remaining three-wheelers has been proposed by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=All-terrain vehicle injury prevention: two-, three-, and four-wheeled unlicensed motor vehicles |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1352\u20134 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10835081 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.6.1352|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, it was determined in a CPSC study that three-wheelers are no more dangerous than other ATVs. Because of the cessation of production, it is widely assumed that the machines are unregistrable, uninsurable, and even illegal, despite a lack of any federal restrictions. All ATC\u2019s continue to be governed by the same laws as ATV\u2019s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThese safety issues with three-wheel ATCs caused a shift in the buying public, as the sales of recently introduced four-wheel ATV models grew rapidly. While three-wheel models ended production in 1987, agreements between the major manufacturers and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]]\u2014to officially cease production and finance safety campaigns moved forward. While the lighter weight of ATC\u2019s made them popular with certain riders, manufacturers continued to focus on ATV production. \n\n===Safety Concerns of ATC\u2019s=== \n\nSafety courses and educational literature has reduced the amount and severity of accidents among ATC and ATV riders. As cornering is more challenging on an ATC than with a four-wheeled machine, properly leaning into the turn is required, to counterbalance the weight and keep the machine stable. Operators may roll over if caution isn't used at high speeds. The lighter nature and smaller footprint of ATC front end\u2019s of ATC\u2019s present both a flipping and steering hazard Under acceleration and on inclines. Rollovers may also occur when traveling steep incline. However, in most terrain with the proper riding technique and safety gear, this issues can be mitigated. ATC\u2019s require unique techniques to ride properly, and turning lean requires more exaggeration than ATV\u2019s; Throttle steering is another technique commonly used on ATC\u2019s in soft terrain and at high speeds, leaning to the inside of the turn and manipulating the throttle to break traction with the rear tires, resulting in the machines turning on axis while maintaining a forward direction.\n\n===H.R.

It sold the first model, the 1982 QuadRunner LT125, which was a recreational machine for beginners. \n\nAdventure Vehicles of Monroe, Louisiana made the first quad ATV in 1980. They called it the Avenger 400. Prior to that, Adventure Vehicles made 3 wheel ATVs and a dump body utility 3 wheeler using Kohler 8 hp engines and Comet drive systems (Comet centrifugal belt driven clutch and a Comet forward, neutral, reverse transaxle with a rigid rear axle or rear differential option.) The Avenger 400 was a rigid suspension vehicle with a fiberglass body and welded tube construction. It was a rudimentary vehicle reminiscent of the Tote Gote of the 1960s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hc9EJcgig8 \n\nSuzuki sold the first four-wheeled mini ATV, the LT50, from 1984 to 1987. After the LT50, Suzuki sold the first ATV with a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] transmission, the LT80, from 1987 to 2006.\n\nIn 1985 Suzuki introduced to the industry the first high-performance four-wheel ATV, the [[Suzuki LT250R]] QuadRacer. This machine was in production for the 1985\u20131992 model years.  During its production run it underwent three major engineering makeovers.  However, the core features were retained. These were: a sophisticated long-travel suspension, a liquid-cooled two-stroke motor and a fully manual five-speed transmission for 1985\u20131986 models and a six-speed transmission for the 87\u201392 models. It was a machine exclusively designed for racing by highly skilled riders.\n\nHonda responded a year later with the FourTrax TRX250R\u2014a machine that has not been replicated until recently. It currently remains a trophy winner and competitor to big-bore ATVs. [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle & Engine|Kawasaki]] responded with its [[Kawasaki Tecate 4|Tecate-4]] 250. The TRX250R was very similar to the ATC250R it eventually replaced, and is often considered one of the greatest sport ATVs ever built.\n\nIn 1987, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a different type of high-performance machine, the [[Yamaha Banshee 350|Banshee 350]], which featured a twin-cylinder liquid-cooled two-stroke motor from the RD350LC street motorcycle. Heavier and more difficult to ride in the dirt than the 250s, the Banshee became a popular machine with sand dune riders thanks to its unique power delivery. The Banshee remains popular, but 2006 is the last year it was available in the U.S. (due to EPA emissions regulations); it remained available in Canada until 2008 and in Australia until 2012. The Warrior 350 was introduced in 1987 and went on for years as a light and fast ATV.\n\nShortly after the introduction of the Banshee in 1987, Suzuki released the LT500R QuadRacer. This unique quad was powered by a 500&nbsp;cc liquid-cooled two-stroke engine with a five-speed transmission. This ATV earned the nickname \"Quadzilla\" with its remarkable amount of speed and size. While there are claims of 100+ mph ({{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|disp=out}}) stock Quadzillas, it was officially recorded by 3&4 Wheel Action magazine as reaching a top speed of over {{convert|79|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in a high-speed shootout in its 1988 June issue, making it the fastest production four-wheeled ATV ever produced. Suzuki discontinued the production of the LT500R in 1990 after just four years.\n\nAt the same time, development of utility ATVs was rapidly escalating. The 1986 Honda FourTrax TRX350 4x4 ushered in the era of [[four-wheel drive]] ATVs. Other manufacturers quickly followed suit, and 4x4s have remained the most popular type of ATV ever since. These machines are popular with hunters, farmers, ranchers and workers at construction sites.\n\n[[File:Spreader AF.jpg|thumb|ATV with a [[tow spreader]] mounted]]\n\nModels continue, today, to be divided into the sport and utility markets. Sport models are generally small, light, [[two-wheel drive]] vehicles that accelerate quickly, have a manual transmission and run at speeds up to approximately {{convert|80|mph|abbr=on}}. Utility models are generally bigger [[four-wheel drive]] vehicles with a maximum speed of up to approximately {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}. They have the ability to haul small loads on attached racks or small dump beds. They may also tow small trailers. Due to the different weights, each has advantages on different types of terrain. A popular model is Yamaha's Raptor 700, which features a nearly 700&nbsp;cc [[four-stroke]] engine.\n\nSix-wheel models often have a small dump bed, with an extra set of wheels at the back to increase the payload capacity. They can be either four-wheel drive (back wheels driving only), or six-wheel drive.\n\nIn 2011 [[LandFighter]] was founded, \"the first Dutch/European ATV brand\". The largest part of production takes site in Taiwan, to [[European standards]]; the ATVs are finally assembled in the Netherlands.\n\n== Safety and legal regulation ==\nSafety has been a major issue with ATVs due to the high number of deaths and injuries associated with them and the negligible protection offered by the machine.\n[[File:USMC-12093.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Roll cage|Roll-over protection]] fitted 4x4 used by the US Marines Special Operations]]\nThe modern breed of ATVs was introduced in the early 1970s and almost immediately realized alarming injury rates for children and adolescents.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kirkpatrick R, Puffinbarger W, Sullivan JA |title=All-terrain vehicle injuries in children |journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics |volume=27 |issue=7 |pages=725\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17878773 |doi=10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181558856}}</ref> Based on analysis of the [[National Trauma Data Bank]], ATVs are more dangerous than [[dirt bike]]s, possibly due to crush injuries and failure to wear safety gear such as helmets.<ref>[http://www.medpagetoday.com/EmergencyMedicine/EmergencyMedicine/22593 \"ACS: Off-Road Injuries Worse With Four-Wheelers\"] article by Crystal Phend, Senior Staff Writer, ''MedPage Today'', 6 October 2010.

Proper trail construction techniques can mitigate these effects.<ref name=FederalRegister2005/>\n\nIn some countries where fencing is not common, such as the US, Canada and Australia, some of ATV riders knowingly cross [[ownership|privately owned property]] in rural areas and travel over public/private properties, where their use is limited only to trails.

To be successful at fast trail riding, an ATV must have light weight, high power, good suspension and a low center of gravity. These machines can be modified for such racing disciplines as [[motocross]], woods racing (also known as cross country), [[off-road racing|desert racing]] (also known as Hare Scrambles), [[hill climbing]], [[ice racing]], speedway, Tourist Trophy (TT), [[Short track motor racing|flat track]], [[drag racing]] and others.\n\nThroughout the United States and the United Kingdom there are many quad racing clubs with [[enduro]] and quadcross sections. [[Grand National Cross Country|GNCC Racing]] began around 1980 and includes hare scramble and enduro type races. To date, events are mainly held in the eastern part of the United States. GNCC racing features many types of obstacles such as, hill climbing, creek and log crossings, dirt roads and wooded trails.\n\nATV National Motocross Championship<ref>[http://www.atvmotocross.com ATVmotorcross.com]</ref> was formed around 1985. ATVMX events are hosted at premiere motocross racetracks throughout the United States. ATVMX consists of several groups, including the Pro (AMA Pro) and Amateur (ATVA) series. Friday involves amateur practicing and racing on Saturday and Sunday. Saturday also involves racing for the Pro Am Women and Pro Am Unlimited classes. Sunday involves racing for the Pro and Pro Am production ATVs, but are scored separately. On average weekend over 500 racers will compete.\n\nThe [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] organizes the [[Quadcross of Nations]] at the end of the year. The competition involves teams of three riders representing their nations. There are three motos with two riders of each nation competing per moto. The location of the event changes from year to year.\n\nChampionship Mud Racing/CMR saw its infancy in 2006 as leaders of the ATV industry recognized a need for uniformity of classes and rules of various local mud bog events. Providing standardized rules created the need for a governing body that both racers and event promoters could turn to and CMR was born. Once unified, a true points series was established and lead to a national championship for what was once nothing more than a hobby for most. In 2007 the finalized board of directors was established and the first races were held in 2008. Currently, the CMR schedule includes eight competition dates spanning from March to November. Points are awarded throughout the season in several different competition classes of ATV and SxS Mud Racing. The 2008 year included Mud Bog and Mudda-Cross competitions, but the 2009 and future seasons will only have Mudda-Cross competitions. Classes range from 0\u2013499&nbsp;cc to a Super-Modified class which will allow any size ATV in competition. The ultimate goal of The CMR is \"to see the growth of ATV Mud Racing as a competitive sport and give competitors a pedestal upon which they can receive the recognition from national media and industry sponsors that they have long deserved.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |title=CMR \u2013 About \u2013 Championship Mud Racing |access-date=24 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306181505/http://www.championship-mudracing.com/about.html |archive-date=6 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the [[FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship]] started with a Quad Championship and the [[Dakar Rally]] added the Quad category in 2008. Because the [[2008 Dakar Rally]] was cancelled, the [[2009 Dakar Rally]] was the first [[Dakar Rally]] with Quads.\n\nAmateur and professional three-wheeler racing across the United States has also spiked in popularity once again, at levels not seen since the factory teams raced in the 1980s. Part of the appeal is the cheapness of parts, and how easy it is to get into. Races are held at various local and large venues, particularly in Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan and California. Payouts are sometimes awarded to winners.\n\nEach year in June, the world's biggest three-wheeler gathering is held at Haspin Acres, in [[Laurel, Indiana]], for the Trikefest event. Over the course of 3 days complete with camping, hundreds of people gather for the event which features competitive racing such as MX style racing, drag racing, mud racing, hill climbs and other events. For those who wish not to compete, there are also many trails a person can ride. as many as 100 or more three-wheelers show up each year, some built and restored to be raffled off, others brought to ride.\n\nThe fastest speed recorded on a quad cycle, or ATV given a flying start, is 315.74&nbsp;km/h (196.19&nbsp;mph), by Terry Wilmeth (USA), at the Madras, Airport in Madras, Oregon, USA, on 15 June 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=The Jim Pattison Group|year=2013|isbn=978-1-908843-15-9|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101 101]|quote=|via=|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec0000unse_r3e7/page/101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amphibious ATV]]\n* [[Car]]\n* [[Dune buggy]]\n* [[John Deere]]\n* [[Motorcycle]]\n* [[Motorized tricycle]]\n* [[Non-road engine]]\n* [[Off-road vehicle]]\n* [[Side-by-side (vehicle)|Side-by-side vehicle]]\n* [[Tomcar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|All-terrain vehicles}}\n<!-- ATTENTION!
