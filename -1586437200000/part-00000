Additional to this, the premaxilla features lateral and medial [[foramina]] that are connected by a complex system of [[Blood vessel|vascular canals]], which pervades the structure of the premaxilla and is probably associated with the sensory branches of the neurovasculature and [[ophthalmic nerve]] supporting the [[Beak#Rhamphotheca|rhamphotheca]] (beak). The [[maxilla]] is triangular in shape and preserves 24 [[Dental alveolus|alveoli]], the [[teeth]] are [[homodont]] with coarse [[Denticle (tooth feature)|serrations]]. The [[dentary]] is wedge-shaped elongated and preserves 31 alveoli. In dorsal view, it is U-shaped and dorsoventrally flattened with a transverse expansion. The lateral and ventral surfaces in the symphyseal region bears a series of foramina that measure {{convert|2|to|5|mm|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, Isolated foramina are connected internally by a complex neurovascular canal.<ref name=Stephan2014>{{cite journal|last1=Stephan|first1=L.|last2=Lawrence|first2=M.

The cervicals are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Centrum_Morphology.svg platycoelous] with low [[Vertebra#Structure|neural arches]].<ref name=Barsbold1980/> Being relatively robust, they have thick [[Articular processes|prezygapophyses]] and large parapophyses. Additional, the cervicals show some resemblance to those of ''Segnosaurus'', however, being much smaller.<ref name=PerleA1981/>\n\n====Hindlimb====\n\nThe preserved right [[Pes (anatomy)|pes]] is virtually complete, only missing the proximal end of the [[metatarsals]] II, III and IV. It is shortened in length, with robust metatarsals that bear widened articular extremities, and form a non-compact metatarsus. The metatarsal I is the shortest in comparison, expanding the laterally extended proximal [[articular surface]] of the metatarsus. All of the remaining metatarsals, are somewhat equal in size. Pedal [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] are very peculiar in structure; the first digit is reduced in length, with all the remaining digits being nearly equal in length, however the fourth digit is very thin compared to the others. The [[phalanges]] of the three first digits are shortened, robust with comparable structure. The second and third phalanx of fourth digit are discoidal and stocky. Lastly, the [[unguals]] are recurved, exceptionally large, and strongly compressed laterally.<ref name=Barsbold1980/> Gregory S. Paul surmised that the long, slender [[claws]] of the feet were used for self-defence mechanism.<ref name=Paul2010/>\n\n====Forelimb====\nThe left [[humerus]] is the only preserved remain from the pectoral region. The humerus shows an elongated [[epiphyses]] and a relatively large [[Deltoid tuberosity|deltoideal]] process.<ref name=Barsbold1980/> As pointed by Perle 1981, it is robust with an estimated maximal length of {{convert|30|cm|mm|abbr=on}}. It has a reduced shaft. The proximal end of the humeurs is greatly broad. The [[humeral head]] features an [[Joint|articular]] surface that is convex and broad, in the middle it is reduced toward the margins. A prominent [[Deltopectoral groove|deltopectoral]] crest is present with the top located 1/3 at the length of the humerus from the proximal end. The articulation [[condyles]] for the [[Radius (bone|radius]] and [[ulna]] are differentiated and divided by a shortened, furrow-like [[Fossa (anatomy)|fossa]] and overall, they are very reduced in size. The fossa for the ulnar process is moderately deep and wide. The internal roughness of the head is prominent,<ref name=PerleA1981/> as in the unrelated [[Dromaeosauridae]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ostrom|first1=J.

Analysis of the brain cavity revealed that ''Erlikosaurus'', and quite likely most other therizinosaurids, had well developed senses of smell, hearing, and balance, traits better associated with [[carnivorous]] [[theropods]]. The enlarged forebrain of ''Erlikosaurus'' may also have been useful in complex [[social behavior]] and [[Ethology#Benefits and costs of group living|predator evasion]].<ref name=Lautenschlager2012/>\n[[File:Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus lower jaw.png|thumb|left|200px|Lower jaw of ''Erlikosaurus'' (bottom) and ''Segnosaurus'' (top) compared]]\nThe well preserved jaws of ''Erlikosaurus'' also allowed a study by the University of Bristol to determine how its feeding style and dietary preferences were linked to how wide it could open its mouth. In the study, performed by Stephen Lautenshlager et al., It was revealed that ''Erlikosaurus'' could open its mouth to a 43 degree angle at maximum. Also included in the study for comparison were the carnivorous theropods ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. From the comparisons, it was indicated that carnivorous dinosaurs had wider jaw gapes than herbivores, much as modern carnivorous animals do today.<ref name=Lautenschlager2015>{{cite journal|first1=L.|last1=Stephan|title=Estimating cranial musculoskeletal constraints in theropod dinosaurs|year=2015|journal=Royal Society Open Science|volume=2|issue=11|doi=10.1098/rsos.150495|pmid=26716007|pmc=4680622|pages=150495|bibcode=2015RSOS....250495L}}</ref>\n\nMore findings about its exceptional skull have been made. Based on comparisons between the highly specialized mandible of ''[[Segnosaurus]]'' and the simple one from ''Erlikosaurus'', these taxa were separated by [[niche partitioning]]. For instance, the mandible of ''Segnosaurus'' features very complex specializations, such as a gracile, recurved dentary, and a thickened lateral shelf. The dentition bears a triple carinae on the lower teeth, lingually folded mesial carinae appressed against triangular denticulate facets on the distal carinae, and extracarinal accessory [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]].

A fine, vertical lamina of [[bone]] is connected rostrally to the medial margin of the premaxilla, indicating that when the animal was alive, a [[cartilaginous]] [[Nasal septum|internasal septum]] was present. Additional to this, the premaxilla features lateral and medial [[foramina]] that are connected by a complex system of [[Blood vessel|vascular canals]], which pervades the structure of the premaxilla and is probably associated with the sensory branches of the neurovasculature and [[ophthalmic nerve]] supporting the [[Beak#Rhamphotheca|rhamphotheca]] (beak). The [[maxilla]] is triangular in shape and preserves 24 [[Dental alveolus|alveoli]], the [[teeth]] are [[homodont]] with coarse [[Denticle (tooth feature)|serrations]]. The [[dentary]] is wedge-shaped elongated and preserves 31 alveoli. In dorsal view, it is U-shaped and dorsoventrally flattened with a transverse expansion. The lateral and ventral surfaces in the symphyseal region bears a series of foramina that measure {{convert|2|to|5|mm|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, Isolated foramina are connected internally by a complex neurovascular canal.<ref name=Stephan2014>{{cite journal|last1=Stephan|first1=L.|last2=Lawrence|first2=M.

The particular cervicals were not figured and counted, but briefly described. The cervicals are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Centrum_Morphology.svg platycoelous] with low [[Vertebra#Structure|neural arches]].<ref name=Barsbold1980/> Being relatively robust, they have thick [[Articular processes|prezygapophyses]] and large parapophyses.

It is shortened in length, with robust metatarsals that bear widened articular extremities, and form a non-compact metatarsus. The metatarsal I is the shortest in comparison, expanding the laterally extended proximal [[articular surface]] of the metatarsus. All of the remaining metatarsals, are somewhat equal in size. Pedal [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] are very peculiar in structure; the first digit is reduced in length, with all the remaining digits being nearly equal in length, however the fourth digit is very thin compared to the others. The [[phalanges]] of the three first digits are shortened, robust with comparable structure. The second and third phalanx of fourth digit are discoidal and stocky. Lastly, the [[unguals]] are recurved, exceptionally large, and strongly compressed laterally.<ref name=Barsbold1980/> Gregory S. Paul surmised that the long, slender [[claws]] of the feet were used for self-defence mechanism.<ref name=Paul2010/>\n\n====Forelimb====\nThe left [[humerus]] is the only preserved remain from the pectoral region. The humerus shows an elongated [[epiphyses]] and a relatively large [[Deltoid tuberosity|deltoideal]] process.<ref name=Barsbold1980/> As pointed by Perle 1981, it is robust with an estimated maximal length of {{convert|30|cm|mm|abbr=on}}. It has a reduced shaft. The proximal end of the humeurs is greatly broad. The [[humeral head]] features an [[Joint|articular]] surface that is convex and broad, in the middle it is reduced toward the margins. A prominent [[Deltopectoral groove|deltopectoral]] crest is present with the top located 1/3 at the length of the humerus from the proximal end. The articulation [[condyles]] for the [[Radius (bone|radius]] and [[ulna]] are differentiated and divided by a shortened, furrow-like [[Fossa (anatomy)|fossa]] and overall, they are very reduced in size. The fossa for the ulnar process is moderately deep and wide.

Analysis of the brain cavity revealed that ''Erlikosaurus'', and quite likely most other therizinosaurids, had well developed senses of smell, hearing, and balance, traits better associated with [[carnivorous]] [[theropods]]. The enlarged forebrain of ''Erlikosaurus'' may also have been useful in complex [[social behavior]] and [[Ethology#Benefits and costs of group living|predator evasion]].<ref name=Lautenschlager2012/>\n[[File:Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus lower jaw.png|thumb|left|200px|Lower jaw of ''Erlikosaurus'' (bottom) and ''Segnosaurus'' (top) compared]]\nThe well preserved jaws of ''Erlikosaurus'' also allowed a study by the University of Bristol to determine how its feeding style and dietary preferences were linked to how wide it could open its mouth. In the study, performed by Stephen Lautenshlager et al., It was revealed that ''Erlikosaurus'' could open its mouth to a 43 degree angle at maximum. Also included in the study for comparison were the carnivorous theropods ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. From the comparisons, it was indicated that carnivorous dinosaurs had wider jaw gapes than herbivores, much as modern carnivorous animals do today.<ref name=Lautenschlager2015>{{cite journal|first1=L.|last1=Stephan|title=Estimating cranial musculoskeletal constraints in theropod dinosaurs|year=2015|journal=Royal Society Open Science|volume=2|issue=11|doi=10.1098/rsos.150495|pmid=26716007|pmc=4680622|pages=150495|bibcode=2015RSOS....250495L}}</ref>\n\nMore findings about its exceptional skull have been made. Based on comparisons between the highly specialized mandible of ''[[Segnosaurus]]'' and the simple one from ''Erlikosaurus'', these taxa were separated by [[niche partitioning]]. For instance, the mandible of ''Segnosaurus'' features very complex specializations, such as a gracile, recurved dentary, and a thickened lateral shelf. The dentition bears a triple carinae on the lower teeth, lingually folded mesial carinae appressed against triangular denticulate facets on the distal carinae, and extracarinal accessory [[Denticle (tooth feature)|denticles]]. In contrast, the dentition of ''Erlikosaurus'' seems to be more \"standar\", with a more simplistic morphology compared to the latter and other relatives.<ref name=Zanno2016>{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

Therefore, it is not always enough to simply preserve that data itself, organizations must also preserve all of the hardware that the data format requires.  \n\nThis is a challenge on many different levels because machines are subject to mechanical failure and need repair on a semi-frequent basis.  Many machines require frequent maintenance like cleaning and [[degaussing]] in order to remain functional.<ref name=\":2\" />  Occasionally, especially in more recent devices, certain parts may need to be replaced regularly in order to function optimally, even if the part in question is still intact.  In addition to maintaining machines like [[Phonograph|phonographs]] and [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]], organizations must maintain stocks of replacement parts for their machines.  Unfortunately, once a particular technology becomes obsolete companies generally stop making machines and replacement parts, turning instead to making equipment to support whatever new technology is now dominant.<ref name=\":2\" />  In doing this, many machines that were once commonplace become rare as there are only limited supplies of replacement machines or parts, with no new replacements forthcoming.  This has actually become more of a challenge as the technology in question has become more sophisticated; while it is possible for a skilled technician to create a phonograph which works at least as well as one from 1905, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to maintain a tape recorder or digital video recorder without prefabricated parts from the original manufacturing company.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIronically, paper documents such as books are almost entirely immune to these problems.  Non-acidic paper and inks are extremely [[Chemical stability|chemically stable]] and can last for centuries if not millennia when kept in a controlled environment.

A prime example of this problem is the [[BBC Domesday Project]] from the 1980s, although its data was eventually recovered with significant effort. \n\n==Obsolescence in software==\nMany versions of word-processing programs, data-storage media, and formats for encoding images and films were in the past considered industry standards but have since been replaced by new software versions or even by completely new hardware. Files meant to be read or edited with a certain program (for example [[Microsoft Word]]) might be unreadable in other programs, and as operating systems and hardware move on, even old versions of programs developed by the same company become impossible to use on the new platform (for instance, older versions of [[Microsoft Works]], before Works 4.5, cannot be run under [[Windows 2000]] or later).  Some industry experts actually consider obsolescence to be a security feature in some contexts, arguing that outdated software is more difficult to hack, but this idea has not been widely accepted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/security-through-obsolescence|title=Security through obsolescence|last=Miller|first=Robin}}</ref>  Many entities now consider formatting obsolescence to be a key concern.
