He was elected as a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]], where he served for 35 years.\n\n==Early years==\nThe son of [[Italy|Italian]] immigrant Piedro (Peter) Lazzarini and his wife Hannah (Annie) Stubbs, Lazzarini was born at [[Wombat, New South Wales|Wombat]], near [[Young, New South Wales|Young]], [[New South Wales]]. He was educated at the Young convent school and Young Superior Public School, before becoming a tailor's apprentice.<ref name=nsw>{{Cite NSW Parliament |name=Mr Carlo Camillo Lazzarini |former=Yes |access-date=30 April 2019 |id=1342}}</ref><ref name=\"ADB\">{{cite web|last1=Nairn|first1=Bede|title=Lazzarini, Carlo Camillo (1880\u20131952)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lazzarini-carlo-camillo-7129/text12301|website=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=14 April 2018|date=1986}}</ref>\n\nLazzarini became active in the union movement and the Labor Party, joining the Young Labor League in 1899. He became secretary and president of the league and was campaign secretary for [[Chris Watson]] in the [[1898 New South Wales colonial election|1898 New South Wales election]] and the [[1901 Australian federal election|first federal election]] in 1901. He was also strongly involved in the predominantly [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] community, acting as district secretary of the [[Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society]] and attending the founding meeting of the Irish National Association.\n\nAfter moving to [[Sydney]], Lazzarini was secretary and president of the [[Federated Clothing Trades' Union]] from 1912\u201317. A member of the moderates faction, he was strongly against [[conscription]] in the [[First World War]], and in 1916 became a founding member of the Industrial Vigilance Committee, which was responsible later that year for the expulsion from the Labor Party of conscription advocates such as prime minister [[Billy Hughes]] and premier [[William Holman]]. On this committee until 1919, he was also a member of the party central executive in 1916 and 1917, and was vice-president of the No Imperial Federation League in 1917.\n\n==New South Wales Parliament==\nAt the [[1917 New South Wales state election|1917 state election]], Lazzarini was elected as member for [[Electoral district of Marrickville|Marrickville]], defeating [[Thomas Simpson Crawford|Thomas Crawford]], who had left the Labor Party. He was the first member of the [[Parliament of New South Wales|New South Wales parliament]] with an Italian name, and two years later his brother [[Bert Lazzarini]] became the first member of the [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] with an Italian name when he won the seat of [[Division of Werriwa|Werriwa]]. In the same year, on 26 April 1919, Carlo married Myra Hurley at St Brigid's church in [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]]. They would have one son.\n\nIn 1920, the Legislative Assembly was elected from multi-member districts, and Lazzarini was elected as one of the members for [[electoral district of Western Suburbs|Western Suburbs]]. He was Labor Party whip in 1920\u201321, and minister for state industrial enterprises in 1921\u201322. From 1922 until 1925 he was a member of the Catholic-reformist group and opposed union extremists in favour of majority parliamentary opinion. In 1923, he also served as vice president of the Australian Industrial Christian Fellowship Council.\n\nAppointed to [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]'s first [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] as chief secretary in 1925, Lazzarini was one of the Labor parliamentarians who clashed with Lang over proposed regulations in 1926. He was subsequently dropped from the cabinet in May 1927, after also serving two months as acting secretary for mines. The Lang government lost power at the [[1927 New South Wales state election|1927 election]], however Lazzarini was re-elected by the reinstated seat of Marrickville. Labor regained government in 1930, only to lose it after controversies of 1932, culminating in the [[governor of New South Wales|governor]] withdrawing Lang's commission. Lazzarini maintained his opposition to Lang and his dictatorial style, one of the few in the New South Wales [[caucus]] to openly do so. As a result, he and others were expelled from the party in August 1936, only to be readmitted to the federal unity conference in 1937.\n\nLazzarini joined the [[Industrial Labor Party]] in 1938, and continued to apply pressure to Lang, who was finally ousted in August 1939. Lazzarini served as an assistant minister in the next Labor government from 1941 until 1944. He was still member for Marrickville, in his 13th term as a member of parliament, when he died of heart disease in [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]] in 1952.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Carlo Lazzarini}}\n{{reflist}}\n&nbsp;\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|au-nsw-la}}\n{{s-bef|before= [[Thomas Simpson Crawford|Thomas Crawford]] }}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Electoral district of Marrickville|Member for Marrickville]]|years=1917{{spaced ndash}}1920}}\n{{s-non|reason= District abolished }}\n{{s-new|district}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Electoral district of Western Suburbs|Member for Western Suburbs]]|years=1920{{spaced ndash}}1927|alongside=[[Tom Hoskins|Hoskins]], [[Edward McTiernan|McTiernan]], [[Sydney Shillington|Shillington]]/[[John Ness|Ness]], [[James Wilson (New South Wales politician, born 1865)|Wilson]]/[[Milton Jarvie|Jarvie]]}}\n{{s-non|reason= District abolished }}\n{{s-new|district}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Electoral district of Marrickville|Member for Marrickville]]|years=1927{{spaced ndash}}1952}}\n{{s-aft|after= [[Norm Ryan]] }}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-new}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Minister for Trade and Industry (New South Wales)|Minister for State Industrial Enterprises]]|years=1921}}\n{{s-non|reason= Post abolished }}\n{{s-new}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Minister for Trade and Industry (New South Wales)|Minister for State Industrial Enterprises]]|years=1921{{spaced ndash}}1922}}\n{{s-aft|after= [[Thomas Henley (Australian politician)|Thomas Henley]]|as=Minister for Railways<br/>and State Industrial Enterprises }}\n{{s-bef|before= [[Charles Oakes]] }}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Chief Secretary of New South Wales|Colonial Secretary of New South Wales]]|years=1925{{spaced ndash}}1927}}\n{{s-aft|after= [[Mark Gosling]] }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lazzarini, Carlo}}\n[[Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:1880 births]]\n[[Category:1952 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Young, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Australian politicians of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:20th-century Australian politicians]]\n[[Category:Australian trade unionists]]\n[[Category:Burials at Rookwood Cemetery]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=October 2014}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n|honorific-prefix = \n|name        = Carlo Lazzarini\n|honorific-suffix = \n|image       = Carlo Lazzarini MP.jpg\n|caption     = \n|office2             = [[Chief Secretary of New South Wales|Colonial Secretary of New South Wales]]\n|term_start2         = 17 June 1925\n|term_end2           = 26 May 1927\n|premier2            = [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]]\n|predecessor2        = [[Charles Oakes]]\n|successor2          = [[Mark Gosling]]\n|birth_date         = {{birth date|1880|04|24|df=y}}\n|birth_place        = [[Wombat, New South Wales|Wombat]], [[Colony of New South Wales]]\n|death_date         = {{death date and age|1952|11|26|1880|04|24|df=y}}\n|death_place        = [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]\n|restingplace       = [[Rookwood Cemetery]]\n|restingplacecoordinates = \n|party              = \n|spouse             = Myra Hurley (1919-1952)\n|relations          = [[Bert Lazzarini]] (brother)\n}}\n'''Carlo Camillo Lazzarini''' (24 April 1880 \u2013 26 November 1952), also known as '''Charlie Lazzarini''', was an [[Australia]]n politician affiliated with the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]].

[[Moses Ugbusien]] took the baton rather casually, the slow start giving [[Darren Clark]] the chance to pass during the curve, putting Australia into the lead at the break.  Taking an efficient tangent from lane 8, [[Ray Armstead]] gained ground on Ugbusien, moving to his shoulder to try to make a pass for the Americans on the stretch, 4 meters behind Clark who was running a 43.86 split, which exactly equalled [[Lee Evans (sprinter)|Lee Evans]]' world record at the time. Ugbusien didn't relent and the two teams passed virtually even. On the handoff, [[Alonzo Babers]] got the edge, trying to keep up with [[Rotimi Peters]]. The long striding Babers took off in pursuit of [[Gary Minihan]], with the three teams well ahead of the next pursuing team from Great Britain. Coming off the final turn, Babers smoothly went past Minihan and pulled away to a 7 meter lead by the handoff to [[Antonio McKay]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/ATH/mens-4-x-400-metres-relay.html</ref> Behind the action at the front, [[Todd Bennett]] steadily chipped away what was more than a 10 meter deficit to put Britain but a step behind Nigeria at the final handoff.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/10186628/Todd-Bennett-Olympic-400m-silver-medallist-in-1984-dies-aged-51.html</ref> McKay kept the American lead for the victory. There a was a battle for the other medals, with [[Rick Mitchell]] holding the Australian advantage of about two meters over [[Innocent Egbunike]] for Nigeria, with [[Phil Brown (athlete)|Phil Brown]] another step back for Britain. With Egbunike training at an American university [[Azusa Pacific University|Azusa Pacific]], he was quite familiar to the spectators. Down the backstretch, Egbunike gained on Mitchell, moving on to his outside shoulder to pounce coming off the final turn. Behind Egbunike, Brown was staying in close contact still on the inside. Then, as Egbunike attacked, Brown went to the outside making it three abreast with 70 meters to go. Mitchell couldn't keep up, but Egbunike and Brown ran stride for stride for 50 meters. In the final 20 meters, Brown gained a slight advantage and crossed the line ahead for the silver medal.

[[Moses Ugbusien]] took the baton rather casually, the slow start giving [[Darren Clark]] the chance to pass during the curve, putting Australia into the lead at the break.  Taking an efficient tangent from lane 8, [[Ray Armstead]] gained ground on Ugbusien, moving to his shoulder to try to make a pass for the home team Americans  on the home stretch, 4 meters behind Clark who was running a 43.86 split, which exactly equalled [[Lee Evans (sprinter)|Lee Evans]]' world record at the time.  Ugbusien didn't relent and the two teams passed virtually even.  On the handoff, 400 meter champion [[Alonzo Babers]] got the edge, gaining two steps then cutting in to close the door on [[Rotimi Peters]].  The long striding Babers took off in pursuit of [[Gary Minihan]], with the three teams well ahead of the next pursuing team from Great Britain.  Coming off the final turn, Babers smoothly went past Minihan and pulled away to a 7 meter lead by the handoff to [[Antonio McKay]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1984/ATH/mens-4-x-400-metres-relay.html</ref>  Behind the action at the front, [[Todd Bennett]] steadily chipped away what was more than a 10 meter deficit to put Britain but a step behind Nigeria at the final handoff.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/10186628/Todd-Bennett-Olympic-400m-silver-medallist-in-1984-dies-aged-51.html</ref>  With no challenge in sight, McKay padded the American lead for an uncontested victory.  The battle was for the other medals, with [[Rick Mitchell]] holding the Australian advantage of about two meters over [[Innocent Egbunike]] for Nigeria, with [[Phil Brown (athlete)|Phil Brown]] another step back for Britain.  With Egbunike training at [[Azusa Pacific University]], he was more of a home town athlete than any of the American team members.  Down the backstretch, Egbunike gained on Mitchell, moving on to his outside shoulder to pounce coming off the final turn.  Behind Egbunike, Brown was staying in close contact still on the inside.  Then as Egbunike attacked, Brown went to the outside making it three abreast with 70 meters to go.  Mitchell couldn't keep up, but Egbunike and Brown ran stride for stride for 50 meters.  In the final 20 meters, Brown gained a slight advantage and crossed the line ahead for the silver medal.

Early Life Infection and Neuroimmunity ====\nShortly after becoming a professor at Duke, Bilbo used the neonatal bacterial infection model she developed in her postdoctoral work to explore how neonatal infection affects glial cell biology and immune functions later in life, specifically after a second environmental challenge.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Bland|first=Sondra

cytokine release after a drug challenge later in life compared to controls who were not neonatally infected.<ref name=\":12\" /> Following findings from her postdoctoral work highlighting [[Interleukin 1 beta|IL-1B]] dysregulation after neonatal infection, Bilbo explored a mechanistic understanding of immune dysregulation after early-life infection. She further wanted to explore how this dysfunction is unmasked after a second immune challenge later in life.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Lauren L.|last2=Sholar|first2=Paige

In the Fall of 1967, IBM (through [[Science Research Associates]]) approached [[Evanston Township High School]] with the offer of four [[IBM 2741|2741 Selectric teletypewriter]] based terminals with dial-up modem connectivity to an experimental computer system which implemented an early version of the APL programming language.  The APL network system was structured in Workspaces which were assigned to various clients using the system. Working independently, the students quickly learned the language and the system. They were free to explore the system, often using existing code available in public Workspaces as models for their own creations. Eventually, curiosity drove the students to explore the system's wider context. This first informal network penetration effort was later acknowledged as helping harden the security of one of the first publicly accessible networks:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Falkoff|first=A.

They modeled their system after [[APL\\360|APL/360]], which had by that time been developed and seen substantial use inside of IBM, using code borrowed from MAT/1500 where possible.

In the Fall of 1967, IBM (through [[Science Research Associates]]) approached [[Evanston Township High School]] with the offer of four [[IBM 2741|2741 Selectric teletypewriter]] based terminals with dial-up modem connectivity to an experimental computer system which implemented an early version of the APL programming language.  The APL network system was structured in Workspaces which were assigned to various clients using the system. Working independently, the students quickly learned the language and the system. They were free to explore the system, often using existing code available in public Workspaces as models for their own creations. Eventually, curiosity drove the students to explore the system's wider context. This first informal network penetration effort was later acknowledged as helping harden the security of one of the first publicly accessible networks:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Falkoff|first=A.

They modeled their system after [[APL\\360|APL/360]], which had by that time been developed and seen substantial use inside of IBM, using code borrowed from MAT/1500 where possible. In their documentation they acknowledge their gratitude to \"a number of high school students for their compulsion to bomb the system\".

Its initial focus was on [[protein folding]] but has shifted to more biomedical problems, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], cancer, Coronavirus disease 2019, and Ebola virus disease. The project uses the idle CPU time of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. The project was started in October 2000 by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of Prof. Vijay S. Pande, who led the project until 2019.<ref name=\"About FAH\"/>{{Verify source|reason=The source doesn't even mention 'cancer', 'Ebola', 'COVID-19', 'idle' resources, or 'Vijay Pande'|date=April 2020}} Folding@home is currently led by Dr. Greg Bowman of Washington University School of Medicine, a former student of Dr. Pande.<ref name=\"FAH leadership change\"/>\n\nThe project has pioneered the utilization of [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs), [[PlayStation&nbsp;3]]s, [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s), and some [[Sony Xperia]] smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computing methods.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/> As part of the [[client\u2013server model]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.\n\nFolding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the system achieved a speed of approximately 1.18 [[FLOPS|exaFLOPS]], or 2.36 x86 exaFLOPS, by April 8, 2020,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://archive.is/fISnM | title = Client Statistics by OS | author = Pande lab | publisher = Archive.is | accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref> making it the world's first [[Exascale computing|exaFLOP computing system]]. This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;2000, the Pande Lab has produced 223 [[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.<ref name=\"papers-march-2020\">{{cite web |title=Papers & Results |url=https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/ |website=Folding@home.org |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1003962107\"/><ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Protein folding}}\n[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]\n\n[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzyme]]s, performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of [[computational biology]].<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.309.5731.78b\"/> Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]], that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/>\n\nDue to the complexity of proteins' conformation or [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447\"/> before 2010, simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/> General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.<ref name=\"978-1-58603-796-3\"/><ref name=\"10.1002/bip.10219\"/> Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1137/06065146X\"/>\n\n[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|thumb|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]\nProtein folding does not occur in one step.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001\"/> ''waiting'' in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.<ref name=\"Simulation FAQ\"/> The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct900620b\"/>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude.<ref name=\"typepad: how far FAH has come\"/> In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million [[CPU]] days of simulations over the span of several months,<ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/> and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10&nbsp;million CPU hours of computing.<ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1010880108\"/> In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-[[amino acid|residue]] NTL9 protein out to 1.52&nbsp;milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than formerly achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein's energy landscape.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.3390/ijms11125292\"/> In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the [[Thomas Kuhn#Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award|Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] for the development of the [[open-source software|open-source]] MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name=\"2010 KPS award\"/><ref name=\"MSMBuilder source\"/> For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Award for Young Investigators for \"developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and [[RNA]] folding\",<ref name=\"Biophysical society names recipients\"/> and the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which \"have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Dr. Pande's efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology.\"<ref name=\"FAH Awards\"/>\n\n== Examples of application in biomedical research ==\nProtein misfolding can result in a [[proteopathy|variety of diseases]] including Alzheimer's disease, [[cancer]], [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], Huntington's disease, [[sickle-cell anemia]], and [[type&nbsp;II diabetes]].<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/><ref name=\"Protein Misfolding Diseases\"/><ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> Cellular infection by viruses such as [[HIV]] and [[influenza]] also involve folding events on [[cell membrane]]s.<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\"/> Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells' natural ability to regulate protein folding.  Such [[therapies]] include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1038/nature02265\"/> The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the [[drug design|rational design of therapeutics]],<ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/> such as expediting and lowering the costs of [[drug discovery]].<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/>\n\nThe simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/> but researchers can use them to study how folding ''[[in vitro]]'' differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011, Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.<ref name=\"forum: 7808/7809 to FAH\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.0608256104\"/> Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of [[Protein&nbsp;L]], and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja908369h\"/>\n\nThe large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"typepad: Simbios\"/><ref name=\"papers for free\"/> The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer,<ref name=\"10.1038/sj.embor.7400108\"/> and they share Folding@home's key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas.<ref name=\"typepad: Simbios\"/> In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home's MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large [[computer cluster]]s or [[supercomputer]]s.<ref name=\"Pronk et al, 2011\"/><ref name=\"Copernicus download\"/> Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.<ref name=\"papers\"/>\n\n=== Alzheimer's disease ===\n{{Multiple image|footer= Alzheimer's disease is linked to the aggregation of amyloid beta protein fragments in the brain (right). Researchers have used Folding@home to simulate this aggregation process, to better understand the cause of the disease.|image1= Amyloid 01big1.jpg|image2= Amyloid 02big1.jpg|image3= Amyloid 03big1.jpg}}\n\n[[Alzheimer's disease]] is an incurable [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of [[dementia]]. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (A\u03b2) [[peptide]], caused by A\u03b2 misfolding and clumping together with other A\u03b2 peptides. These A\u03b2 aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=\"10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine\"/><ref name=\"10.1001/archneurol.2007.56\"/><ref name=\"10.1074/jbc.R800036200\"/> Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of A\u03b2 aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.<ref name=\"10.1063/1.3010881\"/><ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pone.0021776\"/>\n\nPreventing A\u03b2 aggregation is a promising method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a [[literature review]] article.<ref name=\"10.1007/s12013-011-9200-x\"/> In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of A\u03b2 aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate A\u03b2 folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible.

Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current ''[[in silico]]'' methods usually must trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g., use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally costly [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: drug design methods\"/><ref name=\"10.1063/1.2221680\"/> Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom]] (\u00c5) [[root mean square deviation]] (RMSD) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]].

Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]]. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, [[interleukin-2]], and [[RNase H]].<ref name=\"typepad: drug targets\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1209309109\"/>\n\nApproximately half of all known [[antibiotic]]s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's [[ribosome]], a large and complex biochemical machine that performs [[protein biosynthesis]] by [[translation (biology)|translating]] [[messenger RNA]] into proteins.

The conformational change from the normal prion protein (PrPc, stands for cellular) to the disease causing [[isoform]] PrPSc (stands for prototypical prion disease\u2013[[scrapie]]) causes a host of diseases collectly known as [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]] (TSEs), including [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) in bovine, [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CJD) and [[fatal insomnia]] in human, [[chronic wasting disease]] (CWD) in the deer family.

However it was eclipsed by [[K computer]] in November 2011 and [[Blue Gene/Q]] in June 2012.]]\n\nSupercomputer FLOPS performance is assessed by running the legacy [[LINPACK]] benchmark. This short-term testing has difficulty in accurately reflecting sustained performance on real-world tasks because LINPACK more efficiently maps to supercomputer hardware. Computing systems vary in architecture and design, so direct comparison is difficult. Despite this, FLOPS remain the primary speed metric used in supercomputing.<ref name=\"forum: GPU flop conversion 2\"/><ref name=\"supercomputer only technically the fastest\"/> In contrast, Folding@home determines its FLOPS using [[wall-clock time]] by measuring how much time its work units take to complete.<ref name=\"forum: vs PPD numbers\"/><ref name=\"forum: vs PPD numbers 2\"/><ref name=\"forum: GPU flops conversion\"/>\n\nOn September 16, 2007, due in large part to the participation of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native [[Petascale computing|petaFLOPS]], becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so.<ref name=\"typepad: crossing 1 PF\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008\"/> [[Top500]]'s fastest supercomputer at the time was [[BlueGene/L]], at 0.280 petaFLOPS.<ref name=\"Top500 June 2007\"/> The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS,<ref name=\"FAH reaches 2 PF\"/> followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 2008<ref name=\"Nvidia-FAH milestone\"/><ref name=\"3 PF barrier\"/> and September 28, 2008 respectively.<ref name=\"past 4 petaFLOPS\"/> On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS,<ref name=\"typepad: FAH passes 5 PF\"/><ref name=\"crossing 5 PF barrier\"/> and was the first computing project to meet these five levels.<ref name=\"Community Grid Computing\"/><ref name=\"review of FAH\"/> In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] at 1.105 petaFLOPS.<ref name=\"Top500 November 2008\"/> On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008\"/><ref name=\"6 petaFLOPS\"/> In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS.

A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team. In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an [[Internet forum]].<ref name=\"Extreme overclocking forum\"/> The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"MaximumPC Chimp Challenge\"/> Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/>\n\nIf a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a \"Default\" team. This \"Default\" team has a team number of \"0\". Statistics are accumulated for this \"Default\" team as well as for specially named teams.\n\n== Software ==\nFolding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.\n\n=== Work units ===\nA work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a [[Markov model]]. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&nbsp;3 450&nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nBefore public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.<ref name=\"typepad: more transparency\"/> Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.<ref name=\"forum: Gromacs cannot continue\"/><ref name=\"forum: 6803(4,66,255)\"/> The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.<ref name=\"forum: troubleshooting bad WUs\"/>\n\n=== Cores ===\n{{main|List of Folding@home cores}}\nSpecialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as \"FahCores\" and often abbreviated \"cores\", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly language]] code and hardware optimizations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.20703\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct700301q\"/> Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.<ref name=\"Gromacs FAQ\"/> Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.<ref name=\"Open Source FAQ\"/><ref name=\"FAQ index\"/><ref name=\"typepad: update on new FahCores\"/> Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"Petaflop FAQ\"/> The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/>\n\n=== Client ===\n\n[[File:Folding@home Fedora25.png|thumb|Folding@Home running on Fedora 25]]\n\nA Folding@home participant installs a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]]. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/> The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/><ref name=\"forum: can FAH damage PC?\"/> The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]] systems, and [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nProfessional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.<ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Folding@home's data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&nbsp;8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> While the client's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is open-source,<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/> the client is [[proprietary software]] citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.<ref name=\"FAH license\"/><ref name=\"forum: FAH EULA\"/><ref name=\"help ubuntu\"/>\n\nHowever, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as [[Patch (computing)|patching]]) of the executable [[binary file]]s. Likewise, [[binary-only software|binary-only]] distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] while being downloaded via the internet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries|title=The Case of the Modified Binaries|website=Leviathan Security}}</ref> or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. [[Patch (computing)|patched]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/clowes/bh-us-02-clowes-binaries.ppt|title=Fixing/Making Holes in ELF Binaries/Programs - Black Hat}}</ref> or by decompiling<ref>probably using tools such as [https://github.com/thorkill/eresi ERESI]</ref> and recompiling them after modification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/how-to-disassemble-modify-and-then-reassemble-a-linux-executable|title=x86 - How to disassemble, modify and then reassemble a Linux executable?|website=Stack Overflow}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable|title=linux - How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable?|website=Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange}}</ref> These modifications are possible unless the binary files&nbsp;\u2013 and the transport channel&nbsp;\u2013 are [[digital signature|signed]] and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Nipravsky-Certificate-Bypass-Hiding-And-Executing-Malware-From-A-Digitally-Signed-Executable-wp.pdf |title=Certificate Bypass: Hiding and Executing Malware from a Digitally Signed Executable |publisher=[[Deep Instinct]] |website=BlackHat.com |date=August 2016}}</ref> Either way, since in the case of Folding@home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed,<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.\n\nFolding@home uses the [[Cosm (software)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Folding@home was launched on October&nbsp;1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems.<ref name=\"10.1039/C1CP22100K\"/> Its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.<ref name=\"10.1126/science.290.5498.1903\"/><ref name=\"Executive summary\"/> In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P. Anderson]] to test a supplemental client on the open-source [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;<ref name=\"FAH for BOINC soon\"/> however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/>\n\n==== Graphics processing units ====\nThe specialized hardware of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.<ref name=\"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x\"/> Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/MCSE.2010.27\"/>\n\nBefore 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.<ref name=\"10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84\"/>\n\nThe first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&nbsp;2, 2006,<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> delivering a 20\u201330 times speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU news\"/><ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\"/> GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 open beta\"/> Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&nbsp;6.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 goes live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 going well\"/> Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&nbsp;25, 2010. While [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities,<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/> and used OpenMM on top of an [[OpenCL]] framework.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 open beta\"/> Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software application.<ref name=\"forum: 7.1.38 released\"/><ref name=\"forum: GPU3 headless guide\"/> GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in [[FLOPS]]. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.<ref name=\"FAH osstats2\"/>\n\nNative support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.<ref name=\"forum: core17 Linux\"/>\n\n==== PlayStation 3 ====\n{{further|Life with PlayStation}}\n[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3-D animation of the protein being folded]]\n\nFrom March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20 times speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Biotech 27\"/> The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/> This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/>\n\nThe PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&nbsp;23, 2007.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 to study cancer\"/> Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.<ref name=\"PS3 research project\"/> On September&nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.<ref name=\"Life With PS3 live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: life with PS\"/> In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> However, unlike clients running on [[personal computer]]s, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/> The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/> The PS3 also had the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/>\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Sony ended support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and seven months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a \"game changer\" for the project.<ref name=\"PS3 FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h\"/><ref name=\"LWP termination\"/>\n\n==== Multi-core processing client ====\nFolding@home can use the [[parallel computing]] abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/> A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069\"/>\n\nIn November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/> This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.<ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/><ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> On January&nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.<ref name=\"SMP2 release\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/>\n\nSMP2 supports a trial of a special category of ''bigadv'' work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> which was raised to sixteen later, on February&nbsp;7, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: update on bigadv-16\"/> Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[random-access memory]] (RAM) and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.<ref name=\"typepad: bigadv points change\"/> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== V7 ====\n[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&nbsp;7]]. In addition to a variety of controls and user details, V7 presents work unit information, such as its state, calculation progress, ETA, credit points, identification numbers, and description.]]\n\nThe V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] operating systems.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/> It was released on March&nbsp;22, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: v7 rollout\"/> Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low [[scheduling priority|priority]], allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients.<ref name=\"typepad: ATI core 16 released\"/> V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.<ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\nV7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], named FAHControl.<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/><ref name=\"Ticket #736\"/> This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a [[backend as a service|back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or ''slot''). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\n==== Google Chrome ====\nIn 2014, a client for the [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser. The client used [[Google]]'s [[Native Client]] (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@home code at near-native speed in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] on the user's machine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pande|first1=Vijay|title=Adding a completely new way to fold, directly in the browser|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/adding-a-completely-new-way-to-fold-directly-in-the-browser/|website=foldingathome.org|publisher=Pande Lab, Stanford University|access-date=13 February 2015|date=24 February 2014}}</ref> Due to the phasing out of NaCL and changes at Folding@home, the web client was permanently shut down in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=NaCL Web Client Shutdown Notice |url=http://nacl.foldingathome.org/ |website=Folding@Home |publisher=Folding@Home |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Android ====\nIn July 2015, a client for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile phones was released on [[Google Play]] for devices running [[Android 4.4 KitKat]] or newer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vijay |last=Pande |title=First full version of our Folding@Home client for Android Mobile phones |url=https://foldingathome.org/home/first-full-version-of-our-foldinghome-client-for-android-mobile-phones/ |work=Folding@Home |publisher=foldingathome.org |date=July 7, 2015 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Folding@Home |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.gridcomputing |work=[[Google Play]] |date=2016 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the 16th of February 2018 the Android client, which was offered in cooperation with [[Sony Mobile|Sony]], was removed from the Google Play.

In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.<ref name=\"typepad: comparison with Anton\"/> Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories,<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.<ref name=\"10.1145/1654059.1654099\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.1187409\"/> These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems.<ref name=\"10.1145/1364782.1364802\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245\"/> However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|\u00b5s]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> In June 2011 Folding@home added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's.<ref name=\"forum: 7610/7611 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7610\"/> However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology|Medicine}}\n* [[BOINC]]\n* [[Foldit]]\n* [[List of distributed computing projects]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Molecular modeling on GPUs]]\n* [[SETI@home]]\n* [[Storage@home]]\n* [[Molecule editor]]\n* [[World Community Grid]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n| colwidth= 30em\n| refs =\n\n<!-- *** Books *** -->\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\">{{cite book |last1= Collier |first1= Leslie |last2= Balows |first2= Albert |last3= Sussman |first3= Max |year= 1998 |chapter= |title= Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections |edition= ninth |volume= 1, ''Virology'' |editor1-last= Mahy |editor1-first= Brian |editor2-last= Collier |editor2-first= Leslie |publisher= Arnold |location= London |isbn= 978-0-340-66316-5 |pages= 75\u201391}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-387-73905-2\">{{cite book |title= Collagen: structure and mechanics |last= Fratzl |first= Peter |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-387-73905-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWFTqEtXXwC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date= March 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\">{{cite book |author1=Travis Desell |author2=Anthony Waters |author3=Malik Magdon-Ismail |author4=Boleslaw K.

protein dynamics. Its initial focus was on [[protein folding]] but has shifted to more biomedical problems, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], cancer, Coronavirus disease 2019, and Ebola virus disease. The project uses the idle CPU time of personal computers owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. The project was started in October 2000 by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of Prof. Vijay S. Pande, who led the project until 2019.<ref name=\"About FAH\"/>{{Verify source|reason=The source doesn't even mention 'cancer', 'Ebola', 'COVID-19', 'idle' resources, or 'Vijay Pande'|date=April 2020}} Folding@home is currently led by Dr. Greg Bowman of Washington University School of Medicine, a former student of Dr. Pande.<ref name=\"FAH leadership change\"/>\n\nThe project has pioneered the utilization of [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs), [[PlayStation&nbsp;3]]s, [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s), and some [[Sony Xperia]] smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computing methods.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/> As part of the [[client\u2013server model]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.\n\nFolding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the system achieved a speed of approximately 1.18 [[FLOPS|exaFLOPS]], or 2.36 x86 exaFLOPS, by April 8, 2020,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://archive.is/fISnM | title = Client Statistics by OS | author = Pande lab | publisher = Archive.is | accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref> making it the world's first [[Exascale computing|exaFLOP computing system]]. This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;2000, the Pande Lab has produced 223 [[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.<ref name=\"papers-march-2020\">{{cite web |title=Papers & Results |url=https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/ |website=Folding@home.org |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1003962107\"/><ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Protein folding}}\n[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]\n\n[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzyme]]s, performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of [[computational biology]].<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.309.5731.78b\"/> Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]], that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/>\n\nDue to the complexity of proteins' conformation or [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447\"/> before 2010, simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/> General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.<ref name=\"978-1-58603-796-3\"/><ref name=\"10.1002/bip.10219\"/> Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1137/06065146X\"/>\n\n[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|thumb|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]\nProtein folding does not occur in one step.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001\"/> ''waiting'' in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.<ref name=\"Simulation FAQ\"/> The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct900620b\"/>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude.<ref name=\"typepad: how far FAH has come\"/> In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million [[CPU]] days of simulations over the span of several months,<ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/> and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10&nbsp;million CPU hours of computing.<ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1010880108\"/> In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-[[amino acid|residue]] NTL9 protein out to 1.52&nbsp;milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than formerly achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein's energy landscape.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.3390/ijms11125292\"/> In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the [[Thomas Kuhn#Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award|Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] for the development of the [[open-source software|open-source]] MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name=\"2010 KPS award\"/><ref name=\"MSMBuilder source\"/> For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Award for Young Investigators for \"developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and [[RNA]] folding\",<ref name=\"Biophysical society names recipients\"/> and the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which \"have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Dr. Pande's efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology.\"<ref name=\"FAH Awards\"/>\n\n== Examples of application in biomedical research ==\nProtein misfolding can result in a [[proteopathy|variety of diseases]] including Alzheimer's disease, [[cancer]], [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], Huntington's disease, [[sickle-cell anemia]], and [[type&nbsp;II diabetes]].<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/><ref name=\"Protein Misfolding Diseases\"/><ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> Cellular infection by viruses such as [[HIV]] and [[influenza]] also involve folding events on [[cell membrane]]s.<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\"/> Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells' natural ability to regulate protein folding.  Such [[therapies]] include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1038/nature02265\"/> The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the [[drug design|rational design of therapeutics]],<ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/> such as expediting and lowering the costs of [[drug discovery]].<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/>\n\nThe simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/> but researchers can use them to study how folding ''[[in vitro]]'' differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011, Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.<ref name=\"forum: 7808/7809 to FAH\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.0608256104\"/> Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of [[Protein&nbsp;L]], and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja908369h\"/>\n\nThe large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"typepad: Simbios\"/><ref name=\"papers for free\"/> The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer,<ref name=\"10.1038/sj.embor.7400108\"/> and they share Folding@home's key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas.<ref name=\"typepad: Simbios\"/> In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home's MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large [[computer cluster]]s or [[supercomputer]]s.<ref name=\"Pronk et al, 2011\"/><ref name=\"Copernicus download\"/> Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.<ref name=\"papers\"/>\n\n=== Alzheimer's disease ===\n{{Multiple image|footer= Alzheimer's disease is linked to the aggregation of amyloid beta protein fragments in the brain (right). Researchers have used Folding@home to simulate this aggregation process, to better understand the cause of the disease.|image1= Amyloid 01big1.jpg|image2= Amyloid 02big1.jpg|image3= Amyloid 03big1.jpg}}\n\n[[Alzheimer's disease]] is an incurable [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of [[dementia]]. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (A\u03b2) [[peptide]], caused by A\u03b2 misfolding and clumping together with other A\u03b2 peptides. These A\u03b2 aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=\"10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine\"/><ref name=\"10.1001/archneurol.2007.56\"/><ref name=\"10.1074/jbc.R800036200\"/> Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of A\u03b2 aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.<ref name=\"10.1063/1.3010881\"/><ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pone.0021776\"/>\n\nPreventing A\u03b2 aggregation is a promising method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a [[literature review]] article.<ref name=\"10.1007/s12013-011-9200-x\"/> In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of A\u03b2 aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate A\u03b2 folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used the results of this study to identify a [[beta hairpin]] that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure.<ref name=\"10.1038/cr.2010.57\"/> The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.<ref name=\"10.1063/1.3010881\"/>\n\nIn December 2008, Folding@home found several small drug candidates which appear to inhibit the toxicity of A\u03b2 aggregates.<ref name=\"typepad: possible alz. drug\"/> In 2010, in close cooperation with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on [[biological tissue]].<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several [[mutation]]s of A\u03b2 that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] studies of A\u03b2 [[oligomer]]s.<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pone.0021776\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/jm201332p\"/> Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various A\u03b2 fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of A\u03b2.<ref name=\"forum: 6871\"/><ref name=\"description: 6571\"/>\n\n=== Huntington's disease ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] is a neurodegenerative [[genetic disorder]] that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. [[Polyglutamine tract|Excessive repeats]] of the [[glutamine]] amino acid at the [[N-terminus]] of the [[huntingtin protein]] cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease.<ref name=\"10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1\"/> As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.032\"/> Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with [[rational drug design]] methods to stop the aggregate formation.<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> The N17 fragment of the huntingtin protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown.<ref name=\"10.1038/nchembio.279\"/> Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease.<ref name=\"forum: 8021 in beta\"/> Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/>\n\n=== Cancer ===\nMore than half of all known cancers involve [[mutations]] of [[p53]], a [[tumor suppressor]] protein present in every cell which regulates the [[cell cycle]] and signals for [[cell death]] in the event of damage to [[DNA]]. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of [[tumors]]. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers.<ref name=\"10.1126/science.1905840\"/> In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's [[protein dimer]] in an [[water model|all-atom simulation of water]]. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2004.10.083\"/> This was the first [[peer review]]ed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project.<ref name=\"FAH publishes cancer results\"/> The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2005.12.083\"/>\n\nFolding@home is also used to study [[chaperone (protein)|protein chaperones]],<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> [[heat shock protein]]s which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the [[Macromolecular crowding|crowded]] and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in [[chemotherapy]] resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.biopha.2011.04.025\"/> Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells.<ref name=\"typepad: nanomedicine ce\"/> Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme [[Src kinase]], and some forms of the [[Engrailed (gene)|engrailed]] [[homeodomain]]: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer.<ref name=\"typepad: protomol b4\"/><ref name=\"description: 180\"/> In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small [[Trefoil knot fold|knottin]] protein EETI, which can identify [[carcinoma]]s in [[medical imaging|imaging scan]]s by binding to [[cell surface receptor|surface receptor]]s of cancer cells.<ref name=\"forum: 7600 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7600\"/>\n\n[[Interleukin 2]] (IL-2) is a protein that helps [[T cell]]s of the [[immune system]] attack pathogens and tumors. However, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as [[pulmonary edema]]. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a mutant form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. [[Pharmaceutical companies]] have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the [[National Institutes of Health]] are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.<ref name=\"scientists boost IL-2 potency\"/><ref name=\"10.1038/nature10975\"/>\n\n=== Osteogenesis imperfecta ===\n[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]], known as brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone disorder which can be lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in [[Type-I collagen]],<ref name=\"10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16051-0\"/> which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in [[mammal]]s.<ref name=\"978-0-387-73905-2\"/> The mutation causes a deformation in [[Collagen helix|collagen's triple helix structure]], which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.bpj.2009.04.059\"/> In 2005, Folding@home tested a new [[quantum mechanical]] method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.20301\"/> Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to [[Alzheimer]]'s and Huntington's research.<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/>\n\n=== Viruses ===\nFolding@home is assisting in research towards preventing some [[virus]]es, such as [[influenza]] and [[HIV]], from recognizing and entering [[Cell (biology)|biological cells]].<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the enzyme [[RNase H]], a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it.<ref name=\"forum: 10125\"/> Folding@home has also been used to study [[membrane fusion]], an essential event for [[viral entry|viral infection]] and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves [[conformational change]]s of viral fusion proteins and [[protein docking]],<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\"/> but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown.<ref name=\"10.1039/c0cs00115e\"/> Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude.<ref name=\"10.1038/cr.2010.57\"/> The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs.<ref name=\"Peter Kasson\"/> In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.<ref name=\"10.1038/cr.2010.57\"/>\n\nFollowing detailed simulations from Folding@home of small cells known as [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], in 2007, the Pande lab introduced a new computing method to measure the [[topology]] of its structural changes during fusion.<ref name=\"10.1093/bioinformatics/btm250\"/> In 2009, researchers used Folding@home to study mutations of [[Hemagglutinin (influenza)|influenza hemagglutinin]], a protein that attaches a virus to its [[Host (biology)|host]] cell and assists with viral entry.

Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current ''[[in silico]]'' methods usually must trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g., use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally costly [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: drug design methods\"/><ref name=\"10.1063/1.2221680\"/> Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom]] (\u00c5) [[root mean square deviation]] (RMSD) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]].

Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]]. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, [[interleukin-2]], and [[RNase H]].<ref name=\"typepad: drug targets\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1209309109\"/>\n\nApproximately half of all known [[antibiotic]]s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's [[ribosome]], a large and complex biochemical machine that performs [[protein biosynthesis]] by [[translation (biology)|translating]] [[messenger RNA]] into proteins.

In mammals, it is more abundant in the [[central nervous system]].  Although its function is unknown, its high conservation among species indicates an important role in the cellular function.  The conformational change from the normal prion protein (PrPc, stands for cellular) to the disease causing [[isoform]] PrPSc (stands for prototypical prion disease\u2013[[scrapie]]) causes a host of diseases collectly known as [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]] (TSEs), including [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) in bovine, [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CJD) and [[fatal insomnia]] in human, [[chronic wasting disease]] (CWD) in the deer family.  The conformational change is widely accepted as the result of [[protein misfolding]].  What distinguishes TSEs from other protein misfolding diseases is its transmissible nature.

Despite this, FLOPS remain the primary speed metric used in supercomputing.<ref name=\"forum: GPU flop conversion 2\"/><ref name=\"supercomputer only technically the fastest\"/> In contrast, Folding@home determines its FLOPS using [[wall-clock time]] by measuring how much time its work units take to complete.<ref name=\"forum: vs PPD numbers\"/><ref name=\"forum: vs PPD numbers 2\"/><ref name=\"forum: GPU flops conversion\"/>\n\nOn September 16, 2007, due in large part to the participation of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native [[Petascale computing|petaFLOPS]], becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so.<ref name=\"typepad: crossing 1 PF\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008\"/> [[Top500]]'s fastest supercomputer at the time was [[BlueGene/L]], at 0.280 petaFLOPS.<ref name=\"Top500 June 2007\"/> The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS,<ref name=\"FAH reaches 2 PF\"/> followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 2008<ref name=\"Nvidia-FAH milestone\"/><ref name=\"3 PF barrier\"/> and September 28, 2008 respectively.<ref name=\"past 4 petaFLOPS\"/> On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS,<ref name=\"typepad: FAH passes 5 PF\"/><ref name=\"crossing 5 PF barrier\"/> and was the first computing project to meet these five levels.<ref name=\"Community Grid Computing\"/><ref name=\"review of FAH\"/> In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] at 1.105 petaFLOPS.<ref name=\"Top500 November 2008\"/> On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008\"/><ref name=\"6 petaFLOPS\"/> In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS.

A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team. In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an [[Internet forum]].<ref name=\"Extreme overclocking forum\"/> The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"MaximumPC Chimp Challenge\"/> Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/>\n\nIf a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a \"Default\" team. This \"Default\" team has a team number of \"0\". Statistics are accumulated for this \"Default\" team as well as for specially named teams.\n\n== Software ==\nFolding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.\n\n=== Work units ===\nA work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a [[Markov model]]. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&nbsp;3 450&nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nBefore public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.<ref name=\"typepad: more transparency\"/> Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.<ref name=\"forum: Gromacs cannot continue\"/><ref name=\"forum: 6803(4,66,255)\"/> The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.<ref name=\"forum: troubleshooting bad WUs\"/>\n\n=== Cores ===\n{{main|List of Folding@home cores}}\nSpecialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as \"FahCores\" and often abbreviated \"cores\", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly language]] code and hardware optimizations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.20703\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct700301q\"/> Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.<ref name=\"Gromacs FAQ\"/> Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.<ref name=\"Open Source FAQ\"/><ref name=\"FAQ index\"/><ref name=\"typepad: update on new FahCores\"/> Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"Petaflop FAQ\"/> The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/>\n\n=== Client ===\n\n[[File:Folding@home Fedora25.png|thumb|Folding@Home running on Fedora 25]]\n\nA Folding@home participant installs a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]]. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/> The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/><ref name=\"forum: can FAH damage PC?\"/> The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]] systems, and [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nProfessional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.<ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Folding@home's data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&nbsp;8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> While the client's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is open-source,<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/> the client is [[proprietary software]] citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.<ref name=\"FAH license\"/><ref name=\"forum: FAH EULA\"/><ref name=\"help ubuntu\"/>\n\nHowever, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as [[Patch (computing)|patching]]) of the executable [[binary file]]s. Likewise, [[binary-only software|binary-only]] distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] while being downloaded via the internet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries|title=The Case of the Modified Binaries|website=Leviathan Security}}</ref> or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. [[Patch (computing)|patched]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/clowes/bh-us-02-clowes-binaries.ppt|title=Fixing/Making Holes in ELF Binaries/Programs - Black Hat}}</ref> or by decompiling<ref>probably using tools such as [https://github.com/thorkill/eresi ERESI]</ref> and recompiling them after modification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/how-to-disassemble-modify-and-then-reassemble-a-linux-executable|title=x86 - How to disassemble, modify and then reassemble a Linux executable?|website=Stack Overflow}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable|title=linux - How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable?|website=Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange}}</ref> These modifications are possible unless the binary files&nbsp;\u2013 and the transport channel&nbsp;\u2013 are [[digital signature|signed]] and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Nipravsky-Certificate-Bypass-Hiding-And-Executing-Malware-From-A-Digitally-Signed-Executable-wp.pdf |title=Certificate Bypass: Hiding and Executing Malware from a Digitally Signed Executable |publisher=[[Deep Instinct]] |website=BlackHat.com |date=August 2016}}</ref> Either way, since in the case of Folding@home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed,<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.\n\nFolding@home uses the [[Cosm (software)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Folding@home was launched on October&nbsp;1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems.<ref name=\"10.1039/C1CP22100K\"/> Its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.<ref name=\"10.1126/science.290.5498.1903\"/><ref name=\"Executive summary\"/> In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P. Anderson]] to test a supplemental client on the open-source [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;<ref name=\"FAH for BOINC soon\"/> however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/>\n\n==== Graphics processing units ====\nThe specialized hardware of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.<ref name=\"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x\"/> Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/MCSE.2010.27\"/>\n\nBefore 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.<ref name=\"10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84\"/>\n\nThe first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&nbsp;2, 2006,<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> delivering a 20\u201330 times speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU news\"/><ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\"/> GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 open beta\"/> Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&nbsp;6.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 goes live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 going well\"/> Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&nbsp;25, 2010. While [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities,<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/> and used OpenMM on top of an [[OpenCL]] framework.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 open beta\"/> Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software application.<ref name=\"forum: 7.1.38 released\"/><ref name=\"forum: GPU3 headless guide\"/> GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in [[FLOPS]]. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.<ref name=\"FAH osstats2\"/>\n\nNative support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.<ref name=\"forum: core17 Linux\"/>\n\n==== PlayStation 3 ====\n{{further|Life with PlayStation}}\n[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3-D animation of the protein being folded]]\n\nFrom March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20 times speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Biotech 27\"/> The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/> This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/>\n\nThe PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&nbsp;23, 2007.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 to study cancer\"/> Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.<ref name=\"PS3 research project\"/> On September&nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.<ref name=\"Life With PS3 live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: life with PS\"/> In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> However, unlike clients running on [[personal computer]]s, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/> The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/> The PS3 also had the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/>\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Sony ended support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and seven months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a \"game changer\" for the project.<ref name=\"PS3 FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h\"/><ref name=\"LWP termination\"/>\n\n==== Multi-core processing client ====\nFolding@home can use the [[parallel computing]] abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/> A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069\"/>\n\nIn November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/> This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.<ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/><ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> On January&nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.<ref name=\"SMP2 release\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/>\n\nSMP2 supports a trial of a special category of ''bigadv'' work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> which was raised to sixteen later, on February&nbsp;7, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: update on bigadv-16\"/> Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[random-access memory]] (RAM) and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.<ref name=\"typepad: bigadv points change\"/> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== V7 ====\n[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&nbsp;7]].

It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients.<ref name=\"typepad: ATI core 16 released\"/> V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.<ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\nV7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], named FAHControl.<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/><ref name=\"Ticket #736\"/> This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a [[backend as a service|back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or ''slot''). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently.

In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.<ref name=\"typepad: comparison with Anton\"/> Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories,<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.<ref name=\"10.1145/1654059.1654099\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.1187409\"/> These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems.<ref name=\"10.1145/1364782.1364802\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245\"/> However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|\u00b5s]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> In June 2011 Folding@home added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's.<ref name=\"forum: 7610/7611 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7610\"/> However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology|Medicine}}\n* [[BOINC]]\n* [[Foldit]]\n* [[List of distributed computing projects]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Molecular modeling on GPUs]]\n* [[SETI@home]]\n* [[Storage@home]]\n* [[Molecule editor]]\n* [[World Community Grid]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n| colwidth= 30em\n| refs =\n\n<!-- *** Books *** -->\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\">{{cite book |last1= Collier |first1= Leslie |last2= Balows |first2= Albert |last3= Sussman |first3= Max |year= 1998 |chapter= |title= Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections |edition= ninth |volume= 1, ''Virology'' |editor1-last= Mahy |editor1-first= Brian |editor2-last= Collier |editor2-first= Leslie |publisher= Arnold |location= London |isbn= 978-0-340-66316-5 |pages= 75\u201391}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-387-73905-2\">{{cite book |title= Collagen: structure and mechanics |last= Fratzl |first= Peter |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-387-73905-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWFTqEtXXwC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date= March 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\">{{cite book |author1=Travis Desell |author2=Anthony Waters |author3=Malik Magdon-Ismail |author4=Boleslaw K.
