{"title_page": "Henry Mayhew", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}\n[[Image:Henrymayhew.png|thumb|Henry Mayhew, from ''London Labour and the London Poor'' (1861)]]\n\n'''Henry Mayhew''' (25 November 1812 \u2013 25 July 1887) was a journalist, playwright and advocate of reform. He was one of the co-founders of the satirical magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1841, and was the magazine's joint-editor, with [[Mark Lemon]], in its early days. He is also known for his work as a social researcher, publishing an extensive series of newspaper articles in the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' that was later compiled into the book series ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'' (1851), a groundbreaking and influential survey of the city's poor.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHe was born in London, one of seventeen children of Joshua Mayhew. He was educated at [[Westminster School]] before running away from his studies to sea.<ref>Taithe (1996), p. 3</ref> He then served with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] as a [[midshipman]] on a ship bound for [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. He returned after several years, in 1829, becoming a trainee lawyer in [[Wales]].<ref name = \"puuvpx\">Taithe (1996), p. 9</ref> He left this and became a freelance journalist. He contributed to ''The Thief'', a readers' digest, followed quickly by editing a weekly journal&nbsp;\u2013 ''Figaro in London''. Mayhew reputedly fled his creditors and holed up at The Erwood Inn, a small public house in the village of [[Erwood]], south of [[Builth Wells]] in Wales.\n\n===Paris and writing===\nIn 1835 Mayhew found himself in a state of debt and, along with a fellow writer, escaped to Paris to avoid his creditors.<ref name = \"puuvpx\"/> He spent his time writing and in the company of other writers including [[William Thackeray]] and [[Douglas Jerrold]]. Mayhew spent over ten years in Paris returning to England in the 1850s whereby he was involved in several literary adventures, mostly the writing of plays. Two of his plays&nbsp;\u2013 ''But, However'' and the ''Wandering Minstrel''&nbsp;\u2013 were successful, whilst his early work ''Figaro in London'' was less successful.<ref name = \"gxjpjs\">Taithe (1996), p. 10</ref>\n\n===''Punch'' magazine===\n[[Image:Punch.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Punch (magazine)|Punch magazine]] was co-founded by Mayhew in 1841.]]\nOn 17 July 1841 Mayhew cofounded [[Punch (magazine)|Punch magazine]]. At its founding the magazine was jointly edited by Mayhew and [[Mark Lemon]]. The two men hired a group of writers and also illustrators to aid them. These included Douglas Jerrold, Angus Reach, John Leech, Richard Doyle and Shirley Brooks. Initially it was subtitled ''The London Charivari'', this being a reference to a satirical humour magazine published in France under the title ''[[Le Charivari]]'' (a work read often whilst Mayhew was in Paris).  Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove [[puppet]] [[Punch and Judy|Mr. Punch]].\n\n''Punch'' was an unexpected success, selling about 6,000 copies a week in the early years. However, sales of as many as 10,000 issues a week were required to cover all costs of the magazine. In December 1842, the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans; Mayhew resigned as joint editor,<ref name = \"gxjpjs\"/> and he continued at the magazine as \"suggestor in chief\" with Mark Lemon reappointed as editor. Mayhew eventually severed his connection with the magazine, writing his last article in February 1845. His brother [[Horace Mayhew (journalist)|Horace]] stayed on the board of Punch until his own death.\n\nThe ''Punch'' years gave Mayhew the opportunity to meet talented illustrators who he later employed to work from [[daguerreotypes]] on ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]''.<ref name = \"gxjpjs\"/> Following ''Punch'' magazine, Mayhew launched ''Iron Times'', a railway magazine. However this venture lost Mayhew so much money that he was forced to appear in a Court of [[Bankruptcy]] in 1846.\n\n===Formative work===\nIn 1842 Mayhew contributed to the pioneering [[Illustrated London News]]. By this time Mayhew had become reasonably secure financially, had settled his debts and married Jane Jerrold, the daughter of his friend [[Douglas Jerrold]].<ref>Taithe (1996), p. 11</ref> She lived until 1880.\n\n====''London Labour and the London Poor''====\n{{Main|London Labour and the London Poor}}\nThe articles comprising ''London Labour and the London Poor'' were initially collected into three volumes in 1851; the 1861 edition included a fourth volume, co-written with Bracebridge Hemyng, John Binny and [[Andrew Halliday (journalist)|Andrew Halliday]], on the lives of prostitutes, thieves and beggars. This Extra Volume took a more general and statistical approach to its subject than Volumes 1 to 3.\n\nMayhew wrote in volume one: \"''I shall consider the whole of the metropolitan poor under three separate phases, according as they ''will'' work, they ''can't'' work, and they ''won't'' work''\".<ref>http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0140 \u00a0{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050322222303/http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0140 |date=22 March 2005 }}</ref> He interviewed everyone \u2013 beggars, street-entertainers (such as [[Punch and Judy]] men), market traders, prostitutes, labourers, [[sweatshop]] workers, even down to the \"[[mudlark]]s\" who searched the stinking mud on the banks of the [[River Thames]] for wood, metal, rope and coal from passing ships, and the \"pure-finders\" who gathered dog faeces to sell to [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]s. He described their clothes, how and where they lived, their entertainments and customs, and made detailed estimates of the numbers and incomes of those practising each trade. The books show how marginal and precarious many people's lives were, in what, at that time, was the richest city in the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nMayhew's richly detailed descriptions give an impression of what the street markets of his day were like. An example from Volume 1:\n:'The pavement and the road are crowded with purchasers and street-sellers. The housewife in her thick shawl, with the market-basket on her arm, walks slowly on, stopping now to look at the stall of caps, and now to cheapen a bunch of greens. Little boys, holding three or four onions in their hand, creep between the people, wriggling their way through every interstice, and asking for custom in whining tones, as if seeking charity. Then the tumult of the thousand different cries of the eager dealers, all shouting at the top of their voices, at one and the same time, is almost bewildering. \"So-old again,\" roars one. \"Chestnuts all'ot, a penny a score,\" bawls another. \"An 'aypenny a skin, blacking,\" squeaks a boy. \"Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy\u2013 bu-u-uy!\" cries the butcher. \"[[Paper quire#Quire|Half-quire]] of paper for a penny,\" bellows the street stationer. \"An 'aypenny a lot ing-uns.\" \u201cTwopence a pound grapes.\" \u201cThree a penny Yarmouth bloaters.\" \u201cWho'll buy a bonnet for fourpence?\" \u201cPick 'em out cheap here! three pair for a halfpenny, bootlaces.\" \u201cNow's your time! beautiful whelks, a penny a lot.\" \u201cHere's ha'p\u2018orths,\" shouts the perambulating confectioner. \"Come and look at 'em! here's toasters!\" bellows one with a Yarmouth bloater stuck on a toasting-fork. \"Penny a lot, fine russets,\" calls the apple woman: and so the Babel goes on.'<ref>Mayhew, Henry 1851\u20131861. ''London Labour and the London Poor''. Researched and written, variously, with J. Binny, B. Hemyng and A. Halliday.</ref>\n\n==How the poor reacted to ''London Labour and the London Poor''==\nSome of the London street traders did not like the way Mayhew wrote about them. In spring/summer 1851 they established a ''Street Trader's Protection Association'' to guard themselves against the journalist.<ref>M\u00fcnch (2017)</ref>\n\n==Family==\nMayhew was the grandfather of Audrey Mayhew Allen (b. 1870), an author of a number of children's stories published in various periodicals, and of ''[[Gladys in Grammarland]]'', an [[Works based on Alice in Wonderland|imitation]] of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Wonderland'' books.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jerrold|first1=Yvonne|title=Family Tree|url=http://www.yvonnejerrold.com/FamilyTree/1-JaneMatilda%282%29Jerrold-Mayhews.html|website=Yvonne Jerrold}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nMayhew's work was embraced by and was an influence on the [[Christian Socialists]], such as [[Thomas Hughes]], [[Charles Kingsley]], and [[F. D. Maurice]]. Radicals also published sizeable excerpts from the reports in the ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]]'', the ''[[Red Republican]]'', and other newspapers. The often sympathetic investigations, with their immediacy and unswerving eye for detail, offered unprecedented insights into the condition of the Victorian poor. Alongside the earlier work of [[Edwin Chadwick]], they are also regarded as a decisive influence on the thinking of [[Charles Dickens]].\n\nMayhew's work inspired the script of director [[Christine Edzard]]'s 1990 film ''[[The Fool (1990 film)|The Fool]]''. Mayhew has appeared as a character in television and radio histories of Victorian London ; he was played by [[Timothy West]] in the documentary ''[[London (TV series)|London]]'' (2004), and [[David Haig]] in the [[Afternoon Play]] ''A Chaos of Wealth and Want'' (2010). In the 2012 novel ''[[Dodger (novel)|Dodger]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], Mayhew and his wife appear as fictionalised versions of themselves, and he is mentioned in the dedication.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Anne Humpherys (1984), Henry Mayhew, Boston/Mass.: OUP.\n* {{cite book |author=Mayhew, Henry, edited by Robert Douglas-Fairhurst |year=2010 |title=London Labour and the London Poor |publisher=[[OUP]]}}\n* Ole M\u00fcnch (2017), Henry Mayhew and the Street Traders of Victorian London \u2013 A Cultural Exchange with Material Consequences, in: The London Journal.\n* {{cite book |author=Taithe, Bertrand |year=1996 |title=The Essential Mayhew: Representing and Communicating the Poor |publisher=Rivers Oram Press |isbn=1-85489-046-8}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |author=Vlock, Deborah |year=2004 |title=Mayhew, Henry (1812\u20131887) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=OUP |location=London}}\n* {{cite book |author=Yates, Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Yates |year=1884 |title=His Recollections and Experiences |url=https://archive.org/details/edmundyateshisre00yateuoft |publisher=Richard Bentley and Son |location=London}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=cDYUb-tzToUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Henry+Mayhew&hl=en&ei=nJg0TPqpBJKjOOj6qMYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false London Labour and the London Poor], Mayhew, Henry, Published in London, 1861\u201362.

He is a previous panellist on the Sunday Footy Show.\n\n==Early career==\nThompson was recruited from [[Kyneton Football Club|Kyneton]] and debuted for the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] in 1998. A tall marking forward, Thompson was an important young player for the club considering he was selected in the [[1997 AFL Draft]] at pick 82.\n\n==Hawthorn career==\nThompson performed well in Hawthorn's 2001 campaign, in which they came within two goals of playing in the [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], and Thompson finished 3rd in the [[Peter Crimmins Medal]]. Playing mostly at Full Forward with the occasional run in the ruck, Thompson was the club's leading goalkicker for seasons 2003 and 2004.\n\n===Depression===\nIn 2004 Thompson admitted to the media that he had been suffering from [[clinical depression]], a saga that raised awareness of the condition.\n\n==North Melbourne career==\nAt the end of 2004, possibly following the need for a fresh start following his revelation of depression, Thompson was a prized recruit for the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] and was seen as a big forward option alongside [[Saverio Rocca]] at the club. In 2005 he debuted for the Kangaroos and found himself working in rotation and occasionally in tandem with Rocca up forward, although this was not a permanent move due to Rocca's age and the top-heaviness of the Roos' forward line.\n\n===2005 season===\nThompson was the Kangaroos' leading goalkicker for 2005 with 52 goals and was considered a good choice for the Roos.\n\nOne of Thompson's most memorable games was the clash against Collingwood in Round 19. With the Roos trailing by almost 4 goals late in the 4th quarter, Thompson was part of a revival where the Kangaroos managed to take the lead in the dying moments. His contribution was 3 goals, including the matchwinner just before the siren. He gestured with a [[Hulk Hogan]]-style fist pump which remained one of the famous images of the [[2005 AFL season]].\n\n===2006 season===\nIn 2006 Thompson faced an eventful two weeks. In the Round 5 game against [[Melbourne FC|Melbourne]], Thompson had helped the Kangaroos to get back in the game after they were trailing at half-time. Having booted 5 goals for the day and being in control of the Demons' defence, Thompson took a couple of important [[Mark (Australian football)|contested mark]]s and was a dangerous presence up forward for North (in terms of scoring and marking power). He put the Kangaroos in front after they had trailed for much of the last three quarters and was on his way to perhaps putting in a match-winning performance. However following a desperate last-quarter chase of Melbourne's [[Nathan Carroll (Australian footballer)|Nathan Carroll]], Thompson in a shock move put himself on the bench, replacing himself with [[Drew Petrie]]. He was not sitting on the bench and was standing up, giving the impression that he wanted to come back onto the ground. Thompson later cited that he was \"spent\" and tired as the reasons for his early exit (Melbourne then went on to win the game with a last minute goal after the Kangaroos had several forward opportunities).\n\nThis controversy received a lot of media attention but for [[Sirengate]], which occurred the day following the North Melbourne-Melbourne match and was so big that Thompson's voluntary send off (compared to [[Sally Robbins]]' rowing controversy by some in the media) was put on the back-burner.\n\nIn Round 6 Thompson said that he was willing to put the previous week's debacle aside and performed with an 8-goal haul, the best of his career, to give the Kangaroos a 22-point victory to lift them off the bottom of the ladder.\n\nGlenn Archer wrote an article after Nathan Thompson's taking off incident, from \"Thommo's\" view, he made a point that Thommo had lactic acid in his legs and he decided it would be better for the team if he swapped with Drew.\n\n===2007 Season===\nThompson was going outstanding in the Pre-Season, with the new fast running attacking ball play ready to give him more of the footy. He kicked a Super Goal against Carlton in the Semi-Finals of the NAB Cup, then, a week later against St Kilda in a Practice Match, Thompson ruptured his ACL and missed the entire 2007 Season.\n\nWhile in Darwin for the Darwin Cup, Thompson criticised former [[North Melbourne Football Club]] champion [[Wayne Carey]] about his criticisms of the club, which led Carey to respond with mockery of Thompson's depression on the Nine Network's Sunday morning [[The Footy Show (AFL)|Footy Show]]. In addition, on returning from a commercial break, Carey was clearly heard to make references to 'necking himself', to the apparent delight of other members of the Footy Show panel. Carey and the Nine Network were quick to issue an apology over the incident, although no mention was officially made of the 'necking himself' comment.\n\nThompson has recovered well from his knee injury and was considered a possibility of a return in 2007. His name was thrown around for the round 22 clash against the [[Western Bulldogs]] but he didn't end up playing. He also missed out on the finals with coach Laidley saying that he wouldn't risk changing the team's structure that had led to the success they had enjoyed over the season. Thompson will now be looking forward to a big return in 2008.\n\n===2008 Season===\nThompson made his return to football in Round 1 of 2008 against the Bombers on Easter Monday. It was a good return, with Thompson booting 2 goals in the 1st quarter and 3 goals for the 1st half. He kicked 4 goals for the day as the Roos were smashed by the Bombers 9.13.67 to 19.8.122.\n\nThompson's brilliant effort against Hawthorn in Round 13 earned him an AFL Army Award nomination. The publicly voted Award recognises courage, initiative and teamwork on the footy field. Fans have until 11:59&nbsp;pm on Sunday, 29 June, to vote for Thompson at afl.com.au\n\nIt was announced on The Footy Show that Thompson's career with North Melbourne would be coming to an end.\n\nThompson officially announced his retirement after being delisted by North Melbourne on 19 September.<ref>[http://sportal.com.au/AFL-news-display/thompson-bows-out-57076 Kangas' Thompson Bows Out]</ref>\n\n==Season 2009: Back to VFL==\nOn 24 December 2008,  North Melbourne and Hawthorn spearhead Nathan Thompson has decided to come out of retirement and signed with VFL club Werribee Tigers next season after announcing his retirement from AFL ranks this year.\nThe Tigers, who have a part-time AFL alignment with the Kangaroos in the VFL, were desperate to snare a big forward with stature to replace former captain and this year's J.J. Liston Trophy winner James Podsiadly, who was a shock departure after crossing to Geelong's VFL team.\n\n==Post AFL/VFL Career==\nThompson played for the Doncaster Football Club in Division 3 of the Eastern Football League and kicked 9 goals in the 2013 Grand Final against Wantirna South. In 2016 he returned to his home town of Kyneton in central Victoria to play for the Kyneton Tigers.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/werribee-gets-signature/2008/12/23/1229998527451.html\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{AFL Tables|N/Nathan_Thompson}}\n\n{{Hawthorn leading goalkickers}}\n{{North Melbourne leading goalkickers}}\n{{1999 AFL Rising Star nominees}}\n{{1997 AFL national draft}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thompson, Nathan}}\n[[Category:1978 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia)]]\n[[Category:Hawthorn Football Club players]]\n[[Category:North Melbourne Football Club players]]\n[[Category:Bendigo Pioneers players]]\n[[Category:Kyneton Football Club players]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Australian rules footballer, born 1978}}\n{{about|the Australian rules footballer|rapper|Giggs (rapper)|the soccer player|Nathan Thompson (English footballer)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2012}}\n\n{{Infobox AFL biography\n| name = Nathan Thompson\n| image = Nathan_thompson.jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = Nathan Thompson playing for the Kangaroos<br>during the 2006 AFL Season\n| fullname = Nathan Thompson\n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1978|2|14|df=y}}\n| birth_place = \n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| originalteam = [[Kyneton Football Club|Kyneton]] / [[Bendigo Bombers|Bendigo U18]]\n| height = 196 cm\n| weight = 100 kg\n| position = \n| statsend = 2008\n| years1 = 1998 &ndash; 2004\n| club1 = {{AFL Haw}}\n| games_goals1 = 119 (192)\n| years2 = 2005 &ndash; 2008\n| club2 = {{AFL Kan}}\n| games_goals2 = {{0}}60 (135)\n| games_goalstotal = 179 (327)\n| careerhighlights = *2\u00d7 AFL pre-season premiership player: [[1998 Ansett Australia Cup|1998]], [[1999 Ansett Australia Cup|1999]]\n*2\u00d7 [[List of Hawthorn Football Club leading goalkickers|Hawthorn leading goalkicker]]: 2003, 2004\n*2\u00d7 [[List of North Melbourne Football Club leading goalkickers|Kangaroos leading goalkicker]]: 2005, 2006\n*[[AFL Rising Star]] nominee: [[1999 AFL Rising Star|1999]]\n}}\n\n'''Nathan Thompson''' (born 14 February 1978) is a former [[Australian rules football]]er, who previously played with the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club]]s in the [[Australian Football League]]. He is a previous panellist on the Sunday Footy Show.\n\n==Early career==\nThompson was recruited from [[Kyneton Football Club|Kyneton]] and debuted for the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] in 1998. A tall marking forward, Thompson was an important young player for the club considering he was selected in the [[1997 AFL Draft]] at pick 82.\n\n==Hawthorn career==\nThompson performed well in Hawthorn's 2001 campaign, in which they came within two goals of playing in the [[AFL Grand Final|Grand Final]], and Thompson finished 3rd in the [[Peter Crimmins Medal]]. Playing mostly at Full Forward with the occasional run in the ruck, Thompson was the club's leading goalkicker for seasons 2003 and 2004.\n\n===Depression===\nIn 2004 Thompson admitted to the media that he had been suffering from [[clinical depression]], a saga that raised awareness of the condition.\n\n==North Melbourne career==\nAt the end of 2004, possibly following the need for a fresh start following his revelation of depression, Thompson was a prized recruit for the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] and was seen as a big forward option alongside [[Saverio Rocca]] at the club. In 2005 he debuted for the Kangaroos and found himself working in rotation and occasionally in tandem with Rocca up forward, although this was not a permanent move due to Rocca's age and the top-heaviness of the Roos' forward line.\n\n===2005 season===\nThompson was the Kangaroos' leading goalkicker for 2005 with 52 goals and was considered a good choice for the Roos.\n\nOne of Thompson's most memorable games was the clash against Collingwood in Round 19. With the Roos trailing by almost 4 goals late in the 4th quarter, Thompson was part of a revival where the Kangaroos managed to take the lead in the dying moments. His contribution was 3 goals, including the matchwinner just before the siren. He gestured with a [[Hulk Hogan]]-style fist pump which remained one of the famous images of the [[2005 AFL season]].\n\n===2006 season===\nIn 2006 Thompson faced an eventful two weeks. In the Round 5 game against [[Melbourne FC|Melbourne]], Thompson had helped the Kangaroos to get back in the game after they were trailing at half-time. Having booted 5 goals for the day and being in control of the Demons' defence, Thompson took a couple of important [[Mark (Australian football)|contested mark]]s and was a dangerous presence up forward for North (in terms of scoring and marking power). He put the Kangaroos in front after they had trailed for much of the last three quarters and was on his way to perhaps putting in a match-winning performance. However following a desperate last-quarter chase of Melbourne's [[Nathan Carroll (Australian footballer)|Nathan Carroll]], Thompson in a shock move put himself on the bench, replacing himself with [[Drew Petrie]].

Retrieved 17 April 2017.</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n{{original research|section|date=February 2017}}\nArchibald Sayce was born in [[Shirehampton]], Bristol, to a family of [[Shropshire]] descent. A delicate child who suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and got a late start, he soon caught up with a private tutor and was reading [[Homer]] in [[Greek language|Greek]] at ten. He attended [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], becoming a fellow in 1869.\n\nIn 1874, Sayce published a long paper, \"The Astronomy and Astrology of the Babylonians\" in ''Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology'' vol. 3, part 1, with transcriptions and translations of the relevant [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts, that was one of the first articles to recognise and translate [[History of Astronomy|astronomical cuneiform texts]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/transactionssoc08nashgoog|title=Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arch\u00e6ology|last=Society of Biblical Arch\u00e6ology (London|first=England)|date=1874|others=unknown library|language=English}}</ref>\n\nIn 1879, Sayce linked the reliefs near [[Magnesia on the Maeander]] in western [[Anatolia]] to those of the site at [[Yazilikaya]] in the [[Anatolia#Anatolian plateau|Turkish plateau]], and recognised that they belonged to an unidentified pre-Greek culture.\n\nIn 1876, he deciphered one of the [[logogram|hieroglyphic]]s inscribed on stones at [[Hamath]] in Syria, by deducing that the profile of a man stood for \"I\". In 1880, he deciphered another hieroglyphic which he recognised as the governing prefix that identified divinity. He had suspected for some time that [[Bo\u011fazkale|Boghazkoy]] was the capital of the [[Hittites]] because some hieroglyphic scripts found at [[Aleppo]] and Hamath in northern Syria were matched to the script on a monument at Boghazkoy.\n\nIn 1882, in a lecture to the [[Society of Biblical Archaeology]] in London, he announced that the Hittites, far from being a small [[Canaan]]ite tribe who dealt with the kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], were the people of a \"lost Hittite empire\", which [[New Kingdom|Egyptian]] texts were then bringing to light. He and [[William Wright (missionary)|William Wright]] identified the ruins at Boghazkoy with [[Hattusa]], the capital of a Hittite Empire that stretched from the [[Aegean Sea]] to the banks of the [[Euphrates]], centuries before the age of the [[Old Testament]] patriarchs.<ref>{{cite book|first=Trevor|last=Bryce|authorlink=Trevor R. Bryce|title=Life and Society in the Hittite World|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|page=3}}</ref>\n\nSayce concluded that the Hittite hieroglyphic system was predominantly a [[syllabary]], that is, its symbols stood for a phonetic syllable. There were too many different signs for a system that was alphabetical and yet there were too few for it to be a set of ideographs. That very sign standing for the divinity had appeared on the stones of Hamath and other places, always in the form of a prefix of an indecipherable group of hieroglyphics naming the deities. This led Sayce to conclude that by finding the name of one of these deities with the help of another language endowed with similar pronunciation, one might analyse the conversion of the aforesaid name in Hittite hieroglyphics. Also, he stated that the keys to be obtained through that process might in turn be applied to other parts of a Hittite inscription where the same sign were to occur.\n\nSayce dreamed of finding a bilingual [[Rosetta Stone]]. In 1880, he found a clue on a writing that spoke of an ancient silver disk discovered in [[Istanbul]]. It was a small-sized relic resembling a seal. In its centre, the figure of a warrior wearing a short robe, cape, helmet and upward-toe-capped boots (a Hittite apparel, no doubt) lay. The frieze around the warrior contained a cuneiform inscription in [[Hurrian]] dialect. Sayce supposed that the cuneiform inscription on the seal and the Hittite characters contained in its inner circle expressed one only meaning. Therefore, he was facing a bilingual text.\n\nWorking with a plaster impression, Sayce translated the cuneiform text of a seal \"Tarritktimme, king of the country of Erme\" (Walters Gallery, Baltimore). By late 1886, only seven signs had been deciphered out of the totality of signs belonging to the hieroglyphic system.\n\nLater, after Sayce had turned his attention to [[Egyptology]], archives were discovered at Hattusa that unlocked the language spoken there.\n\nLectures were his favourite vehicle for publication. He published in 1887 his [[Hibbert lectures]] on Babylonian religion;<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sayce, Rev. Archibald Henry|journal=Who's Who|year=1913|page=1782|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453201;view=1up;seq=1816}}</ref> in 1902 his [[Gifford lectures]] on Egyptian and Babylonian religion; and in 1907 his [[Rhind lectures]].\n\nSayce was working at [[Eileithyiaspolis|El Kab]] in Egypt with [[Somers Clarke]] in the 1900s.

Retrieved 17 April 2017.</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n{{original research|section|date=February 2017}}\nArchibald Sayce was born in [[Shirehampton]], Bristol, to a family of [[Shropshire]] descent. A delicate child who suffered from [[tuberculosis]] and got a late start, he soon caught up with a private tutor and was reading [[Homer]] in [[Greek language|Greek]] at ten. He attended [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], becoming a fellow in 1869.\n\nIn 1874, Sayce published a long paper, \"The Astronomy and Astrology of the Babylonians\" in ''Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology'' vol. 3, part 1, with transcriptions and translations of the relevant [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts, that was one of the first articles to recognise and translate [[History of Astronomy|astronomical cuneiform texts]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/transactionssoc08nashgoog|title=Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arch\u00e6ology|last=Society of Biblical Arch\u00e6ology (London|first=England)|date=1874|others=unknown library|language=English}}</ref>\n\nIn 1879, Sayce linked the reliefs near [[Magnesia on the Maeander]] in western [[Anatolia]] to those of the site at [[Yazilikaya]] in the [[Anatolia#Anatolian plateau|Turkish plateau]], and recognised that they belonged to an unidentified pre-Greek culture.\n\nIn 1876, he deciphered one of the [[logogram|hieroglyphic]]s inscribed on stones at [[Hamath]] in Syria, by deducing that the profile of a man stood for \"I\". In 1880, he deciphered another hieroglyphic which he recognised as the governing prefix that identified divinity. He had suspected for some time that [[Bo\u011fazkale|Boghazkoy]] was the capital of the [[Hittites]] because some hieroglyphic scripts found at [[Aleppo]] and Hamath in northern Syria were matched to the script on a monument at Boghazkoy.\n\nIn 1882, in a lecture to the [[Society of Biblical Archaeology]] in London, he announced that the Hittites, far from being a small [[Canaan]]ite tribe who dealt with the kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], were the people of a \"lost Hittite empire\", which [[New Kingdom|Egyptian]] texts were then bringing to light. He and [[William Wright (missionary)|William Wright]] identified the ruins at Boghazkoy with [[Hattusa]], the capital of a Hittite Empire that stretched from the [[Aegean Sea]] to the banks of the [[Euphrates]], centuries before the age of the [[Old Testament]] patriarchs.<ref>{{cite book|first=Trevor|last=Bryce|authorlink=Trevor R. Bryce|title=Life and Society in the Hittite World|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|page=3}}</ref>\n\nSayce concluded that the Hittite hieroglyphic system was predominantly a [[syllabary]], that is, its symbols stood for a phonetic syllable. There were too many different signs for a system that was alphabetical and yet there were too few for it to be a set of ideographs. That very sign standing for the divinity had appeared on the stones of Hamath and other places, always in the form of a prefix of an indecipherable group of hieroglyphics naming the deities. This led Sayce to conclude that by finding the name of one of these deities with the help of another language endowed with similar pronunciation, one might analyse the conversion of the aforesaid name in Hittite hieroglyphics. Also, he stated that the keys to be obtained through that process might in turn be applied to other parts of a Hittite inscription where the same sign were to occur.\n\nSayce dreamed of finding a bilingual [[Rosetta Stone]]. In 1880, he found a clue on a writing that spoke of an ancient silver disk discovered in [[Istanbul]]. It was a small-sized relic resembling a seal. In its centre, the figure of a warrior wearing a short robe, cape, helmet and upward-toe-capped boots (a Hittite apparel, no doubt) lay. The frieze around the warrior contained a cuneiform inscription in [[Hurrian]] dialect. Sayce supposed that the cuneiform inscription on the seal and the Hittite characters contained in its inner circle expressed one only meaning. Therefore, he was facing a bilingual text.\n\nWorking with a plaster impression, Sayce translated the cuneiform text of a seal \"Tarritktimme, king of the country of Erme\" (Walters Gallery, Baltimore). By late 1886, only seven signs had been deciphered out of the totality of signs belonging to the hieroglyphic system.\n\nLater, after Sayce had turned his attention to [[Egyptology]], archives were discovered at Hattusa that unlocked the language spoken there.\n\nLectures were his favourite vehicle for publication. He published in 1887 his [[Hibbert lectures]] on Babylonian religion;<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sayce, Rev. Archibald Henry|journal=Who's Who|year=1913|page=1782|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453201;view=1up;seq=1816}}</ref> in 1902 his [[Gifford lectures]] on Egyptian and Babylonian religion; and in 1907 his [[Rhind lectures]].\n\nSayce was working at [[Eileithyiaspolis|El Kab]] in Egypt with [[Somers Clarke]] in the 1900s. In his seasonal winter digs in Egypt he always hired a well-furnished boat on the [[Nile]] to accommodate his travelling library, which also enabled him to offer tea to visiting Egyptologists like the young American [[James Henry Breasted]] and his wife.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n===Books - Known works===\n* {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_TjcsAAAAYAAJ|title=An Assyrian grammar, for comparative purposes|author=Sayce, Archibald Henry | author-mask = | editor=|year=1872|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner|edition=|location=|page=|isbn=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_TjcsAAAAYAAJ/page/n206 188]|accessdate=5 July 2011}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtQOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Archaic classics.
