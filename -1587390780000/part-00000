Gentoo package management is designed to be [[Modular programming|modular]], [[porting|portable]], easy to maintain, and flexible.

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]]. The original design was based on the [[Ports collection|ports system]] used by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) based operating systems. The portage tree contains over 19,000 packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system.<ref name=\"Negus2006\">{{cite book|author=Chris Negus|title=Live Linux CDs: Building and Customizing Bootables|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2S3eUgb39C8C&pg=PA224|year=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall Professional|isbn=978-0-13-243274-0|pages=224\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA single invocation of portage's {{mono|emerge}} command can update the local copy of the portage tree, search for a package, or download, compile, and install one or more packages and their dependencies. The built-in features can be set for individual packages, or globally, with so-called \"USE flags\".<ref name=\"Negus2006\"/>\n\nPortage provides a way to set the amount of processes that can run and the maximum load average for the processor cores using the {{mono|EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS}} flag <ref>https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</ref> in either the default configuration file at <code>etc/portage/make.conf</code> or a file that <code>export</code>s the flag, like in <code>/root/.bashrc</code>.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]).

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]]. The original design was based on the [[Ports collection|ports system]] used by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) based operating systems.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams. However, if so desired, a user may still rebuild the toolchain or reinstall the base system software during or after a normal stage3 installation, effectively simulating the old bootstrap process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#Bootstrapping_the_Base_System_.28Optional_but_Recommended.29|title=Sakaki's EFI Install Guide/Building the Gentoo Base System Minus Kernel|publisher=Sakaki|date=2014-07-04|accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref>\n\n===Gentoo Reference Platform===\nFrom 2003 until 2008, the '''Gentoo Reference Platform''' (GRP) was a snapshot of prebuilt packages that users could quickly install during the Gentoo installation process, to give faster access to fully functional Gentoo installation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2002/10/10/intro_gentoo.html|title=Gentoo Linux Reloaded|author=[[Daniel Robbins (computer programmer)|Daniel Robbins]]|date=2002-10-10|accessdate=2007-01-04|work=[[O'Reilly Media|LinuxDevCenter.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/6206|title=Gentoo Linux 2004.0 Released|author=Sven Vermeulen|date=2004-03-01|accessdate=2018-02-10|work=[[OSNews]]}}</ref> These packages included [[KDE]], [[X Window System]], [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[GNOME]], and [[Mozilla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|title=Gentoo Linux Documentation|accessdate=2018-02-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108142459/https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|archivedate=2014-01-08|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Once the installation was complete, the packages installed as part of the GRP were intended to be replaced by the user with the same or newer versions built though Portage which would be built using the users' system configuration rather than the generic builds provided by the GRP.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]). Profiles formerly tracked the versioning of install media, and switched to two-digit year-based naming after the discontinuation of versioned media. The following new profile versions have been released after 2008.0:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Version\n!

However, over the years Gentoo has suffered from dropping popularity. In 2003, Gentoo was the fourth most popular and dropped to seventh in 2004, ninth in 2005, tenth in 2006 and thirteenth in 2007. For 2008, Gentoo dropped to 18th, but the following year it ended its dropping streak by rising to 17th.

Sarah Schenirer concluded that only providing young Jewish women with a thorough, school-based Jewish education would effectively combat this phenomenon. She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout [[Europe]].\n\nShe obtained the approval of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (author of ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]''), who issued a [[responsum]] holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted. Following the Chofetz Chaim's approbation, the Bais Yaakov Movement in Poland was taken under the wing of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]]. Additionally, she sought and received approbation from [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] rabbis as well, most notably the [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer rebbe)|Belzer Rebbe]] and the [[Avraham Mordechai Alter|Gerrer Rebbe]].<ref>\"From Sarah to Sarah\" by S.

These run various courses generally lasting between one and three years. There are also post-secondary schools that combine Torah education with practical workforce skills, such as computer programming, education, and graphic arts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Bais Yaakov comes from a verse in the [[Book of Exodus]] in which the term \"House of Jacob\" is understood by [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation.<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus|19:3}}</ref>\n\n== Current ==\n=== Educational approach ===\nThe educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of [[Haredi Judaism]] and the [[Agudath Israel movement]]. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the [[curriculum]], whereas in North America and Europe the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values.\n\nStudents are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of ''[[tzniut|tznius]]'' (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, [[oxford shirt]], and sweater or sweatshirt.\n\nThe schools' primary purpose is to prepare students to be contributors to family and community, as good [[Jew]]s, wives, professionals, and mothers. \n\nSecular studies sometimes reflect government proficiency requirements in such subjects as math, science, literature and history in their respective countries.\n\n=== Curriculum ===\nMost non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] ([[Pentateuch]]), [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets), and other parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]]; and instruction in [[Hebrew language]], [[Jewish history]] and the study of practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and other times as a summary of classic ''halakha'' sources.\n\nOne of the tenets of [[Orthodox Judaism]] is that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the Jewish commentaries, so Bais Yaakov girls are taught the [[Tanakh]] through this approach. A major focus is on [[Rashi]], considered the foremost Torah commentator.\n\nThe curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of male-only [[yeshiva]]s, where the core component of study is the [[Talmud]]. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of ''[[aggadah]]'' (homiletics). This contrasts with the approach of many [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] [[Jewish day school]]s, which increasingly teach Talmud to women.\n\n=== Locations ===\n[[Image:\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \"\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1\" \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1 (1).jpg|thumb|250px|Beit Yaakov teachers' Seminary, [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.]]\nBranches exist in most North American cities with large [[:Category:Orthodox Jewish communities|populations of Orthodox Jews]] such as New York City, Montreal, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Toronto, [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], and in most Israeli cities.
