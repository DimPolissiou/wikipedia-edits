The championship has always been played on a regional basis, whereby the respective champions from the Mid, North, South and West championships contest the county series of games. However, in recent years, the championship has followed the same system as the senior grade in Tipperary. Currently (2018) there are 21 teams in the county championship divided up into 6 groups (3 groups with 4 teams, 3 groups with 3 teams). The top 2 teams of each group qualify for the knock out phase of the championship along with the 4 divisional winners. It is quite common for clubs to progress from their group and also win their respective divisional championship.\n\nThe Tipperary County Championship is an integral part of the wider [[Munster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship|Munster GAA Intermediate Club Hurling Championship]]. The winners of the Tipperary county final join the champions of the other hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.\n\nThe title has been won at least once by 31 different clubs.\n\n[[St Mary's Clonmel]] are the current (2017) title-holders, having beaten [[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]] in the final.\n\n==Roll of honour==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" |\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Team'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winner'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winning Years'''\n!Runners Up\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1\n| [[Newport GAA|Newport]]\n| 3\n| 2016, 2002, \n1989\n|2008,\n2000\n|-\n| [[Silvermines GAA|Silvermines]]\n| 3\n| 2012<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|title=Redemption for Silvermines as Ballina lament poor start champions|date=20 October 2012|publisher=The Nationalist|accessdate=22 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130619220137/http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|archivedate=19 June 2013}}</ref>1999,\n\n1972\n|1994,\n1987\n|-\n|\n| [[Moyne-Templetuohy GAA|Moyne-Templetuohy]]\n| 2\n| 2014,\n1983\n|2013,\n2004,\n\n2001\n|-\n|\n|[[Burgess GAA|Burgess]]\n| 2\n| 2005,\n1993\n|2003,\n1992\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2\n|[[Templederry Kenyons GAA|Templederry Kenyons]]\n| 2\n| 2008, 2000\n|1999\n|-\n|[[Borrisokane GAA|Borrisokane]]\n| 2\n| 2010,\n1982\n|\n|-\n| [[\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty GAA|\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty]]\n| 2\n| 2006,\n1994\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"26\" |3\n|[[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|1\n|2018\n|2016,\n\n2015,\n\n2014,\n\n1989\n|-\n| [[Kildangan GAA (Tipperary)|Kildangan]]\n| 1\n| 2004\n|1980,\n2002,\n\n2019\n|-\n|[[Arravale Rovers GAA|Arravale Rovers]]\n| 1\n| 1997\n|2009,\n1991,\n\n1988\n|-\n|[[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]]\n| 1\n| 1988\n|2017,\n2011,\n\n2010\n|-\n|[[J.K.

[[hurling]] competition organised by the [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary County Board]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] since 1979 for the third-tier hurling teams in the county of [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] in Ireland.\n\nThe series of games are played during the summer and autumn months with the county final currently being played at [[Semple Stadium]] in October. The championship has always been played on a regional basis, whereby the respective champions from the Mid, North, South and West championships contest the county series of games. However, in recent years, the championship has followed the same system as the senior grade in Tipperary. Currently (2018) there are 21 teams in the county championship divided up into 6 groups (3 groups with 4 teams, 3 groups with 3 teams). The top 2 teams of each group qualify for the knock out phase of the championship along with the 4 divisional winners. It is quite common for clubs to progress from their group and also win their respective divisional championship.\n\nThe Tipperary County Championship is an integral part of the wider [[Munster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship|Munster GAA Intermediate Club Hurling Championship]]. The winners of the Tipperary county final join the champions of the other hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.\n\nThe title has been won at least once by 31 different clubs.\n\n[[St Mary's Clonmel]] are the current (2017) title-holders, having beaten [[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]] in the final.\n\n==Roll of honour==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" |\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Team'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winner'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winning Years'''\n!Runners Up\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1\n| [[Newport GAA|Newport]]\n| 3\n| 1989, 2002, 2016\n|2000,\n2008\n|-\n| [[Silvermines GAA|Silvermines]]\n| 3\n| 1972, 1999, 2012<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|title=Redemption for Silvermines as Ballina lament poor start champions|date=20 October 2012|publisher=The Nationalist|accessdate=22 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130619220137/http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|archivedate=19 June 2013}}</ref>\n|1987,\n1994\n|-\n|\n| [[Moyne-Templetuohy GAA|Moyne-Templetuohy]]\n| 2\n| 1983, 2014\n|2001,\n2004,\n\n2013\n|-\n|\n|[[Burgess GAA|Burgess]]\n| 2\n| 1993, 2005\n|1992,\n2003\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2\n|[[Templederry Kenyons GAA|Templederry Kenyons]]\n| 2\n| 2000, 2008\n|1999\n|-\n|[[Borrisokane GAA|Borrisokane]]\n| 2\n| 1982, 2010\n|\n|-\n| [[\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty GAA|\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty]]\n| 2\n| 1994, 2006\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"26\" |3\n|[[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|1\n|2018\n|1989,\n\n2014,\n\n2015,\n\n2016\n|-\n| [[Kildangan GAA (Tipperary)|Kildangan]]\n| 1\n| 2004\n|1980,\n2002,\n\n2019\n|-\n|[[Arravale Rovers GAA|Arravale Rovers]]\n| 1\n| 1997\n|1988,\n1991,\n\n2009\n|-\n|[[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]]\n| 1\n| 1988\n|2010,\n2011,\n\n2017\n|-\n|[[J.K.

The library was opened on February 1, 1910, at West 7th Street and South Louisiana Street in downtown Little Rock.\n\n[[Adolphine Fletcher Terry]] was an early proponent of public libraries in Central Arkansas. Her advocacy led to her being Trustee at what was then-known as the Little Rock Public Library from 1925-1965. In the Library Commission's 1975-77 Biennial Report she wrote, \"if you want to start something new, don't hesitate. If you have the proper tools to work with, good; if you have nothing but a forked stick, go ahead anyway.

Mercedes was founded September 15, 1907, by the American Rio Grande Land & Irrigation Company, and was incorporated March 8, 1909. It is one of the oldest towns in the [[Rio Grande Valley]], and the city celebrated its centennial in 2007.\n\nThe city was located in Capisallo Pasture, part of Capisallo Ranch owned by Jim Welles. This location was known as the Pear Orchard because of the vast numbers of [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] cactus growing there at that time.\n\nSome sources{{who|date=January 2012}} state that the original name given to the city was \"Diaz\" in honor of [[Porfirio Diaz]], then president of Mexico. Later it was supposedly renamed \"Mercedes Diaz\" in honor of the president's wife, and from that, Mercedes became the Queen City. This story, however, is historically inaccurate, given that neither of Diaz's two wives were named Mercedes.\n\nGeneral [[Zachary Taylor]]'s headquarters was to the southeast of Mercedes near the [[Rio Grande]]. There the old Rabb Ranch was famous for its stagecoach stop and landing for the riverboats carrying supplies to the settlements and military installations.\n\nThe old Toluca Ranch still stands east of the International Bridge at [[Progreso, Texas|Progreso]], the sister city to the south. This ranch was close to the river and a prized target for the [[banditry|''bandidos'']] during the days of [[Pancho Villa]]. It was built with many secret rooms and passages, and had heavy wooden shutters on the windows to protect its residents.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 1209\n|1920= 3414\n|1930= 6608\n|1940= 7624\n|1950= 10081\n|1960= 10943\n|1970= 9355\n|1980= 11851\n|1990= 12694\n|2000= 13649\n|2010= 15570\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=16761\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/search-results.html?searchType=web&cssp=SERP&q=Mercedes%20city,%20TX|title=Mercedes city, Texas|work=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAt the 2000 [[census]],<ref name=\"GR2\" /> there were 13,649 people, 4,170 households and 3,348 families residing in the city.

Mercedes was founded September 15, 1907, by the American Rio Grande Land & Irrigation Company, and was incorporated March 8, 1909. It is one of the oldest towns in the [[Rio Grande Valley]], and the city celebrated its centennial in 2007.\n\nThe city was located in Capisallo Pasture, part of Capisallo Ranch owned by Jim Welles. This location was known as the Pear Orchard because of the vast numbers of [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] cactus growing there at that time.\n\nSome sources{{who|date=January 2012}} state that the original name given to the city was \"Diaz\" in honor of [[Porfirio Diaz]], then president of Mexico. Later it was supposedly renamed \"Mercedes Diaz\" in honor of the president's wife, and from that, Mercedes became the Queen City. This story, however, is historically inaccurate, given that neither of Diaz's two wives were named Mercedes.\n\nGeneral [[Zachary Taylor]]'s headquarters was to the southeast of Mercedes near the [[Rio Grande]]. There the old Rabb Ranch was famous for its stagecoach stop and landing for the riverboats carrying supplies to the settlements and military installations.\n\nThe old Toluca Ranch still stands east of the International Bridge at [[Progreso, Texas|Progreso]], the sister city to the south. This ranch was close to the river and a prized target for the [[banditry|''bandidos'']] during the days of [[Pancho Villa]]. It was built with many secret rooms and passages, and had heavy wooden shutters on the windows to protect its residents.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 1209\n|1920= 3414\n|1930= 6608\n|1940= 7624\n|1950= 10081\n|1960= 10943\n|1970= 9355\n|1980= 11851\n|1990= 12694\n|2000= 13649\n|2010= 15570\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=16761\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/search-results.html?searchType=web&cssp=SERP&q=Mercedes%20city,%20TX|title=Mercedes city, Texas|work=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=July 24, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAt the 2000 [[census]],<ref name=\"GR2\" /> there were 13,649 people, 4,170 households and 3,348 families residing in the city.

It is located mainly within the [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]], with a small part in the [[London Borough of Merton]], and is {{convert|9.4|mi|km|1}} from [[Charing Cross]].\n\nNew Malden forms part of the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Surrey]]. Neighbouring localities include [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Raynes Park]], [[Surbiton]], [[Tolworth]], [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] and [[Worcester Park]].\n\n==History==\nNew Malden was established entirely as a result of the arrival of the railway, when what is now called [[New Malden railway station]] was opened on 1 December 1846 on the main line from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]]. \n\nBuilding started slowly in the area just to the north of the station, gathering pace in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with two- and three-bedroom [[terrace (architecture)|terraced house]]s. Further out towards [[Coombe, Kingston upon Thames|Coombe Hill]] are larger [[detached]] and [[semi-detached]] houses from the 1930s. The name of the road which leads up the hill to Coombe, Traps Lane, is thought to derive from a farm owned by a Mrs Trap.

Jnana Prabodhini (JP) has now grown into a movement for motivating intelligence towards social change.\n\n== Foundation ==\n=== Inspiration ===\nThe founder of Jnana Prabodhini, late Shri V.V. alias Appa Pendse was an educationist, social organizer, patriot and an active ideologue. In 1962, he envisioned an organization for putting into practice the thoughts of Swami Vivekanand\u2014his inspiration\u2014of changing the face of India, through man-making education. Traditionally, this effort follows the concept of 'Dharm-Sansthapana,' i.e., societal resurgence and reconstruction, a cyclic phenomenon propelled by ancient heroes and saints. Centuries ago, this was advocated by [[Samarth Ramdas]] and reiterated in the recent past by [[Dayananda Saraswati|Maharshi Dayanand]], [[Swami Vivekananda]], and [[Sri Aurobindo|Yogi Arvinda]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Vision ===\n[[File:Dr. V. V. (Appa) pendse.gif|thumb|Dr. V. V. (Appa) Pendse, the founder of Jnana Prabodhini]]A complete metamorphosis of our ancient society into a vibrant Nation, with spirituality at its core and manifestation of excellence and modernity into an outwardly diverse yet internally integrated human life, is the vision of Jnana Prabodhini. A new integration has been envisaged for this. Combining spirituality with modern technology; human potentials like intelligence and giftedness are to be harnessed into leadership abilities and social concern. It is believed that while triggering one's achievement motivation, it could be possible to submerge its outcome into the service of humanity with compassion. This also matches with the concept of 'Trusteeship' propounded by Mahatma Gandhi.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Mission ===\nKnitting an organization of selfless workers, leading directly and in-directly the social movements to transform their respective working fields is the mission of Jnana Prabodhini. This needs a continuum in education and training processes, both for boys and girls, men and women of all age groups; from pre-schooling to real life situations. That requires building a multi-dimensional institution with an experimental character in leadership development in all walks of life. This is not a one-time process, but continuous experimentation is required to evolve processes and methods of encouraging people of all age groups to undertake tasks and challenges in various work fields of life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Fields of work ==\nThe key work area of Jnana Prabodhini is [[leadership development]]. To date, this work is carried out in seven sectors: Education, Research, Health, Rural development, Stree Shakti Prabodhan (Women Empowerment), National Integration, and Youth Organization.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA psychologist by profession, Shri Appa Pendse had studied styles of leadership for his doctoral thesis. It had given him the confidence that, if a congenial atmosphere exists or is created, the motivation for changing the society gets triggered, more precious so, in the intellectually gifted students. They become even-minded, balanced and dedicated workers who can competently fight any contingency and bring about a desirable change in many walks of life. He was aware, and the same was empirically proved later, that 'intelligence' is present in all socio-economic strata.\n\nHe knew that the conventional concept of intelligence quotient (IQ) was fading and an in-depth model was required to give a profile of everybody's intelligence. There could be as many as 120 facets of intelligence. How to identify these facets in the impressionable age and harness their development through education, training, and later in real-life situations has been a great challenge. This gave rise initially to a unique institution conducting supplementary enrichment programs for brilliant students at the high school level. Over 50 years, it has emerged into a well-spread and multi-dimensional organization conducting experiments in motivation building and attitude formation, in work fields with a view to providing a conducive environment for leadership development, required to bring about the desired social change in India.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Geographical coverage ==\nThe headquarters of Jnana Prabodhini is in Pune (Maharashtra). It has three full-fledged centres in the state: at Nigdi (Dist. Pune), Solapur (Dist. Solapur) and Harali (Dist. Osmanabad); four sub-centres at Khed-Shivapur, Velhe, Salumbre (Dist.

Jnana Prabodhini (JP) has now grown into a movement for motivating intelligence towards social change.\n\n== Foundation ==\n=== Inspiration ===\nThe founder of Jnana Prabodhini, late Shri V.V. alias Appa Pendse was an educationist, social organizer, patriot and an active ideologue. In 1962, he envisioned an organization for putting into practice the thoughts of Swami Vivekanand\u2014his inspiration\u2014of changing the face of India, through man-making education. Traditionally, this effort follows the concept of 'Dharm-Sansthapana,' i.e., societal resurgence and reconstruction, a cyclic phenomenon propelled by ancient heroes and saints. Centuries ago, this was advocated by [[Samarth Ramdas]] and reiterated in the recent past by [[Dayananda Saraswati|Maharshi Dayanand]], [[Swami Vivekananda]], and [[Sri Aurobindo|Yogi Arvinda]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Vision ===\n[[File:Dr. V. V. (Appa) pendse.gif|thumb|Dr. V. V. (Appa) Pendse, the founder of Jnana Prabodhini]]A complete metamorphosis of our ancient society into a vibrant Nation, with spirituality at its core and manifestation of excellence and modernity into an outwardly diverse yet internally integrated human life, is the vision of Jnana Prabodhini. A new integration has been envisaged for this. Combining spirituality with modern technology; human potentials like intelligence and giftedness are to be harnessed into leadership abilities and social concern. It is believed that while triggering one's achievement motivation, it could be possible to submerge its outcome into the service of humanity with compassion. This also matches with the concept of 'Trusteeship' propounded by Mahatma Gandhi.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Mission ===\nKnitting an organization of selfless workers, leading directly and in-directly the social movements to transform their respective working fields is the mission of Jnana Prabodhini. This needs a continuum in education and training processes, both for boys and girls, men and women of all age groups; from pre-schooling to real life situations. That requires building a multi-dimensional institution with an experimental character in leadership development in all walks of life. This is not a one-time process, but continuous experimentation is required to evolve processes and methods of encouraging people of all age groups to undertake tasks and challenges in various work fields of life.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Fields of work ==\nThe key work area of Jnana Prabodhini is [[leadership development]]. To date, this work is carried out in seven sectors: Education, Research, Health, Rural development, Stree Shakti Prabodhan (Women Empowerment), National Integration, and Youth Organization.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA psychologist by profession, Shri Appa Pendse had studied styles of leadership for his doctoral thesis. It had given him the confidence that, if a congenial atmosphere exists or is created, the motivation for changing the society gets triggered, more precious so, in the intellectually gifted students. They become even-minded, balanced and dedicated workers who can competently fight any contingency and bring about a desirable change in many walks of life. He was aware, and the same was empirically proved later, that 'intelligence' is present in all socio-economic strata.\n\nHe knew that the conventional concept of intelligence quotient (IQ) was fading and an in-depth model was required to give a profile of everybody's intelligence. There could be as many as 120 facets of intelligence. How to identify these facets in the impressionable age and harness their development through education, training, and later in real-life situations has been a great challenge. This gave rise initially to a unique institution conducting supplementary enrichment programs for brilliant students at the high school level. Over 50 years, it has emerged into a well-spread and multi-dimensional organization conducting experiments in motivation building and attitude formation, in work fields with a view to providing a conducive environment for leadership development, required to bring about the desired social change in India.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Geographical coverage ==\nThe headquarters of Jnana Prabodhini is in Pune (Maharashtra).

Its late war designation was ''Panzerkampfwagen&nbsp;VI&nbsp;Tiger&nbsp;Ausf. E''. The early war variant was designated ''Panzerkampfwagen&nbsp;VI&nbsp;Tiger&nbsp;Ausf. H1''. Often times, people refer to both of the variants as ''Tiger''. The Tiger I gave the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]] its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the [[8.8 cm KwK 36]] gun (derived from the [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|8.8 cm Flak 36]]). 1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trewhitt|first1=Philip A.|title=Armored Fighting Vehicles|date=1999|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=0760712603|pages=26}}</ref> After August 1944, production of the Tiger I was phased out in favour of the [[Tiger II]].\n\nWhile the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time,{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=9}} it has also been called [[Overengineering|over-engineered]],{{sfn|Tucker-Jones|2012|p=7}} using expensive materials and labour-intensive production methods. The Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and breakdowns, and was limited in range by its high fuel consumption. It was expensive to maintain, but generally mechanically reliable.<ref name=Drabkin-2006-43>[[#Reference-Drabkin|Drabkin & Sheremet 2006:43]]</ref> It was difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilisation when mud, ice, and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved ''Schachtellaufwerk''-pattern road wheels, often jamming them solid. This was a problem on the Eastern Front in the muddy ''[[rasputitsa]]'' season and during periods of extreme cold.{{Citation needed|date = April 2017}}\n\nThe tank was given its nickname \"Tiger\" by [[Ferdinand Porsche]], and the [[Roman numeral]] was added after the later Tiger II entered production. The initial designation was ''Panzerkampfwagen&nbsp;VI&nbsp;Ausf\u00fchrung&nbsp;H'' (literally 'Armored Combat Wagon/Vehicle ''VI&nbsp;version&nbsp;H''{{'}}, abbreviated ''PzKpfw&nbsp;VI&nbsp;Ausf.&nbsp;H'') where 'H' denoted [[Henschel & Sohn|Henschel]] as the designer/manufacturer. It was classified with [[Sonderkraftfahrzeug|ordnance inventory designation]] ''[[Sonderkraftfahrzeug|Sd.Kfz.]]&nbsp;182''. The tank was later re-designated as ''PzKpfw VI Ausf. E'' in March 1943, with ordnance inventory designation ''Sd.Kfz.&nbsp;181''.\n\nToday, only seven Tiger I tanks survive in museums and private collections worldwide. {{as of | 2020}} [[Tiger 131]] (captured during the North Africa Campaign) at the UK's [[Bovington Tank Museum|Tank Museum]] is the only example restored to running order.\n\n==Design history==\n===Earlier designs===\nHenschel & Sohn began the development of a large tank design in January 1937 when the ''[[Waffenamt]]'' requested Henschel to develop a ''Durchbruchwagen'' (\"breakthrough vehicle\") in the 30\u201333 tonne range.<ref>White, B. T. ''German Tanks and Armoured Vehicles, 1914\u20131945''. p. 69-70</ref> Only one prototype hull was ever built and it was never fitted with a turret. The ''Durchbruchwagen'' I's general shape and suspension resembled the [[Panzer III]], while the turret resembled the early Panzer IV C turret with the short-barrelled 7.5&nbsp;cm L/24 cannon.\n\nBefore ''Durchbruchwagen'' I was completed, a request was issued for a heavier 30-tonne class vehicle with thicker armour; this was the ''Durchbruchwagen'' II, which would have had 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in) of frontal armour and mounted a [[Panzer IV]] turret with a short-barrelled [[7.5 cm KwK 37|7.5&nbsp;cm L/24 gun]]. Overall weight would have been 36&nbsp;tonnes. Only one hull was built and no turret was fitted. Further development of the ''Durchbruchwagen'' was dropped in 1938 in favour of the larger and better-armoured [[VK 30.01 (H)]] and [[VK 36.01 (H)]] designs.{{efn|''VK'' from the German ''Voll Ketten'' meaning \"fully tracked\"; ''H'' for Henschel}} Both the ''Durchbruchwagen'' I and II prototype hulls were used as test vehicles until 1941.\n\n===Another attempt===\nThe VK 30.01 (H) medium tank and the VK 36.01 (H) heavy tank designs pioneered the use of the complex ''Schachtellaufwerk'' track suspension system of [[torsion bar]]-sprung, overlapped and interleaved main road wheels for tank use. This concept was already common on German half-tracks such as the [[Sd.Kfz. 7]]. The VK 30.01 (H) was intended to mount a low-velocity 7.5&nbsp;cm L/24 infantry support gun, a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/40 dual purpose anti-tank gun, or a 10.5&nbsp;cm L/28 field gun in a [[Krupp]] turret. Overall weight was to be 33 tonnes. The armour was designed to be 50&nbsp;mm on frontal surfaces and 30&nbsp;mm on the side surfaces. Four prototype hulls were completed for testing. Two of these were later modified to build the \"[[Sturer Emil]]\" (12.8&nbsp;cm ''Selbstfahrlafette'' L/61) self-propelled anti-tank gun.\n\nThe VK 36.01 (H) was intended to weigh 40 tonnes, with 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;in) of armour on front surfaces, 80&nbsp;mm on turret sides and 60&nbsp;mm on the hull sides. The VK 36.01 (H) was intended to carry a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/24, or a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/43, or a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/70, or a 12.8&nbsp;cm L/28 cannon in a Krupp turret that looked similar to an enlarged Panzer IV Ausf. C turret. The hull for one prototype was built, followed later by five more. The six turrets built were never fitted and were used as part of the [[Atlantic Wall]]. The VK 36.01 (H) project was discontinued in early 1942 in favour of the VK 45.01 project.\n\n===Further improvements===\nCombat experience against the French [[SOMUA S35]] [[cavalry tank]] and [[Char B1]] heavy tank, and the British [[Matilda II]] [[infantry tank]]s during the [[Battle of France]] in June 1940 showed that the German Army needed better armed and armoured tanks.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nOn 26 May 1941, Henschel and Ferdinand Porsche were asked to submit designs for a 45-tonne heavy tank, to be ready by June 1942.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=13}} Porsche worked on an updated version of their VK 30.01 (P) Leopard tank prototype while Henschel worked on an improved VK 36.01 (H) tank. Henschel built two prototypes: a VK 45.01 (H) H1 with an 8.8&nbsp;cm L/56 cannon, and a VK 45.01 (H) H2 with a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/70 cannon.\n\n===Final designs===\nOn 22 June 1941, Germany launched [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. The Germans were shocked to encounter Soviet [[T-34]] medium and [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tanks, and,{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=14}} according to Henschel designer [[Erwin Aders]]: \"There was great consternation when it was discovered that the Soviet tanks were superior to anything available to the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Heer]].\".{{sfn|Carruthers|2013|loc=chapt. \"Design features\"}}\n\nWeight increase to 45&nbsp;tonnes and an increase in gun calibre to 8.8&nbsp;cm was ordered. The due date for the new prototypes was set for 20 April 1942, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s 53rd birthday. Unlike the [[Panther tank]], the designs did not incorporate [[sloped armour]], an innovation taken from the T-34.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tiger Tank Diagram.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Schematic layout of Tiger H1]] -->\n[[File:VK 4501 Model.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Model reconstruction of [[VK 4501 (P)]] Porsche prototype]]\nPorsche and Henschel submitted prototype designs, each making use of the Krupp-designed turret. They were demonstrated at [[Rastenburg]] in front of Hitler. The Henschel design was accepted, mainly because the Porsche [[VK 4501 (P)]] prototype design used a troubled gasoline-electric hybrid power unit which needed large quantities of [[copper]] for manufacture of its electrical drivetrain components, a strategic war material of which Germany had limited supplies with acceptable electrical properties for such uses.{{sfn|Jentz|Doyle|1993|p=6}} Production of the ''Panzerkampfwagen'' VI ''Ausf.'' H began in August 1942. Expecting an order for his tank, Porsche built 100 chassis. After the contract was awarded to Henschel, they were used for a new turretless, [[casemate]]-style [[tank destroyer]]; 91 hulls were converted into the [[Elefant|''Panzerj\u00e4ger'' Tiger (P)]] in early 1943.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-278-0873-24, Russland, Panzersoldat (Oberleutnant Knauth -).jpg|thumb|upright|Early tiger with tall cupola]]\nThe Tiger was still at the prototype stage when it was first hurried into service, and therefore changes both large and small were made throughout the production run. A redesigned turret with a lower cupola was the most significant change. To cut costs, the submersion capability and an external air-filtration system were dropped.\n\n==Design==\nThe Tiger differed from earlier [[Tanks in the German Army|German tanks]] principally in its design philosophy. Its predecessors balanced mobility, [[Vehicle armour|armour]] and [[firepower]], and were sometimes outgunned by their opponents.\n\nWhile heavy, this tank was not slower than the best of its opponents. However, at over 50 tonnes dead weight, the suspension, gearboxes, and other such items had clearly reached their design limits and breakdowns were frequent if regular maintenance was not undertaken.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAlthough the general design and layout were broadly similar to the previous medium tank, the [[Panzer IV]], the Tiger weighed more than twice as much. This was due to its substantially thicker armour, the larger [[Tank gun|main gun]], greater volume of fuel and ammunition storage, larger engine, and a more solidly built transmission and suspension.\n\n===Armour===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-299-1805-10, Nordfrankreich, Panzer VI (Tiger I).jpg|thumb|left|The Tiger I's [[Vehicle armour|armour]] was up to 120&nbsp;mm on the [[gun mantlet]].<!--- This tank is assigned to the [[SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 101|''schwere SS-Panzer-Abteilung'' 101]] operating in northern France in 1944.-->]]\n\nThe Tiger I had frontal hull armour {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick, frontal [[Gun turret|turret]] armour of {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[gun mantlet]].<ref name=\"id3486.securedata.net\">{{cite web|author=Fabio Prado |url=http://id3486.securedata.net/fprado/armorsite/tiger1.htm |title=Pzkpfw Vi Tiger I |publisher=Armorsite |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> The Tiger had {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} thick hull side plates and 80&nbsp;mm armour on the side superstructure/sponsons, while turret sides and rear were 80&nbsp;mm.

The armour joints were of high quality, being stepped and welded rather than riveted and were made of [[maraging steel]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Gun===\n[[File:Turmzielfernrohr 9c.jpg|thumb|''Turmzielfernrohr'' TZF 9c gun sight]]\n{{main|8.8 cm KwK 36}}\nThe 56-calibre long 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 36 was chosen for the Tiger. A combination of a flat trajectory from the high muzzle velocity and precision from Leitz ''Turmzielfernrohr'' TZF 9b sight (later replaced by the [[monocular]] TZF 9c) made it very accurate. In British wartime firing trials, five successive hits were scored on a {{convert|410|by|460|mm|abbr=on}} target at a range of {{convert|1100|m}}.{{sfn|Carruthers|2013|loc=chapt. Design features}} Compared with the other contemporary German tank guns, the 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 36 had superior penetration to the [[7.5 cm KwK 40]] on the [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]] and [[Panzer IV]] but inferior to the [[7.5 cm KwK 42]] on the [[Panther tank]]{{sfn|Bird|Livingston|2001|p=61}} under ranges of 2,500 metres. At greater ranges, the 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 36 was superior in penetration and accuracy.\n<!----[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J14931, Bei Belgorod, Panzer VI (Tiger I), Aufmunitionieren.jpg|thumb|Loading ammunition]]-->\n\nThe ammunition for the Tiger had electrically fired primers. Four types of ammunition were available but not all were fully available; the PzGr 40 shell used tungsten, which was in short supply as the war progressed.\n\n*''PzGr.'' 39 ([[armour-piercing, capped, ballistic cap]])\n*''PzGr.'' 40 ([[armour-piercing, composite rigid]])\n*''Hl.

The Germans had not developed an adequate diesel engine, so a petrol (gasoline) powerplant had to be used instead. The original engine utilised was a 21.35-litre (1303 cu.in.) 12-cylinder [[Maybach]] [[List of WWII Maybach engines|HL210 P45]] developing 485&nbsp;kW (650&nbsp;hp) at 3,000&nbsp;rpm. Although a good engine, it was underpowered for the vehicle. From the 251st Tiger onwards, it was replaced by the upgraded [[Maybach HL230|HL 230]] P45, a 23.095 litre (1409 cu.in.) engine developing 521&nbsp;kW (700&nbsp;hp) at 3,000&nbsp;rpm.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=41}} The main difference between these engines was that the original Maybach HL 210 used an aluminium engine block while the Maybach HL 230 used a cast-iron engine block. The cast-iron block allowed for larger cylinders (and thus, greater displacement) which increased the power output to 521&nbsp;kW (700&nbsp;hp). The engine was in V-form, with two cylinder banks set at 60 degrees. An [[Aircraft engine starting#Inertia starter|inertia starter]] was mounted on its right side, driven via chain gears through a port in the rear wall. The engine could be lifted out through a hatch on the rear hull roof. In comparison to other V12 and various vee-form gasoline engines used for tanks, the eventual HL 230 engine was nearly four litres smaller in displacement than the Allied British [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] V12 AFV powerplant, itself adapted from the RR Merlin but de-rated to 448&nbsp;kW (600&nbsp;hp) power output; and the American Ford-designed precursor V12 to its [[Ford GAA engine|Ford GAA]] V-8 AFV engine of 18 litre displacement, which in its original V12 form would have had the same 27 litre displacement as the Meteor.\n\nThe engine drove the front sprockets through a drivetrain connecting to a transmission in the front portion of the lower hull; the front sprockets had to be mounted relatively low as a result. The Krupp-designed 11-tonne turret had a hydraulic motor whose pump was powered by mechanical drive from the engine. A full rotation took about a minute.\n\nAnother new feature was the Maybach-Olvar [[hydraulic machinery|hydraulically controlled]] semi-automatic [[pre-selector gearbox]]. The extreme weight of the tank also required a new steering system. Germany's [[Argus Motoren]], where Hermann Klaue had invented a [[ring brake]]<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US2323052 Disk brake for use in motor cars, airplanes, and the like] US Patent 2323052 A</ref> in 1940, supplied them for the [[Arado Ar 96]]<ref>[http://www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de/Waffen/Ar96.htm Arado Ar 96], ''Lexikon der Wehrmacht''.</ref> and also supplied the 55&nbsp;cm disc.<ref>[http://www.alanhamby.com/transmission.shtml Transmission & Steering], Tiger I Information Center.</ref> Klaue acknowledged in the patent application that he had merely improved on existing technology, that can be traced back to British designs dating to 1904. It is unclear whether Klaue's patent ring brake was utilised in the Tiger brake design.\n\nThe clutch-and-brake system, typical for lighter vehicles, was retained only for emergencies. Normally, steering depended on a double [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], Henschel's development of the British [[David Brown Ltd.|Merritt-Brown]] system{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=44}} first encountered in the [[Churchill tank]]. The vehicle had an eight-speed gearbox, and the steering offered two fixed radii of turns on each gear, thus the Tiger had sixteen different radii of turn. In first gear, at a speed of a few km/h, the minimal turning radius was {{convert|3.44|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. In neutral gear, the tracks could be turned in opposite directions, so the Tiger I pivoted in place.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=46}} There was a steering wheel instead of either a tiller \u2014 or, as most tanks had at that time, twin braking levers \u2014 making the Tiger I's steering system easy to use, and ahead of its time.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=44}}\n\n===Suspension===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3965-28, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|left|Clear view of the Tiger I's ''Schachtellaufwerk'' overlapping and interleaved road wheels during production]]\nThe suspension used sixteen [[torsion bar]]s, with eight suspension arms per side. To save space, the swing arms were leading on one side and trailing on the other. There were three road wheels (one of them double, closest to the track's centre) on each arm, in a so-called ''Schachtellaufwerk'' overlapping and interleaved arrangement, similar to that pioneered on German half-tracked military vehicles of the pre-World War II era, with the Tiger I being the first all-tracked German AFV built in quantity to use such a road wheel arrangement. The wheels had a diameter of {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}} in the ''Schachtellaufwerk'' arrangement for the Tiger I's suspension, providing a high uniform distribution of the load onto the track, at the cost of increased maintenance. \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-310-0899-15, Italien, Panzer VI (Tiger I), Reparatur.jpg|thumb|Wheel and track maintenance in muddy conditions]]\n\nRemoving an inner wheel that had lost its solid rubber tire (a common occurrence) required the removal of up to nine other wheels first. During the rainy period that brought on the autumn ''[[rasputitsa]]'' mud season and onwards into the winter conditions on the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern front]], the roadwheels of a ''Schachtellaufwerk''-equipped vehicle could also become packed with mud or snow that could then freeze. Presumably, German engineers, based on the experience of the half tracks, felt that the improvement in off-road performance, track and wheel life, mobility with wheels missing or damaged, plus additional protection from enemy fire was worth the maintenance difficulties of a complex system vulnerable to mud and ice. This approach was carried on, in various forms, to the Panther and the non-interleaved wheel design for the Tiger II.

Forward was an open crew compartment, with the driver and radio-operator seated at the front on either side of the gearbox.

Three men were seated in the turret; the loader to the right of the gun facing to the rear, the gunner to the left of the gun, and the commander behind him. There was also a folding seat on the right for the loader. The turret had a full circular floor and 157&nbsp;cm headroom.

This was achieved for the loss of 1,725 Tigers (including large numbers of operational and strategic losses, i.e abandoned, broken down, etc).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Askey |first1=Nigel |title=Operation Barbarossa : the complete organisational and statistical analysis, and military simulation |publisher=IngramSparks Publishing |isbn=9780648221920 |pages=103}}</ref>\n\n==Production history==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3965-05, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>Installing the turret</center>]]\nProduction of the Tiger I began in August 1942 at the factory of [[Henschel & Son|Henschel und Sohn]] in [[Kassel]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanhamby.com/factory1.shtml|title=The Henschel Tiger Factory|website=alanbamby.com|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}</ref> initially at a rate of 25 per month and peaking in April 1944 at 104 per month. An official document of the time stated that the first Tiger I was completed in August 4. 1,355 had been built by August 1944, when production ceased. Deployed Tiger I's peaked at 671 on 1 July 1944.{{sfn|Jentz|Doyle|1993|p=13}} It took about twice as long to build a Tiger I as another German tank of the period. When the improved Tiger II began production in January 1944, the Tiger I was soon phased out.\n\nIn 1943, Japan bought several specimens of German tank designs for study. A single Tiger I was apparently purchased, along with a Panther and two Panzer IIIs, but only the Panzer IIIs were actually delivered.{{sfn|Zaloga|2007|p=17}} The undelivered Tiger was loaned to the German Wehrmacht by the Japanese government.\n\nMany modifications were introduced during the production run to improve automotive performance, firepower and protection. Simplification of the design was implemented, along with cuts due to raw material shortages. In 1942 alone, at least six revisions were made, starting with the removal of the ''Vorpanzer'' (frontal armour shield) from the pre-production models in April. In May, mudguards bolted onto the side of the pre-production run were added, while removable mudguards saw full incorporation in September. Smoke discharge canisters, three on each side of the turret, were added in August 1942. In later years, similar changes and updates were added, such as the addition of [[Zimmerit]] (a non-magnetic anti-mine coating), in late 1943.<ref>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-vi-tiger-ausf-e-sd-kfz-181.htm Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf.

The resistance group around the later executed priest [[Heinrich Maier]] sent corresponding documents to the American Office of Strategic Services. With the location sketches of the manufacturing facilities, the Allied bombers were given precise air strikes.<ref>Peter Broucek \"Die \u00f6sterreichische Identit\u00e4t im Widerstand 1938\u20131945\" (2008), p 163.</ref><ref>Peter Pirker \"Suberversion deutscher Herrschaft.

It is often misidentified as a ''BergeTiger'' recovery vehicle. As many as three may have been built. It carried a demolition charge on a small crane on the turret in place of the main gun. It was to move up to a minefield and drop the charge, back away, and then set the charge off to clear the minefield. There is no verification of any being used in combat.\n\nAnother variant was the [[Fahrschulpanzer]] VI Tiger tanks (driving school Tiger tanks). These tanks were Tigers with modified engines to run on either compressed [[Towngas]] gas (Stadtgas System) or [[wood gas]] (Holzgas System). This was due to shortages in fuel supply. They used a mixture of turreted and turretless hulls. They were used to train Tiger tank crews. They were not used in combat.\n\n==Designations==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3965-34, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|Tigers under construction.

The tank was also immune to Soviet [[anti-tank rifle]] fire to the sides and rear. Its large calibre 8.8&nbsp;cm provided superior fragmentation and high explosive content over the [[7.5 cm KwK 42]] gun. Therefore, comparing the Tiger with the Panther, for supporting the infantry and destroying fortifications, the Tiger offered superior firepower. It was also key to dealing with towed anti-tank guns, according to German tank commander [[Otto Carius]]:\n\n{{quotation| The destruction of an antitank gun was often accepted as nothing special by lay people and soldiers from other branches. Only the destruction of other tanks counted as a success. On the other hand, antitank guns counted twice as much to the experienced tanker. They were much more dangerous to us. The antitank cannon waited in ambush, well camouflaged, and magnificently set up in the terrain. Because of that, it was very difficult to identify. It was also very difficult to hit because of its low height. Usually, we didn't make out the antitank guns until they had fired the first shot. We were often hit right away, if the antitank crew was on top of things, because we had run into a wall of antitank guns. It was then advisable to keep as cool as possible and take care of the enemy, before the second aimed shot was fired. |author=Otto Carius (translated by Robert J.

For this reason, the Tiger was built with water tight hatches and a [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] device that allowed it to [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] water obstacles four metres deep. The tank's weight also made driving through buildings risky, as the presence of a cellar could result in a sudden drop. Another weakness was the slow traverse of the hydraulically operated turret. Due to reliability problems with the Maybach HL 210 TRM P45, which was delivered within the first production batch of 250 Tigers, performance for its maximum power output at high gear ratio could not be fulfilled.<ref name=\"alanhamby.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alanhamby.com/maybach.shtml|title=The Maybach Engine|work=The Tiger I Information Center}}</ref> Though the Maybach engines had a maximum of 3,000 rpm, crews were told in the ''[[Tigerfibel]]'' not to exceed 2,600 rpm. The engine limitation was alleviated only by the adoption of the Maybach HL 230.<ref name=\"alanhamby.com\"/> A British Army test report showed that the turret on the Tiger E tank turned 360 degrees, at 19\u00ba/second, with its power traverse system set at high ratio and with the engine speed at 2,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=86}} The turret could also be traversed manually, but this option was rarely used, except for very small adjustments.{{sfn|Carruthers|2013}}\n\nEarly Tigers had a top speed of about {{convert|45|km/h|mph}} over optimal terrain. This was not recommended for normal operation, and was discouraged in training. An engine governor was subsequently installed, capping the engine at 2,600 rpm and the Tiger's maximum speed to about {{convert|38|km/h|mph}}. Tiger crews report that typical march speed off-road was 10 kilometers per hour (6&nbsp;mph).<ref>Lochmann and Rubbel p 22</ref> However, medium tanks of the time, such as the Sherman or T-34, had on average a top speed of about {{convert|45|km/h|mph}}. Thus, despite the Tiger being nearly twice as heavy, its speed was comparatively respectable.{{sfn|Carruthers|2013}} With the tank's very wide tracks, a design feature borrowed from the Soviet T-34, the Tiger had a lower ground pressure than many smaller tanks, such as the M4 Sherman.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-022-2926-11A, Russland, Abschleppen eines Tiger I.jpg|thumb|Tiger I towed by two [[Sd.Kfz. 9]]]]\nTiger I tanks needed a high degree of support. It required two or sometimes three of the standard German [[Sd.Kfz. 9|Sd.Kfz. 9 ''Famo'']] heavy recovery half-track tractors to tow it. Tiger crews often resorted to using another Tiger to tow the damaged vehicle, but this was not recommended as it often caused overheating and engine breakdown. The low-mounted sprocket limited the obstacle clearance height. The tracks also had a tendency to override the rear sprocket, resulting in immobilisation. If a track overrode and jammed, two Tigers were normally needed to tow the tank. The jammed track was also a big problem itself, since due to high tension, it was often impossible to split the track by removing the track pins. The track sometimes had to be blown apart with a small explosive charge.\n\nThe average reliability of the Tiger tank in the second half of 1943 was similar to that of the [[Panther tank|Panther]], 36%, compared to the 48% of the [[Panzer IV]] and the 65% of the [[StuG III]].{{sfn|Zaloga|2015|p=202}} From May 1944 to March 1945, the reliability of the Tiger tank was as good as the Panzer IV. With an average of 70%, the Tiger's operational availability on the Western Front, was better than compared to 62% of Panthers. On the Eastern Front, 65% of Tigers were operationally available, compared to the 71% of Panzer IVs and 65% of Panthers.{{sfn|Fletcher|2011|p=139}}{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=202,230}}\n\n===Tactical organization===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-022-2935-18A, Russland, getarnter Panzer VI \"Tiger I\".jpg|thumb|right|A Tiger I camouflaged in a static defensive position]]\n\nTigers were usually employed in separate [[German Heavy Panzer Detachment|heavy tank battalions]] (''schwere Panzer-Abteilung'') under army command. These battalions would be deployed to critical sectors, either for breakthrough operations or, more typically, counter-attacks. A few favoured divisions, such as the ''[[Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division|Grossdeutschland]]'', and the [[Leibstandarte|1st SS ''Leibstandarte'' Adolf Hitler]], [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd SS ''Das Reich'']], and [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|3rd SS ''Totenkopf'' Panzergrenadier Division]]s at Kursk, had a Tiger company in their tank regiments. The ''Grossdeutschland'' Division had its Tiger company increased to a battalion as the III Panzer Battalion of the Panzer Regiment ''Grossdeutschland''. 3rd SS ''Totenkopf'' retained its Tiger I company through the entire war. 1st SS and 2nd SS had their Tiger companies taken away and incorporated into the 101st SS Tiger Battalion, which was part of 1st SS Panzer Corps.{{sfn|Wilbeck|2004|pp=25, 99}}\n\nThe Tiger was originally designed to be an offensive breakthrough weapon, but by the time it went into action, the military situation had changed dramatically, and its main use was on the defensive, as a mobile anti-tank and infantry gun support weapon.{{sfn|Wilbeck|2004|pp=25, 99}} Tactically, this also meant moving the Tiger units constantly to parry breakthroughs, causing excessive mechanical wear. As a result, there are almost no instances where a Tiger battalion went into combat at anything close to full strength.\n\nAgainst the Soviet and Western Allied production numbers, even a 10:1 kill ratio was not sufficient. These numbers must be set against the [[opportunity cost]] of the expensive Tiger. Every Tiger cost as much to build as four ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]]'' assault guns.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Allied response==\n===British response===\n[[File:M26 Killer.jpg|thumb|Tiger I that knocked out the first [[M26 Pershing]] in combat. It then backed into a pile of rubble and became stuck, leading to the crew abandoning it.]]\nThe British had observed the gradual increase in German AFV armour and firepower since 1940 and had anticipated the need for more powerful anti-tank guns. Work on the 76.2&nbsp;mm calibre [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder]] had begun in late 1940 and in 1942 100 early-production guns were rushed to North Africa to help counter the new Tiger threat. The gun carriage had not yet been developed, and the guns were mounted on the carriages of [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounder gun/howitzers]] and were known by the code name \"Pheasant\".\n\nEfforts were hastened to get [[cruiser tank]]s armed with 17-pounder guns into operation. The [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|A30 Challenger]] was already at the prototype stage in 1942,<ref>[http://www.wwiiequipment.com/17pounder.aspx The 17 Pounder Anti-Tank Gun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004041316/http://www.wwiiequipment.com/17pounder.aspx |date=4 October 2008 }} David Boyd, wwiiequipment.com</ref> but this tank was relatively unprotected, having a front hull thickness of 64&nbsp;mm, and in the end was fielded in only limited numbers (around 200 were ordered in 1943), though crews liked it for its high speed. The [[Sherman Firefly]], armed with the 17-pounder, was a notable success even though it was only intended to be a stopgap design. Fireflies were successfully used against Tigers; in one engagement, a single Firefly destroyed three Tigers in 12 minutes with five rounds.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=65}} Over 2,000 Fireflies were built during the war. Five different 17-pounder-armed British designs saw combat during the war: the A30 Challenger, the [[Comet tank|A34 Comet]] (using the [[OQF 77mm HV]] variant), the Sherman Firefly, the [[17pdr SP Achilles]], and the [[Archer (tank destroyer)|17pdr SP Archer]] self-propelled gun, while one more, the [[Centurion Tank|A41 Centurion]], was about to enter service as the European war ended. In 1944 the British introduced an [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|APDS]] round for the 17-pounder, which increased penetration performance considerably.\n\n===Soviet response===\n[[File:Zhukov at the Tiger tank.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] inspecting a Tiger captured by the [[Red Army]] in 1943]]\nInitially, the Soviets responded to the Tiger I by restarting production of the [[57 mm anti-tank gun M1943 (ZiS-2)|57&nbsp;mm ZiS-2]] anti-tank gun (production was stopped in 1941 in favour of cheaper and more versatile alternatives \u2013 e.g. the [[ZiS-3]] \u2013 as the gun's performance was excessive for early German armour). The ZiS-2 had better armour penetration than the 76&nbsp;mm [[F-34 tank gun]] used by most Red Army tanks, or the ZiS-3 76&nbsp;mm divisional cannon, but was still inadequate against Tigers. A small number of T-34s were again fitted with a tank version of the ZiS-2, the ZiS-4, but it could not fire an adequate high-explosive round, making it an unsuitable tank gun.\n\nFiring trials of the new [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|85 mm D-5T]] also had proved disappointing. Several captured German Tiger I tanks were shipped to Chelyabinsk, where they were subjected to 85&nbsp;mm fire from various angles. The 85&nbsp;mm gun could not reliably penetrate the Tiger I's armour except at ranges within the lethal envelope of the Tiger I's own 88&nbsp;mm gun.{{sfn|Zaloga|1994|pages=6\u20137}} It was still initially used on the [[SU-85]] self-propelled gun (based on a T-34 chassis) from August 1943. The production of KV heavy tanks armed with the 85&nbsp;mm D-5T in an IS-85 turret was also started. There was a short production run of 148 KV-85 tanks, which were sent to the front beginning in September 1943 with production ending by December 1943.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boldyrev|first1=Eugeni|title=KV-85 Heavy Tank|url=http://english.battlefield.ru/tanks/10-heavy-tanks/25-kv-85.html|website=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> By early 1944, the T-34/85 appeared; this up-gunned T-34 matched the SU-85's firepower, but with the advantage of mounting the gun in a turret. It also matched the firepower of the heavier IS-85 tank in a more cost effective package resulting in a repetition of the events which heralded the decline of KV-1 production.

These self-propelled guns both mounted the large, [[152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20)|152&nbsp;mm howitzer-gun]]. The SU-152 was intended to be a close-support gun for use against German fortifications rather than armour; however, it shared among the later fielded ISU-152, the nickname ''Zveroboy'' (\"beast killer\"), for its rare ability to knock out German heavy tanks. The 152&nbsp;mm armour-piercing shells weighed over {{convert|45|kg|lb|0}} and could penetrate a Tiger's frontal armour from about {{convert|1000|m|yd|-2}}. Its high-explosive rounds were powerful enough to cause significant damage to a tank, occasionally ripping the turret off outright.

In June 1990, the tank was removed from display at the museum and work began on its restoration. This was carried out both by the museum and the [[Army Base Repair Organisation]] and involved an almost complete disassembly of the tank.

Its late war designation was ''Panzerkampfwagen&nbsp;VI&nbsp;Tiger&nbsp;Ausf. E''. The early war variant was designated ''Panzerkampfwagen&nbsp;VI&nbsp;Tiger&nbsp;Ausf. H1''. Often times, people refer to both of the variants as ''Tiger''. The Tiger I gave the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]] its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the [[8.8 cm KwK 36]] gun (derived from the [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|8.8 cm Flak 36]]). 1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trewhitt|first1=Philip A.|title=Armored Fighting Vehicles|date=1999|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=0760712603|pages=26}}</ref> After August 1944, production of the Tiger I was phased out in favour of the [[Tiger II]].\n\nWhile the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time,{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=9}} it has also been called [[Overengineering|over-engineered]],{{sfn|Tucker-Jones|2012|p=7}} using expensive materials and labour-intensive production methods. The Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and breakdowns, and was limited in range by its high fuel consumption. It was expensive to maintain, but generally mechanically reliable.<ref name=Drabkin-2006-43>[[#Reference-Drabkin|Drabkin & Sheremet 2006:43]]</ref> It was difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilisation when mud, ice, and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved ''Schachtellaufwerk''-pattern road wheels, often jamming them solid. This was a problem on the Eastern Front in the muddy ''[[rasputitsa]]'' season and during periods of extreme cold.{{Citation needed|date = April 2017}}\n\nThe tank was given its nickname \"Tiger\" by [[Ferdinand Porsche]], and the [[Roman numeral]] was added after the later Tiger II entered production. The initial designation was ''Panzerkampfwagen&nbsp;VI&nbsp;Ausf\u00fchrung&nbsp;H'' (literally 'Armored Combat Wagon/Vehicle ''VI&nbsp;version&nbsp;H''{{'}}, abbreviated ''PzKpfw&nbsp;VI&nbsp;Ausf.&nbsp;H'') where 'H' denoted [[Henschel & Sohn|Henschel]] as the designer/manufacturer. It was classified with [[Sonderkraftfahrzeug|ordnance inventory designation]] ''[[Sonderkraftfahrzeug|Sd.Kfz.]]&nbsp;182''. The tank was later re-designated as ''PzKpfw VI Ausf. E'' in March 1943, with ordnance inventory designation ''Sd.Kfz.&nbsp;181''.\n\nToday, only seven Tiger I tanks survive in museums and private collections worldwide. {{as of | 2020}} [[Tiger 131]] (captured during the North Africa Campaign) at the UK's [[Bovington Tank Museum|Tank Museum]] is the only example restored to running order.\n\n==Design history==\n===Earlier designs===\nHenschel & Sohn began the development of a large tank design in January 1937 when the ''[[Waffenamt]]'' requested Henschel to develop a ''Durchbruchwagen'' (\"breakthrough vehicle\") in the 30\u201333 tonne range.<ref>White, B. T. ''German Tanks and Armoured Vehicles, 1914\u20131945''. p. 69-70</ref> Only one prototype hull was ever built and it was never fitted with a turret. The ''Durchbruchwagen'' I's general shape and suspension resembled the [[Panzer III]], while the turret resembled the early Panzer IV C turret with the short-barrelled 7.5&nbsp;cm L/24 cannon.\n\nBefore ''Durchbruchwagen'' I was completed, a request was issued for a heavier 30-tonne class vehicle with thicker armour; this was the ''Durchbruchwagen'' II, which would have had 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in) of frontal armour and mounted a [[Panzer IV]] turret with a short-barrelled [[7.5 cm KwK 37|7.5&nbsp;cm L/24 gun]]. Overall weight would have been 36&nbsp;tonnes. Only one hull was built and no turret was fitted. Further development of the ''Durchbruchwagen'' was dropped in 1938 in favour of the larger and better-armoured [[VK 30.01 (H)]] and [[VK 36.01 (H)]] designs.{{efn|''VK'' from the German ''Voll Ketten'' meaning \"fully tracked\"; ''H'' for Henschel}} Both the ''Durchbruchwagen'' I and II prototype hulls were used as test vehicles until 1941.\n\n===Another attempt===\nThe VK 30.01 (H) medium tank and the VK 36.01 (H) heavy tank designs pioneered the use of the complex ''Schachtellaufwerk'' track suspension system of [[torsion bar]]-sprung, overlapped and interleaved main road wheels for tank use. This concept was already common on German half-tracks such as the [[Sd.Kfz. 7]]. The VK 30.01 (H) was intended to mount a low-velocity 7.5&nbsp;cm L/24 infantry support gun, a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/40 dual purpose anti-tank gun, or a 10.5&nbsp;cm L/28 field gun in a [[Krupp]] turret. Overall weight was to be 33 tonnes. The armour was designed to be 50&nbsp;mm on frontal surfaces and 30&nbsp;mm on the side surfaces. Four prototype hulls were completed for testing. Two of these were later modified to build the \"[[Sturer Emil]]\" (12.8&nbsp;cm ''Selbstfahrlafette'' L/61) self-propelled anti-tank gun.\n\nThe VK 36.01 (H) was intended to weigh 40 tonnes, with 100&nbsp;mm (4&nbsp;in) of armour on front surfaces, 80&nbsp;mm on turret sides and 60&nbsp;mm on the hull sides. The VK 36.01 (H) was intended to carry a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/24, or a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/43, or a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/70, or a 12.8&nbsp;cm L/28 cannon in a Krupp turret that looked similar to an enlarged Panzer IV Ausf. C turret. The hull for one prototype was built, followed later by five more. The six turrets built were never fitted and were used as part of the [[Atlantic Wall]]. The VK 36.01 (H) project was discontinued in early 1942 in favour of the VK 45.01 project.\n\n===Further improvements===\nCombat experience against the French [[SOMUA S35]] [[cavalry tank]] and [[Char B1]] heavy tank, and the British [[Matilda II]] [[infantry tank]]s during the [[Battle of France]] in June 1940 showed that the German Army needed better armed and armoured tanks.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nOn 26 May 1941, Henschel and Ferdinand Porsche were asked to submit designs for a 45-tonne heavy tank, to be ready by June 1942.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=13}} Porsche worked on an updated version of their VK 30.01 (P) Leopard tank prototype while Henschel worked on an improved VK 36.01 (H) tank. Henschel built two prototypes: a VK 45.01 (H) H1 with an 8.8&nbsp;cm L/56 cannon, and a VK 45.01 (H) H2 with a 7.5&nbsp;cm L/70 cannon.\n\n===Final designs===\nOn 22 June 1941, Germany launched [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. The Germans were shocked to encounter Soviet [[T-34]] medium and [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] heavy tanks, and,{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=14}} according to Henschel designer [[Erwin Aders]]: \"There was great consternation when it was discovered that the Soviet tanks were superior to anything available to the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Heer]].\".{{sfn|Carruthers|2013|loc=chapt. \"Design features\"}}\n\nWeight increase to 45&nbsp;tonnes and an increase in gun calibre to 8.8&nbsp;cm was ordered. The due date for the new prototypes was set for 20 April 1942, [[Adolf Hitler]]'s 53rd birthday. Unlike the [[Panther tank]], the designs did not incorporate [[sloped armour]], an innovation taken from the T-34.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tiger Tank Diagram.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Schematic layout of Tiger H1]] -->\n[[File:VK 4501 Model.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Model reconstruction of [[VK 4501 (P)]] Porsche prototype]]\nPorsche and Henschel submitted prototype designs, each making use of the Krupp-designed turret. They were demonstrated at [[Rastenburg]] in front of Hitler. The Henschel design was accepted, mainly because the Porsche [[VK 4501 (P)]] prototype design used a troubled gasoline-electric hybrid power unit which needed large quantities of [[copper]] for manufacture of its electrical drivetrain components, a strategic war material of which Germany had limited supplies with acceptable electrical properties for such uses.{{sfn|Jentz|Doyle|1993|p=6}} Production of the ''Panzerkampfwagen'' VI ''Ausf.'' H began in August 1942. Expecting an order for his tank, Porsche built 100 chassis. After the contract was awarded to Henschel, they were used for a new turretless, [[casemate]]-style [[tank destroyer]]; 91 hulls were converted into the [[Elefant|''Panzerj\u00e4ger'' Tiger (P)]] in early 1943.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-278-0873-24, Russland, Panzersoldat (Oberleutnant Knauth -).jpg|thumb|upright|Early tiger with tall cupola]]\nThe Tiger was still at the prototype stage when it was first hurried into service, and therefore changes both large and small were made throughout the production run. A redesigned turret with a lower cupola was the most significant change. To cut costs, the submersion capability and an external air-filtration system were dropped.\n\n==Design==\nThe Tiger differed from earlier [[Tanks in the German Army|German tanks]] principally in its design philosophy. Its predecessors balanced mobility, [[Vehicle armour|armour]] and [[firepower]], and were sometimes outgunned by their opponents.\n\nWhile heavy, this tank was not slower than the best of its opponents. However, at over 50 tonnes dead weight, the suspension, gearboxes, and other such items had clearly reached their design limits and breakdowns were frequent if regular maintenance was not undertaken.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAlthough the general design and layout were broadly similar to the previous medium tank, the [[Panzer IV]], the Tiger weighed more than twice as much. This was due to its substantially thicker armour, the larger [[Tank gun|main gun]], greater volume of fuel and ammunition storage, larger engine, and a more solidly built transmission and suspension.\n\n===Armour===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-299-1805-10, Nordfrankreich, Panzer VI (Tiger I).jpg|thumb|left|The Tiger I's [[Vehicle armour|armour]] was up to 120&nbsp;mm on the [[gun mantlet]].<!--- This tank is assigned to the [[SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 101|''schwere SS-Panzer-Abteilung'' 101]] operating in northern France in 1944.-->]]\n\nThe Tiger I had frontal hull armour {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick, frontal [[Gun turret|turret]] armour of {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} and a {{convert|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[gun mantlet]].<ref name=\"id3486.securedata.net\">{{cite web|author=Fabio Prado |url=http://id3486.securedata.net/fprado/armorsite/tiger1.htm |title=Pzkpfw Vi Tiger I |publisher=Armorsite |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> The Tiger had {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}} thick hull side plates and 80&nbsp;mm armour on the side superstructure/sponsons, while turret sides and rear were 80&nbsp;mm.

The armour joints were of high quality, being stepped and welded rather than riveted and were made of [[maraging steel]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Gun===\n[[File:Turmzielfernrohr 9c.jpg|thumb|''Turmzielfernrohr'' TZF 9c gun sight]]\n{{main|8.8 cm KwK 36}}\nThe 56-calibre long 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 36 was chosen for the Tiger. A combination of a flat trajectory from the high muzzle velocity and precision from Leitz ''Turmzielfernrohr'' TZF 9b sight (later replaced by the [[monocular]] TZF 9c) made it very accurate. In British wartime firing trials, five successive hits were scored on a {{convert|410|by|460|mm|abbr=on}} target at a range of {{convert|1100|m}}.{{sfn|Carruthers|2013|loc=chapt.

At greater ranges, the 8.8&nbsp;cm KwK 36 was superior in penetration and accuracy.\n<!----[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J14931, Bei Belgorod, Panzer VI (Tiger I), Aufmunitionieren.jpg|thumb|Loading ammunition]]-->\n\nThe ammunition for the Tiger had electrically fired primers. Four types of ammunition were available but not all were fully available; the PzGr 40 shell used tungsten, which was in short supply as the war progressed.\n\n*''PzGr.'' 39 ([[armour-piercing, capped, ballistic cap]])\n*''PzGr.'' 40 ([[armour-piercing, composite rigid]])\n*''Hl.

The Germans had not developed an adequate diesel engine, so a petrol (gasoline) powerplant had to be used instead. The original engine utilised was a 21.35-litre (1303 cu.in.) 12-cylinder [[Maybach]] [[List of WWII Maybach engines|HL210 P45]] developing 485&nbsp;kW (650&nbsp;hp) at 3,000&nbsp;rpm. Although a good engine, it was underpowered for the vehicle. From the 251st Tiger onwards, it was replaced by the upgraded [[Maybach HL230|HL 230]] P45, a 23.095 litre (1409 cu.in.) engine developing 521&nbsp;kW (700&nbsp;hp) at 3,000&nbsp;rpm.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=41}} The main difference between these engines was that the original Maybach HL 210 used an aluminium engine block while the Maybach HL 230 used a cast-iron engine block. The cast-iron block allowed for larger cylinders (and thus, greater displacement) which increased the power output to 521&nbsp;kW (700&nbsp;hp). The engine was in V-form, with two cylinder banks set at 60 degrees. An [[Aircraft engine starting#Inertia starter|inertia starter]] was mounted on its right side, driven via chain gears through a port in the rear wall. The engine could be lifted out through a hatch on the rear hull roof. In comparison to other V12 and various vee-form gasoline engines used for tanks, the eventual HL 230 engine was nearly four litres smaller in displacement than the Allied British [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] V12 AFV powerplant, itself adapted from the RR Merlin but de-rated to 448&nbsp;kW (600&nbsp;hp) power output; and the American Ford-designed precursor V12 to its [[Ford GAA engine|Ford GAA]] V-8 AFV engine of 18 litre displacement, which in its original V12 form would have had the same 27 litre displacement as the Meteor.\n\nThe engine drove the front sprockets through a drivetrain connecting to a transmission in the front portion of the lower hull; the front sprockets had to be mounted relatively low as a result. The Krupp-designed 11-tonne turret had a hydraulic motor whose pump was powered by mechanical drive from the engine. A full rotation took about a minute.\n\nAnother new feature was the Maybach-Olvar [[hydraulic machinery|hydraulically controlled]] semi-automatic [[pre-selector gearbox]]. The extreme weight of the tank also required a new steering system. Germany's [[Argus Motoren]], where Hermann Klaue had invented a [[ring brake]]<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US2323052 Disk brake for use in motor cars, airplanes, and the like] US Patent 2323052 A</ref> in 1940, supplied them for the [[Arado Ar 96]]<ref>[http://www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de/Waffen/Ar96.htm Arado Ar 96], ''Lexikon der Wehrmacht''.</ref> and also supplied the 55&nbsp;cm disc.<ref>[http://www.alanhamby.com/transmission.shtml Transmission & Steering], Tiger I Information Center.</ref> Klaue acknowledged in the patent application that he had merely improved on existing technology, that can be traced back to British designs dating to 1904. It is unclear whether Klaue's patent ring brake was utilised in the Tiger brake design.\n\nThe clutch-and-brake system, typical for lighter vehicles, was retained only for emergencies. Normally, steering depended on a double [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], Henschel's development of the British [[David Brown Ltd.|Merritt-Brown]] system{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=44}} first encountered in the [[Churchill tank]]. The vehicle had an eight-speed gearbox, and the steering offered two fixed radii of turns on each gear, thus the Tiger had sixteen different radii of turn. In first gear, at a speed of a few km/h, the minimal turning radius was {{convert|3.44|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. In neutral gear, the tracks could be turned in opposite directions, so the Tiger I pivoted in place.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=46}} There was a steering wheel instead of either a tiller \u2014 or, as most tanks had at that time, twin braking levers \u2014 making the Tiger I's steering system easy to use, and ahead of its time.{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=44}}\n\n===Suspension===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3965-28, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|left|Clear view of the Tiger I's ''Schachtellaufwerk'' overlapping and interleaved road wheels during production]]\nThe suspension used sixteen [[torsion bar]]s, with eight suspension arms per side. To save space, the swing arms were leading on one side and trailing on the other. There were three road wheels (one of them double, closest to the track's centre) on each arm, in a so-called ''Schachtellaufwerk'' overlapping and interleaved arrangement, similar to that pioneered on German half-tracked military vehicles of the pre-World War II era, with the Tiger I being the first all-tracked German AFV built in quantity to use such a road wheel arrangement. The wheels had a diameter of {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}} in the ''Schachtellaufwerk'' arrangement for the Tiger I's suspension, providing a high uniform distribution of the load onto the track, at the cost of increased maintenance. \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-310-0899-15, Italien, Panzer VI (Tiger I), Reparatur.jpg|thumb|Wheel and track maintenance in muddy conditions]]\n\nRemoving an inner wheel that had lost its solid rubber tire (a common occurrence) required the removal of up to nine other wheels first. During the rainy period that brought on the autumn ''[[rasputitsa]]'' mud season and onwards into the winter conditions on the [[Eastern Front of World War II|Eastern front]], the roadwheels of a ''Schachtellaufwerk''-equipped vehicle could also become packed with mud or snow that could then freeze. Presumably, German engineers, based on the experience of the half tracks, felt that the improvement in off-road performance, track and wheel life, mobility with wheels missing or damaged, plus additional protection from enemy fire was worth the maintenance difficulties of a complex system vulnerable to mud and ice. This approach was carried on, in various forms, to the Panther and the non-interleaved wheel design for the Tiger II. Eventually, a new 80&nbsp;cm diameter 'steel' wheel design, closely resembling those on the [[Tiger II]], with an internally sprung steel-rim tire was substituted, and which like the Tiger II, were only overlapped and not interleaved.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-064-61, Kassel, Verladen eines Panzer VI \"Tiger I\".jpg|thumb|right|Tiger at the [[Henschel & Son#World War II|Henschel plant]] is loaded onto a special rail car.

To meet [[Loading gauge|rail-freight size restrictions]], the outermost roadwheel on each axle (16 total) could be unbolted from a flange {{sfn|Jentz|Doyle|2000|p=35}} and narrower {{convert|520|mm|abbr=on}} wide 'transport' tracks (''Verladeketten'') installed.{{sfn|Jentz|Doyle|2000|p=36}}{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=44}}{{sfn|Wilbeck|2004|p= }} The track replacement and wheel removal took 30 minutes for each side of the tank.{{sfn|Anderson|2013|p=69}} However, in service, Tigers were frequently transported by rail with their combat tracks fitted, as long as the train crew knew there were no narrow tunnels or other obstructions on the route that would prevent an oversized load from passing, despite this practice being strictly forbidden.{{sfn|Anderson|2013|p=71}}\n\n===Fording system===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2019}}\nThe Tiger tank's combat weight of 56 tons was often too heavy for small bridges which had 35 ton weight limits, so it was designed to ford bodies of water up to {{cvt|15|ft}} deep.<ref name=\"Tiger Tanks at War Pg20\">{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Michael |last2=Brown |first2=James D. |title=Tiger Tanks at War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1gbrYELbT4C&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=pistol+port+tanks&source=bl&ots=189uETVgc5&sig=jSOFCPmR5ulmNOA41CNqG7KrAR4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKhdPnlcvfAhWQJDQIHcb6Ans4ChDoATABegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=bridges&f=false |publisher=Voyageur Press |pages=20 |language=en |date=15 February 2008}}</ref> This required unusual mechanisms for ventilation and cooling when underwater.

Forward was an open crew compartment, with the driver and radio-operator seated at the front on either side of the gearbox. Behind them the turret floor was surrounded by panels forming a continuous level surface. This helped the loader to retrieve the ammunition, which was mostly stowed above the tracks. Three men were seated in the turret; the loader to the right of the gun facing to the rear, the gunner to the left of the gun, and the commander behind him. There was also a folding seat on the right for the loader. The turret had a full circular floor and 157&nbsp;cm headroom.  Early versions of the Tiger I's turret included two [[Firing port|pistol ports]] however one of these was replaced with a loader escape hatch and the other deleted from later designs.<ref name=\"Tiger Tanks at War Pg88\">{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Michael |last2=Brown |first2=James D. |title=Tiger Tanks at War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1gbrYELbT4C&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=pistol+port+tanks&source=bl&ots=189uETVgc5&sig=jSOFCPmR5ulmNOA41CNqG7KrAR4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKhdPnlcvfAhWQJDQIHcb6Ans4ChDoATABegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=pistol%20port%20tanks&f=false |website=Google Books |publisher=Voyageur Press |accessdate=1 January 2019 |pages=88 |language=en |date=15 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nPost-war testing by the Allies found the tank to be uncomfortable and spartan.

This was achieved for the loss of 1,725 Tigers (including large numbers of operational and strategic losses, i.e abandoned, broken down, etc).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Askey |first1=Nigel |title=Operation Barbarossa : the complete organisational and statistical analysis, and military simulation |publisher=IngramSparks Publishing |isbn=9780648221920 |pages=103}}</ref>\n\n==Production history==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-635-3965-05, Panzerfabrik in Deutschland.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>Installing the turret</center>]]\nProduction of the Tiger I began in August 1942 at the factory of [[Henschel & Son|Henschel und Sohn]] in [[Kassel]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanhamby.com/factory1.shtml|title=The Henschel Tiger Factory|website=alanbamby.com|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}</ref> initially at a rate of 25 per month and peaking in April 1944 at 104 per month. An official document of the time stated that the first Tiger I was completed in August 4. 1,355 had been built by August 1944, when production ceased. Deployed Tiger I's peaked at 671 on 1 July 1944.{{sfn|Jentz|Doyle|1993|p=13}} It took about twice as long to build a Tiger I as another German tank of the period. When the improved Tiger II began production in January 1944, the Tiger I was soon phased out.\n\nIn 1943, Japan bought several specimens of German tank designs for study. A single Tiger I was apparently purchased, along with a Panther and two Panzer IIIs, but only the Panzer IIIs were actually delivered.{{sfn|Zaloga|2007|p=17}} The undelivered Tiger was loaned to the German Wehrmacht by the Japanese government.\n\nMany modifications were introduced during the production run to improve automotive performance, firepower and protection. Simplification of the design was implemented, along with cuts due to raw material shortages. In 1942 alone, at least six revisions were made, starting with the removal of the ''Vorpanzer'' (frontal armour shield) from the pre-production models in April. In May, mudguards bolted onto the side of the pre-production run were added, while removable mudguards saw full incorporation in September. Smoke discharge canisters, three on each side of the turret, were added in August 1942. In later years, similar changes and updates were added, such as the addition of [[Zimmerit]] (a non-magnetic anti-mine coating), in late 1943.<ref>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-vi-tiger-ausf-e-sd-kfz-181.htm Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf.

The resistance group around the later executed priest [[Heinrich Maier]] sent corresponding documents to the American Office of Strategic Services.

It is often misidentified as a ''BergeTiger'' recovery vehicle. As many as three may have been built. It carried a demolition charge on a small crane on the turret in place of the main gun. It was to move up to a minefield and drop the charge, back away, and then set the charge off to clear the minefield. There is no verification of any being used in combat.\n\nAnother variant was the [[Fahrschulpanzer]] VI Tiger tanks (driving school Tiger tanks). These tanks were Tigers with modified engines to run on either compressed [[Towngas]] gas (Stadtgas System) or [[wood gas]] (Holzgas System). This was due to shortages in fuel supply. They used a mixture of turreted and turretless hulls. They were used to train Tiger tank crews.

The tank was also immune to Soviet [[anti-tank rifle]] fire to the sides and rear. Its large calibre 8.8&nbsp;cm provided superior fragmentation and high explosive content over the [[7.5 cm KwK 42]] gun. Therefore, comparing the Tiger with the Panther, for supporting the infantry and destroying fortifications, the Tiger offered superior firepower. It was also key to dealing with towed anti-tank guns, according to German tank commander [[Otto Carius]]:\n\n{{quotation| The destruction of an antitank gun was often accepted as nothing special by lay people and soldiers from other branches. Only the destruction of other tanks counted as a success. On the other hand, antitank guns counted twice as much to the experienced tanker. They were much more dangerous to us. The antitank cannon waited in ambush, well camouflaged, and magnificently set up in the terrain. Because of that, it was very difficult to identify. It was also very difficult to hit because of its low height. Usually, we didn't make out the antitank guns until they had fired the first shot. We were often hit right away, if the antitank crew was on top of things, because we had run into a wall of antitank guns. It was then advisable to keep as cool as possible and take care of the enemy, before the second aimed shot was fired. |author=Otto Carius (translated by Robert J.

Many of these early models were plagued by problems with the transmission, which had difficulty handling the great weight of the vehicle if pushed too hard. It took time for drivers to learn how to avoid overtaxing the engine and transmission, and many broke down. The most significant event from this engagement was that one of the Tigers became stuck in swampy ground and had to be abandoned.

The Tigers were hit by a number of M3 Lee tanks firing at a range of 80 to 100 metres. Two of the Lees were knocked out in this action. The Tiger tanks proved that they had excellent protection from enemy fire; this greatly increased the crew's trust in the quality of the armour.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=13}} The first loss to an Allied gun was on 20 January 1943 near [[Robaa]],{{sfn|Schneider|2004|p=43}} when a battery of the British 72nd Anti-Tank Regiment knocked out a Tiger with their [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|6-pounder (57 mm) anti-tank guns]].

For this reason, the Tiger was built with water tight hatches and a [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] device that allowed it to [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] water obstacles four metres deep. The tank's weight also made driving through buildings risky, as the presence of a cellar could result in a sudden drop. Another weakness was the slow traverse of the hydraulically operated turret. Due to reliability problems with the Maybach HL 210 TRM P45, which was delivered within the first production batch of 250 Tigers, performance for its maximum power output at high gear ratio could not be fulfilled.<ref name=\"alanhamby.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alanhamby.com/maybach.shtml|title=The Maybach Engine|work=The Tiger I Information Center}}</ref> Though the Maybach engines had a maximum of 3,000 rpm, crews were told in the ''[[Tigerfibel]]'' not to exceed 2,600 rpm. The engine limitation was alleviated only by the adoption of the Maybach HL 230.<ref name=\"alanhamby.com\"/> A British Army test report showed that the turret on the Tiger E tank turned 360 degrees, at 19\u00ba/second, with its power traverse system set at high ratio and with the engine speed at 2,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).{{sfn|Green|Brown|2008|p=86}} The turret could also be traversed manually, but this option was rarely used, except for very small adjustments.{{sfn|Carruthers|2013}}\n\nEarly Tigers had a top speed of about {{convert|45|km/h|mph}} over optimal terrain. This was not recommended for normal operation, and was discouraged in training. An engine governor was subsequently installed, capping the engine at 2,600 rpm and the Tiger's maximum speed to about {{convert|38|km/h|mph}}. Tiger crews report that typical march speed off-road was 10 kilometers per hour (6&nbsp;mph).<ref>Lochmann and Rubbel p 22</ref> However, medium tanks of the time, such as the Sherman or T-34, had on average a top speed of about {{convert|45|km/h|mph}}. Thus, despite the Tiger being nearly twice as heavy, its speed was comparatively respectable.{{sfn|Carruthers|2013}} With the tank's very wide tracks, a design feature borrowed from the Soviet T-34, the Tiger had a lower ground pressure than many smaller tanks, such as the M4 Sherman.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-022-2926-11A, Russland, Abschleppen eines Tiger I.jpg|thumb|Tiger I towed by two [[Sd.Kfz. 9]]]]\nTiger I tanks needed a high degree of support. It required two or sometimes three of the standard German [[Sd.Kfz. 9|Sd.Kfz. 9 ''Famo'']] heavy recovery half-track tractors to tow it. Tiger crews often resorted to using another Tiger to tow the damaged vehicle, but this was not recommended as it often caused overheating and engine breakdown. The low-mounted sprocket limited the obstacle clearance height. The tracks also had a tendency to override the rear sprocket, resulting in immobilisation. If a track overrode and jammed, two Tigers were normally needed to tow the tank. The jammed track was also a big problem itself, since due to high tension, it was often impossible to split the track by removing the track pins. The track sometimes had to be blown apart with a small explosive charge.\n\nThe average reliability of the Tiger tank in the second half of 1943 was similar to that of the [[Panther tank|Panther]], 36%, compared to the 48% of the [[Panzer IV]] and the 65% of the [[StuG III]].{{sfn|Zaloga|2015|p=202}} From May 1944 to March 1945, the reliability of the Tiger tank was as good as the Panzer IV. With an average of 70%, the Tiger's operational availability on the Western Front, was better than compared to 62% of Panthers. On the Eastern Front, 65% of Tigers were operationally available, compared to the 71% of Panzer IVs and 65% of Panthers.{{sfn|Fletcher|2011|p=139}}{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=202,230}}\n\n===Tactical organization===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-022-2935-18A, Russland, getarnter Panzer VI \"Tiger I\".jpg|thumb|right|A Tiger I camouflaged in a static defensive position]]\n\nTigers were usually employed in separate [[German Heavy Panzer Detachment|heavy tank battalions]] (''schwere Panzer-Abteilung'') under army command. These battalions would be deployed to critical sectors, either for breakthrough operations or, more typically, counter-attacks. A few favoured divisions, such as the ''[[Gro\u00dfdeutschland Division|Grossdeutschland]]'', and the [[Leibstandarte|1st SS ''Leibstandarte'' Adolf Hitler]], [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich|2nd SS ''Das Reich'']], and [[3rd SS Division Totenkopf|3rd SS ''Totenkopf'' Panzergrenadier Division]]s at Kursk, had a Tiger company in their tank regiments. The ''Grossdeutschland'' Division had its Tiger company increased to a battalion as the III Panzer Battalion of the Panzer Regiment ''Grossdeutschland''. 3rd SS ''Totenkopf'' retained its Tiger I company through the entire war. 1st SS and 2nd SS had their Tiger companies taken away and incorporated into the 101st SS Tiger Battalion, which was part of 1st SS Panzer Corps.{{sfn|Wilbeck|2004|pp=25, 99}}\n\nThe Tiger was originally designed to be an offensive breakthrough weapon, but by the time it went into action, the military situation had changed dramatically, and its main use was on the defensive, as a mobile anti-tank and infantry gun support weapon.{{sfn|Wilbeck|2004|pp=25, 99}} Tactically, this also meant moving the Tiger units constantly to parry breakthroughs, causing excessive mechanical wear. As a result, there are almost no instances where a Tiger battalion went into combat at anything close to full strength.\n\nAgainst the Soviet and Western Allied production numbers, even a 10:1 kill ratio was not sufficient. These numbers must be set against the [[opportunity cost]] of the expensive Tiger. Every Tiger cost as much to build as four ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]]'' assault guns.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Allied response==\n===British response===\n[[File:M26 Killer.jpg|thumb|Tiger I that knocked out the first [[M26 Pershing]] in combat. It then backed into a pile of rubble and became stuck, leading to the crew abandoning it.]]\nThe British had observed the gradual increase in German AFV armour and firepower since 1940 and had anticipated the need for more powerful anti-tank guns. Work on the 76.2&nbsp;mm calibre [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder]] had begun in late 1940 and in 1942 100 early-production guns were rushed to North Africa to help counter the new Tiger threat. The gun carriage had not yet been developed, and the guns were mounted on the carriages of [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounder gun/howitzers]] and were known by the code name \"Pheasant\".\n\nEfforts were hastened to get [[cruiser tank]]s armed with 17-pounder guns into operation. The [[Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger|A30 Challenger]] was already at the prototype stage in 1942,<ref>[http://www.wwiiequipment.com/17pounder.aspx The 17 Pounder Anti-Tank Gun] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004041316/http://www.wwiiequipment.com/17pounder.aspx |date=4 October 2008 }} David Boyd, wwiiequipment.com</ref> but this tank was relatively unprotected, having a front hull thickness of 64&nbsp;mm, and in the end was fielded in only limited numbers (around 200 were ordered in 1943), though crews liked it for its high speed. The [[Sherman Firefly]], armed with the 17-pounder, was a notable success even though it was only intended to be a stopgap design. Fireflies were successfully used against Tigers; in one engagement, a single Firefly destroyed three Tigers in 12 minutes with five rounds.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=65}} Over 2,000 Fireflies were built during the war. Five different 17-pounder-armed British designs saw combat during the war: the A30 Challenger, the [[Comet tank|A34 Comet]] (using the [[OQF 77mm HV]] variant), the Sherman Firefly, the [[17pdr SP Achilles]], and the [[Archer (tank destroyer)|17pdr SP Archer]] self-propelled gun, while one more, the [[Centurion Tank|A41 Centurion]], was about to enter service as the European war ended. In 1944 the British introduced an [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|APDS]] round for the 17-pounder, which increased penetration performance considerably.\n\n===Soviet response===\n[[File:Zhukov at the Tiger tank.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] inspecting a Tiger captured by the [[Red Army]] in 1943]]\nInitially, the Soviets responded to the Tiger I by restarting production of the [[57 mm anti-tank gun M1943 (ZiS-2)|57&nbsp;mm ZiS-2]] anti-tank gun (production was stopped in 1941 in favour of cheaper and more versatile alternatives \u2013 e.g. the [[ZiS-3]] \u2013 as the gun's performance was excessive for early German armour). The ZiS-2 had better armour penetration than the 76&nbsp;mm [[F-34 tank gun]] used by most Red Army tanks, or the ZiS-3 76&nbsp;mm divisional cannon, but was still inadequate against Tigers. A small number of T-34s were again fitted with a tank version of the ZiS-2, the ZiS-4, but it could not fire an adequate high-explosive round, making it an unsuitable tank gun.\n\nFiring trials of the new [[85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K)|85 mm D-5T]] also had proved disappointing. Several captured German Tiger I tanks were shipped to Chelyabinsk, where they were subjected to 85&nbsp;mm fire from various angles. The 85&nbsp;mm gun could not reliably penetrate the Tiger I's armour except at ranges within the lethal envelope of the Tiger I's own 88&nbsp;mm gun.{{sfn|Zaloga|1994|pages=6\u20137}} It was still initially used on the [[SU-85]] self-propelled gun (based on a T-34 chassis) from August 1943. The production of KV heavy tanks armed with the 85&nbsp;mm D-5T in an IS-85 turret was also started. There was a short production run of 148 KV-85 tanks, which were sent to the front beginning in September 1943 with production ending by December 1943.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Boldyrev|first1=Eugeni|title=KV-85 Heavy Tank|url=http://english.battlefield.ru/tanks/10-heavy-tanks/25-kv-85.html|website=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> By early 1944, the T-34/85 appeared; this up-gunned T-34 matched the SU-85's firepower, but with the advantage of mounting the gun in a turret.

The SU-152 was intended to be a close-support gun for use against German fortifications rather than armour; however, it shared among the later fielded ISU-152, the nickname ''Zveroboy'' (\"beast killer\"), for its rare ability to knock out German heavy tanks.

Many large components have been salvaged over the years, but the discovery of a more or less and generally complete vehicle has so far eluded armour enthusiasts and tank collectors. In addition to Tiger 131, six other Tiger I tanks survive as of April 2018 at these following locations:\n\n* [[Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s]] in [[Saumur]], [[France]]. Indoor exhibit in good condition. Mid-production (1944) version with overlapping 'steel'-type roadwheels adopted from the Tiger II and fitted with the narrow transport tracks. This Tiger was part of the 2nd company of the [[SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 102]] which fought in the [[Cauville]] sector and was later abandoned by her crew after a mechanical breakdown. She was recommissioned as ''Colmar'' with the 2nd squadron of the Free French [[6th Cuirassier Regiment (France)|6th Cuirassier Regiment]] and joined the new unit in fighting all the way back to Germany.\n* [[Vimoutiers]] in [[Normandy]], France. The renowned \"[[Vimoutiers Tiger tank]]\". Abandoned and then destroyed (to prevent enemy capture) by its German crew in August 1944. An outdoor monument in poor condition due to the effect of time and the elements (many original parts such as hatches and both rear exhaust pipes missing).\n* [[Kubinka Tank Museum]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. In good condition; displayed as an indoor exhibit (although the outermost row of four roadwheels are missing on this vehicle).\n* Military-Historical Museum of Lenino-Snegiri in Russia. In very bad condition; displayed outdoors. This tank was a former firing-range target and has been badly shot-at and cut up (damage include broken running gear and multiple shell-holes on its armour).\n* Tiger 712 [Hull Number 250031] of the [[501st Heavy Panzer Battalion]] is a part of the United States Army Armor & Cavalry Museum in [[Fort Benning, Georgia]], the US. In good condition; formerly displayed outdoors, it has since been moved indoors. This vehicle appears to have had its left turret and upper-hull sides partially cut open (possibly for vehicle studies and analysis) during or after WWII but the cut openings have since been covered up by false metal plates.\n* The German Panzer Museum in Munster now has a Tiger I on display.<ref>[http://www.panzermuseum-munster.de/home/aktuelles/detail/article/die-schwerste-katze-aller-zeiten.html Deutsches Panzermuseum Munster: Die schwerste Katze aller Zeiten<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This tank was reconstructed by Mr. Hoebig in Germany using parts found in the Trun Scrapyard in Normandy <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuLocale_-Un-char-Tigre-Allemand-reconstruit-avec-des-pieces-de-la-poche-de-Falaise-Chambois_40772-2173893------61001-aud_actu.Htm|title=Un char Tigre Allemand reconstruit avec des pi\u00e8ces de la poche de Falaise-Chambois|work=Ouest-France.fr}}</ref> and some other parts found in Kurland (in Latvia).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nTigerI Saumur.jpg|Tiger ''Colmar'' in the ''Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s'' in Saumur, France\nVimoutiers (Orne-France) - Char Tigre allemand.jpg|The [[Vimoutiers Tiger tank]] in Vimoutiers in Normandy, France\nPz.Kpfw.
