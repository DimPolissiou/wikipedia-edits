The bulk of the sand in the 0.5-hectare beach, of approximately 500 truckloads, was found missing in July 2008. The beach was to form part of a resort complex, but the theft of its most important feature has led to its developers putting their plans on hold. \nIllegal [[sand mining]] is a problem in Jamaica; the local tradition of people building their own homes has caused a huge demand for construction material.\n\n====Investigation====\nThe disappearance of the beach was considered so important that Jamaica's Prime Minister [[Bruce Golding]] took a personal interest in the theft and ordered a report into how such a large quantity of sand could have been stolen, transported and presumably sold. \nPolice carried out forensic tests on beaches along the coast to see if any of it matched the stolen sand. A three-month police investigation failed to lead to anyone being charged. There were unconfirmed reports about collusion between the criminals and some police officers, but Jamaican police denied any such collusion.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{seealso|Land reclamation in Singapore}}\n\nSingapore is the world's largest importer of sand,<ref name=\"guardian\">https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jul/01/riddle-of-the-sands-the-truth-behind-stolen-beaches-and-dredged-islands</ref><ref name=\"toc\">https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/07/03/singapore-under-scrutiny-for-alleged-involvement-in-illegal-sand-import-for-land-reclamation/</ref> using it for [[Land reclamation in Singapore|land reclamation]] that has increased the country's size by 20% since independence.<ref name='guardian'/>  Much of the imported sand has reportedly been mined illegally in Malaysia, Indonesia and Cambodia.<ref name='guardian'/><ref name='toc'/>\n\n==Effects==\nAlthough sand theft does not seem to be a serious problem at first, it is nonetheless a serious problem as the removal of sand facilitates [[soil salinisation]].

The bulk of the sand in the 0.5-hectare beach, of approximately 500 truckloads, was found missing in July 2008. The beach was to form part of a resort complex, but the theft of its most important feature has led to its developers putting their plans on hold. \nIllegal [[sand mining]] is a problem in Jamaica; the local tradition of people building their own homes has caused a huge demand for construction material.\n\n====Investigation====\nThe disappearance of the beach was considered so important that Jamaica's Prime Minister [[Bruce Golding]] took a personal interest in the theft and ordered a report into how such a large quantity of sand could have been stolen, transported and presumably sold. \nPolice carried out forensic tests on beaches along the coast to see if any of it matched the stolen sand. A three-month police investigation failed to lead to anyone being charged. There were unconfirmed reports about collusion between the criminals and some police officers, but Jamaican police denied any such collusion.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{seealso|Land reclamation in Singapore}}\n\nSingapore is the world's largest importer of sand,<ref name=\"guardian\">https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jul/01/riddle-of-the-sands-the-truth-behind-stolen-beaches-and-dredged-islands</ref><ref name=\"toc\">https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/07/03/singapore-under-scrutiny-for-alleged-involvement-in-illegal-sand-import-for-land-reclamation/</ref> using it for [[Land reclamation in Singapore|land reclamation]] that has increased the country's size by 20% since independence.<ref name='guardian'/>  Much of the imported sand has reportedly been mined illegally in Malaysia, Indonesia and Cambodia.<ref name='guardian'/><ref name='toc'/>\n\n==Effects==\nAlthough sand theft does not seem to be a serious problem at first, it is nonetheless a serious problem as the removal of sand facilitates [[soil salinisation]].

The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice. Prine died on April 7, 2020 of [[COVID-19]].\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life.  In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

He was active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer from the early 1970s until his death and was known for an often humorous style of original music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=September 17, 1964 |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. Army, he moved to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby.\n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], he was discovered by [[Kris Kristofferson]] (although Prine himself credited film critic [[Roger Ebert]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-prine-roger-ebert-first-review/|title=How an Unplanned Roger Ebert Review Launched John Prine's Career|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref>), resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|self-titled debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice. Prine died on April 7, 2020 of [[COVID-19]].\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life.  In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

Perot claimed to represent a viable alternative to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and, as a result, founded the Reform Party. Perot won 8.4 percent of the popular vote in 1996. Although he did not receive a single electoral vote, no other [[List of third party and independent performances in United States elections|third-party or independent candidate]] has since managed to receive as high a share of the vote.\n\nThe party has nominated several notable cadidates over the years, including Perot himself, [[Pat Buchanan]], and [[Ralph Nader]]. Its most significant victory came when [[Jesse Ventura]] was elected [[Governor of Minnesota]] in [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]], although he left the party shortly into his term. [[Donald Trump]] was a member of the Reform Party during his [[Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaign|2000 presidential campaign]]. In around the year 2000, party infighting and scandals led to a major decline in the party's strength. Beginning with [[Pat Buchanan 2000 presidential campaign|Buchanan's poor showing]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]], no Reform Party presidential candidate has been able to attain at least 1 percent of the vote.\n\n==The Ross Perot movement==\n===Ross Perot's 1992 presidential election campaign===\nThe party grew out of [[Ross Perot]]'s efforts in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], where&mdash;running as an independent&mdash;he became the first non-major party candidate since 1912 to have been considered viable enough to win the presidency. Perot received attention for focusing on fiscal issues such as the [[Government budget deficit|federal deficit]] and [[government debt|national debt]]; government reform issues such as [[term limits]], [[campaign finance reform]], and lobbying reform; and issues on trade. A large part of his following was grounded in the belief he was addressing vital problems largely ignored by the two major parties.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.reformparty.org|title=Welcome to the Reform Party National Committee website|author=|date=|website=Reform Party National Committee}}</ref>\n\nA Gallup poll showed Perot with a slim lead, but on July 19 he suspended his campaign, accusing Republican operatives of threatening to sabotage his daughter's wedding.{{fact|date=June 2019}} He was accused by ''[[Newsweek]]'' of being a \"quitter\" in a well-publicized cover-page article.{{fact|date=June 2019}} After resuming his campaign on October 1, Perot was dogged by the \"quitter\" moniker and other allegations concerning his character.{{fact|date=June 2019}} On Election Day many voters were confused as to whether Perot was actually still a candidate. He ended up receiving about 18.9 percent of the popular vote, a record level of popularity not seen in an independent candidacy since former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] ran on the \"Bull Moose\" [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1912. He continued being politically involved after the election, turning his campaign organization ([[United We Stand America]]) into a lobbying group. One of his primary goals was the defeat of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] during this period.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n==Foundation and rise of the party==\nIn 1995, Republicans took control of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], largely on the strength of the \"[[Contract with America]]\", which recognized and promised to deal with many of the issues Perot's voters had mobilized to support in 1992. However, two of the major provisions (Constitutional amendments for term limits and the balanced budgets) failed to secure the two-thirds congressional majorities required to be submitted to the states.\n\nDissatisfied, the grassroots organizations that had made Perot's 1992 candidacy possible began to band together to found a [[Third party (United States)|third party]] intended to rival the Republicans and Democrats. For legal reasons, the party ended up being called the \"Reform Party\" (\"Independent Party\" was preferred, but already taken, as were several variants on the name). A drive to get the party on the ballot in all fifty states succeeded, although it ended with lawsuits in some regions over state [[ballot access]] requirements. In a few areas, minor parties became incorporated as state party organizations.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n==Apex: 1996 presidential election==\n\n===Nomination campaign===\nAt first, when the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 election season]] arrived, Perot held off from entering the contest for the Reform Party's presidential nomination, calling for others to try for the ticket. The only person who announced such an intention was [[Richard Lamm|Dick Lamm]], former Governor of [[Colorado]]. After the [[Federal Election Commission]] indicated only Perot and not Lamm would be able to secure federal matching funds\u2014because his 1992 campaign was as an independent\u2014Perot entered the race. Some were upset that Perot changed his mind, because in their view, Perot overshadowed [[Richard Lamm 1996 presidential campaign|Lamm's]] run for the party nomination. This built up to the beginning of a splinter within the movement, when it was alleged certain problems in the primary process\u2014such as many Lamm supporters not receiving ballots, and some primary voters receiving multiple ballots\u2014were Perot's doing. The Reform Party claimed these problems stemmed from the petition process for getting the Reform Party on the ballot in all of the states, since the party claimed they used the names and addresses of petition signers as the basis of who received ballots. Primary ballots were sent by mail to designated voters. Eventually, Perot was nominated and he chose economist [[Pat Choate]] as his vice-presidential candidate.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n===Exclusion from the debates===\nBetween 1992 and 1996, the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] changed its rules regarding how candidates could qualify to participate in the presidential debates. As Perot had previously done very well in debates, it was a decisive blow to the campaign when the Commission ruled that he could not participate on the basis of somewhat vague criteria \u2014 such as that a candidate was required to have already been endorsed by \"a substantial number of major news organizations,\" with \"substantial\" being a number to be decided by the Commission on a case-by-case basis. Perot could not have qualified for the debates in 1992 under these rules, and was able to show that various famous U.S. presidents would likewise have been excluded from modern debate by the Commission on Presidential Debates.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\nDespite legal action by the Perot team, and an 80 percent majority of Americans supporting his participation in the debates, the Commission refused to budge and Perot was reduced to making his points heard via a series of half-hour \"commercials\". In the end, Perot and Choate won 8 percent of the vote.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n==Plateau and decline==\n\n===1997===\nBy October 1997, factional disputes began to emerge with the departure of a group that believed Perot had rigged the 1996 party primary to defeat Lamm.  These individuals eventually established the \"American Reform Party\" (ARP).  The ARP is actually a minor [[political action committee]].  Then chairman, Roy Downing, said the split came about when it was \"...discovered [that the Reform Party] was a top down party instead of a bottom up organization.\"<ref>[http://www.ahherald.com/content/view/3623/28/ Atlantic Herald - Fall of the Reform Party]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Although members of the group attempted to persuade former [[Colorado]] Governor [[Dick Lamm]] \u2013 Perot's chief rival for the nomination \u2013 to run for president as an Independent, he declined, pointing out that he had promised before running that he would not challenge the party's decision.  During this time, Perot himself chose to concentrate on lobbying efforts through [[United We Stand America]].<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/> \n\n====American Reform Party====\n{{anchor|American Reform Party}}\nWhen the ARP was founded, [[Jackie Salit]] noted in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'': \"At its founding meeting in Kansas City in 1997, the 40 black delegates in the room, led by the country\u2019s foremost African-American independent \u2013 [[Lenora Fulani]] \u2013 represented the first time in US history that African-Americans were present at the founding of a major national political party.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/0216/Tea-party-activists-Don-t-confuse-them-with-independents |title=Tea party activists: Don't confuse them with independents |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe ARP has yet to organize in more than a few states.  In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]], [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004]], and [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008]] elections, the American Reform Party supported [[Ralph Nader]] for president.  The ARP is not a political party in the conventional sense.  It does not have ballot access in any state, and it does not run candidates.  It supports third party candidates and independents who support the primary principals of the Party's platform.\n\nAbout 2010\u20132011, the party shifted from a relatively [[centrist]] platform to a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]-style [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]] one. In the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]], the ARP endorsed Republican Party nominee [[Mitt Romney]] against incumbent president [[Barack Obama]].<ref>[http://www.americanreformparty.net/blog/comments/american_reform_party_endorses_mitt_romney_for_president \"American Reform Party Endorses Mitt Romney for President\", ARP statement November 2, 2012]</ref> In the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], the Party endorsed the Republican candidate [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanreformparty.net/blog/comments/the-american-reform-party-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-of-the-united|title=The American Reform Party endorses Donald Trump for President of the United States {{!}} American Reform Party|last=Party|first=American Reform|website=www.americanreformparty.net|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref>\n\n;Affiliates\n*In New York State, the Integrity Party is an ARP affiliate. The group, led by Darren Johnson, used the state's fusion election system in cross-endorsing a Democratic sheriff candidate, Vincent Demarco, in Suffolk County, helping him narrowly win election. The party had also run a host of other candidates and attempted to go statewide in 2006, fielding [[Phoebe Legere]] as a candidate in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 New York gubernatorial election]].  Legere and the party did not qualify for the November ballot.\n\n*The [[Reform Party (Northern Mariana Islands)|Reform Party of Northern Mariana Islands]] is an affiliate of the ARP.\n\n===Mid-term elections of 1998===\nIn 1998, the Reform Party received a boost when [[Jesse Ventura]] was [[1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election|elected]] Governor of Minnesota.\nAccording to the [[League of Women Voters]], the Reform Party USA obtained more votes nationwide in 1998 than did any other third party in America (without those garnered by Ventura). Counting Ventura's performance, Reformers took in more votes than all other third parties in the United States combined, establishing the Reform Party as America's third largest party.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n===2000 presidential election===\n{{see also|Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaign}}\n{{see also|Pat Buchanan 2000 presidential campaign}}\n\nThe Reform Party's presidential candidate for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] was due federal matching funds of $12.5 million, based on Perot's 8 percent showing in 1996.

Reform Party representatives had long stated beliefs that their party could bring together people from both sides of these issues, which they consider divisive, to address what they considered to be more vital concerns as expressed in their platform. The idea was to form a large coalition of moderates; that intention was overridden in 2001 by the Buchanan takeover which rewrote the RPUSA Constitution to include platform planks opposed to any form of abortion. The Buchananists, in turn, were overridden by the 2002 Convention which reverted the Constitution to its 1996 version and the party's original stated goals.\n\n==Active state affiliates==\nThe party's active state affiliates are:<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n*[[Reform Party of Texas (political party)|Reform Party of Texas]]\n*[[Reform Party of California]]\n*[[Reform Party of New Jersey]] (reorganized in 2010)\n*[[Reform Party of Florida]]\n*[[Reform Party of North Carolina]]\n*[[Reform Party of New York]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Absentee ballot]]\n* [[Write-in candidate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official}}\n*[http://www.americanreformparty.net/ American Reform Party]\n\n{{Reform Party (U.S.)|state=expanded}}\n{{United States political parties}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reform Party of the United States Of America}}\n[[Category:Reform Party of the United States of America| ]]\n[[Category:1995 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:Nationalist parties in the United States]]\n[[Category:Political career of Donald Trump]]\n[[Category:Political parties established in 1995]]\n[[Category:Political parties in the United States]]\n[[Category:Ralph Nader]]\n[[Category:Ross Perot]]\n[[Category:Pat Buchanan]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American political party}}\n{{About|the party founded by Ross Perot|the short-lived party formed in Wisconsin in 1871 |Reform Party (19th-century Wisconsin)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Infobox political party\n| name = Reform Party of the<br>United States of America\n| logo = Reform Party of the United States of America logo.png\n| colorcode = {{Reform Party (United States)/meta/color}}\n| foundation = {{start date and age|1995}}\n| ideology = {{no wrap|[[Populism]]<br>[[Radical centrism]]<br>[[Electoral reform in the United States|Electoral reform]]}}\n| headquarters = [[Bohemia, New York]]\n| international = None\n| website = {{url|http://www.reformparty.org/}}\n| country = United States\n| chairperson = Bill C.

Perot claimed to represent a viable alternative to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], and, as a result, founded the Reform Party. Perot won 8.4 percent of the popular vote in 1996. Although he did not receive a single electoral vote, no other [[List of third party and independent performances in United States elections|third-party or independent candidate]] has since managed to receive as high a share of the vote.\n\nThe party has nominated several notable candidates over the years, including Perot himself, [[Pat Buchanan]], and [[Ralph Nader]]. Its most significant victory came when [[Jesse Ventura]] was elected [[Governor of Minnesota]] in [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]], although he left the party shortly into his term. [[Donald Trump]] was a member of the Reform Party during his [[Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaign|2000 presidential campaign]]. In around the year 2000, party infighting and scandals led to a major decline in the party's strength. Beginning with [[Pat Buchanan 2000 presidential campaign|Buchanan's poor showing]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]], no Reform Party presidential candidate has been able to attain at least 1 percent of the vote.\n\n==The Ross Perot movement==\n===Ross Perot's 1992 presidential election campaign===\nThe party grew out of [[Ross Perot]]'s efforts in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]], where&mdash;running as an independent&mdash;he became the first non-major party candidate since 1912 to have been considered viable enough to win the presidency. Perot received attention for focusing on fiscal issues such as the [[Government budget deficit|federal deficit]] and [[government debt|national debt]]; government reform issues such as [[term limits]], [[campaign finance reform]], and lobbying reform; and issues on trade. A large part of his following was grounded in the belief he was addressing vital problems largely ignored by the two major parties.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.reformparty.org|title=Welcome to the Reform Party National Committee website|author=|date=|website=Reform Party National Committee}}</ref>\n\nA Gallup poll showed Perot with a slim lead, but on July 19 he suspended his campaign, accusing Republican operatives of threatening to sabotage his daughter's wedding.{{fact|date=June 2019}} He was accused by ''[[Newsweek]]'' of being a \"quitter\" in a well-publicized cover-page article.{{fact|date=June 2019}} After resuming his campaign on October 1, Perot was dogged by the \"quitter\" moniker and other allegations concerning his character.{{fact|date=June 2019}} On Election Day many voters were confused as to whether Perot was actually still a candidate. He ended up receiving about 18.9 percent of the popular vote, a record level of popularity not seen in an independent candidacy since former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] ran on the \"Bull Moose\" [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1912. He continued being politically involved after the election, turning his campaign organization ([[United We Stand America]]) into a lobbying group. One of his primary goals was the defeat of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] during this period.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n==Foundation and rise of the party==\nIn 1995, Republicans took control of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], largely on the strength of the \"[[Contract with America]]\", which recognized and promised to deal with many of the issues Perot's voters had mobilized to support in 1992. However, two of the major provisions (Constitutional amendments for term limits and the balanced budgets) failed to secure the two-thirds congressional majorities required to be submitted to the states.\n\nDissatisfied, the grassroots organizations that had made Perot's 1992 candidacy possible began to band together to found a [[Third party (United States)|third party]] intended to rival the Republicans and Democrats. For legal reasons, the party ended up being called the \"Reform Party\" (\"Independent Party\" was preferred, but already taken, as were several variants on the name). A drive to get the party on the ballot in all fifty states succeeded, although it ended with lawsuits in some regions over state [[ballot access]] requirements. In a few areas, minor parties became incorporated as state party organizations.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n==Apex: 1996 presidential election==\n\n===Nomination campaign===\nAt first, when the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 election season]] arrived, Perot held off from entering the contest for the Reform Party's presidential nomination, calling for others to try for the ticket. The only person who announced such an intention was [[Richard Lamm|Dick Lamm]], former Governor of [[Colorado]]. After the [[Federal Election Commission]] indicated only Perot and not Lamm would be able to secure federal matching funds\u2014because his 1992 campaign was as an independent\u2014Perot entered the race. Some were upset that Perot changed his mind, because in their view, Perot overshadowed [[Richard Lamm 1996 presidential campaign|Lamm's]] run for the party nomination. This built up to the beginning of a splinter within the movement, when it was alleged certain problems in the primary process\u2014such as many Lamm supporters not receiving ballots, and some primary voters receiving multiple ballots\u2014were Perot's doing. The Reform Party claimed these problems stemmed from the petition process for getting the Reform Party on the ballot in all of the states, since the party claimed they used the names and addresses of petition signers as the basis of who received ballots. Primary ballots were sent by mail to designated voters. Eventually, Perot was nominated and he chose economist [[Pat Choate]] as his vice-presidential candidate.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n===Exclusion from the debates===\nBetween 1992 and 1996, the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] changed its rules regarding how candidates could qualify to participate in the presidential debates. As Perot had previously done very well in debates, it was a decisive blow to the campaign when the Commission ruled that he could not participate on the basis of somewhat vague criteria \u2014 such as that a candidate was required to have already been endorsed by \"a substantial number of major news organizations,\" with \"substantial\" being a number to be decided by the Commission on a case-by-case basis. Perot could not have qualified for the debates in 1992 under these rules, and was able to show that various famous U.S. presidents would likewise have been excluded from modern debate by the Commission on Presidential Debates.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\nDespite legal action by the Perot team, and an 80 percent majority of Americans supporting his participation in the debates, the Commission refused to budge and Perot was reduced to making his points heard via a series of half-hour \"commercials\". In the end, Perot and Choate won 8 percent of the vote.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n==Plateau and decline==\n\n===1997===\nBy October 1997, factional disputes began to emerge with the departure of a group that believed Perot had rigged the 1996 party primary to defeat Lamm.  These individuals eventually established the \"American Reform Party\" (ARP).  The ARP is actually a minor [[political action committee]].  Then chairman, Roy Downing, said the split came about when it was \"...discovered [that the Reform Party] was a top down party instead of a bottom up organization.\"<ref>[http://www.ahherald.com/content/view/3623/28/ Atlantic Herald - Fall of the Reform Party]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Although members of the group attempted to persuade former [[Colorado]] Governor [[Dick Lamm]] \u2013 Perot's chief rival for the nomination \u2013 to run for president as an Independent, he declined, pointing out that he had promised before running that he would not challenge the party's decision.  During this time, Perot himself chose to concentrate on lobbying efforts through [[United We Stand America]].<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/> \n\n====American Reform Party====\n{{anchor|American Reform Party}}\nWhen the ARP was founded, [[Jackie Salit]] noted in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'': \"At its founding meeting in Kansas City in 1997, the 40 black delegates in the room, led by the country\u2019s foremost African-American independent \u2013 [[Lenora Fulani]] \u2013 represented the first time in US history that African-Americans were present at the founding of a major national political party.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/0216/Tea-party-activists-Don-t-confuse-them-with-independents |title=Tea party activists: Don't confuse them with independents |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe ARP has yet to organize in more than a few states.  In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]], [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004]], and [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008]] elections, the American Reform Party supported [[Ralph Nader]] for president.  The ARP is not a political party in the conventional sense.  It does not have ballot access in any state, and it does not run candidates.  It supports third party candidates and independents who support the primary principals of the Party's platform.\n\nAbout 2010\u20132011, the party shifted from a relatively [[centrist]] platform to a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]]-style [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]] one. In the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]], the ARP endorsed Republican Party nominee [[Mitt Romney]] against incumbent president [[Barack Obama]].<ref>[http://www.americanreformparty.net/blog/comments/american_reform_party_endorses_mitt_romney_for_president \"American Reform Party Endorses Mitt Romney for President\", ARP statement November 2, 2012]</ref> In the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], the Party endorsed the Republican candidate [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanreformparty.net/blog/comments/the-american-reform-party-endorses-donald-trump-for-president-of-the-united|title=The American Reform Party endorses Donald Trump for President of the United States {{!}} American Reform Party|last=Party|first=American Reform|website=www.americanreformparty.net|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref>\n\n;Affiliates\n*In New York State, the Integrity Party is an ARP affiliate. The group, led by Darren Johnson, used the state's fusion election system in cross-endorsing a Democratic sheriff candidate, Vincent Demarco, in Suffolk County, helping him narrowly win election. The party had also run a host of other candidates and attempted to go statewide in 2006, fielding [[Phoebe Legere]] as a candidate in the [[New York gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 New York gubernatorial election]].  Legere and the party did not qualify for the November ballot.\n\n*The [[Reform Party (Northern Mariana Islands)|Reform Party of Northern Mariana Islands]] is an affiliate of the ARP.\n\n===Mid-term elections of 1998===\nIn 1998, the Reform Party received a boost when [[Jesse Ventura]] was [[1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election|elected]] Governor of Minnesota.\nAccording to the [[League of Women Voters]], the Reform Party USA obtained more votes nationwide in 1998 than did any other third party in America (without those garnered by Ventura). Counting Ventura's performance, Reformers took in more votes than all other third parties in the United States combined, establishing the Reform Party as America's third largest party.<ref name=\"reformparty.org\"/>\n\n===2000 presidential election===\n{{see also|Donald Trump 2000 presidential campaign}}\n{{see also|Pat Buchanan 2000 presidential campaign}}\n\nThe Reform Party's presidential candidate for the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] was due federal matching funds of $12.5 million, based on Perot's 8 percent showing in 1996.

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]]. A three-stage rocket with four strap-on [[liquid rocket booster]]s, it is currently the second most powerful member of the [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March rocket family]] after the [[Long_March_5|Long March 5]] and the heaviest of the [[Long March 3 rocket family]], and is mainly used to place [[communications satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]]s.\n\nAn enhanced version, the Long March 3B/E or G2, was introduced in 2007 to increase the rocket's [[Geosynchronous transfer orbit|GTO]] cargo capacity and lift heavier [[Geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] communications satellites. The Long March 3B also served as the basis for the medium-capacity [[Long March 3C]], which was first launched in 2008.\n\n{{As of|2020|04}}, the Long March 3B and 3B/E have conducted 63<!-- UPDATE after each launch --> successful launches, plus two failures and two partial failures, giving them a success rate of {{percent|63|67|1}}.<!-- UPDATE after each launch -->\n\n==History==\n[[File:CZ-3B.svg|thumb|left|70px|A diagram of the Long March 3B, showing its outboard liquid rocket boosters.]]\n\nThe development of the Long March 3B began in 1986 to meet the needs of the international GEO communications satellite market.

Long March 3B with [[Intelsat 708]] failed just after liftoff when the launch vehicle veered off course and exploded when it hit the ground at T+23 seconds. One person on the ground was killed by the explosion (the total number of casualties is unknown). The cause of the accident was traced to short-circuiting of the vehicle's guidance platform at liftoff.<ref name=\"cnn1999\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/resources/1999/coxreport/satellite/pg1.html|title=Satellite Launches in the PRC: Loral|work=CNN|accessdate= 8 August 2018|date=25 May 1999}}</ref> The number of casualties is debated and unclear even decades after the accident. The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States since the information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review |date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it's incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China\".<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn 31 August 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure. Officials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on 7 July 2017, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\". The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own power.<ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_satellite_Zhongxing_9A_enters_preset_orbit_999.html</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) launch failure ===\nOn 9 April 2020, a Long March 3B launcher failed after lifting off from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in the southwestern [[Sichuan]] province at 11:46 UTC during the launch of an Indonesian communications satellite, [[Nusantara Satu|Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua)]]. But the rocket malfunctioned minutes later, during the planned burn of the third stage. Wreckage from the third stage and the Palapa-N1 spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere, leading to sightings of fiery debris in the skies over Guam. With the Long March 3B failure, Chinese rockets have faltered on two missions in less than a month. A Long March 7A rocket failed to place a satellite in orbit on 16 March 2020 after taking off from the [[Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site]] on [[Hainan Island]], located in southern China.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/09/chinese-rocket-fails-during-launch-of-indonesian-communications-satellite/ - 9 April 2020</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External

[[carrier rocket]]. Introduced in 1996, it is launched from Launch Area 2 and 3 at the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in [[Sichuan]].

The Chinese official death toll is usually of the order of few casualties, whereas some estimates place the number of people dead to a few hundred (see [[Intelsat 708]]-article).\n\nThe participation of [[Space Systems/Loral]] in the accident investigation caused great political controversy in the United States since the information provided during the accident investigation would help China improve its rockets and ballistic missiles. The U.S. Congress reclassified satellite technology as a [[Ammunition|munition]] and placed it back under the restrictive [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] in 1998.<ref name=\"zenio2006\">{{cite news|last1=Zelnio|first1=Ryan|title=A short history of export control policy|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/528/1|work=The Space Review |date=January 9, 2006}}</ref> No license to launch U.S. spacecraft on Chinese rockets has been approved by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] since then, and an official at the [[Bureau of Industry and Security]] emphasized in 2016 that \"no U.S.-origin content, regardless of significance, regardless of whether it's incorporated into a foreign-made item, can go to China\".<ref name=\"selding2016\">{{cite news|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=U.S. ITAR satellite export regime's effects still strong in Europe|url=http://spacenews.com/u-s-itar-satellite-export-regimes-effects-still-strong-in-europe/|work=SpaceNews|date=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-D partial launch failure ===\nOn 31 August 2009, during the launch of [[Palapa-D]], the third stage engine under-performed and placed the satellite into a lower than planned orbit. The satellite was able to make up the performance shortfall using its own engine and reach geosynchronous orbit, but with its lifetime shortened to 10.5 years from the originally projected 15-16 years. The investigation found that the failure was due to burn-through of the engine's gas generator, and that \"the most likely cause of the burn-through was a foreign matter or humidity-caused icing in the engine's liquid-hydrogen injectors\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Burn-through Blamed in China Long March Mishap|url=http://spacenews.com/burn-through-blamed-china-long-march-mishap/|publisher=SpaceNews|date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ChinaSat-9A partial launch failure ===\nOn 19 June 2017, a Long March 3B/E mission carrying [[ChinaSat_9A|ChinaSat-9A]] ended in partial failure. Officials did not release details regarding the status of the mission for at least 4 hours after liftoff.<ref>http://spaceflight101.com/long-march-3b-zhongxing-9a-launch/</ref> Two weeks later, on 7 July 2017, officials confirmed that the mission had been anomalous, with Space Daily reporting that \"an anomaly was found on the carrier rocket's rolling control thruster, part of the attitude control engine, during the third gliding phase\". The failure in the rocket's third stage left the payload in a lower than intended orbit, and the payload was forced to spend two weeks reaching its intended orbit under its own power.<ref>http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Chinese_satellite_Zhongxing_9A_enters_preset_orbit_999.html</ref>\n\n=== Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) launch failure ===\nOn 9 April 2020, a Long March 3B launcher failed after lifting off from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]] in the southwestern Sichuan province at 11:46 UTC during the launch of an Indonesian communications satellite, [[Nusantara Satu|Palapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua)]]. But the rocket malfunctioned minutes later, during the planned burn of the third stage. Wreckage from the third stage and the Palapa-N1 spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere, leading to sightings of fiery debris in the skies over Guam. With the Long March 3B failure, Chinese rockets have faltered on two missions in less than a month. A Long March 7A rocket failed to place a satellite in orbit on 16 March 2020 after taking off from the [[Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site]] on [[Hainan Island]], located in southern China.<ref>https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/09/chinese-rocket-fails-during-launch-of-indonesian-communications-satellite/ - 9 April 2020</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight|China}}\n*[http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/report/1999/3b.htm LM-3B User's Manual] at GlobalSecurity.org\n*[http://www.calt.com/english/ps/index.html Long March-3B (LM-3B)] at the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology\n\n{{Long March rockets}}\n{{Expendable launch systems}}\n{{CLEP}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Long March 3b}}\n[[Category:Long March (rocket family)]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1996]]\n", "name_user": "CRS-20", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePalapa-N1 (Nusantara Dua) launch failure", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_3B"}
