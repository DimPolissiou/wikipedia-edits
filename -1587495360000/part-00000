He is a strange, remote-controlled [[teddy bear]] who proclaims himself to be the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy and initiates a life of mutual killing among the students. He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves. Seen from the front his left half is a cute white teddy bear with black details and grey shading; his right half has black fur and adds red as a spot color applied to his eye\nto contribute to his sadistic appearance together with an evil smirk.\n\nThe identity of Monokuma's controller, as well as his motives for bringing the students together, are central to the mysteries that the students must investigate. It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope.

An ordinary high school student who was accepted to the academy by raffle. He has no spectacular talents, aside from his belief that he is a bit more optimistic than most people, and was given the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}} due to winning the lottery. Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}.

However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all. Makoto also appears in ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls|Danganronpa Another Episode]]''. He returns as the protagonist of ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School|Danganronpa 3]]'', where he becomes involved in Monokuma's Monokuma Hunter game. His forbidden action is \"running in the hallway.\" After surviving the Monokuma Hunter game, Makoto becomes the headmaster of the rebuilt Hope's Peak Academy.<ref name=\"anotherepappearance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Has Danganronpa 1's Hero, Makoto Naegi, In It - Siliconera|work=Siliconera|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230839/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|archive-date=2015-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyoko Kirigiri|\u9727\u5207 \u97ff\u5b50|Kirigiri Ky\u014dko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Erika Harlacher]] (game), [[Caitlin Glass]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/357985813117665280|title=Erika Harlacher on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414012713/https://twitter.com/erikaharlacher/status/357985813117665280|archive-date=2016-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The main heroine of the first game.

In ''Danganronpa 3'', she becomes involved in the Monokuma Hunter game alongside other Future Foundation members. She is presumably killed by the poison in her wristband as a result of her forbidden action, \"passing the fourth time limit with Makoto still alive.\" At the end of the series, it is revealed she had survived thanks to an antidote created by Seiko, which slowed the poison's effects and put her in a coma until Mikan revived her.

A charismatic [[gyaru]] fashion model who has modeled for many popular magazines. She is thought to have been killed by Monokuma near the start of the game, having been impaled by several spears after assaulting Monokuma as punishment for breaking the school rules. It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support. By the time the survivors confront her, it is said that Junko has gone completely insane, her original personality long since lost in her psychosis. She is also the cause of the current state of the school and the world, having manipulated and brainwashed the school's disgruntled reserve course students into rioting over their unfair treatment, which the school desperately tried to cover up until it spilled out into the outside world and caused a worldwide uprising against those perceived as special or privileged. When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students. At the last second before her death, she becomes bored with despair and dies without knowing the despair of death she was so excited about mere seconds ago. Her body is then dismembered by several members of Ultimate Despair and the parts grafted onto their bodies.

She attempts to get the remaining students to graduate so that her personality can take over the real world bodies of those that died within the virtual world, but she is ultimately thwarted by Hajime Hinata and the other students, being destroyed when the virtual world is shut down. Her avatar appears as a fully three-dimensional giant version possessing a video cell phone that she uses to communicate with the students in the virtual world. She reveals that, after having failed twice, she doesn't feel despair at her defeat, just disappointment, which she had earlier claimed to be the one emotion that she hates above all else since it can't be used constructively in any way.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mukuro Ikusaba|\u6226\u5203 \u3080\u304f\u308d|Ikusaba Mukuro}}\n:{{voiced by|Megumi Toyoguchi|[[Amanda Celine Miller]] (game), [[Jamie Marchi]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n:The elusive sixteenth student of Hope's Peak Academy, who the others only become aware of when she is announced as the sixth murder victim.

It is revealed that Mukuro was actually Junko's twin sister and one of the Super High School Level Despair Students and was disguised as Junko at the beginning of the killing game. However, Junko became bored with the original plan and killed Mukuro on a whim after her sister betrayed her. In the alternative story depicted in the ''Danganronpa IF'' digital novel included with ''Danganronpa 2'', Mukuro is saved from being killed by Junko thanks to Makoto and decides to turn against Junko and help everyone escape from the academy alive once she realizes that Junko is beyond saving. During the novel, it is revealed that Mukuro does not share Junko's nihilist philosophy and only involved herself with Ultimate Despair because she loved Junko too much to abandon her. She also has a crush on Makoto, since he was not intimidated by her military background and talked to her like a normal person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Alter Ego|\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30a8\u30b4|Arut\u0101 Ego}}\n:{{voiced by|K\u014dki Miyata|Dorothy Elias-Fahn (game), [[Kara Edwards]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n:An [[artificial intelligence]] program left behind by Chihiro following his death. He generally speaks with Chihiro's voice and likeness, but can also imitate other students.

Afterwards, Alter Ego asks Makoto and Kyoko to help connect him to the school network so he can find out more, but he is soon discovered by Monokuma and is destroyed by a bulldozer following the fourth trial. However, he manages to leave behind a virus in the network which helps save Makoto when Monokuma attempts to execute him.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future. He and his friends then broadcast a video claiming responsibility for the final killing game, freeing the Future Foundation of suspicion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Nanami|\u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb|Nanami Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Christine Marie Cabanos]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/435879404586020864|title=Christine M.

She accidentally kills Nagito, falling into his trap which was meant to ensure her survival alone, but she thwarts his plans by confessing her identity and offering herself to be executed by getting crushed by a [[Tetris]] block in order to save the remaining students. It is learned during the graduation that she is actually an AI program designed to observe and protect the students during the Future Foundation's experiment. However, some of her consciousness remains, allowing her to help Hajime during his conflict.

Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

A soft spoken, unsure boy, Shuichi lacks the self-confidence to strive to his full potential. Though well known in the police department for solving numerous murder cases as an apprentice to his uncle, he believes he doesn't deserve his Ultimate title due to him solving cases by chance. However, after developing a close bond with Kaede, she motivates him and helps raise his self-esteem, which results in Shuichi quickly becoming a central figure during the class trials. Following Kaede's death, Shuichi becomes close with his fellow students, Kaito and Maki. Prior to entering the game, Shuichi is revealed to have been an ordinary, but sociopathic, high-school student who desired to play the role of an evil detective during the game, having concocted what he believed to be the perfect murder after watching every season of the killing game.

While encouraging the other students to trust one another and work together, she strives to get them all out of the school, repeatedly reaffirming, \u201cOnce we get out, we\u2019ll all be friends.\u201d Kaede's desperation to end the killing game drives her to concoct a plan to murder the Mastermind, seemingly leading to the death of the innocent Rantaro and resulting in her execution by hanging. In Chapter 6, it is revealed that Kaede's plan had actually failed to kill anyone, but that the Mastermind proceeded to kill Rantaro and have Kaede framed for the murder anyways. Prior to entering the game, much like everyone else, Kaede was an ordinary individual who willingly had her previous life's memories erased in order to compete on the killing show with a talent and fake background.

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial. Although he survives the final trial, he launches an attack on the school and self-destructs to destroy the dome surrounding the school and execute Tsumugi, effectively making him the final casualty of the game.\n\n;{{nihongo|Maki Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd \u9b54\u59eb|Harukawa Maki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]}} (Japanese), [[Erica Mendez]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tsunderica/status/881269561995087872|title=Got the okay to say that I'm Maki Harukawa in Danganronpa V3!

He has no spectacular talents, aside from his belief that he is a bit more optimistic than most people, and was given the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}} due to winning the lottery. Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}.

However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all. Makoto also appears in ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls|Danganronpa Another Episode]]''. He returns as the protagonist of ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School|Danganronpa 3]]'', where he becomes involved in Monokuma's Monokuma Hunter game. His forbidden action is \"running in the hallway.\" After surviving the Monokuma Hunter game, Makoto becomes the headmaster of the rebuilt Hope's Peak Academy.<ref name=\"anotherepappearance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Has Danganronpa 1's Hero, Makoto Naegi, In It - Siliconera|work=Siliconera|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230839/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|archive-date=2015-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyoko Kirigiri|\u9727\u5207 \u97ff\u5b50|Kirigiri Ky\u014dko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Erika Harlacher]] (game), [[Caitlin Glass]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/357985813117665280|title=Erika Harlacher on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414012713/https://twitter.com/erikaharlacher/status/357985813117665280|archive-date=2016-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The main heroine of the first game.

In ''Danganronpa 3'', she becomes involved in the Monokuma Hunter game alongside other Future Foundation members. She is presumably killed by the poison in her wristband as a result of her forbidden action, \"passing the fourth time limit with Makoto still alive.\" At the end of the series, it is revealed she had survived thanks to an antidote created by Seiko, which slowed the poison's effects and put her in a coma until Mikan revived her.

A charismatic [[gyaru]] fashion model who has modeled for many popular magazines. She is thought to have been killed by Monokuma near the start of the game, having been impaled by several spears after assaulting Monokuma as punishment for breaking the school rules. It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support. By the time the survivors confront her, it is said that Junko has gone completely insane, her original personality long since lost in her psychosis. She is also the cause of the current state of the school and the world, having manipulated and brainwashed the school's disgruntled reserve course students into rioting over their unfair treatment, which the school desperately tried to cover up until it spilled out into the outside world and caused a worldwide uprising against those perceived as special or privileged. When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students. At the last second before her death, she becomes bored with despair and dies without knowing the despair of death she was so excited about mere seconds ago. Her body is then dismembered by several members of Ultimate Despair and the parts grafted onto their bodies.

She attempts to get the remaining students to graduate so that her personality can take over the real world bodies of those that died within the virtual world, but she is ultimately thwarted by Hajime Hinata and the other students, being destroyed when the virtual world is shut down. Her avatar appears as a fully three-dimensional giant version possessing a video cell phone that she uses to communicate with the students in the virtual world. She reveals that, after having failed twice, she doesn't feel despair at her defeat, just disappointment, which she had earlier claimed to be the one emotion that she hates above all else since it can't be used constructively in any way.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mukuro Ikusaba|\u6226\u5203 \u3080\u304f\u308d|Ikusaba Mukuro}}\n:{{voiced by|Megumi Toyoguchi|[[Amanda Celine Miller]] (game), [[Jamie Marchi]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> \n:The elusive sixteenth student of Hope's Peak Academy, who the others only become aware of when she is announced as the sixth murder victim.

It is revealed that Mukuro was actually Junko's twin sister and one of the Super High School Level Despair Students and was disguised as Junko at the beginning of the killing game. However, Junko became bored with the original plan and killed Mukuro on a whim after her sister betrayed her. In the alternative story depicted in the ''Danganronpa IF'' digital novel included with ''Danganronpa 2'', Mukuro is saved from being killed by Junko thanks to Makoto and decides to turn against Junko and help everyone escape from the academy alive once she realizes that Junko is beyond saving. During the novel, it is revealed that Mukuro does not share Junko's nihilist philosophy and only involved herself with Ultimate Despair because she loved Junko too much to abandon her. She also has a crush on Makoto, since he was not intimidated by her military background and talked to her like a normal person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Alter Ego|\u30a2\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30a8\u30b4|Arut\u0101 Ego}}\n:{{voiced by|K\u014dki Miyata|Dorothy Elias-Fahn (game), [[Kara Edwards]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n:An [[artificial intelligence]] program left behind by Chihiro following his death. He generally speaks with Chihiro's voice and likeness, but can also imitate other students. After the others discover him on a laptop Chihiro fixed, he helps them decrypt some data on the laptop to help the other students and is soon treated as a friend. Afterwards, Alter Ego asks Makoto and Kyoko to help connect him to the school network so he can find out more, but he is soon discovered by Monokuma and is destroyed by a bulldozer following the fourth trial. However, he manages to leave behind a virus in the network which helps save Makoto when Monokuma attempts to execute him.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future. He and his friends then broadcast a video claiming responsibility for the final killing game, freeing the Future Foundation of suspicion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Nanami|\u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb|Nanami Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Christine Marie Cabanos]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/435879404586020864|title=Christine M.

She accidentally kills Nagito, falling into his trap which was meant to ensure her survival alone, but she thwarts his plans by confessing her identity and offering herself to be executed by getting crushed by a [[Tetris]] block in order to save the remaining students. It is learned during the graduation that she is actually an AI program designed to observe and protect the students during the Future Foundation's experiment. However, some of her consciousness remains, allowing her to help Hajime during his conflict.

Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

A soft spoken, unsure boy, Shuichi lacks the self-confidence to strive to his full potential. Though well known in the police department for solving numerous murder cases as an apprentice to his uncle, he believes he doesn't deserve his Ultimate title due to him solving cases by chance. However, after developing a close bond with Kaede, she motivates him and helps raise his self-esteem, which results in Shuichi quickly becoming a central figure during the class trials. Following Kaede's death, Shuichi becomes close with his fellow students, Kaito and Maki. Prior to entering the game, Shuichi is revealed to have been an ordinary, but sociopathic, high-school student who desired to play the role of an evil detective during the game, having concocted what he believed to be the perfect murder after watching every season of the killing game.

While encouraging the other students to trust one another and work together, she strives to get them all out of the school, repeatedly reaffirming, \u201cOnce we get out, we\u2019ll all be friends.\u201d Kaede's desperation to end the killing game drives her to concoct a plan to murder the Mastermind, seemingly leading to the death of the innocent Rantaro and resulting in her execution by hanging. In Chapter 6, it is revealed that Kaede's plan had actually failed to kill anyone, but that the Mastermind proceeded to kill Rantaro and have Kaede framed for the murder anyways. Prior to entering the game, much like everyone else, Kaede was an ordinary individual who willingly had her previous life's memories erased in order to compete on the killing show with a talent and fake background.

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial. Although he survives the final trial, he launches an attack on the school and self-destructs to destroy the dome surrounding the school and execute Tsumugi, effectively making him the final casualty of the game.\n\n;{{nihongo|Maki Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd \u9b54\u59eb|Harukawa Maki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]}} (Japanese), [[Erica Mendez]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tsunderica/status/881269561995087872|title=Got the okay to say that I'm Maki Harukawa in Danganronpa V3!

After blackmailing Kaito through saving his life, the two conspired together to create a virtually unsolvable murder and make it impossible for the game to continue.

Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas-de-Calais, the department's [[prefectures in France|prefecture]] is its third-largest city of [[Arras]]. The population of the metropolitan area at the 2010 census was 126,395.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Calais overlooks the [[Strait of Dover]], the narrowest point in the [[English Channel]], which is only {{convert|34|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide here, and is the closest French town to [[England]].  The [[White Cliffs of Dover]] can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais.  Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the [[Channel Tunnel]] has linked nearby [[Coquelles]] to [[Folkestone]] by rail.\n\nDue to its position, Calais since the [[Middle Ages]] has been a major port and a very important centre for transport and trading with England. Calais came under English control after [[Edward III of England]] [[Siege of Calais (1346\u20131347)|captured the city]] in 1347, followed by a treaty in 1360 that formally assigned [[Pale of Calais|Calais to English rule]].  Calais grew into a thriving centre for wool production, and came to be called the \"brightest jewel in the English crown\" owing to its great importance as the gateway for the [[tin]], [[lead]], [[lace]] and wool trades (or \"staples\"). Calais remained under English control until [[Siege of Calais (1558)|its capture]] by France in 1558. The town was virtually razed to the ground during [[World War II]], when in May 1940, it was a strategic bombing target of the invading German forces who took the town during the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]].  During World War II, the Germans built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles on England.\n\nThe old part of the town, Calais proper (known as [[Calais-Nord]]), is situated on an [[artificial island]] surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies to the south and south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a [[lighthouse]] until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the [[\u00c9glise Notre-Dame de Calais|church of Notre-Dame]], built during the English occupancy of Calais. It is arguably the only church built in the [[Perpendicular Gothic|English perpendicular style]] in all of France. In this church former French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] married his wife [[Yvonne Vendroux]]. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the H\u00f4tel-de-ville (the town hall), and the [[Belfries of Belgium and France|belfry]] from the early 20th century. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually. Aside from being a key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in the [[lace]] industry for which the town is also famed.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe early history of habitation in the area is limited. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] called the settlement ''Caletum''. [[Julius Caesar]] mustered 800 to 1,000 sailing boats, five [[Roman legion|legions]] and some 2,000 horses at Calais, due to its strategic position, to attack [[Britannia]].<ref name=\"Historyws\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calais.ws/History.html |title=History |publisher=Calais.ws |accessdate=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207224409/http://www.calais.ws/History.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 }}</ref> The English could hold on to it for so many centuries because it remained an island surrounded by marshes, and therefore almost impossible to attack from the land.

In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English.<ref name=\"Ruler69\"/> There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees.<ref name=\"Ruler69\">Ruler (2011), p.69</ref> The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware.<ref name=\"EB\">[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] 11th ed. 1911</ref> Principal imports in the early 20th century included cotton and silk goods, coal, iron and steel, petroleum, timber, raw wool, cotton yarn and cork.<ref name=\"EB\"/> During the five years 1901\u20131905 the average annual value of exports was \u00a38,388,000 (\u00a36,363,000 in the years 1896\u20131900), of imports \u00a34,145,000 (\u00a33,759,000 in 1896\u20131900).<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nAs a fishing port, Calais has several notable fishing markets including Les D\u00e9lices de la Mer and Hu\u00eetri\u00e8re Calaisenne on the Boulevard La Fayette, the latter of which is noted for its [[oyster]]s, [[lobster]] and [[crab]]s from Brittany.

It adjoins the watchtower, and during medieval times was once the heart of the city. While Calais was a territory of England (1347\u20131558), it became known as Market Square (place du March\u00e9).

Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas-de-Calais, the department's [[prefectures in France|prefecture]] is its third-largest city of [[Arras]]. The population of the metropolitan area at the 2010 census was 126,395.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Calais overlooks the [[Strait of Dover]], the narrowest point in the [[English Channel]], which is only {{convert|34|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide here, and is the closest French town to [[England]].  The [[White Cliffs of Dover]] can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais.  Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the [[Channel Tunnel]] has linked nearby [[Coquelles]] to [[Folkestone]] by rail.\n\nDue to its position, Calais since the [[Middle Ages]] has been a major port and a very important centre for transport and trading with England. Calais came under English control after [[Edward III of England]] [[Siege of Calais (1346\u20131347)|captured the city]] in 1347, followed by a treaty in 1360 that formally assigned [[Pale of Calais|Calais to English rule]].  Calais grew into a thriving centre for wool production, and came to be called the \"brightest jewel in the English crown\" owing to its great importance as the gateway for the [[tin]], [[lead]], [[lace]] and wool trades (or \"staples\"). Calais remained under English control until [[Siege of Calais (1558)|its capture]] by France in 1558. The town was virtually razed to the ground during [[World War II]], when in May 1940, it was a strategic bombing target of the invading German forces who took the town during the [[Siege of Calais (1940)|Siege of Calais]].  During World War II, the Germans built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles on England.\n\nThe old part of the town, Calais proper (known as [[Calais-Nord]]), is situated on an [[artificial island]] surrounded by canals and harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies to the south and south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes, in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built in the 13th century, which was used as a [[lighthouse]] until 1848 when a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place is the [[\u00c9glise Notre-Dame de Calais|church of Notre-Dame]], built during the English occupancy of Calais. It is arguably the only church built in the [[Perpendicular Gothic|English perpendicular style]] in all of France. In this church former French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] married his wife [[Yvonne Vendroux]]. South of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the H\u00f4tel-de-ville (the town hall), and the [[Belfries of Belgium and France|belfry]] from the early 20th century. Today, Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually. Aside from being a key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in the [[lace]] industry for which the town is also famed.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe early history of habitation in the area is limited. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] called the settlement ''Caletum''. [[Julius Caesar]] mustered 800 to 1,000 sailing boats, five [[Roman legion|legions]] and some 2,000 horses at Calais, due to its strategic position, to attack [[Britannia]].<ref name=\"Historyws\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calais.ws/History.html |title=History |publisher=Calais.ws |accessdate=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207224409/http://www.calais.ws/History.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 }}</ref> The English could hold on to it for so many centuries because it remained an island surrounded by marshes, and therefore almost impossible to attack from the land.

More than 10 million people visit Calais annually.<ref name=\"Whitfield2005\"/>\n\nFrom medieval times, English companies thrived in Calais. Calais was a particularly important centre in the production and trade of wool and cloth, which outweighed the costs of maintaining the town as part of England. In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English.<ref name=\"Ruler69\"/> There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees.<ref name=\"Ruler69\">Ruler (2011), p.69</ref> The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware.<ref name=\"EB\">[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] 11th ed. 1911</ref> Principal imports in the early 20th century included cotton and silk goods, coal, iron and steel, petroleum, timber, raw wool, cotton yarn and cork.<ref name=\"EB\"/> During the five years 1901\u20131905 the average annual value of exports was \u00a38,388,000 (\u00a36,363,000 in the years 1896\u20131900), of imports \u00a34,145,000 (\u00a33,759,000 in 1896\u20131900).<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nAs a fishing port, Calais has several notable fishing markets including Les D\u00e9lices de la Mer and Hu\u00eetri\u00e8re Calaisenne on the Boulevard La Fayette, the latter of which is noted for its [[oyster]]s, [[lobster]] and [[crab]]s from Brittany.

It adjoins the watchtower, and during medieval times was once the heart of the city. While Calais was a territory of England (1347\u20131558), it became known as Market Square (place du March\u00e9). Only at the end of English rule did it take the name of Place d'Armes. After the reconquest of Calais in 1558 by Francis, Duke of Guise, Francis II gave Calais the right to hold a fair twice a year on the square, which still exists today, as well as a bustling Wednesday and Saturday market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calais-guide.co.uk/sights/place-darmes.html|title=Place d'Armes|publisher=Calais Guide.co.uk|accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n===H\u00f4tel de Ville===\nThe town centre, which has seen significant regeneration over the past decade, is dominated by its distinctive town hall (H\u00f4tel de Ville) at Place du Soldat Inconnu.

The pulpit and reading-desk, richly sculptured in oak, is another well-executed piece of ecclesiastical workmanship from [[St. Omer]]. The altar-piece, the Assumption, was often attributed to [[Anthony van Dyck]], though in reality it is by [[Gerard Seghers]]; whilst the painting over the side altar, once believed to be by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] <ref name=\"Calton1852\"/> is in fact by [[Pieter Van Mol]]. A high and strongly built wall, partaking more of the fortress than a cathedral in its aspect, flanks the building, and protects it from the street where formerly ran the old river, in its course through Calais to the sea.<ref name=\"Calton1852\"/>\n\nThe square, massive Norman tower has three-arched belfry windows on each face, surmounted by corner turrets, and a conically-shaped tower of octagonal proportions, topped again by a short steeple. The tower was a main viewing point for the [[Anglo-French Survey (1784\u20131790)]] which linked the [[Paris Observatory]] with the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] using [[trigonometry]]. Cross-channel sightings were made of signal lights at [[Dover Castle]] and [[Fairlight, East Sussex]].\n\nThe church was assigned as a historic monument by decree of 10 September 1913, only to have its stained glass smashed during a Zeppelin bombardment on 15 January 1915, falling through the roof.<ref name=\"MFPM2010\">{{cite book|author=Michelin / MFPM|title=Nord Pas-de-Calais Picardie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1F1kHo5cZTkC&pg=PA106|accessdate=5 February 2012|date=15 February 2010|publisher=Michelin|isbn=978-2-06-714775-1|page=106}}</ref><ref name=\"Information quarterly\">{{cite book|title=Information quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmI9AAAAYAAJ|accessdate=5 February 2012|year=1916|publisher=R.R.

The Awards include:  The Most Valuable Film of the Year, The Most Valuable Documentary of the Year, The International Green Film Award, The Award for Justice, the International Human Rights Film Award (in cooperation with [[Amnesty International]] and the Human Rights Film Network), as well as various Honorary Awards.\n\nThe Most Valuable Film of the Year and the Most Valuable Documentary of the Year are judged by a committee of more than 100 filmmakers and humanitarians each year.  The Honorary Award is awarded each year to a person for outstanding social and/or political or environmental achievements.\n\nIn 2007, Cinema for Peace launched together with [[Amnesty International]] the \u201cInternational Human Rights Film Award\u201d and in 2009, together with the Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]], [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]], in The Hague, the \u201cCinema for Peace Award for Justice\u201d. Cinema for Peace has awarded the \"International Green Film Award\" beginning in 2009, to honor members of the film community for an environmental movie or for outstanding achievements in raising awareness for green issues. The first Green Film Award Winner presented by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] for his film [[The 11th Hour (2007 film)]]. In 2010, the \u2018International Green Film Award\u2019 was presented by Mikhail Gorbachev and Leonardo DiCaprio to [[Crude (2009 film)]] and director [[Joe Berlinger]]. The 2011 International Green Film Award was presented by Opel Project Earth to ''Jane's Journey'', directed by Lorenz Knauer for his film exhibiting [[Jane Goodall]]'s travels in her work to preserve [[endangered species]] around the world.\n\n===Cinema for Peace Honorary Awards===\n \nOn the eve of the 20th anniversary of the Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 2009, former President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] received the Cinema for Peace Honorary Award for his central role in ending the [[Cold War]] and paving the way for a peaceful reunification process in Germany. At the Cinema for Peace Honorary Dinner at the China Club in Berlin, [[Bob Geldof]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] and [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], German Foreign Minister during the reunification era, were the laudation speakers. The dinner was chaired among others by arts patrons Dieter Rosenkranz and Alexander Lebedev. Chairman and CEO of [[MTV Networks International]] Bill Roedy presented on this occasion the MTV [[Free Your Mind (MTV award)|Free Your Mind]] Award to President Gorbachev.\n\nTwo-time [[Academy Award]] winner Sean Penn was awarded the Cinema for Peace Honorary Award in 2011 for his humanitarian work in New Orleans and Haiti.  In January 2010, he founded the J/P Haitian Relief Organization to aid victims of the devastating earthquake in Haiti.\n\n\"In the Land of Blood and Honey\", the directorial debut of Angelina Jolie, was honored with the \"Honorary Award for Opposing War and Genocide\" at the Cinema for Peace Berlin 2012. The film tells the story of the love between a Serbian man and a Muslim woman, who realize, upon the outbreak of the Bosnian war, they not only stand on opposing sides, but the man is now a soldier and the woman a prisoner of war. \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" depicts the horrific violence of the civil war and makes a call for peace.\n\nCharlize Theron received the Cinema for Peace Honorary Award 2013 for her commitment against the spread of HIV/AIDS among young South Africans. The South African actress and United Nations Messenger of Peace is the founder of the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP), which calls for medical education and battles against the spread of HIV.\n\n===Cinema for Peace Award for Opposing Anti-Semitism===\n\nCinema for Peace Berlin 2013 highlighted artistic and social opposition to [[anti-Semitism]] in Germany and other counties. The Cinema for Peace Honorary Award for Opposing Anti-Semitism was presented to actress Veronica Ferres, Charlotte Knobloch and Marga Spiegel, who all have been working against anti-semitism and [[xenophobia]] for many years. The award was presented by German Rabbi Daniel Alter, who was the victim of an attack motivated by religious hatred on the streets of Berlin in 2012.\n\n== Award winners 2002\u20132019 ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== 2020 ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemaforpeace-foundation.org/nominations-2020|title=Nominations 2020|website=Cinema for Peace Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for Most Valuable Movie of the Year''' to [[1917 (2019 film)|''1917'']] by [[Sam Mendes]]\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for Most Valuable Documentary of the Year''' to ''[[The Cave (2019 Syrian film)|The Cave]]'' by [[Feras Fayyad]]\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for Woman's Empowerment''' to [[A Girl from Mogadishu (film)|''A Girl from Mogadishu'']] by [[Mary McGuckian]]\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for Woman's Empowerment''' to [[Maiden (film)|''Maiden'']] by [[Alex Holmes]]\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for most Political film of the Year''' to ''[[The Report (2019 film)|The Report]]'' by [[Scott Z.

The Awards include:  The Most Valuable Film of the Year, The Most Valuable Documentary of the Year, The International Green Film Award, The Award for Justice, the International Human Rights Film Award (in cooperation with [[Amnesty International]] and the Human Rights Film Network), as well as various Honorary Awards.\n\nThe Most Valuable Film of the Year and the Most Valuable Documentary of the Year are judged by a committee of more than 100 filmmakers and humanitarians each year.  The Honorary Award is awarded each year to a person for outstanding social and/or political or environmental achievements.\n\nIn 2007, Cinema for Peace launched together with [[Amnesty International]] the \u201cInternational Human Rights Film Award\u201d and in 2009, together with the Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Court]], [[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]], in The Hague, the \u201cCinema for Peace Award for Justice\u201d. Cinema for Peace has awarded the \"International Green Film Award\" beginning in 2009, to honor members of the film community for an environmental movie or for outstanding achievements in raising awareness for green issues. The first Green Film Award Winner presented by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] for his film [[The 11th Hour (2007 film)]]. In 2010, the \u2018International Green Film Award\u2019 was presented by Mikhail Gorbachev and Leonardo DiCaprio to [[Crude (2009 film)]] and director [[Joe Berlinger]]. The 2011 International Green Film Award was presented by Opel Project Earth to ''Jane's Journey'', directed by Lorenz Knauer for his film exhibiting [[Jane Goodall]]'s travels in her work to preserve [[endangered species]] around the world.\n\n===Cinema for Peace Honorary Awards===\n \nOn the eve of the 20th anniversary of the Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 2009, former President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] received the Cinema for Peace Honorary Award for his central role in ending the [[Cold War]] and paving the way for a peaceful reunification process in Germany. At the Cinema for Peace Honorary Dinner at the China Club in Berlin, [[Bob Geldof]], [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] and [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], German Foreign Minister during the reunification era, were the laudation speakers. The dinner was chaired among others by arts patrons Dieter Rosenkranz and Alexander Lebedev. Chairman and CEO of [[MTV Networks International]] Bill Roedy presented on this occasion the MTV [[Free Your Mind (MTV award)|Free Your Mind]] Award to President Gorbachev.\n\nTwo-time [[Academy Award]] winner Sean Penn was awarded the Cinema for Peace Honorary Award in 2011 for his humanitarian work in New Orleans and Haiti.  In January 2010, he founded the J/P Haitian Relief Organization to aid victims of the devastating earthquake in Haiti.\n\n\"In the Land of Blood and Honey\", the directorial debut of Angelina Jolie, was honored with the \"Honorary Award for Opposing War and Genocide\" at the Cinema for Peace Berlin 2012. The film tells the story of the love between a Serbian man and a Muslim woman, who realize, upon the outbreak of the Bosnian war, they not only stand on opposing sides, but the man is now a soldier and the woman a prisoner of war. \"In the Land of Blood and Honey\" depicts the horrific violence of the civil war and makes a call for peace.\n\nCharlize Theron received the Cinema for Peace Honorary Award 2013 for her commitment against the spread of HIV/AIDS among young South Africans. The South African actress and United Nations Messenger of Peace is the founder of the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP), which calls for medical education and battles against the spread of HIV.\n\n===Cinema for Peace Award for Opposing Anti-Semitism===\n\nCinema for Peace Berlin 2013 highlighted artistic and social opposition to [[anti-Semitism]] in Germany and other counties. The Cinema for Peace Honorary Award for Opposing Anti-Semitism was presented to actress Veronica Ferres, Charlotte Knobloch and Marga Spiegel, who all have been working against anti-semitism and [[xenophobia]] for many years. The award was presented by German Rabbi Daniel Alter, who was the victim of an attack motivated by religious hatred on the streets of Berlin in 2012.\n\n== Award winners 2002\u20132019 ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== 2020 ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemaforpeace-foundation.org/nominations-2020|title=Nominations 2020|website=Cinema for Peace Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for Most Valuable Movie of the Year''' to [[1917 (2019 film)|''1917'']] by [[Sam Mendes]]\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for Most Valuable Documentary of the Year''' to ''[[The Cave (2019 Syrian film)|The Cave]]'' by [[Feras Fayyad]]\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for Woman's Empowerment''' to [[A Girl from Mogadishu (film)|''A Girl from Mogadishu'']] by [[Mary McGuckian]]\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for Woman's Empowerment''' to [[Maiden (film)|''Maiden'']] by [[Alex Holmes]]\n* '''Cinema for Peace Award for most Political film of the Year''' to ''[[The Report (2019 film)|The Report]]'' by [[Scott Z.

[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

Democracy is an obstacle to this suppression of freedom which the centralized direction of economic activity requires.

According to Hayek, it is in this way that becomes possible for [[totalitarian]] leaders to rise to power as happened in the years following World War I.<ref name=\"Hayek\"/> [[Austrian School]] economists such as Hayek and his mentor [[Ludwig Mises]] also continually used the word ''socialism'' as a synonym for authoritarian socialism, central planning and state socialism, conflating it with fascism,<ref name=\"Mises\">Mises, Ludwig (1936) [1922].

There are difficult questions about the precise standard which should thus be assured [...] but there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody.

[...] [And] there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom.

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay), also [condemning] wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not.

There are elemental characteristics of the authoritarian socialist economic system that distinguish it from the [[capitalist]] [[market economy]]:\n* The communist party has a concentration of power in representation of the working class. The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy. The market is planned by a central government agency, generally a state planning commission.\n* Socially-equitable distribution of the national income in which goods and services are provided for free by the state that supplement private consumption.\n\nThis economic model is greatly characterized by the government's central planning.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\">Wilczynski, J.

[...] The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities.

A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals. [And] an economy cannot be politically tailored to perfection\".<ref name=\"Ader\"/><ref name=\"Wellisz\">Wellisz, Stanislaw (1964).

In 1913, prior to both [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the former Soviet Union had a GDP per capita of $1,488 in 1990 international dollars which grew 461% to $6,871 by 1990. After its dissolution in December 1991, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998. By comparison, Western Europe grew from a higher base of $3,688 international dollars by a comparable 457% to $16,872 in the same period and reached $17,921 by 1998.<ref name=\"Maddison\">Maddison, Angus (2001).

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1981).

[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/02/04.htm \"The Tasks of Business Executives\"].</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

The lower orbit also means more distance between Starlink and competing internet constellations proposed by OneWeb and Telesat. FCC approval allows satellite companies to provide communications services in the United States.

The main difference is that Red Bull comes in a tall blue and silver can while the [[Thailand]] Red Bull, or Krating Daeng, is in a smaller gold can. The two drinks also differ in terms of taste\u2014Red Bull has less sugar and is carbonated.

Since 2014, the Austrian Red Bull (carbonated) has also been exported to China. This has created confusion since both drinks use the same brand name, in both English and Chinese.\n\nSimilarly, in Southeast Asia, Red Bull and Krating Daeng are often confused as both use the Red Bull name in their packaging, although they are two separate products aimed at different markets.

Among his most popular works are ''[[Die Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1sf\u00fcrstin]]'' (1915) and ''[[Countess Maritza|Gr\u00e4fin Mariza]]'' (1924). Influences on his compositional style include Hungarian folk music (such as the [[cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s]]), the Viennese style of precursors such as [[Johann Strauss II]] and [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]], and, in his later works, American [[jazz]].  As a result of the ''[[Anschluss]],'' K\u00e1lm\u00e1n and his family fled to Paris and then to the United States. He eventually returned to Europe in and died in Paris in 1953.\n\n==Biography==\n{{onesource|section|date=January 2018}}\nK\u00e1lm\u00e1n was born '''Imre Koppstein''' in [[Si\u00f3fok]], then in [[Austria-Hungary]], on the southern shore of [[Lake Balaton]], to a [[Jew]]ish family. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n initially intended to become a concert [[piano|pianist]], but because of early-onset [[arthritis]], he focused on composition instead. He studied [[music theory]] and [[musical composition|composition]] at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music|National Hungarian Royal Academy of Music]] (then the Budapest Academy of Music), where he was a fellow student of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] under [[Hans von Koessler|Hans K\u00f6ssler]]. \n\nHis early symphonic poems ''Saturnalia'' and ''Endre es Johanna'' were well-received, although he failed to achieve publication. He also composed piano music and wrote many songs: a song cycle on poems by Ludwig Jacobowski and a song collection published under the title ''Dalai''.\n[[File:M.Sander - Imre Kalman, 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Young K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, by [[Mart Sander]]]]\nHowever, the popularity of his humorous cabaret songs led him towards the composition of [[operetta]]s. His first great success was ''Tat\u00e1rj\u00e1r\u00e1s'' \u2013 ''Ein Herbstman\u00f6ver'' in German, meaning ''Autumn maneuver'', although the English title is ''[[The Gay Hussars]]'', which was first staged at the {{Lang|de|Lustspieltheater}} in [[Budapest]], on 22 February 1908. Thereafter he moved to [[Vienna]], where he achieved worldwide fame through his operettas ''[[Der Zigeunerprimas]]'', ''[[Die Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1sf\u00fcrstin]]'', ''[[Gr\u00e4fin Mariza]]'', and ''[[Die Zirkusprinzessin]]''.\n[[File:Kalman Imre B Siofok.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of K\u00e1lm\u00e1n in Si\u00f3fok]]\nK\u00e1lm\u00e1n and [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]] were the leading composers of what has been called the \"Silver Age\" of Viennese operetta during the first quarter of the 20th century. He became well known for his fusion of Viennese [[waltz]] with Hungarian [[cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s]].

He studied [[music theory]] and [[musical composition|composition]] at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music|National Hungarian Royal Academy of Music]] (then the Budapest Academy of Music), where he was a fellow student of [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] under [[Hans von Koessler|Hans K\u00f6ssler]]. \n\nHis early symphonic poems ''Saturnalia'' and ''Endre es Johanna'' were well-received, although he failed to achieve publication. He also composed piano music and wrote many songs: a song cycle on poems by Ludwig Jacobowski and a song collection published under the title ''Dalai''.\n[[File:M.Sander - Imre Kalman, 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Young K\u00e1lm\u00e1n, by [[Mart Sander]]]]\nHowever, the popularity of his humorous cabaret songs led him towards the composition of [[operetta]]s.
