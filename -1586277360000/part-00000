The final bill omitted the I-41 designation. In 2009, Green Bay officials began a campaign to have US&nbsp;41 designated as a northern extension of [[Interstate 55|I-55]] from its current termination in [[Chicago]], with the alternative being designated as a spur of I-43.<ref>{{cite news |last= Jagannathan |first= Malavika |title= Officials Push to Rename Revamped US&nbsp;41 |work= [[Green Bay Press Gazette]] |date= February 8, 2009 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/greenbaypressgazette/access/1688989471.html?FMT=ABS |accessdate=July 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.villageofhoward.com/cm/pdfs/agendasminutes/Village%20Board%202-9-09.pdf |format= PDF |title= New Business, Minutes of the Village Board Meeting |publisher= [[Howard, Wisconsin|Village of Howard, Wisconsin]] |date= February 9, 2009 |accessdate= July 10, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> At the spring meeting of the Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbers of AASHTO on May 18, 2012, the I-55 designation was discussed by the committee.

Therefore, the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] (WisDOT) decided to seek a different designation not requiring the cooperation of their Illinois counterparts. Four designations were proposed by WisDOT and put up for public review: two new primary designations (I-41 and I-47) and two auxiliary designations (I-594 and I-643).<ref>{{cite report |author= Staff

The highway continues north concurrently with I-94 to the [[Mitchell Interchange]] in [[Milwaukee]], turns west to run concurrently with I-894 and I-43 to the [[Hale Interchange]] (forming a brief [[wrong-way concurrency]] with I-43), and turns north to run concurrently with I-894 and [[U.S. Route 45 in Wisconsin|US 45]] to the [[Zoo Interchange]], with the US 45 concurrency continuing until the I-41/US&nbsp;41/US&nbsp;45 split near [[Richfield, Washington_County,_Wisconsin|Richfield]]. The Interstate roughly parallels I-43, which runs north\u2013south along [[Lake Michigan]] from Milwaukee to Green Bay. I-41 runs through the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox Valley]] (including the cities of [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]] and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], along with the [[Fox Cities]]) and Green Bay, where it ends at the I-43 interchange. The Interstate is approximately {{convert|176|mi|km}} long and located almost entirely within the state of Wisconsin, and is completely concurrent with a slightly adjusted alignment of US&nbsp;41 to its termination in Green Bay.<ref name=google>{{google maps |url= https://www.google.com/maps/dir/42.4811897,-87.9465899/44.5607489,-88.0541922/@43.529931,-89.3574176,471191m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!4m4!1m0!1m0!3e0!5i1 |title= Overview Map of Interstate&nbsp;41 |accessdate= April 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Interstate Highways 41, 43, and 894.jpg|thumb|upright=0.795|Markers for I-41, I-43, and I-894 south of Milwaukee; this is one of two instances of a wrong-way concurrency in the United States involving two Interstate highways.

The final bill omitted the I-41 designation. In 2009, Green Bay officials began a campaign to have US&nbsp;41 designated as a northern extension of [[Interstate 55|I-55]] from its current termination in [[Chicago]], with the alternative being designated as a spur of I-43.<ref>{{cite news |last= Jagannathan |first= Malavika |title= Officials Push to Rename Revamped US&nbsp;41 |work= [[Green Bay Press Gazette]] |date= February 8, 2009 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/greenbaypressgazette/access/1688989471.html?FMT=ABS |accessdate=July 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.villageofhoward.com/cm/pdfs/agendasminutes/Village%20Board%202-9-09.pdf |format= PDF |title= New Business, Minutes of the Village Board Meeting |publisher= [[Howard, Wisconsin|Village of Howard, Wisconsin]] |date= February 9, 2009 |accessdate= July 10, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> At the spring meeting of the Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbers of AASHTO on May 18, 2012, the I-55 designation was discussed by the committee.

Therefore, the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] (WisDOT) decided to seek a different designation not requiring the cooperation of their Illinois counterparts. Four designations were proposed by WisDOT and put up for public review: two new primary designations (I-41 and I-47) and two auxiliary designations (I-594 and I-643).<ref>{{cite report |author= Staff

It is a spin-off to the Slenderina series. The game features an unnamed protagonist trapped in a house, needing to solve puzzles while avoiding a \"Granny\" to get out of the house in a time period of only five days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/962400/Granny/|title=Granny on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe game gained heavy traction following its release through various media platforms, such as [[YouTube]], [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] and others. The latest update the game received was on April 18, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/granny-update-17-how-find-new-room-freeze-trap-pet-crow-weapon-car-tips-1361834|title=Here's how to find all the new stuff in Granny update 1.7|last=EDT|first=Cammy Harbison On 3/13/19 at 3:12 PM|date=2019-03-13|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe game is heavily based around sound. The main antagonist, known only as the titular \"Granny\", is alerted via sound. The overall objective of the game is to escape the home by using clues and solving puzzles.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game takes place in an old house where the main character (the player) is trapped. The player must explore the house to find items that can help him escape the house in 5 days (6 if an optional puzzle is solved). Items include a hammer to pry out planks of wood, a shotgun to shoot Granny, and a crossbow to knock down tall objects or to knock out Granny. The house currently has 6 floors, including a garage and 2 attic areas. The player can escape by clearing away the obstacles on the front door, which requires the player to find a pair of cutting pliers, a hammer, a padlock code, a padlock key and a master key (these items are required to unlock the main door, but getting these items may require more), or by repairing the car in the garage, which requires gasoline, a car key, a car battery, a spark plug, an engine part and a wrench.\n\nGranny \u2013 the antagonist \u2013 searches the house for the player. Granny has an excellent sense of hearing and will run toward any loud sound that she hears, whether from a discarded object or a creaking floorboard. Granny runs toward the player until she loses sight of him, and place bear traps around the house to catch the player.  Granny's running speed differs depending on the game's difficulty (easy, medium, hard, or extreme). On 'extreme' difficulty, Granny runs faster than the player; on 'practice' difficulty, Granny is not present, and the player is allowed to freely roam and figure out how to escape the house. There's also a woolly spider in the one of the attic floors, which attacks the player if they get too close. The player will have to use a piece of meat to distract the woolly spider or shoot it with the crossbow or shotgun. The Nightmare Mode adds more challenges to the Extreme difficulty, by adding a darker, bloodier texture over most surfaces, making it harder to see the edges of most objects. Nightmare mode also makes Granny's bear traps much harder to avoid.\n\nThe player can hide under beds or in wardrobes, as long as Granny doesn't see the player hiding. If the player is caught, Granny swings her baseball bat at the player's head, which ends the current day. The player can also get knocked out by falling from the unstable floor or woolly spider in the attic. If the player is caught on the last day, one of 4 \"game over\" cut-scenes play, including being attacked by Granny in the basement, getting run over by the car in the garage, having their head chopped off by the guillotine in the backyard, and falling onto a bear trap through the weak attic floor. The player can defend themselves from Granny by shooting her with the crossbow, making her walk over an ice trap, trapping her in the sauna (located in the garage) for a period of time, or shooting her with the shotgun to remove Granny as a threat for a period of time (2 minutes in Easy, 1 minute in Medium, 30 seconds in Hard, and 15 seconds in Extreme. An extra 30 seconds can be added if Granny is shot with the shotgun in Nightmare Mode).\n\nThe player also receives injuries during the period of time they are in the house. On the first day, the player has no injuries. On the second day, the player walks with a limp. On the third day, the limp becomes more severe. On the fourth day, the player's vision is splattered with drops of blood and the bed they wake up in has blood on it. From here on, the player sustains no more injuries. During the \"game over\" cut-scenes, the vision of the player will remain the same as it had on the previous day.\n\nWhen the player manages to escape through the front door, Granny will stand behind him (unless on Practice difficulty, in which case she waits outside the open door) as the player runs. If the player does not put the teddy bear into the baby's crib in the attic before escaping, Granny will jump-scare and attack the player when the screen turns black. If the player puts the teddy bear into the crib, Granny will sit on the front step holding the teddy bear in her left hand before turning around to watch the player run away, and is joined with her granddaughter Slenderina as the camera pans away.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game's plot is not mentioned in the mobile version. In the Steam release, the game starts off with a cut-scene of the player walking through the woods. The player finds Granny's house and is subsequently attacked by Granny. The player awakes in a bed, which starts the game properly. According to a note on a piece of wood that is found inside the basement walls, the player is not the first person that Granny has trapped. It is unclear if the previous visitor escaped the house, but the note indicates that they were quite badly injured and aware that they had little chance of escaping.\n\n== Series continuation ==\n\n=== Granny: Chapter Two ===\nA second game of the Granny series, named ''Granny: Chapter Two'', was released on September 6, 2019.\n\nSimilar to the first installment, you are trapped in a house. In the first game, there was only Granny, her pet crow, rats, and pet spider. In ''Granny: Chapter Two'', there are more enemies to face whilst escaping the house. The list of enemies are: Granny, Grandpa, Slendrina's baby, and the sewer monster. The player can choose a practice mode where Granny and Grandpa both are not in home; a game where only Granny or only Grandpa is included or have them both in the house.\n\nThere are some new items in this game, such as the double-barrel shotgun, stun-gun, crowbar, grenades, and boat key. There are two extra locks. The player can escape through the front door which is located on the first floor, by the boat in the sewer which  is located in the basement, where the player woke up, or  by the helicopter which the player gain acess by taking the security key on Grandpa's neck. When the player loses Granny and Grandpa either feed the player to the sewer monster or using the ancient iron maiden on the player.

It is a spin-off to the Slenderina series. The game features an unnamed protagonist trapped in a house, needing to solve puzzles while avoiding a \"Granny\" to get out of the house in a time period of only five days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/962400/Granny/|title=Granny on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe game gained heavy traction following its release through various media platforms, such as [[YouTube]], [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] and others. The latest update the game received was on April 18, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/granny-update-17-how-find-new-room-freeze-trap-pet-crow-weapon-car-tips-1361834|title=Here's how to find all the new stuff in Granny update 1.7|last=EDT|first=Cammy Harbison On 3/13/19 at 3:12 PM|date=2019-03-13|website=Newsweek|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe game is heavily based around sound. The main antagonist, known only as the titular \"Granny\", is alerted via sound. The overall objective of the game is to escape the home by using clues and solving puzzles.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game takes place in an old house where the main character (the player) is trapped. The player must explore the house to find items that can help him escape the house in 5 days (6 if an optional puzzle is solved). Items include a hammer to pry out planks of wood, a shotgun to shoot Granny, and a crossbow to knock down tall objects or to knock out Granny. The house currently has 6 floors, including a garage and 2 attic areas. The player can escape by clearing away the obstacles on the front door, which requires the player to find a pair of cutting pliers, a hammer, a padlock code, a padlock key and a master key (these items are required to unlock the main door, but getting these items may require more), or by repairing the car in the garage, which requires gasoline, a car key, a car battery, a spark plug, an engine part and a wrench.\n\nGranny \u2013 the antagonist \u2013 searches the house for the player. Granny has an excellent sense of hearing and will run toward any loud sound that she hears, whether from a discarded object or a creaking floorboard. Granny runs toward the player until she loses sight of him, and place bear traps around the house to catch the player.  Granny's running speed differs depending on the game's difficulty (easy, medium, hard, or extreme). On 'extreme' difficulty, Granny runs faster than the player; on 'practice' difficulty, Granny is not present, and the player is allowed to freely roam and figure out how to escape the house. There's also a woolly spider in the one of the attic floors, which attacks the player if they get too close. The player will have to use a piece of meat to distract the woolly spider or shoot it with the crossbow or shotgun. The Nightmare Mode adds more challenges to the Extreme difficulty, by adding a darker, bloodier texture over most surfaces, making it harder to see the edges of most objects. Nightmare mode also makes Granny's bear traps much harder to avoid.\n\nThe player can hide under beds or in wardrobes, as long as Granny doesn't see the player hiding. If the player is caught, Granny swings her baseball bat at the player's head, which ends the current day. The player can also get knocked out by falling from the unstable floor or woolly spider in the attic. If the player is caught on the last day, one of 4 \"game over\" cut-scenes play, including being attacked by Granny in the basement, getting run over by the car in the garage, having their head chopped off by the guillotine in the backyard, and falling onto a bear trap through the weak attic floor. The player can defend themselves from Granny by shooting her with the crossbow, making her walk over an ice trap, trapping her in the sauna (located in the garage) for a period of time, or shooting her with the shotgun to remove Granny as a threat for a period of time (2 minutes in Easy, 1 minute in Medium, 30 seconds in Hard, and 15 seconds in Extreme. An extra 30 seconds can be added if Granny is shot with the shotgun in Nightmare Mode).\n\nThe player also receives injuries during the period of time they are in the house. On the first day, the player has no injuries. On the second day, the player walks with a limp. On the third day, the limp becomes more severe. On the fourth day, the player's vision is splattered with drops of blood and the bed they wake up in has blood on it. From here on, the player sustains no more injuries. During the \"game over\" cut-scenes, the vision of the player will remain the same as it had on the previous day.\n\nWhen the player manages to escape through the front door, Granny will stand behind him (unless on Practice difficulty, in which case she waits outside the open door) as the player runs. If the player does not put the teddy bear into the baby's crib in the attic before escaping, Granny will jump-scare and attack the player when the screen turns black. If the player puts the teddy bear into the crib, Granny will sit on the front step holding the teddy bear in her left hand before turning around to watch the player run away, and is joined with her granddaughter Slenderina as the camera pans away.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game's plot is not mentioned in the mobile version. In the Steam release, the game starts off with a cut-scene of the player walking through the woods. The player finds Granny's house and is subsequently attacked by Granny. The player awakes in a bed, which starts the game properly. According to a note on a piece of wood that is found inside the basement walls, the player is not the first person that Granny has trapped. It is unclear if the previous visitor escaped the house, but the note indicates that they were quite badly injured and aware that they had little chance of escaping.\n\n== Series continuation ==\n\n=== Granny: Chapter Two ===\nA second game of the Granny series, named ''Granny: Chapter Two'', was released on September 6, 2019.\n\nSimilar to the first installment, you are trapped in a house. In the first game, there was only Granny, her pet crow, rats, and pet spider. In ''Granny: Chapter Two'', there are more enemies to face whilst escaping the house. The list of enemies are: Granny, Grandpa, Slendrina's baby, and the sewer monster. The player can choose a practice mode where Granny and Grandpa both are not in home; a game where only Granny or only Grandpa is included or have them both in the house.\n\nThere are some new items in this game, such as the double-barrel shotgun, stun-gun, crowbar, grenades, and boat key. There are two extra locks. The player can escape through the front door which is located on the first floor, by the boat in the sewer which  is located in the basement, where the player woke up, or  by the helicopter which the player gain acess by taking the security key on Grandpa's neck. When the player loses Granny and Grandpa either feed the player to the sewer monster or using the ancient iron maiden on the player. When the player kill Slendrina's baby, the player will hear heartbeats in the background, Slendrina's child moaning, a giant Slendrina's head on top of the baby which will watch your every movement. Granny's and Grandpa's eye will turn red, and just like the first installment, they know where you are. Grandpa's doesn't hear anything except when the player uses the iron maiden, drop his favourite vase, shotgun shots, when the player knocks out Granny, gasoline explosions, the security alarm, and when Slendrina's baby got killed.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}[http://granny.games/ Granny games on PC]<br />\n\n[[Category:2017 video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Horror video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "name_user": "46.71.236.146", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_(video_game)"}

At the age of 19, she left New Zealand and settled in England, where she became a friend of writers such as [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Virginia Woolf]]. Mansfield was diagnosed with [[extrapulmonary tuberculosis]] in 1917; the disease claimed her life at the age of 34.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMansfield was born Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp in 1888 into a socially prominent family in [[Wellington]], New Zealand. Her grandfather was [[Arthur Beauchamp]], who briefly represented the {{NZ electorate link|Picton}} electorate in parliament.

M\u0101ori characters often are portrayed in a sympathetic or positive light in her later stories, such as \"[[How Pearl Button Was Kidnapped]]\".<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\n=== Moving to London ===\nMansfield moved to London in 1903, where she attended [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] along with her sisters. Mansfield recommenced playing the cello, an occupation that she believed she would take up professionally,<ref name=\"NZ\" /> but she also began contributing to the college newspaper with such dedication that she eventually became its editor.<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /><ref name=\"Writing\" /> She was particularly interested in the works of the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and [[Oscar Wilde]],<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /> and she was appreciated among her peers for her vivacious and charismatic approach to life and work.<ref name=\"Writing\" />\n\nMansfield met fellow writer Ida Baker (also known as Lesley Moore),<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /> a South African, at the college, and they became lifelong friends.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Mansfield did not become involved in much political activity during her time in London.

After finishing her schooling in England she returned to New Zealand and only then began in earnest to write [[short stories]]. She had several works published in the ''Native Companion'' (Australia), her first paid writing work, and by this time she had her heart set on becoming a professional writer.<ref name=Writing/> This was also the first occasion on which she used the pseudonym \"K. Mansfield\".<ref name=NZ/> She rapidly grew weary of the provincial New Zealand lifestyle and of her family, and two years later headed back to London.<ref name=SelectedStories/> Her father sent her an annual allowance of 100 pounds for the rest of her life.<ref name=Bio/> In later years she expressed both admiration and disdain for New Zealand in her journals, but she was never able to return there because of her [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\nMansfield had two romantic relationships with women that are notable for their prominence in her journal entries. She continued to have male lovers, and attempted to repress her feelings at certain times. Her first same-sex romantic relationship was with [[Maata Mahupuku]] (sometimes known as Martha Grace), a wealthy young M\u0101ori woman whom she had first met at Miss Swainson's school in Wellington and then again in London in 1906. In June 1907, she wrote:<blockquote>\"I want Maata\u2014I want her as I have had her\u2014terribly. This is unclean I know but true.\"</blockquote>She often referred to Maata as Carlotta. She wrote about Maata in several short stories. Maata married in 1907, but it is claimed that she sent money to Mansfield in London.<ref>The Canoes of Kupe. Roberta McIntyre. Fraser Books. Masteron. 2012.</ref> The second relationship, with Edith Kathleen Bendall, took place from 1906 to 1908.

She published only one story and one poem during her first 15 months there.<ref name=Writing/> Mansfield sought out the Trowell family for companionship, and while Arnold was involved with another woman, Mansfield embarked on a passionate affair with his brother Garnet.<ref name=NZ/> By early 1909, she had become pregnant by Garnet though Trowell's parents disapproved of the relationship, and the two broke up.

She blamed the breakdown of the marriage to Bowden on a lesbian relationship between Mansfield and Baker, and she quickly had her daughter dispatched to the [[spa town]] of [[Bad W\u00f6rishofen]] in Bavaria, Germany. Mansfield [[miscarriage|miscarried]] after attempting to lift a suitcase on top of a cupboard. It is not known whether her mother knew of this miscarriage when she left shortly after arriving in Germany, but she cut Mansfield out of her will.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nMansfield's time in Bavaria had a significant effect on her literary outlook.

The story depicts a New Zealand family moving house.\n\n=== Diagnosis of tuberculosis ===\nIn December 1917, Mansfield was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. For part of spring and summer 1918, she joined her close friend the American painter [[Anne Estelle Rice]] at [[Looe]] in [[Cornwall]], in the hope of recovering. There, Rice painted a famous portrait of her dressed in red, a vibrant colour Mansfield liked and suggested herself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/41995 |title=Loading... {{!}} Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |website=collections.tepapa.govt.nz |language=en |access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref> The painting known as the ''Portrait of Katherine Mansfield'' is now exhibited in [[Te Papa Tongarewa Museum]] of New Zealand. Mansfield wrote in a letter to Murry about being Rice's model:<blockquote>A. came early and began the great painting \u2014 me in that red, brick red frock with flowers everywhere. It's awfully interesting, even now. I painted her in my way as she painted me in hers: her eyes \u2026 little blue flowers plucked this morning.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Letter to John Middleton Murry [17 June 1918] |title=The Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield, vol. 2 |editor1-last=O'Sullivan |editor1-first=Vincent |editor2-last=Scott |editor2-first=Margaret |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1987 |location=New York |isbn=978-0198126140 |pages=244\u201345 }}</ref></blockquote>Then, rejecting the idea of staying in a [[sanatorium]] on the grounds that it would cut her off from writing,<ref name=\"Writing\" /> she moved abroad to avoid the English winter.<ref name=\"NZ\" /> She stayed at a half-deserted, cold hotel in [[Bandol]], France, where she became depressed but continued to produce stories, including \"[[Je ne parle pas fran\u00e7ais]]\". \"[[Bliss (short story)|Bliss]]\", the story that lent its name to her second collection of stories in 1920, was also published in 1918. Her health continued to deteriorate and she had her first lung [[haemorrhage]] in March.<ref name=\"NZ\" />\n\nBy April, Mansfield's divorce from Bowden had been finalised, and she and Murry married, only to part again two weeks later.<ref name=NZ/> They came together again, however, and in March 1919 Murry became editor of ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', a magazine for which Mansfield wrote more than 100 book reviews (collected posthumously as ''Novels and Novelists''). During the winter of 1918\u201319 she and Baker stayed in a villa in [[Sanremo|San Remo]], Italy. Their relationship came under strain during this period; after she wrote to Murry to express her feelings of depression, he stayed over Christmas.<ref name=NZ/> Although her relationship with Murry became increasingly distant after 1918<ref name=NZ/> and the two often lived apart,<ref name=Biog2/> this intervention of his spurred her on, and she wrote \"[[The Man Without a Temperament]]\", the story of an ill wife and her long-suffering husband. Mansfield followed her first collection of short stories, ''Bliss'' (1920), with another collection, ''[[The Garden Party (short story collection)|The Garden Party]]'', published in 1922.\n\n===Last years and death===\nMansfield spent her last years seeking increasingly unorthodox cures for her tuberculosis. In February 1922, she consulted the Russian physician Ivan Manoukhin, whose \"revolutionary\" treatment, which consisted of bombarding her [[spleen]] with [[X-rays]], caused Mansfield to develop heat flashes and numbness in her legs.\n\nIn October 1922, Mansfield moved to [[G. I. Gurdjieff|Georges Gurdjieff]]'s [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]] in [[Fontainebleau]], France, where she was put under the care of [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olgivanna Lazovitch Hinzenburg]] (who later married [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]). As a guest rather than a pupil of Gurdjieff, Mansfield was not required to take part in the rigorous routine of the institute,<ref>[[Linda Lappin]]. \"Katherine Mansfield and D. H. Lawrence, A Parallel Quest\", ''Katherine Mansfield Studies: The Journal of the Katherine Mansfield Society, Vol 2'', Edinburgh University Press, 2010, pp.72-86.</ref> but she spent much of her time there with her mentor, Alfred Richard Orage, and her last letters inform Murry of her attempts to apply some of Gurdjieff's teachings to her own life.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SdkKAQAAMAAJ&q=collected+letters+of+katherine+mansfield&dq=collected+letters+of+katherine+mansfield |title=The Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield |editor=Vincent O'Sullivan and Margaret Scott |page=360 |year=2008 |isbn=9780198183990}}</ref>\n\nMansfield suffered a fatal pulmonary haemorrhage in January 1923, after running up a flight of stairs.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OP_bJDyvBnoC&pg=PT126&lpg=PT126&dq=%22katherine+mansfield%22+stairs+murry |title=The Creative Mystique: From Red Shoes Frenzy to Love and Creativity |author=Susan Kavaler-Adler |page=113 |year=1996 |isbn=0-415-91412-4}}</ref> She died on 9 January, and was buried at Cimetiere d\u2019Avon, [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] (near Fontainebleau), France.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition.</ref>\n\nMansfield was a prolific writer in the final years of her life. Much of her work remained unpublished at her death, and Murry took on the task of editing and publishing it in two additional volumes of short stories (''The Dove's Nest'' in 1923, and ''Something Childish'' in 1924); a volume of poems; ''The Aloe''; ''Novels and Novelists''; and collections of her letters and journals.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe following high schools in New Zealand have a [[House system|house]] named after Mansfield: [[Whangarei Girls' High School]]; [[Rangitoto College]], [[Westlake Girls' High School]], and [[Macleans College]] in [[Auckland]]; [[Tauranga Girls' College]]; [[Wellington Girls' College]]; [[Rangiora High School]] in North [[Canterbury]], and [[Southland Girls' High School]] in [[Invercargill]]. She has also been honoured at [[Karori]] Normal School in [[Wellington]], which has a stone monument dedicated to her with a plaque commemorating her work and her time at the school, and at [[Samuel Marsden Collegiate School]] (previously Fitzherbert Terrace School) with a painting, and an award in her name.\n\nHer birthplace in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]], Wellington has been preserved as the [[Katherine Mansfield House and Garden]], and a park is dedicated to her.\n\nA street in [[Menton]], France, where she lived and wrote, is named after her.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.la-croix.com/Archives/2007-06-09/Menton-le-havre-secret-de-Katherine-Mansfield.-_NP_-2007-06-09-293407 |title=Menton, le havre secret de Katherine Mansfield. |last=La-Croix.com |date=2007-06-09 |website=La Croix |language=fr |access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref> A fellowship is offered annually to enable a New Zealand writer to work at her former home, the Villa Isola Bella, and New Zealand's pre-eminent short story competition is named in her honour.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thearts.co.nz/katherine-mansfield-menton-fellowship |title=Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship |date=2015-09-16 |work=The Arts Foundation |access-date=2018-08-22 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMansfield was the subject of a 1973 [[BBC]] miniseries, ''[[A Picture of Katherine Mansfield]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]].

Here Mansfield spent the happiest years of her childhood, and she used some of those memories as an inspiration for the short story \"[[Prelude (short story)|Prelude]]\".<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n[[File:Katherine Mansfield Birthplace, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|[[Katherine Mansfield House and Garden]] in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon, Wellington]]]]\n\nHer first printed stories appeared in the ''High School Reporter'' and the [[Wellington Girls College|Wellington Girls' High School]] magazine (the family returned to Wellington proper in 1898),<ref name=Bio/> in 1898 and 1899.<ref name=Writing>{{cite web |url=http://www.katherinemansfield.com/mansfield/her_write.asp |title=Mansfield: Her Writing |publisher=Katharinemansfield.com |accessdate=12 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014065750/http://www.katherinemansfield.com/mansfield/her_write.asp |archive-date=14 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Her first formally published story \"[https://wellington.recollect.co.nz/nodes/view/2515 His Little Friend]\" appeared the following year in a society magazine, ''New Zealand Graphic and Ladies Journal''.<ref>Yska, Redmer, ''A Strange Beautiful Excitement: Katherine Mansfield's Wellington'', Otago University Press, 2017</ref> In 1902 she became enamoured of Arnold Trowell, a cellist, although her feelings were for the most part not reciprocated.<ref name=NZ>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Whi071Kota-t1-g1-t8.html |title=Katherine Mansfield, 1888\u20131923 |author=Joanna Woods |publisher=[[Victoria University of Wellington]] |work=K\u014dtare 2007, Special Issue \u2013 Essays in New Zealand Literary Biography \u2013 Series One: 'Women Prose Writers to World War I' |year=2007 |accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> Mansfield was herself an accomplished cellist, having received lessons from Trowell's father.<ref name=Bio/>\n\nMansfield wrote in her journals of feeling alienated in New Zealand, and of how she had become disillusioned because of the repression of the [[M\u0101ori people]]. M\u0101ori characters often are portrayed in a sympathetic or positive light in her later stories, such as \"[[How Pearl Button Was Kidnapped]]\".<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\n=== Moving to London ===\nMansfield moved to London in 1903, where she attended [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] along with her sisters. Mansfield recommenced playing the cello, an occupation that she believed she would take up professionally,<ref name=\"NZ\" /> but she also began contributing to the college newspaper with such dedication that she eventually became its editor.<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /><ref name=\"Writing\" /> She was particularly interested in the works of the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and [[Oscar Wilde]],<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /> and she was appreciated among her peers for her vivacious and charismatic approach to life and work.<ref name=\"Writing\" />\n\nMansfield met fellow writer Ida Baker (also known as Lesley Moore),<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /> a South African, at the college, and they became lifelong friends.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Mansfield did not become involved in much political activity during her time in London. For example, she did not actively support the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffragette movement in the UK]] (women in New Zealand [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|had gained the right to vote]] in 1893).<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" />\n\n=== Travelling across Europe ===\nMansfield travelled in [[Continental Europe]] between 1903 and 1906, staying mainly in Belgium and Germany. After finishing her schooling in England she returned to New Zealand and only then began in earnest to write [[short stories]]. She had several works published in the ''Native Companion'' (Australia), her first paid writing work, and by this time she had her heart set on becoming a professional writer.<ref name=Writing/> This was also the first occasion on which she used the pseudonym \"K. Mansfield\".<ref name=NZ/> She rapidly grew weary of the provincial New Zealand lifestyle and of her family, and two years later headed back to London.<ref name=SelectedStories/> Her father sent her an annual allowance of 100 pounds for the rest of her life.<ref name=Bio/> In later years she expressed both admiration and disdain for New Zealand in her journals, but she was never able to return there because of her [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\nMansfield had two romantic relationships with women that are notable for their prominence in her journal entries. She continued to have male lovers, and attempted to repress her feelings at certain times. Her first same-sex romantic relationship was with [[Maata Mahupuku]] (sometimes known as Martha Grace), a wealthy young M\u0101ori woman whom she had first met at Miss Swainson's school in Wellington and then again in London in 1906. In June 1907, she wrote:<blockquote>\"I want Maata\u2014I want her as I have had her\u2014terribly. This is unclean I know but true.\"</blockquote>She often referred to Maata as Carlotta. She wrote about Maata in several short stories. Maata married in 1907, but it is claimed that she sent money to Mansfield in London.<ref>The Canoes of Kupe. Roberta McIntyre. Fraser Books. Masteron. 2012.</ref> The second relationship, with Edith Kathleen Bendall, took place from 1906 to 1908. Mansfield also professed her adoration for her in her journals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://socsci.flinders.edu.au/wmst/awsa2001/pdf/papers/Laurie.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090325142350/http://flinders.edu.au/socsci/womensstudies/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 March 2009 |title=Queering Katherine |author=Alison J.

She published only one story and one poem during her first 15 months there.<ref name=Writing/> Mansfield sought out the Trowell family for companionship, and while Arnold was involved with another woman, Mansfield embarked on a passionate affair with his brother Garnet.<ref name=NZ/> By early 1909, she had become pregnant by Garnet though Trowell's parents disapproved of the relationship, and the two broke up. She then hastily entered into a marriage with George Bowden, a teacher of singing 11 years her senior;<ref name=Tele>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/bokatherine.xml |title=So many afterlives from one short life |author=Ali Smith |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> they were married on 2 March, but she left him the same evening, before the marriage could be consummated.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nAfter Mansfield had a brief reunion with Garnet, Mansfield's mother, Annie Beauchamp, arrived in 1909. She blamed the breakdown of the marriage to Bowden on a lesbian relationship between Mansfield and Baker, and she quickly had her daughter dispatched to the [[spa town]] of [[Bad W\u00f6rishofen]] in Bavaria, Germany. Mansfield [[miscarriage|miscarried]] after attempting to lift a suitcase on top of a cupboard. It is not known whether her mother knew of this miscarriage when she left shortly after arriving in Germany, but she cut Mansfield out of her will.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nMansfield's time in Bavaria had a significant effect on her literary outlook. In particular, she was introduced to the works of [[Anton Chekhov]]. Some biographers accuse her of plagiarizing Chekhov with one of her early short stories.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3560098/Sincerely-Katherine-Mansfield.html |title=Sincerely, Katherine Mansfield |last=Wilson |first=A.N. |date=September 8, 2008 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> She returned to London in January 1910.

The piece was rejected by the magazine's editor [[John Middleton Murry]], who requested something darker.

Mansfield pledged her father's allowance towards the magazine, but it was discontinued, being reorganised as ''[[The Blue Review]]'' in 1913 and folding after three issues.<ref name=NZ/> Mansfield and Murry were persuaded by their friend [[Gilbert Cannan]] to rent a cottage next to his windmill in [[Cholesbury]], Buckinghamshire in 1913, in an attempt to alleviate Mansfield's ill health.<ref>{{cite book |last=Farr |first=Diana |title=Gilbert Cannan A Georgian Prodigy |year=1978 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=0-7011-2245-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gilbertcannangeo0000pull }}</ref> In January 1914, the couple moved to Paris, in the hope that a change of setting would make writing easier for both of them. Mansfield wrote only one story during her time there, \"[[Something Childish But Very Natural]]\", before Murry was recalled to London to declare bankruptcy.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nMansfield had a brief affair with the French writer [[Francis Carco]] in 1914. Her visit to him in Paris in February 1915<ref name=NZ/> is retold in her story \"[[An Indiscreet Journey]]\".<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\n=== Impact of World War I ===\nKatherine Mansfield's life and work were changed in 1915 by the death of her beloved younger brother, Leslie Heron \"Chummie\" Beauchamp,<ref>Elizabeth Bowen, Introduction, in ''Stories by Katherine Mansfield'', New York: Vintage Books, an imprint of Random House, 1956</ref> as a New Zealand soldier in France.

Sister, take and eat.\"<ref name=SelectedStories/>}}\n\nAt the beginning of 1917, Mansfield and Murry separated,<ref name=SelectedStories/> although he continued to visit her at her new apartment.<ref name=NZ/> Ida Baker, whom Mansfield often called, with a mixture of affection and disdain, her \"wife\", moved in with her shortly afterwards.<ref name=Tele/> Mansfield entered into her most prolific period of writing after 1916, which began with several stories, including \"[[Mr Reginald Peacock's Day]]\" and \"[[A Dill Pickle]]\", being published in ''The New Age''. [[Virginia Woolf]] and her husband [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who had recently set up the [[Hogarth Press]], approached her for a story, and Mansfield presented to them \"[[Prelude (short story)|Prelude]]\", which she had begun writing in 1915 as \"The Aloe\". The story depicts a New Zealand family moving house.\n\n=== Diagnosis of tuberculosis ===\nIn December 1917, Mansfield was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. For part of spring and summer 1918, she joined her close friend the American painter [[Anne Estelle Rice]] at [[Looe]] in [[Cornwall]], in the hope of recovering. There, Rice painted a famous portrait of her dressed in red, a vibrant colour Mansfield liked and suggested herself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/41995 |title=Loading... {{!}} Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |website=collections.tepapa.govt.nz |language=en |access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref> The painting known as the ''Portrait of Katherine Mansfield'' is now exhibited in [[Te Papa Tongarewa Museum]] of New Zealand. Mansfield wrote in a letter to Murry about being Rice's model:<blockquote>A. came early and began the great painting \u2014 me in that red, brick red frock with flowers everywhere. It's awfully interesting, even now. I painted her in my way as she painted me in hers: her eyes \u2026 little blue flowers plucked this morning.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Letter to John Middleton Murry [17 June 1918] |title=The Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield, vol. 2 |editor1-last=O'Sullivan |editor1-first=Vincent |editor2-last=Scott |editor2-first=Margaret |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1987 |location=New York |isbn=978-0198126140 |pages=244\u201345 }}</ref></blockquote>Then, rejecting the idea of staying in a [[sanatorium]] on the grounds that it would cut her off from writing,<ref name=\"Writing\" /> she moved abroad to avoid the English winter.<ref name=\"NZ\" /> She stayed at a half-deserted, cold hotel in [[Bandol]], France, where she became depressed but continued to produce stories, including \"[[Je ne parle pas fran\u00e7ais]]\". \"[[Bliss (short story)|Bliss]]\", the story that lent its name to her second collection of stories in 1920, was also published in 1918. Her health continued to deteriorate and she had her first lung [[haemorrhage]] in March.<ref name=\"NZ\" />\n\nBy April, Mansfield's divorce from Bowden had been finalised, and she and Murry married, only to part again two weeks later.<ref name=NZ/> They came together again, however, and in March 1919 Murry became editor of ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', a magazine for which Mansfield wrote more than 100 book reviews (collected posthumously as ''Novels and Novelists''). During the winter of 1918\u201319 she and Baker stayed in a villa in [[Sanremo|San Remo]], Italy. Their relationship came under strain during this period; after she wrote to Murry to express her feelings of depression, he stayed over Christmas.<ref name=NZ/> Although her relationship with Murry became increasingly distant after 1918<ref name=NZ/> and the two often lived apart,<ref name=Biog2/> this intervention of his spurred her on, and she wrote \"[[The Man Without a Temperament]]\", the story of an ill wife and her long-suffering husband. Mansfield followed her first collection of short stories, ''Bliss'' (1920), with another collection, ''[[The Garden Party (short story collection)|The Garden Party]]'', published in 1922.\n\n===Last years and death===\nMansfield spent her last years seeking increasingly unorthodox cures for her tuberculosis. In February 1922, she consulted the Russian physician Ivan Manoukhin, whose \"revolutionary\" treatment, which consisted of bombarding her [[spleen]] with [[X-rays]], caused Mansfield to develop heat flashes and numbness in her legs.\n\nIn October 1922, Mansfield moved to [[G. I. Gurdjieff|Georges Gurdjieff]]'s [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]] in [[Fontainebleau]], France, where she was put under the care of [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olgivanna Lazovitch Hinzenburg]] (who later married [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]). As a guest rather than a pupil of Gurdjieff, Mansfield was not required to take part in the rigorous routine of the institute,<ref>[[Linda Lappin]]. \"Katherine Mansfield and D. H. Lawrence, A Parallel Quest\", ''Katherine Mansfield Studies: The Journal of the Katherine Mansfield Society, Vol 2'', Edinburgh University Press, 2010, pp.72-86.</ref> but she spent much of her time there with her mentor, Alfred Richard Orage, and her last letters inform Murry of her attempts to apply some of Gurdjieff's teachings to her own life.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SdkKAQAAMAAJ&q=collected+letters+of+katherine+mansfield&dq=collected+letters+of+katherine+mansfield |title=The Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield |editor=Vincent O'Sullivan and Margaret Scott |page=360 |year=2008 |isbn=9780198183990}}</ref>\n\nMansfield suffered a fatal pulmonary haemorrhage in January 1923, after running up a flight of stairs.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OP_bJDyvBnoC&pg=PT126&lpg=PT126&dq=%22katherine+mansfield%22+stairs+murry |title=The Creative Mystique: From Red Shoes Frenzy to Love and Creativity |author=Susan Kavaler-Adler |page=113 |year=1996 |isbn=0-415-91412-4}}</ref> She died on 9 January, and was buried at Cimetiere d\u2019Avon, [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] (near Fontainebleau), France.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition.</ref>\n\nMansfield was a prolific writer in the final years of her life. Much of her work remained unpublished at her death, and Murry took on the task of editing and publishing it in two additional volumes of short stories (''The Dove's Nest'' in 1923, and ''Something Childish'' in 1924); a volume of poems; ''The Aloe''; ''Novels and Novelists''; and collections of her letters and journals.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe following high schools in New Zealand have a [[House system|house]] named after Mansfield: [[Whangarei Girls' High School]]; [[Rangitoto College]], [[Westlake Girls' High School]], and [[Macleans College]] in [[Auckland]]; [[Tauranga Girls' College]]; [[Wellington Girls' College]]; [[Rangiora High School]] in North [[Canterbury]], and [[Southland Girls' High School]] in [[Invercargill]]. She has also been honoured at [[Karori]] Normal School in [[Wellington]], which has a stone monument dedicated to her with a plaque commemorating her work and her time at the school, and at [[Samuel Marsden Collegiate School]] (previously Fitzherbert Terrace School) with a painting, and an award in her name.\n\nHer birthplace in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]], Wellington has been preserved as the [[Katherine Mansfield House and Garden]], and a park is dedicated to her.\n\nA street in [[Menton]], France, where she lived and wrote, is named after her.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.la-croix.com/Archives/2007-06-09/Menton-le-havre-secret-de-Katherine-Mansfield.-_NP_-2007-06-09-293407 |title=Menton, le havre secret de Katherine Mansfield. |last=La-Croix.com |date=2007-06-09 |website=La Croix |language=fr |access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref> A fellowship is offered annually to enable a New Zealand writer to work at her former home, the Villa Isola Bella, and New Zealand's pre-eminent short story competition is named in her honour.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thearts.co.nz/katherine-mansfield-menton-fellowship |title=Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship |date=2015-09-16 |work=The Arts Foundation |access-date=2018-08-22 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMansfield was the subject of a 1973 [[BBC]] miniseries, ''[[A Picture of Katherine Mansfield]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]].

It is based on the [[Uglydoll|plush toys of the same name]], and follows a group of them as they try to find embracement from the real world despite their flaws. The film stars the voices of [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]], [[Nick Jonas]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Blake Shelton]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Gabriel Iglesias]], [[Wang Leehom]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Bebe Rexha]], [[Charli XCX]], and [[Lizzo]].\n\n''UglyDolls'' was theatrically released in the United States on May 3, 2019 by [[STX Entertainment]], the first animated film produced by the company. It received unfavorable reviews from critics, who called it \"well-meaning but derivative\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/long-shot-is-certified-fresh/|title=Long Shot is Certified Fresh|author=Ryan Fujitani|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=May 2, 2019|accessdate=May 3, 2019}}</ref> It was also [[Box-office bomb|financially failure]] at the box-office grossing only $32.5 million out of a budget of between $45 million and $53 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a hidden universe, dolls are anthropomorphized and chosen for a single child, while deformed dolls are dropped into the remote town of Uglyville. Among these dolls is the idealistic Moxy ([[Kelly Clarkson]]), who dreams of the 'Big World' and being chosen for a child (\"Today's the Day\"/\"Couldn't Be Better\"), despite Uglyville's Mayor Ox ([[Blake Shelton]]) assuring her this is a myth. On advice from the shy village 'wise man' Lucky Bat ([[Wang Leehom]]), Moxy enters the hole from which new Ugly Dolls arrive, hoping to reach the Big World with the help of Lucky Bat and her friends, easy-going Ugly Dog ([[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]), cynical baker Wage ([[Wanda Sykes]]), and strong, soft-spoken Babo ([[Gabriel Iglesias]]).\n \nMoxy and her friends follow the tunnel to the Institute of Perfection (\"Today's the (Perfect) Day\") where dolls go through a number of tests, culminating in 'the Gauntlet', an obstacle course based on a human house, to be with their perfect child. The Institute's superficial doll leader Lou ([[Nick Jonas]]) meets the Ugly Dolls (\"The Ugly Truth\"), but states that they do not meet the standards to participate in the Gauntlet. Faced with Moxy\u2019s positivity, Lou agrees to let them try, hoping to ruin her optimism. The friends meet a perfect doll named Mandy ([[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]]), who is more accepting of the Ugly Dolls and has poor eyesight, but refuses to wear glasses and be labelled 'imperfect.'\n \nThe Ugly Dolls' first days of training (\"You Make My Dreams\") end in disaster. They dress up like the perfect dolls for a better chance at reaching the Big World (\"All Dolled Up\"). Lou sends the Spy Girls, a trio of ruthless perfect dolls \u2013 Tuesday ([[Bebe Rexha]]), Kitty ([[Charli XCX]]), and Lydia ([[Lizzo]]) \u2013 to kidnap Ox, and makes him confess that he and Lou were once friends who trained for the Gauntlet, until Ox fell short of its standards and was banished to the doll factory\u2019s recycling bin. After, he boarded it up to pave way for Uglyville, where he kept the Big World a secret from his fellow Ugly Dolls to protect them from the same rejection. Demoralized, Moxy abandons her quest and returns to Uglyville.\n\nLearning the truth, the residents of Uglyville lose their morale, The next day, as Moxy resigns herself to a lifetime of sadness and self-loathing, Mandy visits and convinces her that what Lou said does not matter, only Moxy\u2019s belief that there is a child for her in the Big World (\"Unbreakable\"). With her confidence renewed, Moxy decides to rejoin the Gauntlet, but she and Mandy are kidnapped by the Spy Girls on orders from Lou to take them to the recycling bin. The rest of the Ugly Dolls soon find out about this and come to their rescue, and they arrive at the Gauntlet, to Lou\u2019s chagrin.\n \nAs the Ugly Dolls advance through the challenges, Ugly Dog distracts a robotic dog by putting on a disguise and dancing to help the other Ugly Dolls, (\"Bon Bon\") prompting Lou to try to sabotage Moxy. Nearing the finish line, Lou makes a robotic baby cry after kicking it in the face, prompting the Perfect dolls, including the Spy Girls, to shun him while an empathetic Moxy comforts the crying baby. Lou crosses the finish line, but Moxy and her friends are dubbed the winners for making a child happy \u2014 a doll's true purpose. Lou is revealed to be a 'prototype' by Lydia resulting in the original standards. Angered, Lou \u2014 in a last-ditch attempt to keep the Ugly Dolls from leaving \u2014 tries to use a giant knitting needle to destroy the portal to the Big World believing if he can't go, then no one can. He is foiled by the Ugly Dolls and thrown into the washing machine by a doll named Nolan.\n \nThe Ugly Dolls and the Perfect Dolls fix the portal, make peace, and merge their hometowns to create the town of Imperfection (\"The Big Finale\"). Moxy finally goes through the portal, where she is put into the arms of her special kid, a little girl named Maizy who is missing a tooth like Moxy, much to her elation.\n\nDuring the credits (\"Broken & Beautiful\"), the Ugly Dolls, Mandy, and the Spy Girls are each shown to have found their own special kid with similar characteristics, while Lou is demoted to janitorial duty and overseen by the robotic dog.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kelly Clarkson]] as Moxy, the leader of the group with insatiable curiosity and limitless confidence.

It received unfavorable reviews from critics, who called it \"well-meaning but derivative\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/long-shot-is-certified-fresh/|title=Long Shot is Certified Fresh|author=Ryan Fujitani|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=May 2, 2019|accessdate=May 3, 2019}}</ref> It was also [[Box-office bomb|financially unsuccessful]] at the box-office grossing only $32.5 million out of a budget of between $45 million and $53 million.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a hidden universe, dolls are anthropomorphized and chosen for a single child, while deformed dolls are dropped into the remote town of Uglyville. Among these dolls is the idealistic Moxy ([[Kelly Clarkson]]), who dreams of the 'Big World' and being chosen for a child (\"Today's the Day\"/\"Couldn't Be Better\"), despite Uglyville's Mayor Ox ([[Blake Shelton]]) assuring her this is a myth. On advice from the shy village 'wise man' Lucky Bat ([[Wang Leehom]]), Moxy enters the hole from which new Ugly Dolls arrive, hoping to reach the Big World with the help of Lucky Bat and her friends, easy-going Ugly Dog ([[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]), cynical baker Wage ([[Wanda Sykes]]), and strong, soft-spoken Babo ([[Gabriel Iglesias]]).\n \nMoxy and her friends follow the tunnel to the Institute of Perfection (\"Today's the (Perfect) Day\") where dolls go through a number of tests, culminating in 'the Gauntlet', an obstacle course based on a human house, to be with their perfect child. The Institute's superficial doll leader Lou ([[Nick Jonas]]) meets the Ugly Dolls (\"The Ugly Truth\"), but states that they do not meet the standards to participate in the Gauntlet. Faced with Moxy\u2019s positivity, Lou agrees to let them try, hoping to ruin her optimism. The friends meet a perfect doll named Mandy ([[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]]), who is more accepting of the Ugly Dolls and has poor eyesight, but refuses to wear glasses and be labelled 'imperfect.'\n \nThe Ugly Dolls' first days of training (\"You Make My Dreams\") end in disaster. They dress up like the perfect dolls for a better chance at reaching the Big World (\"All Dolled Up\"). Lou sends the Spy Girls, a trio of ruthless perfect dolls \u2013 Tuesday ([[Bebe Rexha]]), Kitty ([[Charli XCX]]), and Lydia ([[Lizzo]]) \u2013 to kidnap Ox, and makes him confess that he and Lou were once friends who trained for the Gauntlet, until Ox fell short of its standards and was banished to the doll factory\u2019s recycling bin. After, he boarded it up to pave way for Uglyville, where he kept the Big World a secret from his fellow Ugly Dolls to protect them from the same rejection. Demoralized, Moxy abandons her quest and returns to Uglyville.\n\nLearning the truth, the residents of Uglyville lose their morale, The next day, as Moxy resigns herself to a lifetime of sadness and self-loathing, Mandy visits and convinces her that what Lou said does not matter, only Moxy\u2019s belief that there is a child for her in the Big World (\"Unbreakable\"). With her confidence renewed, Moxy decides to rejoin the Gauntlet, but she and Mandy are kidnapped by the Spy Girls on orders from Lou to take them to the recycling bin. The rest of the Ugly Dolls soon find out about this and come to their rescue, and they arrive at the Gauntlet, to Lou\u2019s chagrin.\n \nAs the Ugly Dolls advance through the challenges, Ugly Dog distracts a robotic dog by putting on a disguise and dancing to help the other Ugly Dolls, (\"Bon Bon\") prompting Lou to try to sabotage Moxy. Nearing the finish line, Lou makes a robotic baby cry after kicking it in the face, prompting the Perfect dolls, including the Spy Girls, to shun him while an empathetic Moxy comforts the crying baby. Lou crosses the finish line, but Moxy and her friends are dubbed the winners for making a child happy \u2014 a doll's true purpose. Lou is revealed to be a 'prototype' by Lydia resulting in the original standards. Angered, Lou \u2014 in a last-ditch attempt to keep the Ugly Dolls from leaving \u2014 tries to use a giant knitting needle to destroy the portal to the Big World believing if he can't go, then no one can. He is foiled by the Ugly Dolls and thrown into the washing machine by a doll named Nolan.\n \nThe Ugly Dolls and the Perfect Dolls fix the portal, make peace, and merge their hometowns to create the town of Imperfection (\"The Big Finale\"). Moxy finally goes through the portal, where she is put into the arms of her special kid, a little girl named Maizy who is missing a tooth like Moxy, much to her elation.\n\nDuring the credits (\"Broken & Beautiful\"), the Ugly Dolls, Mandy, and the Spy Girls are each shown to have found their own special kid with similar characteristics, while Lou is demoted to janitorial duty and overseen by the robotic dog.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kelly Clarkson]] as Moxy, the leader of the group with insatiable curiosity and limitless confidence.
