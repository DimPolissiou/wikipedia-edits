Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G. Vernon Harcourt]] and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} Other people who assisted in the founding were [[Anna Swanwick]], [[Bertha Johnson]] and [[Owen Roberts (educator)|Owen Roberts]].\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\n[[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=25}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include the war poets [[Robert Graves]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[R. E. Vern\u00e8de]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]]. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest [[quadrangle (architecture)|quads]]. Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]]. There are also remains of some 19th-century buildings, including a stone-lined well.<ref name=hughes>{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/the-catherine-hughes-building/ |title=The Catherine Hughes Building |access-date=30 August 2018 |website=www.some.ox.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Walton House===\n[[File:Walton House, Somerville College, Oxford.jpg|thumb|right|House seen from the east]]\nThe original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called House) was built in 1826 and purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=26}} The house could only accommodate seven of the twelve students who came up to Oxford in the first year.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63899#n43 |title=Somerville College \u2013 British History Online |website=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> In 1881, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, [[Walter Cave]] added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the Eleanor Smith Cottages were added, adjoining Walton House.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}}\n\nToday House is home to only one or two students, and, until 2014, it housed the college bar. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to college are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews; some of the college's paintings by [[Roger Fry]] are located here.<ref name=artuk /> Most of the administration of college, and the academic [[pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]] are in House, as is the Mary Somerville Room, a reception room featuring paintings by Mary Somerville, [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and [[George Frederic Watts]].<ref name=artuk />\n\n===Park===\n[[File:Park Building, Somerville College, Oxford University.jpg|thumb|right|Park Building]]\nOriginally known as West, due to its location within the college, the idea of building a second self-contained hall was inspired by [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room. Park is a Grade II-listed building.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1369711 |title=SOMERVILLE COLLEGE, WEST BUILDING |access-date=16 September 2018 |website=[[Historic England]]}}</ref>\n\n===Library===\n{{Main|Somerville College Library}}\n[[File:Somerville College Library.jpg|thumb|right|[[Somerville College Library]]]]\nThe Grade II-listed library was designed by [[Basil Champneys]] in 1903 and opened by [[John Morley]] the following year. Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened. It now holds around 120,000 items (95,000 on open shelves), making it one of the largest college libraries in the university.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}}\n\n[[Amelia Edwards]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Vera Brittain]] have been notable benefactors to the library.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}} The library contains paintings by Mary Somerville, [[John Constable]], [[Maud Sumner]] and [[Patrick George]].<ref name=artuk />\n\nThe John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/john-stuart-mill-collection/ |title=John Stuart Mill Collection \u2013 Somerville College Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle (having been designed to bring the college together) and is open 24 hours, with access to college-wide wifi, a group study room, and computing and printing facilities.

A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E.

In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

The first floor is occupied by the pantry and the hall, in which Formal Hall (called guest night) is held weekly during term time.\n\nMaitland now houses few students, being mainly occupied by fellows' offices and the college IT office. The building is named after Principal Agnes Maitland, and is to the south of Hall.<ref name=\"blogs.some.ox.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===Penrose===\nThe Penrose block was designed by [http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/mayors/1836_1962/rogers_harold_1937.html/ Harold Rogers] in 1925 and its first students were installed in 1927. A row of poplars had to be removed in 1926 for the construction to take place at the south-western end of the main quadrangle on the site of 119 and 119A Walton Street.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/>{{sfn |Manuel|2013 |p=35}} It was refurbished in 2014, with carpets replacing the bare wooden floorboards, and new furniture. Penrose is named after Dame [[Emily Penrose]], the third principal of the college. It contains mainly first-year accommodation, with around 30 rooms.<ref name=\"blogs.some.ox.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===Darbishire===\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford UK.png|thumb|right|Darbishire Quad]]\nDarbishire Quad was the culmination of a long-standing project to absorb Woodstock Road properties above the Oxford Oratory. In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

Margery Fry was opened in 1964 by [[Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit]] and Vaughan was opened in 1966. Constructed in the same architectural style, with an exterior concrete frame standing away from the walls of the interior edifice, the two buildings sit atop a podium containing shops and an arcaded walkway in Little Clarendon Street.\n\nVaughan is the larger of the two, with eleven rows to its concrete frame compared to the eight of Margery Fry.<ref name=\"manchesterhistory.net\">{{cite web |url=http://manchesterhistory.net/architecture/1960/somerville.html |title=Somerville College 1960s, Oxford, UK |website=manchesterhistory.net}}</ref> It is a Grade II-listed building and contains around 60 undergraduate rooms, which are smaller than those of Margery Fry and house exclusively first-year students, along with the junior deans.<ref name=thetab>{{cite web |url=https://thetab.com/uk/oxford/2016/01/19/somerville-first-choice-25551 |last=Haberfield |first=Catrin |title=Somerville should have been your first choice |publisher=[[The Tab]] |date=2015}}</ref> Vaughan was refurbished in 2013, with new bathroom facilities, including, for the first time, sinks.

The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include the war poets [[Robert Graves]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]] and [[R. E. Vern\u00e8de]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]]. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest [[quadrangle (architecture)|quads]]. Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]].

In 1897/98, the Eleanor Smith Cottages were added, adjoining Walton House.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}}\n\nToday House is home to only one or two students, and, until 2014, it housed the college bar.

The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was designed to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened.

A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J.

In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

Completed in 2011, the ROQ buildings were the first new buildings in the university's [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] and have won four awards for their architect Niall McLaughlin. The project was also awarded Oxford City Council's David Steel Sustainable Building Award, being commended for its balancing of Somerville's collegiate heritage with the need for energy efficiency. Energy-efficiency measures include renewable technologies such as solar thermal energy and ground source heat pumps.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/roq-accommodation-wins-sustainable-building-award/ |title=ROQ awards |accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe buildings house 68 students, all in en-suite rooms, and there are a number of rooms and facilities designed to help those with disabilities, including lifts and adjoining carer rooms. The buildings were made possible by donations of over \u00a32.7 million from over 1,000 alumni and friends of the college, and by a significant loan.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> There is now an unimpeded view of the [[Radcliffe Observatory]].\n\n===The Terrace===\nBefore the Catherine Hughes Building, the most recent work in Somerville was the Terrace in 2013, a caf\u00e9 and bar attached to the Vaughan building (replacing the old bar in House). It is housed in a mainly glass structure, with seating in the college colours of red and black.

The new building, designed by [[Niall McLaughlin Architects]], includes en suite bathrooms, kitchens and accessible rooms on every floor and a new communal study area for graduate students.<ref name=hughes />\n\nThe red-brick building has a frontage onto Walton Street and additional access from the college gardens, aligning with key levels on the adjacent Penrose Building. The bedrooms are arranged in clusters with kitchens and circulation spaces forming social focal points.\n\nThe building's construction has given Somerville sufficient accommodation to be one of the three Oxford colleges which can allow all students applying from 2017 to live in college for the entirety of their three or four-year undergraduate degree courses.<ref name=Oxfordwebsite>[https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/colleges/college-listing/somerville-college?wssl=1 Somerville College]</ref><ref name=whychoose />\n\n===Gardens===\n[[File:Park Lawn, Somerville College, Oxford.jpg|thumb|]]\nSomerville is one of the few Oxford colleges where students may walk on the grass.

It was home to a donkey, two cows a pony and a pig.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} The paddock was soon transformed into tennis courts, where huge tents where erected during World War I. During [[World War II]], large water tanks were dug in the Main Quad and in Darbishire Quad, in case of firebombing, and the lawns were dug up and planted with vegetables.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=35}}\n\nIn the Main Quad there is a cedar planted by [[Harold Macmillan]] in 1976, after an old cedar was victim of a winter storm. Another tree, a ''[[Picea likiangensis]]'', was planted in 2007 on the chapel lawn, providing Somerville with an outdoor Christmas tree.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=35}} The library border of lavender and ''[[Agapanthus]]'' references the [[bluestocking]] reputation of Somerville and the [[tory]] blue ''[[Ceratostigma willmottianum]]'' is planted outside the Margaret Thatcher Centre. [[Beardtongues]], ''[[Begonia]]'' and 1,200 red and black tulips reflect the college's colours. There are nods to Somerville's long-standing links with [[India]], a strip of alpine plants in front of Wolfson, a bog garden, herbaceous borders and the emblematic Somerville thistles (''[[Echinops]]'').<ref name=gardens />{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=36}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/news/ever-green-robert-washington-celebrates-30-years-at-somerville/ |title=EVER GREEN \u2013 Robert Washington celebrates 30 years at Somerville |date=11 June 2014 |website=www.some.ox.ac.uk |access-date=30 August 2018}}</ref> The western wall of Penrose and the northern wall of Vaughan form two faces of the Fellows' Garden, previously kitchen gardens, which is distinct from the main quad and separated from it by a hedge and a wall.

Six of these defendants were acquitted, and a mistrial was declared for the remaining three because the jury failed to agree on their verdicts. There was widespread suspicion in the city that an Italian network of criminals was responsible for the killing of the police chief, in a period of anti-Italian sentiment and rising crime. Believing the jury had been bribed, a mob broke into the jail where the men were being held and killed eleven of the prisoners, most by shooting. The mob outside the jail numbered in the thousands and included some of the city's most prominent citizens. American press coverage of the event was largely congratulatory, and those responsible for the lynching were never charged.\n\nThe incident had serious national repercussions. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte in New Orleans registered a protest and left the city in May 1891 at his government's direction. The ''[[New York Times]]'' published his lengthy statement charging city politicians with responsibility for the lynching of the Italians.<ref name=\"nyt524\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1891/05/24/103309443.html?pageNumber=1 \"Signor Corte's Farewell/His Story of the Lynching of the Italians\"], ''New York Times'', 24 May 1891; accessed 5 February 2018</ref> Italy cut off diplomatic relations with the United States, sparking rumors of war. Increased [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|anti-Italian]] sentiment led to calls for restrictions on immigration. The word \"[[Mafia]]\" entered the American lexicon, and the stereotype of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian mafioso]] became established in the popular imagination.\n\nThe lynchings were the subject of the 1999 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Vendetta (1999 film)|Vendetta]]'', starring [[Christopher Walken]]. The movie is based on a 1977 history book of the same name by [[Richard Gambino]].\n\n==Background==\n===Anti-Italian sentiment in New Orleans===\n\nIn late 19th-century America, there was a growing prejudice against Italians, although they were recruited to satisfy the demand for cheap labor. They were immigrating to the American South, particularly Florida and Louisiana, in large numbers because of poor conditions at home and to fill the shortage of cheap labor created by the end of slavery and the preference of freedmen to work on their own accounts as sharecroppers. Sugar planters, in particular, sought workers who were more compliant than former slaves; they hired immigrant recruiters to bring Italians to southern Louisiana. In the 1890s, thousands of Italians were arriving in New Orleans each year. Many settled in the [[French Quarter]], which by the early 20th century became known as \"Little Sicily.\"{{sfn|Liles|2017}}\n\nIn a letter responding to an inquiry about immigration in New Orleans, Mayor [[Joseph A. Shakspeare]] expressed the common anti-Italian prejudice, complaining that the city had become attractive to \"...the worst classes of Europe: Southern Italians and Sicilians...the most idle, vicious, and worthless people among us.\" He claimed they were \"filthy in their persons and homes\" and blamed them for the spread of disease, concluding that they were \"without courage, honor, truth, pride, religion, or any quality that goes to make a good citizen.\"{{sfn|Liles|2017}}\n\n===Assassination of David Hennessy===\n[[File:HennessySceneOfTheAssassination.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of Hennessy's murder. \"Scene of the Assassination\", ''The Mascot'', New Orleans, 1890.]]\n\nOn the evening of October 15, 1890, New Orleans police chief David Hennessy was shot by several gunmen as he walked home from work. Hennessy returned fire and chased his attackers before collapsing. When asked who had shot him, Hennessy reportedly whispered to Captain William O'Connor, \"[[wikt:dago|Dagoes]]\" (a derogatory term for Italians and others of Mediterranean heritage). Hennessy was awake in the hospital for several hours after the shooting, and spoke to friends, but did not name the shooters. The next day complications set in and he died.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=4}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xxiv}}\n\nThere had been an ongoing feud between the Provenzano and Mantranga<ref group=note>Also spelled \"Matranga\" in some documents.</ref> families, who were business rivals on the New Orleans waterfront. Hennessy had put several of the Provenzanos in prison, and their appeal trial was coming up. According to some reports, Hennessy had been planning to offer new evidence at the trial that would clear the Provenzanos and implicate the Mantrangas. If true, this would mean that the Mantrangas, and not the Provenzanos, had a motive for the murder.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=264}} A policeman who was a friend of Hennessy's later testified that Hennessy had told him he had no such plans.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=76}} In any case, it was widely believed that Hennessy's killers were Italian. Local papers such as the ''Times-Democrat'' and the ''Daily Picayune'' freely blamed \"Dagoes\" for the murder.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=267}}\n\n===Investigation===\nThe murder was quickly followed by mass arrests of local Italians. Mayor [[Joseph A. Shakspeare]] (according to the ''Picayune'') told the police to \"scour the whole neighborhood. Arrest every Italian you come across.\" Within 24 hours, 45 people had been arrested.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=265}} By some accounts, as many as 250 Italians were rounded up.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=35}} Most were eventually released for lack of evidence.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}} Local Italians were afraid to leave their homes for several days after the murder, but eventually the furor died down and they returned to work.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=267}}\n\nNineteen men were ultimately charged with the murder or as accessories and held without bail in the Parish Prison. These included Charles Mantranga, who was charged with plotting the murder, and several of the Mantranga's friends and workers. Pietro Monasterio, a shoemaker, was arrested because he lived across the street from where Hennessy was standing when he was shot. Antonio Marchesi, a fruit peddler, was arrested because he was a friend of Monasterio's and \"was known to frequent his shoe shop.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=150, 14}} Emmanuele Polizzi was arrested when a policeman identified him as one of the men he had seen running from the scene of the crime.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}}\n\nA few days after Hennessy's death, Mayor Shakspeare gave a speech declaring that Hennessy had been \"the victim of Sicilian vengeance\" and calling upon the citizenry to \"teach these people a lesson they will not forget.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=144}} He appointed a Committee of Fifty to investigate \"the existence of secret societies or bands of oath-bound assassins...and to devise necessary means and the most effectual and speedy measures for the uprooting and total annihilation\" of any such organizations.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}} On October 23, the committee published an open letter to the Italian community encouraging them to inform on each other anonymously.\n\nThe letter ended on a menacing note:\n<blockquote>We hope this appeal will be met by you in the same spirit in which we issue it, and that this community will not be driven to harsh and stringent methods outside of the law, which may involve the innocent and guilty alike...Upon you and your willingness to give information depends which of these courses shall be pursued.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=115}}</blockquote>\n\nThe letter was signed by the Committee's chairman, [[Edgar Howard Farrar|Edgar H.

Apparently the detectives did not obtain any useful information, because they were not asked to testify at the trial. Only Polizzi, who appeared to be mentally ill, said anything to incriminate himself, and his confession was deemed inadmissible.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=68}}\n\nMeanwhile, the defendants were subject to extremely negative pretrial publicity.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=278}} Across the country, newspapers ran headlines such as \"Vast Mafia in New Orleans\" and \"1,100 Dago Criminals\".{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=66}}\n\nSeveral shotguns were found near the scene of the crime. One was a [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] shotgun, a type which was widely used in New Orleans and throughout the South, but which police claimed was a \"favorite\" of Italians. Another had a hinged [[Stock (firearms)|stock]]. Local newspapers reported that such guns were imported from Italy; in fact they were manufactured by the [[W. Richards Company]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=265}}\n\nSpurred to action by the popular accounts of Hennessy's murder, a 29-year-old newspaper salesman named Thomas Duffy walked into the prison on October 17, 1890, sought out Antonio Scaffidi, whom he had heard was a suspect, and shot him in the neck with a revolver. Scaffidi survived the attack, only to be lynched a few months later. Duffy was eventually convicted of assault and sentenced to six months in prison.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=41\u201343}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}\n\n===Murder trial===\n\nA trial for nine of the suspects began on February 16, 1891, and concluded on March 13, 1891, with Judge Joshua G. Baker presiding.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xii}} The defendants were represented by Lionel Adams of the law firm Adams and O'Malley, and the state by district attorney Charles A. Luzenberg. Jury selection was a time-consuming process: Hundreds of prospective jurors were rejected before 12 people were found who were not opposed to capital punishment, were not openly prejudiced against Italians, and were not of Italian descent themselves.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=72}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=269}}\n\nMuch of the evidence presented at trial was weak or contradictory.

Suspects were identified by witnesses who had not seen their faces, but only their clothing. Captain Bill O'Connor, the witness who claimed to have heard Hennessy blame \"Dagoes\" for the assassination, was not called to testify. There were numerous other discrepancies and improprieties. At one point, two employees of the defense law firm were arrested for attempting to bribe prospective jurors.{{sfn|Botein|1979|pp=269\u2013270}} Afterward, when federal district attorney William Grant looked into the case, he reported that the evidence against the men was \"exceedingly unsatisfactory\" and inconclusive. He could find no evidence linking any of the lynched men to [[the Mafia]], or to any attempts to bribe the jury.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=114}} The bribery charges were eventually dismissed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}}\n\nMantranga and another man, Bastian Incardona, were found not guilty by directed verdict, as no evidence had been presented against them. The jury declared four of the defendants not guilty, and asked the judge to declare a mistrial for the other three, as they could not agree on a verdict.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=192, 208}} The six who were acquitted were not released, but were held pending an additional charge of \"lying in wait\" with intent to commit murder. Luzenberg admitted that without a murder conviction, he would be forced to drop the \"lying in wait\" charges. But all nine men were returned to the prison\u2014a decision which would prove fatal for some of them.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=77}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=209}}\n\nThe jurors were given the option to leave by a side door, but chose to walk out the front door and face the angry crowd. Several defended their decision to reporters, arguing that they had \"reasonable doubt\" and had done what they thought was right.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=209}} Some were harassed, threatened, fired from their jobs, and otherwise penalized for failing to convict the Italians.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=103, 154}}\n\n===Incitement===\n[[File:Speaker inciting the mob in New Orleans on March 14, 1891.jpg|thumb|William S.

Houston, politician and businessman; and John C. Wickliffe, editor of the ''[[New Delta]]'' newspaper.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xii}}{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=83}} Other members of the lynch mob included [[John M.

Nine others were shot or clubbed to death inside the prison.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=35}} The bullet-riddled bodies of Polizzi and Bagnetto were left hanging for hours.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=83\u201386}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=272}}\n\n===Victims===\n\nThe following people were lynched:{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=xi\u2013xii}}\n\n* Antonio Bagnetto, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted.\n* James Caruso, [[stevedore]]: Not tried.\n* Loreto Comitis, tinsmith: Not tried.\n* Rocco Geraci, stevedore: Not tried.\n* Joseph P.

Two others had police records in Italy: Geraci had been accused of murder and had fled before he could be tried, and Comitz had been convicted of theft.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=186\u2013193}} Incardona was wanted in Italy as a petty criminal.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=14}}\n\nThree of the men\u2014Comitz, Monasterio, and Traina\u2014had not applied for U.S. citizenship and could still be considered Italian subjects.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=260}}\n\nAll of those lynched were Sicilian immigrants except for Macheca, a Louisiana native of Sicilian descent, and Comitz, who was from the Rome area. Shortly after Hennessy's death, the ''Daily States'' informed readers that the suspects were \"a villainous looking set\" and described their appearance in racist terms, concluding, \"They are not Italians, but Sicilians.\"{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|p=124}}\n\nMost anti-Italian hostility in the United States was directed at [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]]s, particularly Sicilians. This was especially true in the American South, where Southern Italians were not considered full-fledged members of the \"white race\". The U.S. Bureau of Immigration reinforced this distinction, classifying Northern and Southern Italians as two different races.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=81}} Between 1890 and 1910, Sicilians made up less than 4 percent of the white male population, yet were roughly 40 percent of the white victims of southern lynch mobs. Before that, many white victims were ethnic Irish. They often had peripheral positions, working on construction of levees and railroads, and as farm workers.{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=213\u2013215}}\n\nMacheca's personal history complicates this view of Sicilians as victims of white racism. He was born in 1843 to Sicilian parents in Louisiana, and adopted and raised by a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] man named Macheca. During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate army. In 1868, either Macheca or his adoptive father led a group of Sicilians in a violent, anti-black demonstration.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=44-45}} Although not a member of the [[White League]], as a captain of the First Louisiana Infantry Regiment, Macheca fought in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]] on the same side as the [[New Orleans|Crescent City]] [[White League]] in 1874. He was the leader of a group of Sicilians who called themselves \"The Innocents\"; depending on the source, this group was either a murderous gang of white supremacists,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=45}} a precursor to the Louisiana Mafia, or a security force hired to protect Macheca and his businesses.{{sfn|Margavio|Salamone|2014|p=215}} The racial politics are further complicated by the fact that the 1891 lynch mob included some black residents.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=81}} In addition, Colonel [[James Lewis (Louisiana politician)|James Lewis]], a member of the elite Committee of Fifty, was a [[mixed-race]] African-American man who had been an officer in the Louisiana Native Guard and a leader in the Republican Party.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1977|p=810}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Press coverage===\n[[File:Cartoon that appeared in Puck on March 25, 1891.jpg|thumb|Cartoon that appeared in ''Puck'' on March 25, 1891.]]\nAmerican newspaper accounts at the time were largely sympathetic to the lynchers, and anti-Italian in tone.{{sfn|Wasserman|1998|p=78}}{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=217\u2013218}}{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=79}} The victims were presumed to have been involved with [[the Mafia]] and therefore deserving of their fate. A ''New York Times'' headline announced, \"Chief Hennessy Avenged...Italian Murderers Shot Down\".{{sfn|NY Times, March 15, 1891}} A ''Times'' editorial the next day vilified Sicilians in general:\n\n<blockquote>These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the cut-throat practices, and the oath-bound societies of their native country, are to us a pest without mitigation. Our own rattlesnakes are as good citizens as they...Lynch law was the only course open to the people of New Orleans.{{sfn|NY Times, March 16, 1891}}</blockquote> \n\nMany commentators offered a ''[[wikt:pro forma|pro forma]]'' condemnation of vigilantism before ultimately blaming the victims and defending the lynchers.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=79}}{{sfn|Leach|1992|p=28}} Massachusetts representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], for example, claimed to deplore the mob's behavior, and then proceeded to justify it while proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.{{sfn|Lodge|1891}} Even the ''London Times'' expressed approval.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=96}}\n\nNot all editors were convinced of the mob's innocence. The ''Charleston News and Courier'' argued that murder by vigilantes was no more acceptable than any other kind. The ''St. Louis Republic'' wrote that the men were killed \"on proof of being 'dagoes' and on the merest suspicion of being guilty of any other crime.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=96}} Some Northern newspapers also condemned the lynchings. Many others, however, implicitly or explicitly condoned them.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=273}} A ''Boston Globe'' front-page headline read, \"STILETTO RULE: New Orleans Arose to Meet the Curse.\"{{sfn|Globe|1891|p=1}} Boston was another industrial city that had been receiving many immigrants from southern Italy.\n\nFollowing strong protests by the Italian government and the Italian-American community, the press eventually became less supportive of the lynchers.{{sfn|Wasserman|1998|p=78}}{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\n===Criminal charges===\n\nA grand jury convened on March 17, 1891, to investigate the lynching. Judge Robert H. Marr, who presided over the jury, was a longtime personal friend of several of the lynch mob participants.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=275}} On May 5, 1891, the grand jury published a report concluding that several jurors in the Hennessy case had been bribed to acquit the Italians. No proof was offered and no criminal charges were pursued.\n\nThe grand jury claimed that it could not identify the participants in the lynching. In the same report, the lynching was described as a \"gathering\" of \"several thousands of the first, best, and even the most law-abiding, of the citizens of this city.\" No one was indicted.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=179}} Only Thomas Duffy, the newspaper salesman who had shot Scaffidi in October, was penalized. Duffy was serving time in the Parish Prison at the time of the lynching.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=229}}\n\nAfter the Hennessy case, at least eight more men of Italian descent were lynched in Louisiana during the 1890s. In each case, as was typical of lynchings, local authorities claimed to be unable to identify anyone involved and never prosecuted anyone for the murders.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=276}}\n\n===Political repercussions===\n\nThe incident strained relations between the U.S. and Italy. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte left New Orleans in late May 1891 and the ''New York Times'' published his statement accusing the city politicians of responsibility for the lynchings.<ref name=\"nyt524\"/> The Italian government demanded that the lynch mob be brought to justice and that reparations be paid to the dead men's families.<!--{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=260}}--> When the U.S. declined to prosecute the mob leaders, Italy recalled its ambassador from Washington in protest.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=95}} The U.S. followed suit, recalling its legation from Rome. Diplomatic relations remained at an impasse for over a year, and there were rumors of a declaration of war on America as a result of the murders. As part of a wider effort to ease tensions with Italy and placate Italian Americans, president [[Benjamin Harrison]] declared the first nationwide celebration of [[Columbus Day]] in 1892, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Italian explorer's landing in the New World.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/12/opinion/columbus-day-italian-american-racism.html|title=Opinion: How Italians Became 'White'|last=Staples|first=Brent|date=2019-10-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nWhen President Harrison agreed to pay a $25,000 indemnity to the victims' families, Congress tried unsuccessfully to intervene against the reparations, accusing him of \"unconstitutional executive usurpation of Congressional powers\".{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=126\u2013127}} The US paid $2,211.90 to each family of the eleven victims. \n\nThe contrasting American and Italian attitudes toward the lynchings are perhaps best summarized by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s comment. Roosevelt, then serving on the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], wrote to his sister [[Anna Roosevelt Cowles]] on March 21, 1891:\n<blockquote>Monday we dined at the Camerons; various [[Dago (slur)|dago]] diplomats were present, all much wrought up by the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans.

However, it is more widely known in [[Italy]].{{sfn|Donohue|2012}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=278}}\n\nMayor Shakspeare was narrowly defeated for reelection in 1892, with the Italian-American vote a decisive factor.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=65}} Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who survived by hiding in the prison while his father was lynched, was awarded $5,000 in damages in 1893 after suing the city of New Orleans.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}}\n\nThe death of Hennessy became a rallying cry for law enforcement and nativists to halt the immigration of Italians into America.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|pp=78\u201379}} [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] claimed that \"the paupers and criminals of Europe\" were \"pouring into the United States\" and proposed a literacy test to keep out the poorest immigrants.{{sfn|Lodge|1891|pp=611\u2013612}}\n\nThe Hennessy case introduced the word \"Mafia\" to the American public.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=36}} It generated the now-familiar stereotype of the Italian-American mafioso.

Among other things, Gambino notes that Hennessy had a \"colorful\" past that provided any number of possible motives to be subject to murder, none of which the police chose to investigate. He also notes that shortly after the lynching, the city passed an ordinance giving control of all New Orleans dock work to the newly formed Louisiana Construction and Improvement Corporation, a business headed by several of the lynch mob leaders. Italian waterfront merchants and workers, who had been making remarkable economic progress up to then, were thus eliminated as competitors.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=103}}\n\nThe 1999 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Vendetta (1999 film)|Vendetta]]'', starring [[Christopher Walken]] and directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]], is based on Gambino's book.{{sfn|Webb|2000|pp=1155\u20131156}} It portrays Macheca and several of the other lynched men as innocent victims.

Six of these defendants were acquitted, and a mistrial was declared for the remaining three because the jury failed to agree on their verdicts. There was widespread suspicion in the city that an Italian network of criminals was responsible for the killing of the police chief, in a period of anti-Italian sentiment and rising crime. Believing the jury had been bribed, a mob broke into the jail where the men were being held and killed eleven of the prisoners, most by shooting. The mob outside the jail numbered in the thousands and included some of the city's most prominent citizens. American press coverage of the event was largely congratulatory, and those responsible for the lynching were never charged.\n\nThe incident had serious national repercussions. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte in New Orleans registered a protest and left the city in May 1891 at his government's direction. The ''[[New York Times]]'' published his lengthy statement charging city politicians with responsibility for the lynching of the Italians.<ref name=\"nyt524\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1891/05/24/103309443.html?pageNumber=1 \"Signor Corte's Farewell/His Story of the Lynching of the Italians\"], ''New York Times'', 24 May 1891; accessed 5 February 2018</ref> Italy cut off diplomatic relations with the United States, sparking rumors of war. Increased [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|anti-Italian]] sentiment led to calls for restrictions on immigration. The word \"[[Mafia]]\" entered the American lexicon, and the stereotype of the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian mafioso]] became established in the popular imagination.\n\nThe lynchings were the subject of the 1999 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Vendetta (1999 film)|Vendetta]]'', starring [[Christopher Walken]]. The movie is based on a 1977 history book of the same name by [[Richard Gambino]].\n\n==Background==\n===Anti-Italian sentiment in New Orleans===\n\nIn late 19th-century America, there was a growing prejudice against Italians, although they were recruited to satisfy the demand for cheap labor. They were immigrating to the American South, particularly Florida and Louisiana, in large numbers because of poor conditions at home and to fill the shortage of cheap labor created by the end of slavery and the preference of freedmen to work on their own accounts as sharecroppers. Sugar planters, in particular, sought workers who were more compliant than former slaves; they hired immigrant recruiters to bring Italians to southern Louisiana. In the 1890s, thousands of Italians were arriving in New Orleans each year. Many settled in the [[French Quarter]], which by the early 20th century became known as \"Little Sicily.\"{{sfn|Liles|2017}}\n\nIn a letter responding to an inquiry about immigration in New Orleans, Mayor [[Joseph A. Shakspeare]] expressed the common anti-Italian prejudice, complaining that the city had become attractive to \"...the worst classes of Europe: Southern Italians and Sicilians...the most idle, vicious, and worthless people among us.\" He claimed they were \"filthy in their persons and homes\" and blamed them for the spread of disease, concluding that they were \"without courage, honor, truth, pride, religion, or any quality that goes to make a good citizen.\"{{sfn|Liles|2017}}\n\n===Assassination of David Hennessy===\n[[File:HennessySceneOfTheAssassination.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of Hennessy's murder. \"Scene of the Assassination\", ''The Mascot'', New Orleans, 1890.]]\n\nOn the evening of October 15, 1890, New Orleans police chief David Hennessy was shot by several gunmen as he walked home from work. Hennessy returned fire and chased his attackers before collapsing. When asked who had shot him, Hennessy reportedly whispered to Captain William O'Connor, \"[[wikt:dago|Dagoes]]\" (a derogatory term for Italians and others of Mediterranean heritage). Hennessy was awake in the hospital for several hours after the shooting, and spoke to friends, but did not name the shooters. The next day complications set in and he died.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=4}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xxiv}}\n\nThere had been an ongoing feud between the Provenzano and Mantranga<ref group=note>Also spelled \"Matranga\" in some documents.</ref> families, who were business rivals on the New Orleans waterfront. Hennessy had put several of the Provenzanos in prison, and their appeal trial was coming up. According to some reports, Hennessy had been planning to offer new evidence at the trial that would clear the Provenzanos and implicate the Mantrangas. If true, this would mean that the Mantrangas, and not the Provenzanos, had a motive for the murder.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=264}} A policeman who was a friend of Hennessy's later testified that Hennessy had told him he had no such plans.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=76}} In any case, it was widely believed that Hennessy's killers were Italian. Local papers such as the ''Times-Democrat'' and the ''Daily Picayune'' freely blamed \"Dagoes\" for the murder.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=267}}\n\n===Investigation===\nThe murder was quickly followed by mass arrests of local Italians. Mayor [[Joseph A. Shakspeare]] (according to the ''Picayune'') told the police to \"scour the whole neighborhood. Arrest every Italian you come across.\" Within 24 hours, 45 people had been arrested.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=265}} By some accounts, as many as 250 Italians were rounded up.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=35}} Most were eventually released for lack of evidence.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}} Local Italians were afraid to leave their homes for several days after the murder, but eventually the furor died down and they returned to work.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=267}}\n\nNineteen men were ultimately charged with the murder or as accessories and held without bail in the Parish Prison. These included Charles Mantranga, who was charged with plotting the murder, and several of the Mantranga's friends and workers. Pietro Monasterio, a shoemaker, was arrested because he lived across the street from where Hennessy was standing when he was shot. Antonio Marchesi, a fruit peddler, was arrested because he was a friend of Monasterio's and \"was known to frequent his shoe shop.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=150, 14}} Emmanuele Polizzi was arrested when a policeman identified him as one of the men he had seen running from the scene of the crime.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}}\n\nA few days after Hennessy's death, Mayor Shakspeare gave a speech declaring that Hennessy had been \"the victim of Sicilian vengeance\" and calling upon the citizenry to \"teach these people a lesson they will not forget.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=144}} He appointed a Committee of Fifty to investigate \"the existence of secret societies or bands of oath-bound assassins...and to devise necessary means and the most effectual and speedy measures for the uprooting and total annihilation\" of any such organizations.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=266}} On October 23, the committee published an open letter to the Italian community encouraging them to inform on each other anonymously.\n\nThe letter ended on a menacing note:\n<blockquote>We hope this appeal will be met by you in the same spirit in which we issue it, and that this community will not be driven to harsh and stringent methods outside of the law, which may involve the innocent and guilty alike...Upon you and your willingness to give information depends which of these courses shall be pursued.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=115}}</blockquote>\n\nThe letter was signed by the Committee's chairman, [[Edgar Howard Farrar|Edgar H. Farrar]], who later served as president of the [[American Bar Association]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=21\u201322}} Other prominent members of the Committee included General [[Algernon Sidney Badger|Algernon S. Badger]], Judge [[Robert C. Davey]], politician [[Walter C. Flower]], Colonel [[James Lewis (Louisiana politician)|James Lewis]],<!-- Classified by Nussbaum as \"black\" in the binary system of race, Lewis was in fact of mixed race, with a white father and mixed-race mother. He may have been among the [[free people of color]] in Louisiana before the war. --> and architect [[Thomas Sully (architect)|Thomas Sully]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=146-147}}\n\nThe Committee of Fifty hired two private detectives to pose as prisoners and try to get the defendants to talk about the murder. Apparently the detectives did not obtain any useful information, because they were not asked to testify at the trial. Only Polizzi, who appeared to be mentally ill, said anything to incriminate himself, and his confession was deemed inadmissible.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=68}}\n\nMeanwhile, the defendants were subject to extremely negative pretrial publicity.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=278}} Across the country, newspapers ran headlines such as \"Vast Mafia in New Orleans\" and \"1,100 Dago Criminals\".{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=66}}\n\nSeveral shotguns were found near the scene of the crime. One was a [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading]] shotgun, a type which was widely used in New Orleans and throughout the South, but which police claimed was a \"favorite\" of Italians. Another had a hinged [[Stock (firearms)|stock]]. Local newspapers reported that such guns were imported from Italy; in fact they were manufactured by the [[W. Richards Company]].{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=15\u201316}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=265}}\n\nSpurred to action by the popular accounts of Hennessy's murder, a 29-year-old newspaper salesman named Thomas Duffy walked into the prison on October 17, 1890, sought out Antonio Scaffidi, whom he had heard was a suspect, and shot him in the neck with a revolver. Scaffidi survived the attack, only to be lynched a few months later. Duffy was eventually convicted of assault and sentenced to six months in prison.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=41\u201343}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}\n\n===Murder trial===\n\nA trial for nine of the suspects began on February 16, 1891, and concluded on March 13, 1891, with Judge Joshua G. Baker presiding.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xii}} The defendants were represented by Lionel Adams of the law firm Adams and O'Malley, and the state by district attorney Charles A. Luzenberg. Jury selection was a time-consuming process: Hundreds of prospective jurors were rejected before 12 people were found who were not opposed to capital punishment, were not openly prejudiced against Italians, and were not of Italian descent themselves.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=72}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=269}}\n\nMuch of the evidence presented at trial was weak or contradictory. The murder had taken place on a poorly lit street on a damp night,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=129}} in a notoriously corrupt city,{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=264}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=33}} and the eyewitness testimony was unreliable. Suspects were identified by witnesses who had not seen their faces, but only their clothing. Captain Bill O'Connor, the witness who claimed to have heard Hennessy blame \"Dagoes\" for the assassination, was not called to testify. There were numerous other discrepancies and improprieties. At one point, two employees of the defense law firm were arrested for attempting to bribe prospective jurors.{{sfn|Botein|1979|pp=269\u2013270}} Afterward, when federal district attorney William Grant looked into the case, he reported that the evidence against the men was \"exceedingly unsatisfactory\" and inconclusive. He could find no evidence linking any of the lynched men to [[the Mafia]], or to any attempts to bribe the jury.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=114}} The bribery charges were eventually dismissed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}}\n\nMantranga and another man, Bastian Incardona, were found not guilty by directed verdict, as no evidence had been presented against them. The jury declared four of the defendants not guilty, and asked the judge to declare a mistrial for the other three, as they could not agree on a verdict.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=192, 208}} The six who were acquitted were not released, but were held pending an additional charge of \"lying in wait\" with intent to commit murder. Luzenberg admitted that without a murder conviction, he would be forced to drop the \"lying in wait\" charges. But all nine men were returned to the prison\u2014a decision which would prove fatal for some of them.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=77}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=209}}\n\nThe jurors were given the option to leave by a side door, but chose to walk out the front door and face the angry crowd. Several defended their decision to reporters, arguing that they had \"reasonable doubt\" and had done what they thought was right.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=209}} Some were harassed, threatened, fired from their jobs, and otherwise penalized for failing to convict the Italians.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=103, 154}}\n\n===Incitement===\n[[File:Speaker inciting the mob in New Orleans on March 14, 1891.jpg|thumb|William S. Parkerson inciting the mob. ''Harper's Weekly'', March 28, 1891.]]\n\nA group of about 150 people, calling themselves the Committee on Safety (referring to the Revolutionary War era),  met that evening to plan their response. The following morning an ad appeared in local newspapers calling for a mass meeting at the statue of [[Henry Clay]], near the prison. Citizens were told to \"come prepared for action.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=77}}\n\nThe ''Daily States'' editorialized:\n<blockquote>Rise, people of New Orleans! Alien hands of oath-bound assassins have set the blot of a martyr's blood upon your vaunted civilization! Your laws, in the very Temple of Justice, have been bought off, and suborners have caused to be turned loose upon your streets the midnight murderers of David C. Hennessy, in whose premature grave the very majesty of our American law lies buried with his mangled corpse \u2014 the corpse of him who in life was the representative, the conservator of your peace and dignity.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=216}}</blockquote>\n\nAs thousands of demonstrators gathered near the Parish Prison, Pasquale Corte, the Italian consul in New Orleans, sought the help of Louisiana governor [[Francis T.

The governor declined to take any action without a request from Mayor Shakspeare, who had gone out to breakfast and could not be reached.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=78\u201381}} Meanwhile, at the Clay statue, attorney William S. Parkerson was exhorting the people of New Orleans to \"set aside the verdict of that infamous jury, every one of whom is a perjurer and a scoundrel.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=157}} When the speech was over, the multi-racial crowd {{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=81,83}}{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=220}}{{sfn|NY Times, March 15, 1891}} marched to the prison, chanting, \"We want the Dagoes.\"{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=272}}\n\n==Lynching==\n\nInside the prison, as the mob was breaking down the door with a battering ram, prison warden Lemuel Davis let the 19 Italian prisoners out of their cells and told them to hide as best they could.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=82}}\n\nAlthough the thousands of demonstrators outside gave the sense that the lynching was a spontaneous outburst, the killings were carried out by a relatively small, disciplined \"execution squad\" led by Parkerson and three other city leaders: Walter Denegre, lawyer; James D. Houston, politician and businessman; and John C. Wickliffe, editor of the ''[[New Delta]]'' newspaper.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xii}}{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=83}} Other members of the lynch mob included [[John M. Parker]], who was elected as Louisiana's 37th governor, and [[Walter C.

Antonio Bagnetto, a fruit peddler, was hanged from a tree and shot. Nine others were shot or clubbed to death inside the prison.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=35}} The bullet-riddled bodies of Polizzi and Bagnetto were left hanging for hours.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=83\u201386}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=272}}\n\n===Victims===\n\nThe following people were lynched:{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=xi\u2013xii}}\n\n* Antonio Bagnetto, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted.\n* James Caruso, [[stevedore]]: Not tried.\n* Loreto Comitis, tinsmith: Not tried.\n* Rocco Geraci, stevedore: Not tried.\n* Joseph P. Macheca, fruit importer: Tried and acquitted.\n* Antonio Marchesi, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted.\n* Pietro Monasterio, cobbler: Mistrial.\n* Emmanuele Polizzi, street vendor: Mistrial.\n* Frank Romero, ward politician: Not tried.\n* Antonio Scaffidi, fruit peddler: Mistrial.\n* Charles Traina, rice plantation laborer: Not tried.\n\nThe following people managed to escape lynching by hiding inside the prison:\n\n* John Caruso, stevedore: Not tried.\n* Bastian Incardona, laborer: Tried and acquitted.\n* Gaspare Marchesi, 14, son of Antonio Marchesi: Tried and acquitted.\n* Charles Mantranga, labor manager: Tried and acquitted.\n* Peter Natali, laborer: Not tried.\n* Charles Pietza (or Pietzo), grocer: Not tried.\n* Charles Patorno, merchant: Not tried.\n* Salvatore Sinceri, stevedore: Not tried.\n\nThe court and district attorney set the survivors free after the lynching, and dropped the charges against the men who had not yet been tried.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nOne of the victims, Polizzi, had a police record in the U.S., having reportedly cut a man with a knife in Austin, Texas, several years earlier. Two others had police records in Italy: Geraci had been accused of murder and had fled before he could be tried, and Comitz had been convicted of theft.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=186\u2013193}} Incardona was wanted in Italy as a petty criminal.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=14}}\n\nThree of the men\u2014Comitz, Monasterio, and Traina\u2014had not applied for U.S. citizenship and could still be considered Italian subjects.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=260}}\n\nAll of those lynched were Sicilian immigrants except for Macheca, a Louisiana native of Sicilian descent, and Comitz, who was from the Rome area. Shortly after Hennessy's death, the ''Daily States'' informed readers that the suspects were \"a villainous looking set\" and described their appearance in racist terms, concluding, \"They are not Italians, but Sicilians.\"{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|p=124}}\n\nMost anti-Italian hostility in the United States was directed at [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]]s, particularly Sicilians. This was especially true in the American South, where Southern Italians were not considered full-fledged members of the \"white race\". The U.S. Bureau of Immigration reinforced this distinction, classifying Northern and Southern Italians as two different races.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=81}} Between 1890 and 1910, Sicilians made up less than 4 percent of the white male population, yet were roughly 40 percent of the white victims of southern lynch mobs. Before that, many white victims were ethnic Irish. They often had peripheral positions, working on construction of levees and railroads, and as farm workers.{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=213\u2013215}}\n\nMacheca's personal history complicates this view of Sicilians as victims of white racism. He was born in 1843 to Sicilian parents in Louisiana, and adopted and raised by a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] man named Macheca. During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate army. In 1868, either Macheca or his adoptive father led a group of Sicilians in a violent, anti-black demonstration.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=44-45}} Although not a member of the [[White League]], as a captain of the First Louisiana Infantry Regiment, Macheca fought in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]] on the same side as the [[New Orleans|Crescent City]] [[White League]] in 1874. He was the leader of a group of Sicilians who called themselves \"The Innocents\"; depending on the source, this group was either a murderous gang of white supremacists,{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=45}} a precursor to the Louisiana Mafia, or a security force hired to protect Macheca and his businesses.{{sfn|Margavio|Salamone|2014|p=215}} The racial politics are further complicated by the fact that the 1891 lynch mob included some black residents.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=81}} In addition, Colonel [[James Lewis (Louisiana politician)|James Lewis]], a member of the elite Committee of Fifty, was a [[mixed-race]] African-American man who had been an officer in the Louisiana Native Guard and a leader in the Republican Party.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1977|p=810}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Press coverage===\n[[File:Cartoon that appeared in Puck on March 25, 1891.jpg|thumb|Cartoon that appeared in ''Puck'' on March 25, 1891.]]\nAmerican newspaper accounts at the time were largely sympathetic to the lynchers, and anti-Italian in tone.{{sfn|Wasserman|1998|p=78}}{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=217\u2013218}}{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=79}} The victims were presumed to have been involved with [[the Mafia]] and therefore deserving of their fate. A ''New York Times'' headline announced, \"Chief Hennessy Avenged...Italian Murderers Shot Down\".{{sfn|NY Times, March 15, 1891}} A ''Times'' editorial the next day vilified Sicilians in general:\n\n<blockquote>These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the cut-throat practices, and the oath-bound societies of their native country, are to us a pest without mitigation. Our own rattlesnakes are as good citizens as they...Lynch law was the only course open to the people of New Orleans.{{sfn|NY Times, March 16, 1891}}</blockquote> \n\nMany commentators offered a ''[[wikt:pro forma|pro forma]]'' condemnation of vigilantism before ultimately blaming the victims and defending the lynchers.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=79}}{{sfn|Leach|1992|p=28}} Massachusetts representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], for example, claimed to deplore the mob's behavior, and then proceeded to justify it while proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration.{{sfn|Lodge|1891}} Even the ''London Times'' expressed approval.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=96}}\n\nNot all editors were convinced of the mob's innocence. The ''Charleston News and Courier'' argued that murder by vigilantes was no more acceptable than any other kind. The ''St. Louis Republic'' wrote that the men were killed \"on proof of being 'dagoes' and on the merest suspicion of being guilty of any other crime.\"{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=96}} Some Northern newspapers also condemned the lynchings. Many others, however, implicitly or explicitly condoned them.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=273}} A ''Boston Globe'' front-page headline read, \"STILETTO RULE: New Orleans Arose to Meet the Curse.\"{{sfn|Globe|1891|p=1}} Boston was another industrial city that had been receiving many immigrants from southern Italy.\n\nFollowing strong protests by the Italian government and the Italian-American community, the press eventually became less supportive of the lynchers.{{sfn|Wasserman|1998|p=78}}{{sfn|DeLucia|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}\n\n===Criminal charges===\n\nA grand jury convened on March 17, 1891, to investigate the lynching. Judge Robert H. Marr, who presided over the jury, was a longtime personal friend of several of the lynch mob participants.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=275}} On May 5, 1891, the grand jury published a report concluding that several jurors in the Hennessy case had been bribed to acquit the Italians. No proof was offered and no criminal charges were pursued.\n\nThe grand jury claimed that it could not identify the participants in the lynching. In the same report, the lynching was described as a \"gathering\" of \"several thousands of the first, best, and even the most law-abiding, of the citizens of this city.\" No one was indicted.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=179}} Only Thomas Duffy, the newspaper salesman who had shot Scaffidi in October, was penalized. Duffy was serving time in the Parish Prison at the time of the lynching.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=229}}\n\nAfter the Hennessy case, at least eight more men of Italian descent were lynched in Louisiana during the 1890s. In each case, as was typical of lynchings, local authorities claimed to be unable to identify anyone involved and never prosecuted anyone for the murders.{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=276}}\n\n===Political repercussions===\n\nThe incident strained relations between the U.S. and Italy. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte left New Orleans in late May 1891 and the ''New York Times'' published his statement accusing the city politicians of responsibility for the lynchings.<ref name=\"nyt524\"/> The Italian government demanded that the lynch mob be brought to justice and that reparations be paid to the dead men's families.<!--{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=260}}--> When the U.S. declined to prosecute the mob leaders, Italy recalled its ambassador from Washington in protest.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=95}} The U.S. followed suit, recalling its legation from Rome. Diplomatic relations remained at an impasse for over a year, and there were rumors of a declaration of war on America as a result of the murders. As part of a wider effort to ease tensions with Italy and placate Italian Americans, president [[Benjamin Harrison]] declared the first nationwide celebration of [[Columbus Day]] in 1892, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Italian explorer's landing in the New World.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/12/opinion/columbus-day-italian-american-racism.html|title=Opinion: How Italians Became 'White'|last=Staples|first=Brent|date=2019-10-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nWhen President Harrison agreed to pay a $25,000 indemnity to the victims' families, Congress tried unsuccessfully to intervene against the reparations, accusing him of \"unconstitutional executive usurpation of Congressional powers\".{{sfn|Gambino|2000|pp=126\u2013127}} The US paid $2,211.90 to each family of the eleven victims. \n\nThe contrasting American and Italian attitudes toward the lynchings are perhaps best summarized by [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s comment. Roosevelt, then serving on the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], wrote to his sister [[Anna Roosevelt Cowles]] on March 21, 1891:\n<blockquote>Monday we dined at the Camerons; various [[Dago (slur)|dago]] diplomats were present, all much wrought up by the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans. Personally I think it rather a good thing, and said so.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1891|pp=1\u20132}}</blockquote>\n\nThe incident has been mostly forgotten in the U.S., relegated to the footnotes of American history texts. However, it is more widely known in [[Italy]].{{sfn|Donohue|2012}}{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=278}}\n\nMayor Shakspeare was narrowly defeated for reelection in 1892, with the Italian-American vote a decisive factor.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=65}} Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who survived by hiding in the prison while his father was lynched, was awarded $5,000 in damages in 1893 after suing the city of New Orleans.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}}\n\nThe death of Hennessy became a rallying cry for law enforcement and nativists to halt the immigration of Italians into America.{{sfn|Puleo|2007|pp=78\u201379}} [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] claimed that \"the paupers and criminals of Europe\" were \"pouring into the United States\" and proposed a literacy test to keep out the poorest immigrants.{{sfn|Lodge|1891|pp=611\u2013612}}\n\nThe Hennessy case introduced the word \"Mafia\" to the American public.{{sfn|Maselli|Candeloro|2004|p=36}} It generated the now-familiar stereotype of the Italian-American mafioso. Journalists of the time used the word \"Mafia\" loosely, to sell newspapers, often linking the crimes of individual Italians to organized crime when no evidence of such a connection existed.{{sfn|Botein|1979|pages=263\u2013264, 277, 279}}{{sfn|Kurtz|1983|pp=356\u2013357, 366}}{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|pp=140\u2013141}}<!--{{sfn|Puleo|2007|p=78}}--> After the lynching, newspapers circulated wild rumors that thousands of Italian Americans were plotting to attack New Orleans, and were wrecking railroads in New York and [[Chicago]].{{sfn|Botein|1979|p=273}} The press reported that the defense lawyers in the Hennessy case were paid by the Mafia, when Italian-language newspapers in cities across the country had raised funds for the men's legal defense.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=56}} Soon historians were applying the \"Mafia\" label retroactively to crimes committed by Italians in the past.{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|pp=143\u2013144}}\n\nFor decades after the lynching, New Orleans children of other ethnicities would taunt Italian Americans with the phrase, \"Who killa de chief?\"{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=285}}\n\n===Books and films===\n\nFor the better part of a century, most historians relied on contemporary newspaper accounts as their primary sources of information about the lynching, seldom questioning the guilt of the lynched men or the popular assumption that Hennessy's murder was a Mafia assassination. In the 1970s, two studies by Italian Americans challenged the prevailing view.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=291}}{{sfn|Baiamonte|1992|p=120}}{{sfn|Kurtz|1983|p=357}}\n\nHumbert Nelli, a professor of history at the [[University of Kentucky]], examines the Hennessy case in a chapter of ''The Business of Crime'' (1976). Nelli demonstrates that the evidence against the men was weak, and argues that the murder was too poorly planned and amateurish to have been a Mafia hit.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|p=59}} In a chapter on crime in New Orleans, he claims that although crime flourished among the city's southern Italians at the time, it could not accurately be attributed to ''mafiosi''.{{sfn|Nelli|1981|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nIn ''Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History'' (1977),<ref group=note>The original title was ''Vendetta: A True Story of the Worst Lynching in America, the Mass Murder of Italian-Americans in New Orleans in 1891, the Vicious Motivations Behind It, and the Tragic Repercussions that Linger to This Day''.</ref> Richard Gambino, a professor at [[City University of New York]], raises numerous questions about the investigation and trial, and proposes an alternative theory about Hennessy's murder. Among other things, Gambino notes that Hennessy had a \"colorful\" past that provided any number of possible motives to be subject to murder, none of which the police chose to investigate. He also notes that shortly after the lynching, the city passed an ordinance giving control of all New Orleans dock work to the newly formed Louisiana Construction and Improvement Corporation, a business headed by several of the lynch mob leaders. Italian waterfront merchants and workers, who had been making remarkable economic progress up to then, were thus eliminated as competitors.{{sfn|Gambino|2000|p=103}}\n\nThe 1999 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Vendetta (1999 film)|Vendetta]]'', starring [[Christopher Walken]] and directed by [[Nicholas Meyer]], is based on Gambino's book.{{sfn|Webb|2000|pp=1155\u20131156}} It portrays Macheca and several of the other lynched men as innocent victims. It is narrated by the character of Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who escaped being lynched by hiding in the prison.\n\nReviewers have criticized Gambino's language as sensational and partisan while acknowledging the book's merits.{{sfn|Botein|1978|pp=505\u2013506}}{{sfn|Jackson|1977|pp=628\u2013629}}{{sfn|Wiley|Pozzetta|1978|pp=378\u2013379}} Writing in the ''Journal of American History'' in 1977, Raymond Nussbaum (an alumnus of [[Tulane University]]) suggested that historians looking for a balanced account of the lynching look elsewhere.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1977|p=810}} In a film review that appeared in the same journal in 2000, Clive Webb calls the movie a \"compelling portrait of prejudice\" and recommends that historians consult the book for more information.{{sfn|Webb|2000|pp=1155\u20131156}}\n\nThe lynching is discussed in the 2004 documentary, ''Linciati: Lynchings of Italians in America'', directed by M.

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years.

Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life.

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2016 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 13 April 2016. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea. All of which have either split from or merged with other parties in the last four years.

Frances wants Faith to paint murals all over the ornate walls of the abandoned ballroom of her ostentatious 211-acre estate. The theme of the mural is to be the grand entrance of Frances' daughter Cassandra at her \"coming out\" fete, which also happens to be the night Cassandra mysteriously died.\n\nFaith soon begins receiving expensive gifts from Frances, which she enjoys but doesn't understand. Before long, Faith starts picking up on several uncanny resemblances between herself and the dead Cassandra.

First conceived during [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration]] as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person [[Project Mercury]], which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person [[Project Gemini]] conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the [[Apollo 11]] mission when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last, [[Apollo 17]], in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].\n\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] (pictured) walked on the [[Moon]] with [[Neil Armstrong]], on [[Apollo 11]], July 20\u201321, 1969.|alt=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|alt=|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', the iconic 1968 image from [[Apollo 8|Apollo{{nbsp}}8]] taken by astronaut [[William Anders]]]]\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three crewed missions in 1973\u201374, and the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]], a joint US-[[Soviet Union]] Earth-orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957\u20131969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and [[Apollo 11]] was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.\n\nOverall the Apollo program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its [[Johnson Space Center]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[human spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.\n\n==Background==\n===Origin and spacecraft feasibility studies===\n{{main|Apollo spacecraft feasibility study}}\n\nThe Apollo program was conceived during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]]. While the Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] could support only one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a [[space station]], [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar flight]]s, and eventual crewed [[Moon landing|lunar landing]]s.\n\nThe program was named after [[Apollo]], the Greek god of light, music, and the Sun, by [[NASA]] manager [[Abe Silverstein]], who later said, \"I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.\"<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 55</ref> Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt \"Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.\"<ref name=\"pressrelease\">{{cite press release |title=Release 69-36 |date=July 14, 1969 |publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]] |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/apollo_press_release.html |location=Cleveland, OH |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh L. Dryden]] announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of [[Space Task Group]] conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and reentry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by [[Maxime Faget]], to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.<ref name=\"chariots_feasibility\">[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 1.7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html \"Feasility Studies\"]. pp. 16-21</ref>\n\n===Political pressure builds===\n{{main|Space Race}}\n\nIn November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the [[Soviet Union]] in the fields of [[space exploration]] and [[missile defense]].

At a meeting of the US House [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science and Astronautics]] one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.<ref>[[#87th Congress|87th Congress 1961]]</ref> Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.<ref>[[#Sidey|Sidey 1963]], p. 114</ref>\n\n[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

LOR advocates including [[John Houbolt]] at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness\", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-4.html \"Early Reaction to LOR\"]. p. 71</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Nicholas E.

Wiesner blurted out \"No, that's no good\" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm and issued a [[request for proposal]] to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, \"The [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] [as lifeboat]{{nbsp}}... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|SPS]].\"<ref>Letterman, p. 404 (James Lovell, \"Explosion on Apollo 13; April 1970: From the Earth to the Moon and Back\".

Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a ''command and service Module'' (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the ''Lunar Excursion Module'' (LEM, later shortened to ''Lunar Module'', LM, but still pronounced \"lem\") which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.<ref name=\"SummaryReport\" />\n\n===Command and service module===\n{{main|Apollo command and service module}}\n[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] in lunar orbit|alt=The cone-shaped command module, attached to the cylindrical service module, orbits the Moon with a panel removed, exposing the scientific instrument module]]\n\nThe [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.

Twenty-four of these left Earth's orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on the Moon's surface, though none of them returned to it after landing once. One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist.

The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the service module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo{{nbsp}}6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo{{nbsp}}6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn{{nbsp}}V ready to fly men, canceling a third uncrewed test.<ref>[[Apollo program#Brooks.2C et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 10.5: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch10-5.html \"Apollo 6: Saturn V's Shaky Dress Rehearsal\"]</ref>\n\n===Crewed development missions===\n\n<imagemap>\nFile:Apollo manned development missions insignia.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Apollo crewed development mission patches.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.<ref name=\"KSC-Apollo_13\" /> Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch11-7.html \"Mission to Fra Mauro\"]. p. 199</ref>\n\nThe contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was [[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|revised for the extended missions]] to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 12-4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-4.html \"Changes for Extended Lunar Missions\"]. pp. 211-214</ref>\n\n====Mission cutbacks====\n{{main|Canceled Apollo missions}}\n\nAbout the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming [[Space Shuttle]]. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-2.html \"Cutbacks and Program Changes\"]. pp. 201-202</ref> The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the [[John F.

The final fiscal year of Apollo funding was 1973.\n\n==Apollo Applications Program==\n{{main|Apollo Applications Program}}\n\nLooking beyond the crewed lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (''Apollo X'',) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter]] (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch4.htm|title=A Science Program for Manned Spaceflight|access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a [[Manned Venus Flyby|Venus fly-by mission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=j74hfnr889reqoinelc27u5877&action=dlattach;topic=34776.0;attach=584256;sess=0 |title=Manned Venus Flyby |date=February 1, 1967 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board. Dubbed [[Skylab]], it was assembled on the ground rather than in space, and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a Saturn V. It was equipped with an Apollo Telescope Mount.

First conceived during [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration]] as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person [[Project Mercury]], which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s national goal of \"landing a man on the Moon by the end of this decade and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person [[Project Gemini]] conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the [[Apollo 11]] mission when astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed their [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed [[astronaut]]s on the Moon, the last, [[Apollo 17]], in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|twelve men walked on the Moon]].\n\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|[[Buzz Aldrin]] (pictured) walked on the [[Moon]] with [[Neil Armstrong]], on [[Apollo 11]], July 20\u201321, 1969.|alt=Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon]]\n[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|alt=|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', the iconic 1968 image from [[Apollo 8|Apollo{{nbsp}}8]] taken by astronaut [[William Anders]]]]\nApollo ran from 1961 to 1972, with the first crewed flight in 1968. It encountered a major setback in 1967 when an [[Apollo 1]] cabin fire killed the entire crew during a prelaunch test. After the first successful landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar [[geology of the Moon|geological]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the [[Apollo 13]] landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which destroyed the service module's capability to provide electrical power, crippling the CSM's propulsion and life support systems. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the lunar module as a \"lifeboat\" for these functions. Apollo used [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family rockets]] as launch vehicles, which were also used for an [[Apollo Applications Program]], which consisted of [[Skylab]], a [[space station]] that supported three crewed missions in 1973\u201374, and the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]], a joint US-[[Soviet Union]] Earth-orbit mission in 1975.\n\nApollo set several major [[List of space exploration milestones, 1957\u20131969|human spaceflight milestones]]. It stands alone in sending crewed missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]]. [[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and [[Apollo 11]] was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.\n\nOverall the Apollo program returned {{convert|842|lb|kg}} of lunar rocks and [[lunar soil|soil]] to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability, and funded construction of its [[Johnson Space Center]] and [[Kennedy Space Center]]. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and [[human spaceflight]], including [[avionics]], telecommunications, and computers.\n\n==Background==\n===Origin and spacecraft feasibility studies===\n{{main|Apollo spacecraft feasibility study}}\n\nThe Apollo program was conceived during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration in early 1960, as a follow-up to [[Project Mercury]]. While the Mercury [[space capsule|capsule]] could support only one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission, Apollo would carry three. Possible missions included ferrying crews to a [[space station]], [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar flight]]s, and eventual crewed [[Moon landing|lunar landing]]s.\n\nThe program was named after [[Apollo]], the Greek god of light, music, and the Sun, by [[NASA]] manager [[Abe Silverstein]], who later said, \"I was naming the spacecraft like I'd name my baby.\"<ref>[[#Murray & Cox|Murray & Cox 1989]], p. 55</ref> Silverstein chose the name at home one evening, early in 1960, because he felt \"Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.\"<ref name=\"pressrelease\">{{cite press release |title=Release 69-36 |date=July 14, 1969 |publisher=[[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]] |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/apollo_press_release.html |location=Cleveland, OH |accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1960, NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh L. Dryden]] announced the Apollo program to industry representatives at a series of [[Space Task Group]] conferences. Preliminary specifications were laid out for a spacecraft with a ''mission module'' cabin separate from the ''command module'' (piloting and reentry cabin), and a ''propulsion and equipment module''. On August 30, a feasibility study competition was announced, and on October 25, three study contracts were awarded to [[Convair|General Dynamics/Convair]], [[General Electric]], and the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. Meanwhile, NASA performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by [[Maxime Faget]], to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs.<ref name=\"chariots_feasibility\">[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 1.7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch1-7.html \"Feasility Studies\"]. pp. 16-21</ref>\n\n===Political pressure builds===\n{{main|Space Race}}\n\nIn November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the [[Soviet Union]] in the fields of [[space exploration]] and [[missile defense]]. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the \"[[missile gap]]\" that he and many other senators felt had developed between the Soviet Union and the United States due to the inaction of President Eisenhower.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Christopher A. |last=Preble |title=\"Who Ever Believed in the 'Missile Gap'?\": John F.

Webb]] requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.<ref>[[#Beschloss|Beschloss 1997]], p. 55</ref>\n\nOn April 12, 1961, Soviet [[astronaut#Russian|cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US House [[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|Committee on Science and Astronautics]] one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.<ref>[[#87th Congress|87th Congress 1961]]</ref> Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.<ref>[[#Sidey|Sidey 1963]], p. 114</ref>\n\n[[File:Kennedy Giving Historic Speech to Congress - GPN-2000-001658.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

LOR advocates including [[John Houbolt]] at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging that he spoke \"somewhat as a voice in the wilderness\", Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.<ref>[[#Brooks, et al.|Brooks, et al. 1979]], Chapter 3.4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch3-4.html \"Early Reaction to LOR\"]. p. 71</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Nicholas E.

Wiesner blurted out \"No, that's no good\" in front of the press, during a presentation by von Braun. Webb jumped in and defended von Braun, until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was \"still subject to final review\". Webb held firm and issued a [[request for proposal]] to candidate Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) contractors. Wiesner finally relented, unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedy's office, because of the President's involvement with the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and fear of Kennedy's support for Webb.

Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen. In 1964 an MSC study concluded, \"The [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] [as lifeboat]{{nbsp}}... was finally dropped, because no single reasonable [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the [[Apollo command and service module#Service propulsion system|SPS]].\"<ref>Letterman, p. 404 (James Lovell, \"Explosion on Apollo 13; April 1970: From the Earth to the Moon and Back\".

Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a ''command and service Module'' (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the ''Lunar Excursion Module'' (LEM, later shortened to ''Lunar Module'', LM, but still pronounced \"lem\") which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.<ref name=\"SummaryReport\" />\n\n===Command and service module===\n{{main|Apollo command and service module}}\n[[File:Apollo CSM lunar orbit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Apollo 15]] [[Apollo command and service module|CSM]] in lunar orbit|alt=The cone-shaped command module, attached to the cylindrical service module, orbits the Moon with a panel removed, exposing the scientific instrument module]]\n\nThe [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) was the conical crew cabin, designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.

The capability of the command module's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.\n\n[[Apollo 5]] (AS-204) was the first uncrewed test flight of LM in Earth orbit, launched from pad 37 on January 22, 1968, by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1. The LM engines were successfully test-fired and restarted, despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing. The ascent engine was fired in abort mode, known as a \"fire-in-the-hole\" test, where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage.

The intent of this mission was to achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the service module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced [[pogo oscillation]], a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection.

Apollo 13 launched Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in April 1970, headed for the [[Fra Mauro formation]]. But two days out, a liquid oxygen tank exploded, disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a \"lifeboat\" to return to Earth. Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause, which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory, and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.<ref name=\"KSC-Apollo_13\" /> Apollo was grounded again, for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch11-7.html \"Mission to Fra Mauro\"]. p. 199</ref>\n\nThe contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs was enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV) increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was [[Apollo/Skylab A7L#A7LB Spacesuit (Apollo, Skylab and ASTP)|revised for the extended missions]] to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 12-4: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-4.html \"Changes for Extended Lunar Missions\"]. pp. 211-214</ref>\n\n====Mission cutbacks====\n{{main|Canceled Apollo missions}}\n\nAbout the time of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming [[Space Shuttle]]. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.<ref>[[#Compton|Compton 1989]], Chapter 11-7: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch12-2.html \"Cutbacks and Program Changes\"]. pp. 201-202</ref> The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the [[John F.

The final fiscal year of Apollo funding was 1973.\n\n==Apollo Applications Program==\n{{main|Apollo Applications Program}}\n\nLooking beyond the crewed lunar landings, NASA investigated several post-lunar applications for Apollo hardware. The Apollo Extension Series (''Apollo X'',) proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit, using the space in the [[Apollo (spacecraft)#Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter (SLA)|Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter]] (SLA) to house a small orbital laboratory (workshop). Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station. This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty S-IVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). The workshop was to be supplemented by the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], which could be attached to the ascent stage of the lunar module via a rack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4208/ch4.htm|title=A Science Program for Manned Spaceflight|access-date=June 11, 2016}}</ref> The most ambitious plan called for using an empty S-IVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a [[Manned Venus Flyby|Venus fly-by mission]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=j74hfnr889reqoinelc27u5877&action=dlattach;topic=34776.0;attach=584256;sess=0 |title=Manned Venus Flyby |date=February 1, 1967 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe S-IVB orbital workshop was the only one of these plans to make it off the drawing board.
