They were first described by [[Florentino Ameghino]], from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of [[Patagonia]]. Sparassodonts were present throughout South America's long period of \"splendid isolation\" during the [[Cenozoic]]; during this time, they shared the niches for large warm-blooded predators with the flightless [[Phorusrhacidae|terror bird]]s. Previously, it was thought that these mammals died out in the face of competition from \"more competitive\" [[placental]] [[carnivorans]] during the [[Pliocene]] [[Great American Interchange]], but more recent research has showed that sparassodonts died out long before eutherian carnivores arrived in South America (aside from [[Procyonidae|procyonids]], which sparassodonts probably did not directly compete with).<ref name=\"parahyaenodon\" /><ref name=\"link.springer\">{{cite journal| title=The Evolution of the Cenozoic Terrestrial Mammalian Predator Guild in South America: Competition or Replacement?|first=Francisco J.|last=Prevosti|author2=Anal\u00eda Forasiepi |author3=Natalia Zimicz |journal=[[Journal of Mammalian Evolution]]|year=2013|volume=20|pages=3\u201321| doi=10.1007/s10914-011-9175-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Engelman2019\"/> Sparassodonts have been referred to as '''borhyaenoids''' by some authors,<ref name=\"Simpson1941\"/><ref name=\"Naish\"/><ref name=\"Argot2004\"/> but currently the term Borhyaenoidea refers to a restricted subgroup of sparassodonts comprising [[Borhyaenidae|borhyaenids]] and their close relatives.<ref name=\"Forasiepi2009\"/><ref name=\"Marshal1990\"/>\n\n==Features==\n\nAlthough members of the order Sparassodonta showed many similarities with placental [[carnivores]], they were not closely related and are a very good example of convergent evolution.

They were first described by [[Florentino Ameghino]], from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of [[Patagonia]]. Sparassodonts were present throughout South America's long period of \"splendid isolation\" during the [[Cenozoic]]; during this time, they shared the niches for large warm-blooded predators with the flightless [[Phorusrhacidae|terror bird]]s. Previously, it was thought that these mammals died out in the face of competition from \"more competitive\" [[placental]] [[carnivorans]] during the [[Pliocene]] [[Great American Interchange]], but more recent research has showed that sparassodonts died out long before eutherian carnivores arrived in South America (aside from [[Procyonidae|procyonids]], which sparassodonts probably did not directly compete with).<ref name=\"parahyaenodon\" /><ref name=\"link.springer\">{{cite journal| title=The Evolution of the Cenozoic Terrestrial Mammalian Predator Guild in South America: Competition or Replacement?|first=Francisco J.|last=Prevosti|author2=Anal\u00eda Forasiepi |author3=Natalia Zimicz |journal=[[Journal of Mammalian Evolution]]|year=2013|volume=20|pages=3\u201321| doi=10.1007/s10914-011-9175-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Engelman2019\"/> Sparassodonts have been referred to as '''borhyaenoids''' by some authors,<ref name=\"Simpson1941\"/><ref name=\"Naish\"/><ref name=\"Argot2004\"/> but currently the term Borhyaenoidea refers to a restricted subgroup of sparassodonts comprising [[Borhyaenidae|borhyaenids]] and their close relatives.<ref name=\"Forasiepi2009\"/><ref name=\"Marshal1990\"/>\n\n==Features==\n\nAlthough members of the order Sparassodonta showed many similarities with placental [[carnivores]], they were not closely related and are a very good example of convergent evolution.

Its release was preceded by the single \"Emmaretta\" and by a long tour in the UK, whose dates were interspersed between the album's recording sessions.\n\nThe music of this album is mostly original and a combination of [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], but with a harder edge and with the guitar parts in more evidence than in the past. This was due both to the growth of guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]] as a songwriter and to the conflicts within the band over the fusion of [[classical music]] and rock proposed by keyboard player [[Jon Lord]] and amply implemented in the band's previous releases.\n\nThe band started their second US tour in April 1969 with little support from their almost-bankrupt American label and without an album to promote, because of a delay in the manufacturing of the new LP. During the tour, Deep Purple showed a remarkable progress as performers and a musical direction more oriented towards a heavier and louder sound than before. Doubts about compatibility of vocalist [[Rod Evans]] with the hard rock music that other band members wanted to pursue brought about the decision of searching for a substitute, which was found in [[Ian Gillan]] of the band [[Episode Six]]. Gillan had formed a songwriting duo with Episode Six's bassist [[Roger Glover]], who was also invited to join Deep Purple and replace [[Nick Simper]]. The band's new line-up, identified as Mark II, debuted live in London on 10 July 1969.\n\nCommercially, this album was the least successful of the three albums released by the band's Mark I line-up and was ignored by critics upon its release. Modern reviews are generally positive and remark on the variety of styles within the album and the boldness of the song arrangements.\n\n==Background==\nIn late 1968, Deep Purple had embarked on a successful first US tour to promote their second album, ''[[The Book of Taliesyn]]'', and returned home on 3 January 1969.<ref name=\"CD4\" >Robinson: p. 4</ref> The band was considered an underground act in the United Kingdom, but word of their success in America had influenced their reputation at home, as they gradually rose in popularity and request.<ref name=\"CD4\" /><ref name=\"T58\">Thompson: p. 58</ref> However, their releases had yet to make an impact in the UK,<ref name=\"P33\">Popoff: p. 33</ref> where their second single, a cover of [[Neil Diamond]]'s \"[[Kentucky Woman]]\", had not charted and was retired after six weeks,<ref name=\"Tal8\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Book of Taliesyn Remastered |others=[[Deep Purple]] |year=2000 |first=Simon |last=Robinson | type= CD Booklet |publisher= [[EMI]] |id=7243 5 21608 22 |location= London, UK |page= 8}}</ref> after having peaked at No. 38 in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-book-of-taliesyn-mw0000195135/awards |title=The Book of Taliesyn Billboard Singles |accessdate=2 February 2014 |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314215855/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-book-of-taliesyn-mw0000195135/awards |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and No. 21 in Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.5889&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=5qm7edenekrvgo1m1n5r72q651| title = Top Singles \u2013 Volume 10, No. 16, December 16 1968| accessdate = 2 February 2014 | date = 16 December 1968 | publisher = [[Library and Archives Canada]]}}</ref>\n\nDeep Purple's American label [[Tetragrammaton Records]] pressured the band to make a single to match the success of their hit \"[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]\",<ref name=\"B121\" >Bloom: p.121</ref> and the band had tried to satisfy that request while still in the US for the last dates of their tour; they recorded some [[cover version|covers]] in a New York studio in December 1968, without worthwhile results.<ref name=\"T56\">Thompson: p. 56</ref> The musicians had come up with much more complex original material for their second album and making a song that would easily fit the three-minute range was apparently becoming difficult.<ref name=\"CD4\" />\n\nA few days after their US tour, Deep Purple settled in with their usual producer [[Derek Lawrence]] at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in Kingsway, London, already used for ''The Book of Taliesyn'' sessions, to compose and record new songs and solve the new single problem.<ref name=\"B121\" /> The song \"Emmaretta\", named after the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' cast member Emmaretta Marks whom singer [[Rod Evans]] had met in the US, was composed for that purpose and recorded on 7 January 1969, after four takes.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> The heavier and more experimental song \"The Bird Has Flown\" was arranged and recorded later on the same day and was chosen as the B-side for the US release.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> The instrumental \"Wring That Neck\" from their previous album was the B-side of the British edition of \"Emmaretta\", which was issued in February 1969 and promoted by Deep Purple in their first full UK tour.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> This was the first time that a Deep Purple release appeared in the UK before the US.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> The tour started in Birmingham on 6 February with a concert broadcast by [[BBC Radio 1]],<ref name=\"T58\"/> and went on as a series of one-nighters in clubs and colleges across the country during February and March.<ref name=\"CD4\" /><ref name=\"live\" >{{cite web | url = http://www.deeppurpleliveindex.com/ | title = Deep Purple Live Index \u2013 search for Mk I (68/69) | accessdate = 25 January 2014 | publisher = Deep Purple Live Index.com}}</ref> Deep Purple's greater visibility and their declared interest in the British public induced local music magazines to print a few articles on them.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> But after keyboard player and spokesperson [[Jon Lord]] publicly stated that they would play large arenas for \u00a32500 per show in America then come home and only be able to book small venues paying \u00a3150 a night, typical headlines were \"Purple won't starve for an ideal\" and \"They lose \u00a32350 a night working in Britain\".<ref name=\"CD5\" >Robinson: p. 5</ref>\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe band's management organized the spare time from the UK tour to record new songs for a third album over the course of February and March 1969 at De Lane Lea Studios, with Lawrence as producer and Barry Ainsworth as sound engineer.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> The pressure of the multiple engagements left the band very little time for composition and most of the tracks were written and rehearsed in the studio.<ref name=\"Popoff 36\">Popoff: p.36</ref> ''Deep Purple'' was the band's third album to be recorded, even though they had been together for less than one year. According to Nick Simper: \"Recording was always a problem. We were always short of material, purely because of our schedule. The fact that we were always being chased by Tetragrammaton for material, we never had the luxury like most bands do now of saying, 'hang on fellas, we need a little bit of down time to just think about stuff and try and be creative.'\"<ref name=DP-critical>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQI1LYpGD5A | title=Deep Purple - A Critical Retrospective/Rock Review | accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref> Added Blackmore: \"That really bugs me...going to the studio, 'right, you gotta turn out an LP, boys.' You know, 'here we go, you gotta write a song...''today''.' It\u2019s just ridiculous.\"<ref name=DP-critical/>\n\nThe musicians were now starting to fully endeavour to write original material and found ideas for seven songs,<ref name=\"P33\"/> more than on either of their first two albums.<ref name=\"T57\">Thompson: p. 57</ref> Musical and lyrical inspiration came from very disparate sources.

to affect the US charts.<ref name=\"CD6\" /> The label's financial distress caused a delay in the printing of ''Deep Purple'', which was released in the US only on 21 June 1969, after the band had

album and touring in the UK, their managers at HEC Enterprises had found an agreement for Deep Purple to support [[the Rolling Stones]] in their upcoming US tour during Spring 1969, the first in three years and a certain sold-out event.<ref name=\"T59\"/> Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones decided to spend more time at [[Olympic Studios]] in London to record their album ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' and postponed their tour.<ref name=\"T59\"/> Thus, in early April 1969 Deep Purple were on their way back to the US to start off a two-month coast-to-coast tour as headliners which, similarly to what had happened in Britain, brought them mainly to small clubs and colleges.<ref name=\"live\" /><ref name=\"T59\"/><ref name=\"CD6\" >Robinson: p. 6</ref> This time their trek also touched Canada, where their albums were distributed by [[Polydor Records]].<ref name=\"live\" /><ref name=\"CD6\" />\n\nUpon arrival on US soil, Deep Purple found out that Tetragrammaton had not yet found the resources to manufacture their now finished album and could offer very little financial support to the tour.<ref name=\"CD5\" /> Contrary to what happened in the past, when the American label had spent much money in advance for promotion and people who saw the band on the road could find stacks of LPs and singles for sale at every concert,<ref>Popoff: p. 39</ref> this time the single \"Emmaretta\" and the band's back-catalogue remained sitting on store shelves.<ref name=\"CD6\" /> In fact, the band experienced some economic limitations during the tour and asked their manager [[John Coletta]] to fly back home, so the hotel bills would be reduced.<ref name=\"CD6\" /><ref name=\"T60\">Thompson: p. 60</ref> Coletta later commented on how 1969 was a wasted year for Deep Purple in America.<ref

between Blackmore and Lord.<ref name=\"CD6\" /><ref name=\"T60\"/> In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original [[Leslie speaker]]s of his [[Hammond organ]] C-3 and connect

other hand, Simper sided with Blackmore against Lord's excessive influence in the band's songwriting and was critical of classical music getting in the way of harder rock.<ref name=\"darker\"

was completed.<ref name=\"T62\"/> Meanwhile, the search for a new singer to replace Evans began and Blackmore asked for help in this task from his old acquaintance [[Mick Underwood]], at the time drummer of the British rock band [[Episode Six]].<ref name=\"CD7\" /> Underwood recommended Episode Six singer [[Ian Gillan]], whom Blackmore and Lord contacted at a London gig.<ref name=\"T69\">Thompson: p. 69</ref> Gillan, who did not see a future in his then current band,<ref name=\"T69\"/> was enthusiastic about joining Deep Purple and involved bassist [[Roger Glover]], with whom he formed a songwriting duo.<ref name=\"Simper\" /> According to Simper, his replacement with Glover was initially not planned and was due to the creative togetherness of the two Episode Six members.<ref>Bloom: p. 126</ref> Gillan convinced the reluctant Glover to audition for Deep Purple and the two soon found themselves torn between the new band, which gladly welcomed both of them, and obligations with Episode Six for the completion of a UK tour.<ref>Thompson: pp. 69\u201370</ref> Evans, Simper and Episode Six's management were kept unaware of these events and of the fact that the new line-up was already active in writing and rehearsing new songs.<ref name=\"CD10\" /> In between gigs all over the country, Deep Purple had rehearsed the song \"Hallelujah\" with Evans and Simper to be released as a new single, but it was recorded in secret on 7 June by the fresh Mark II line-up at De Lane Studios instead, with Glover still acting as a session musician.<ref name=\"CD10\" /> The final show of the Mark I lineup was in Cardiff on 4 July 1969, and the Mark II lineup debuted live at [[The Speakeasy Club]] in London on 10 July.<ref name=\"inrock9\" /> The final show played by Gillan and Glover with Episode Six was in Little Bardfield on 26 July 1969.<ref name=\"inrock9\" /> The single \"Hallelujah\" was released in late July in the US and the UK and featured an edited version of \"April\" as B-side, the final original appearance on vinyl of the Mark I formation.<ref name=\"CD10\" />\n\nAfter his dismissal, Evans left for the US with his wife and resurfaced in 1971

Its release was preceded by the single \"Emmaretta\" and by a long tour in the UK, whose dates were interspersed between the album's recording sessions.\n\nThe music of this album is mostly original and a combination of [[progressive rock]], [[hard rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]], but with a harder edge and with the guitar parts in more evidence than in the past. This was due both to the growth of guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]] as a songwriter and to the conflicts within the band over the fusion of [[classical music]] and rock proposed by keyboard player [[Jon Lord]] and amply implemented in the band's previous releases.\n\nThe band started their second US tour in April 1969 with little support from their almost-bankrupt American label and without an album to promote, because of a delay in the manufacturing of the new LP. During the tour, Deep Purple showed a remarkable progress as performers and a musical direction more oriented towards a heavier and louder sound than before. Doubts about compatibility of vocalist [[Rod Evans]] with the hard rock music that other band members wanted to pursue brought about the decision of searching for a substitute, which was found in [[Ian Gillan]] of the band [[Episode Six]]. Gillan had formed a songwriting duo with Episode Six's bassist [[Roger Glover]], who was also invited to join Deep Purple and replace [[Nick Simper]]. The band's new line-up, identified as Mark II, debuted live in London on 10 July 1969.\n\nCommercially, this album was the least successful of the three albums released by the band's Mark I line-up and was ignored by critics upon its release. Modern reviews are generally positive and remark on the variety of styles within the album and the boldness of the song arrangements.\n\n==Background==\nIn late 1968, Deep Purple had embarked on a successful first US tour to promote their second album, ''[[The Book of Taliesyn]]'', and returned home on 3 January 1969.<ref name=\"CD4\" >Robinson: p. 4</ref> The band was considered an underground act in the United Kingdom, but word of their success in America had influenced their reputation at home, as they gradually rose in popularity and request.<ref name=\"CD4\" /><ref name=\"T58\">Thompson: p. 58</ref> However, their releases had yet to make an impact in the UK,<ref name=\"P33\">Popoff: p. 33</ref> where their second single, a cover of [[Neil Diamond]]'s \"[[Kentucky Woman]]\", had not charted and was retired after six weeks,<ref name=\"Tal8\">{{cite AV media notes |title=The Book of Taliesyn Remastered |others=[[Deep Purple]] |year=2000 |first=Simon |last=Robinson | type= CD Booklet |publisher= [[EMI]] |id=7243 5 21608 22 |location= London, UK |page= 8}}</ref> after having peaked at No. 38 in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-book-of-taliesyn-mw0000195135/awards |title=The Book of Taliesyn Billboard Singles |accessdate=2 February 2014 |work=[[AllMusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314215855/http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-book-of-taliesyn-mw0000195135/awards |archivedate=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and No. 21 in Canada.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.5889&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=5qm7edenekrvgo1m1n5r72q651| title = Top Singles \u2013 Volume 10, No. 16, December 16 1968| accessdate = 2 February 2014 | date = 16 December 1968 | publisher = [[Library and Archives Canada]]}}</ref>\n\nDeep Purple's American label [[Tetragrammaton Records]] pressured the band to make a single to match the success of their hit \"[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]\",<ref name=\"B121\" >Bloom: p.121</ref> and the band had tried to satisfy that request while still in the US for the last dates of their tour; they recorded some [[cover version|covers]] in a New York studio in December 1968, without worthwhile results.<ref name=\"T56\">Thompson: p. 56</ref> The musicians had come up with much more complex original material for their second album and making a song that would easily fit the three-minute range was apparently becoming difficult.<ref name=\"CD4\" />\n\nA few days after their US tour, Deep Purple settled in with their usual producer [[Derek Lawrence]] at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in Kingsway, London, already used for ''The Book of Taliesyn'' sessions, to compose and record new songs and solve the new single problem.<ref name=\"B121\" /> The song \"Emmaretta\", named after the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' cast member Emmaretta Marks whom singer [[Rod Evans]] had met in the US, was composed for that purpose and recorded on 7 January 1969, after four takes.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> The heavier and more experimental song \"The Bird Has Flown\" was arranged and recorded later on the same day and was chosen as the B-side for the US release.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> The instrumental \"Wring That Neck\" from their previous album was the B-side of the British edition of \"Emmaretta\", which was issued in February 1969 and promoted by Deep Purple in their first full UK tour.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> This was the first time that a Deep Purple release appeared in the UK before the US.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> The tour started in Birmingham on 6 February with a concert broadcast by [[BBC Radio 1]],<ref name=\"T58\"/> and went on as a series of one-nighters in clubs and colleges across the country during February and March.<ref name=\"CD4\" /><ref name=\"live\" >{{cite web | url = http://www.deeppurpleliveindex.com/ | title = Deep Purple Live Index \u2013 search for Mk I (68/69) | accessdate = 25 January 2014 | publisher = Deep Purple Live Index.com}}</ref> Deep Purple's greater visibility and their declared interest in the British public induced local music magazines to print a few articles on them.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> But after keyboard player and spokesperson [[Jon Lord]] publicly stated that they would play large arenas for \u00a32500 per show in America then come home and only be able to book small venues paying \u00a3150 a night, typical headlines were \"Purple won't starve for an ideal\" and \"They lose \u00a32350 a night working in Britain\".<ref name=\"CD5\" >Robinson: p. 5</ref>\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe band's management organized the spare time from the UK tour to record new songs for a third album over the course of February and March 1969 at De Lane Lea Studios, with Lawrence as producer and Barry Ainsworth as sound engineer.<ref name=\"CD4\" /> The pressure of the multiple engagements left the band very little time for composition and most of the tracks were written and rehearsed in the studio.<ref name=\"Popoff 36\">Popoff: p.36</ref> ''Deep Purple'' was the band's third album to be recorded, even though they had been together for less than one year. According to Nick Simper: \"Recording was always a problem. We were always short of material, purely because of our schedule.

album and touring in the UK, their managers at HEC Enterprises had found an agreement for Deep Purple to support [[the Rolling Stones]] in their upcoming US tour during Spring 1969, the first in three years and a certain sold-out event.<ref name=\"T59\"/> Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones decided to spend more time at [[Olympic Studios]] in London to record their album ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' and postponed their tour.<ref name=\"T59\"/> Thus, in early April 1969 Deep Purple were on their way back to the US to start off a two-month coast-to-coast tour as headliners which, similarly to what had happened in Britain, brought them mainly to small clubs and colleges.<ref name=\"live\" /><ref name=\"T59\"/><ref name=\"CD6\" >Robinson: p. 6</ref> This time their trek also touched Canada, where their albums were distributed by [[Polydor Records]].<ref name=\"live\" /><ref name=\"CD6\" />\n\nUpon arrival on US soil, Deep Purple found out that Tetragrammaton had not yet found the resources to manufacture their now finished album and could offer very little financial support to the tour.<ref name=\"CD5\" /> Contrary to what happened in the past, when the American label had spent much money in advance for promotion and people who saw the band on the road could find stacks of LPs and singles for sale at every concert,<ref>Popoff: p. 39</ref> this time the single \"Emmaretta\" and the band's back-catalogue remained sitting on store shelves.<ref name=\"CD6\" /> In fact, the band experienced some economic limitations during the tour and asked their manager [[John Coletta]] to fly back home, so the hotel bills would be reduced.<ref name=\"CD6\" /><ref name=\"T60\">Thompson: p. 60</ref> Coletta later commented on how 1969 was a wasted year for Deep Purple in America.<ref

drummer of the British rock band [[Episode Six]].<ref name=\"CD7\" /> Underwood recommended Episode Six singer [[Ian Gillan]], whom Blackmore and Lord contacted at a London gig.<ref name=\"T69\">Thompson: p. 69</ref> Gillan, who did not see a future in his then current band,<ref name=\"T69\"/> was enthusiastic about joining Deep Purple and involved bassist [[Roger Glover]], with whom he formed a songwriting duo.<ref name=\"Simper\" /> According to Simper, his replacement with Glover was initially not planned and was due to the creative togetherness of the two Episode Six members.<ref>Bloom: p. 126</ref> Gillan convinced the reluctant Glover to audition for Deep Purple and the two soon found themselves torn between the new band, which gladly welcomed both of them, and obligations with Episode Six for the completion of a UK tour.<ref>Thompson: pp. 69\u201370</ref> Evans, Simper and Episode Six's management were kept unaware of these events and of the fact that the

to be released as a new single, but it was recorded in secret on 7 June by the fresh Mark II line-up at De Lane Studios instead, with Glover still acting as a session musician.<ref name=\"CD10\" />

Gillan and Glover with Episode Six was in Little Bardfield on 26 July 1969.<ref name=\"inrock9\" /> The single \"Hallelujah\" was released in late July in the US and the UK and featured an edited

[[AllMusic]]'s Bruce Eder calls the album \"one of the most bracing progressive rock albums ever, and a successful vision of a musical path that the group might have taken but didn't\", remarking how Deep Purple succeeded in combining \"heavy metal's early, raw excitement, intensity, and boldness with progressive rock's complexity and intellectual scope.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> Jedd Beaudoin of [[PopMatters]] appreciates in his review the heavier sound of the songs and notices how \"Evans sounds more and more out of place in a band that was increasingly more comfortable with stretching itself beyond the confines of pure pop pieces\", like in the track \"April\", which he considers not only \"the most ambitious thing on the entire record, but also arguably the best.\"<ref name=\"popmatters\" /> David Bowling, in his [[Blogcritics]] column, reviews the album as \"the least satisfying of their three early career releases, although it can also be considered their most adventurous\" for its \"meandering through a number of different styles and sounds.\" However, considering the growth shown by Blackmore and Lord as performers in this release, he concludes that it is \"a fitting conclusion to the band's formative years.\"<ref name=\"Blogcritics\"/> [[Martin Popoff]] praised the album for being \"stronger, more aggressive and much better recorded\" than \"either of the first two records\", showing the original work of \"a strangely soulful psych band distinguished\", with the exception of singer Evans, \"by its hard-hitting players\".<ref name=\"martin\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll credits adapted from the original releases.<ref name=\"sleeve\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Deep Purple |others=[[Deep Purple]] |year=1969 |type=LP Sleeve |publisher=[[Harvest Records]] SHVL 759 |location=London, UK}}</ref>\n{{track listing\n| headline = Side one\n| title1   = Chasing Shadows\n| writer1   = [[Ian Paice]], [[Jon Lord]]\n| length1   = 5:34\n| title2   = Blind\n| writer2   = Lord\n| length2   = 5:26\n| title3   = [[Lal\u00e9na|Lalena]]\n| note3  = Donovan cover\n| writer3   = [[Donovan|Donovan Leitch]]\n| length3   = 5:05\n| title4   = Fault Line\n| writer4   = [[Ritchie Blackmore]], [[Nick Simper]], Lord, Paice\n| note4  = instrumental\n| length4   = 1:46\n| title5   = The Painter\n| writer5   = Blackmore, [[Rod Evans]], Lord, Simper, Paice\n| length5   = 3:51\n}}\n{{track listing\n| headline = Side two\n| title6   = Why Didn't Rosemary?\n| writer6   = Blackmore, Evans, Lord, Simper, Paice\n| length6   = 5:04\n| title7   = Bird Has Flown\n| writer7   = Lord, Evans, Blackmore\n| length7   = 5:36\n| title8   = April\n| writer8   = Blackmore, Lord\n| length8   = 12:10\n}}\n{{track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = Remastered CD edition bonus tracks\n| title9   = The Bird Has Flown\n| note9   = Alternate [[A-side]] version\n| writer9   = Lord, Evans, Blackmore\n| length9   = 2:54\n| title10   = Emmaretta\n| note10   = Studio [[B-side]]\n| writer10  = Lord, Evans, Blackmore\n| length10  = 3:00\n| title11   = Emmaretta\n| note11   = [[BBC]] ''Top Gear'' session, 14 January 1969\n| writer11  = Lord, Evans, Blackmore\n| length11  = 3:09\n| title12   = Lalena\n| note12   = BBC radio session;
