{"title_page": "Symphony No. 2 (Borodin)", "text_new": "[[File:Borodin.jpg|right|200px|[[help:contents|demo]]]]'''Symphony No. 2 in B minor''' by [[Alexander Borodin]] was composed intermittently between 1869 and 1876. It consists of four movements and is considered the most important large-scale work completed by the composer himself. It has many melodic resemblances to both ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and ''[[Mlada]]'', two theatre works that diverted Borodin's attention on and off during the six years of composition.\n\n==Composition==\nAlthough he had a keen interest in music, Borodin's scientific research and teaching duties as an adjunct professor of Chemistry in the Medico-Surgical Academy at [[St. Petersburg]] since 1874 interrupted his composition of the Second [[Symphony]]. As a result, this symphony took several years to complete.\n\n{{quote|On visiting him I seldom found him working in the laboratory which adjoined his apartment. When he sat over his retorts filled with some colorless gas and distilled it by means of a tube from one vessel into another, I used to tell him that he was \u2018transfusing emptiness into vacancy\u2019. Having finished his work, he would go without me to his apartment, where he began musical operations or conversations, in the midst of which he used to jump up, run back to the laboratory to see whether something had not burned out or boiled over; meanwhile he filled the corridor with incredible sequences from successions of ninths or sevenths.<ref>Terrence Lee.

Borodin suddenly decided to abandon ''Prince Igor'' in March 1870, criticizing his own inability to write a libretto that would satisfy both musical and scenic requirement.<ref>Robert W Oldani, \"Borodin, Aleksandr Porfir\u2019yevich,\" in [[Grove Music Online]], [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com] (accessed 10 March 2009).</ref> He told his wife, \"There is scarcely any drama or scenic movement\u2026 Anyhow, opera seems to me an unnatural thing\u2026 besides I am by nature a lyricist and symphonist; I am attracted by the symphonic forms.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, ii.</ref>\n\nSoon after setting ''Prince Igor'' aside, Borodin returned to the B minor Symphony, assuring Stasov that the \"materials\" created for the opera would be used in the newly revived symphony. According to Stasov in an article contributed to the \"Vestnik Evropi\" in 1883, Borodin told him more than once that in the first movement he wished to depict a gathering of Russian warrior-heroes, in the slow movement the figure of a bayan\u2014a type of Russian [[accordion]], and in the finale a scene of heroes feasting to the sound of guslis\u2014an ancient plucked instrument.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe composed most of the first movement in April 1870, and he wrote it out onto a piano score a year later, in spring 1871. In that same year he sketched the Scherzo and Andante. That summer he orchestrated the first movement, and in October he drafted the finale.<ref>Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, iv.</ref>\n\nBorodin's work on the symphony was again interrupted when the Director of the Imperial Theatres, Stephan Gedenov, asked him to collaborate on an extravagant opera-ballet ''[[Mlada]]'' with other members of [[Vladimir Stasov]]'s \"mighty little heap,\" namely [[Cesar Cui]], [[Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].<ref>Francis Maes, A History of Russian Music: From Kamarinskaya to Babi Yar, translated by [[Arnold J. Pomerans]] and Erica Pomerans (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 7.</ref> In his usual fashion of composing, Borodin borrowed heavily from earlier works, in this case ''Prince Igor''. The show was ultimately cancelled because of production costs, and Borodin once again turned to the B minor Symphony.<ref>Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, iv.</ref>\n\nA new interest took his attention away from the composition once again in the fall of 1872 as the [[Tsar Alexander II]]'s government passed legislation allowing women to take advanced medical courses. As an advocate of the new campaign, Borodin became the founder of a School of Medicine for women, where he taught several courses. Despite these distractions, Borodin finished the piano score in May 1873.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Oldani, \"Borodin, Aleksandr Porfir\u2019yevich.\"</ref>\n\nThe following academic year (1873\u201374), more and more aggravated that he was not receiving support or recognition for his scientific work, he published his last paper on aldehydes and turned to teaching; it was at this time that he became director of the Medical-Surgical Academy's laboratory facilities. Meanwhile, he also took up ''Prince Igor'' again and worked on orchestrating the final three movements of the symphony, although this work was not ultimately completed until 1875.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn the autumn of 1876, the [[Russian Musical Society]] showed an interest in performing the symphony; however, Borodin was disconcerted to find that he had lost the full score.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Although the middle movements were eventually found, he had to reorchestrate the outer two movements while sick in bed. The work was premiered 10 March 1877<ref>26 February/10 March. Dates in scholarly texts for this and other Russian works are frequently shown with both the earlier [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]] dates, and later [[Gregorian calendar]] dates; Russia used the Eastern Orthodox calendar until the fall of tsarist Russia with the beginning of the [[communist]] regime when [[Lenin]] changed to the Gregorian calendar.</ref> under the baton of [[Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This symphony fits in the debate over the merit of [[folklore]] elements and traditional western art music values, which was a central conflict of [[Romantic nationalism]].<ref>Maes, A History of Russian Music, 8.</ref> The work was popular, but according to Rimsky-Korsakov, only enjoyed \"moderate success\" because Borodin had written the brass part too thickly.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBorodin's relationship with [[Liszt]] also had impacted his symphonic writing. Later in 1877, Borodin traveled to Germany in order to enroll some of his chemistry pupils in Jena University. While in Germany, Borodin visited Liszt in [[Weimar]] where the two played through both of Borodin's symphonies in four-hand piano arrangements. Liszt had been an admirer of Borodin's music and he arranged performances of Borodin's symphonies, making them the first Russian symphonies to be received abroad. Regarding Borodin's attempt to revise his score, Liszt said,\n\n{{quote|Heaven forbid! Do not touch it; alter nothing. Your modulations are neither extravagant nor faulty. Your artistic instinct is such that you need not fear to be original. Do not listen to those who would deter you from following your own way. You are on the right road. Similar advice was given to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who wisely ignored it. Despite the adage that \u2018there is nothing new under the sun,\u2019 your Second Symphony is entirely new. Nobody had done anything like it. And it is perfectly logical in structure.\"\u2026. From another source you are always lucid, intelligent and perfectly original [\u2026] work in your own way and pay no attention to anyone.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe symphony is scored for the following orchestra: \n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Woodwind]]s:\n:[[piccolo]]\n:2 [[flute]]s\n:2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling on [[cor anglais]])\n:2 [[clarinet]]s\n:2 [[bassoon]]s\n;[[Brass instrument|Brass]]:\n:4 [[French horn|horn]]s\n:2 [[trumpet]]s\n:3 [[trombone]]s\n:[[tuba]]\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Percussion]]:\n:3 [[timpani]]\n:[[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]\n:[[tambourine]]\n:[[bass drum]]\n:[[cymbal]]s (in the finale only)\n\n;[[Harp]]\n\n;[[String section|Strings]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Score and edition==\nIn 1879 Borodin revised the orchestration of the symphony and thinned out the heavy brass parts. The premiere of this final version took place 4 March 1879 under the baton of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] at a Free School Concert.<ref>Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, v.</ref> Borodin became occupied with the symphony one last time in 1886, while preparing the manuscript full score for the printer. He made a few refinement changes suggested by Rimsky-Korsakov, who also provided the [[metronome]] markings based on the successful second performance.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Theme from the second symphony (Borodin's tomb).JPG|220 px|thumb|Theme of the first movement on Borodin's grave monument.]]\n\nThe B minor [[Symphony]] is arguably the most important large-scale work completed by the composer himself, and is considered to be one of his greatest.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> It has many melodic resemblances to both ''Prince Igor'' and ''[[Mlada]]'', which were two theatrical works that diverted Borodin's attention away from the B minor symphony between 1869\u201375.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> According to the account of Borodin's friend [[Nikolay Kashkin]], the symphony's striking and abrupt opening theme originated from the abandoned chorus of [[Polovtsian]]s,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] biographer Serge Dianin notes that there is a common thread present in all three pieces.<ref>Serge Dianin, Borodin, translated by Robert Lord (London: [[Oxford University Press]], 1963), 200.</ref> According to Dianin, \"it is for this reason that we find certain similarities in the themes Borodin uses in these works.\" <ref>According to Dianin, \"it is for this reason that we find certain similarities in the themes Borodin uses in these works.\"</ref> The relation to the heroic world of ''Prince Igor'' led Stasov to nickname the work the \"''Bogatirskaya simfoniya''\" (\"Heroic symphony\").<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Maes, A History of Russian Music, 70.</ref>\n\n===I. Allegro moderato===\n[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=73]]\n\nExcluding the E natural, the opening theme is made up of an [[octatonic]] subcollection which consists of the major and minor 3rd above the tonic. The alternation between major and minor thirds is found throughout the symphony, and is based on this opening theme.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The lyrical second theme in D major not only sets a contrast to the first theme, but also to present the cyclic elements evident in the whole work. This is very recognizable in the trio of the [[scherzo]] movement, and distantly echoed in the finale.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Maes states that the second theme is a protyazhnaya stylization, which he defines as \"a splendid form of melismatically decorated song set to poetry of great expressive power and lyrical intensity.\" <ref>Maes, A History of Russian Music, 3.</ref>\n\nThe second theme in the recapitulation is also in E-flat (a diminished fourth away from the opening theme), making it an [[enharmonic]] major third above B natural. This makes the interchange between the major and minor third not only melodic, but structural as well.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nMusicologist A. Peter Brown notes that the first movement is a [[sonata form]], shaped by a somewhat unusual key scheme in the recapitulation, and provides the following analysis of the first movement.<ref>A. Peter Brown and Brian Hart, The European Symphony from ca. 1800 to ca. 1930, vol. 3, part B: Great Britain, Russia, and France.

Instead, he uses two keys (E-flat and C) which are not only distant from B minor, but also unrelated to the tonic key of S in the exposition. Brown concludes with the following thoughts about the first movement:\n\n{{quote|For a supposedly dilettante [[composer]] who had little training in the academic studies of musical composition, this first movement is a significant accomplishment. Though it has virtually no [[polyphony]], Borodin has sustained this piece with attractive melodies motivically interrelated, a large-scale sense of rhythm, effective orchestration in the revised version, and idiosyncratic use of harmony and [[modulation]], particularly in the recapitulation. This masterly first movement is a considerable advance over that of his First Symphony, whose high originality made it at times less effective.<ref>Brown (2008), 316</ref>}}\n\nIn spite of the first movement's sonata-like form, according to Brown, musicologist Francis Maes states that because of a compulsive repetition of the motto \u2013 in sequences, diminutions, and augmentations \u2013 the orchestration \u2013 with intensive use of the low brass \u2013 and the peculiarity of tempo changes, \"all this turns the first movement into a montage of contrasts rather than into a developing sonata form.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Despite this apparent conflict, music critic David Fanning argues that Borodin's use of melodic material, and the heroic themes that result, are \"virtually unprecedented in the history of the symphony.\" <ref>Fanning, David. \"Building a Library; Borodin's Symphony No. 2.\" [[BBC Music Magazine]]. Vol. 5, issue 8. (London: [[BBC]] Magazines, 1997), 46.</ref>\n\n===II. Scherzo. Molto vivo===\n[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=74]]\n\nThe second movement is unconventional in many ways, as it moves to the key of F major \u2013 a very remote key; which may have been Balakirev's idea originally.<ref>Dianin, Borodin, 202.</ref> It breaks from the usual triple meter, and it groups together unusual lengths of phrases.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 318.</ref> Instead, Borodin opts for {{music|time|1|1}} time with a tempo marking of 108 \u2013 four quarter notes to a bar with a whole note receiving the beat \u2013 and alternates between four and five bar phrases, with an occasional one or two bar phrase.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 319.</ref> There is a great deal of rhythmic contrast between the two main ideas; the first is firmly on the beat, while the second is syncopated.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAfter a four bar introduction, a majority of the [[Scherzo]] proper is a continuation of quarter note figures passed throughout the orchestra in a \"kaleidoscope of color.\"<ref>After a four bar introduction, a majority of the Scherzo proper is a continuation of quarter note figures passed throughout the orchestra in a \"kaleidoscope of color.\"</ref> Dianin notes that the second subject in this passage ends in an unusual fashion, marked by descending leaps of a fourth;<ref>Dianin, Borodin, 203.</ref> while Maes points out the recollection of [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], particularly the [[oriental]]-sounding Trio (Allegretto).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Following the transition to the Allegretto section in {{music|time|6|4}}, we have the second main theme. Brown had the following thoughts of this portion of the second movement:\n\n{{quote|Perhaps, this Allegretto is a Russian Barcarolle with its lilting rhythms in compound-duple meter, mild [[hemiola]]s, and a melody marked [[cantabile]] e dolce. Borodin's orchestration of the background is almost [[Klangfarben]] with harp, triangle, and horns providing a pointilistic accompaniment. The form builds through repetitions of its four-measure theme with changes to its background in good kuchkist fashion.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 318.</ref>}}\n\nFollowing the Allegretto is a return of the Scherzo proper, which [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] found to be the weak link in the symphony.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 319.</ref>\n\n===III. Andante===\n[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=75]]\nAccording to Borodin's friend and chief biographer [[Vladimir Stasov]], the third movement of the symphony was intended to depict the Slavic minstrel [[Boyan (bard)|Boyan]] accompanying himself on a [[gusli]] (a type of [[zither]]), represented by the [[harp]]. While this movement is similar to the third movement of his first symphony, the structure differs being [[rondo]]-like:<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| ''Introd.''\n| ''A''\n| ''B''\n| ''A''\n| ''C(A)''\n| ''B''\n| ''A''\n| ''B''\n| ''A''\n| ''Introd.''\n|-\n| D-flat\n| \n| E minor\n| A-flat\n| A\n| D-flat\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|-\n| 1\n| 5\n| 23\n| 46\n| 80\n| 87\n| 91\n| 101\n| 113\n| 121\n|} \n \nThe Andante begins with what Oldani calls \"one of Borodin's most serene melodies,\" <ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> played by solo clarinet and accompanied by the harp, and what follows is a horn solo with the ornamental grace notes that are quite typical of Borodin's lyrical melodies.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This melody is heard from various instruments throughout the piece, while some of the material incorporates the interaction between minor and major thirds present in the Allegro (I).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe movement ends in a similar fashion to how it began, with clarinet solo followed by horn solo, accompanied by harp. Maes eloquently summarizes the mystique of the third movement by pointing out how powerfully it refers to the \"mythical, imaginary world of both ''Ruslan'' and ''Prince Igor''.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n===IV. Finale. Allegro===\n[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=76]]\nAccording to Oldani the finale is in sonata form, but more free than the first movement.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, Brown points out that there are at least three viable ways to interpret the formal structure of this movement:<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.</ref> 1) in the standard western tradition of the symphony with the movement being either in sonata or rondo form; 2) as a collection of dances that mimic sonata form; 3) as a programmatic piece that follows the events laid out by Stasov.<ref>1) in the standard western tradition of the symphony with the movement being either in sonata or rondo form; 2) as a collection of dances that mimic [[sonata]] form; 3) as a programmatic piece that follows the events laid out by Stasov.</ref> This section begins with a pentatonic theme in the violin and viola, with the development consisting of a [[whole-tone]] passage which is also used in both Mlada and the prologue of ''Prince Igor''.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| ''Intr.''\n| ''Pr.''

These elements, combined with the addition of cymbals, triangle, tambourine, and bass drum, give the music not only a Slavic dance feel, but also makes it \"[[Music of Turkey|Turkish]]\" sounding to western ears.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.</ref> Each dance has its own bold rhythmic motion which is a result of the syncopation, as well as the resilient anacrustic formations;<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 323.</ref> Dianin describes the tone of the movement as being \"bright and jubilant.\" <ref>Dianin, Borodin, 205.</ref>\n\n===Summary===\nAccording to Dianin, Stasov believed that Borodin had the knights and [[Hero|heroic]] figures of ancient Russia in mind with this piece. \"The first movement depicts an assembly of Russian knights [\u2026] the Scherzo could be intended to suggest a headlong chase, but it could equally well be a festive scene [\u2026] the third movement was to have depicted Bayan, the legendary minstrel who appears in the ''Lay of Igor's Campaign'' [\u2026] and the finale is meant to depict \u2018the knights\u2019 feast, the sound of the gusli, and a jubilant throng of people.\" <ref>Dianin, Borodin, 207\u2013208.</ref>\n\nDianin concludes by stating that the overall character of Borodin's Symphony No. 2 is patriotic, and that he is showing his sincere admiration for the strength and courage of the men of old, who \"saved Russia from her enemies.\"<ref name=\"Dianin, Borodin, 209\">Dianin, Borodin, 209.</ref> Borodin not only admired these great heroes of Russian history, but was able to capture their essence in his music.<ref name=\"Dianin, Borodin, 209\"/> In summing up the work, Brown had the following comment:\n\n{{quote|The Second Symphony proved to be Borodin's great work. Whatever Borodin's technical limitations as a composer, they fail to be revealed in this symphony.

It has many melodic resemblances to both ''[[Prince Igor]]'' and ''[[Mlada]]'', two theatre works that diverted Borodin's attention on and off during the six years of composition.\n\n==Composition==\nAlthough he had a keen interest in music, Borodin's scientific research and teaching duties as an adjunct professor of Chemistry in the Medico-Surgical Academy at [[St. Petersburg]] since 1874 interrupted his composition of the Second [[Symphony]]. As a result, this symphony took several years to complete.\n\n{{quote|On visiting him I seldom found him working in the laboratory which adjoined his apartment. When he sat over his retorts filled with some colorless gas and distilled it by means of a tube from one vessel into another, I used to tell him that he was \u2018transfusing emptiness into vacancy\u2019. Having finished his work, he would go without me to his apartment, where he began musical operations or conversations, in the midst of which he used to jump up, run back to the laboratory to see whether something had not burned out or boiled over; meanwhile he filled the corridor with incredible sequences from successions of ninths or sevenths.<ref>Terrence Lee. Greenwalt. \"A Study of the Symphony in Russia from Glinka to the Early Twentieth Century.\" (Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilm, 1972), 120.</ref>|[[Rimsky-Korsakov]]}}\n\nImmediately after the successful premiere of his first symphony in E-flat conducted by [[Mily Balakirev]] at the Imperial Russian Music concert in 1869, Borodin began writing the Second Symphony in B minor.<ref>[[Gerald Abraham]], foreword to Alexander Borodin, \"Symphony No. 2 in B minor,\" 1869\u201376 (London: Ernst Eulenberg), ii.</ref> That summer, he left off work on the piece in order to work on ''[[Prince Igor]]'' (Knyaz Igor), an opera based on a 12th-century epic \"the Story of Igor's Army,\" suggested by his friend and first biographer [[Vladimir Stasov]]. Borodin suddenly decided to abandon ''Prince Igor'' in March 1870, criticizing his own inability to write a libretto that would satisfy both musical and scenic requirement.<ref>Robert W Oldani, \"Borodin, Aleksandr Porfir\u2019yevich,\" in [[Grove Music Online]], [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com] (accessed 10 March 2009).</ref> He told his wife, \"There is scarcely any drama or scenic movement\u2026 Anyhow, opera seems to me an unnatural thing\u2026 besides I am by nature a lyricist and symphonist; I am attracted by the symphonic forms.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, ii.</ref>\n\nSoon after setting ''Prince Igor'' aside, Borodin returned to the B minor Symphony, assuring Stasov that the \"materials\" created for the opera would be used in the newly revived symphony. According to Stasov in an article contributed to the \"Vestnik Evropi\" in 1883, Borodin told him more than once that in the first movement he wished to depict a gathering of Russian warrior-heroes, in the slow movement the figure of a bayan\u2014a type of Russian [[accordion]], and in the finale a scene of heroes feasting to the sound of guslis\u2014an ancient plucked instrument.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe composed most of the first movement in April 1870, and he wrote it out onto a piano score a year later, in spring 1871. In that same year he sketched the Scherzo and Andante. That summer he orchestrated the first movement, and in October he drafted the finale.<ref>Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, iv.</ref>\n\nBorodin's work on the symphony was again interrupted when the Director of the Imperial Theatres, Stephan Gedenov, asked him to collaborate on an extravagant opera-ballet ''[[Mlada]]'' with other members of [[Vladimir Stasov]]'s \"mighty little heap,\" namely [[Cesar Cui]], [[Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].<ref>Francis Maes, A History of Russian Music: From Kamarinskaya to Babi Yar, translated by [[Arnold J. Pomerans]] and Erica Pomerans (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), 7.</ref> In his usual fashion of composing, Borodin borrowed heavily from earlier works, in this case ''Prince Igor''. The show was ultimately cancelled because of production costs, and Borodin once again turned to the B minor Symphony.<ref>Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, iv.</ref>\n\nA new interest took his attention away from the composition once again in the fall of 1872 as the [[Tsar Alexander II]]'s government passed legislation allowing women to take advanced medical courses. As an advocate of the new campaign, Borodin became the founder of a School of Medicine for women, where he taught several courses. Despite these distractions, Borodin finished the piano score in May 1873.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Oldani, \"Borodin, Aleksandr Porfir\u2019yevich.\"</ref>\n\nThe following academic year (1873\u201374), more and more aggravated that he was not receiving support or recognition for his scientific work, he published his last paper on aldehydes and turned to teaching; it was at this time that he became director of the Medical-Surgical Academy's laboratory facilities. Meanwhile, he also took up ''Prince Igor'' again and worked on orchestrating the final three movements of the symphony, although this work was not ultimately completed until 1875.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn the autumn of 1876, the [[Russian Musical Society]] showed an interest in performing the symphony; however, Borodin was disconcerted to find that he had lost the full score.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Although the middle movements were eventually found, he had to reorchestrate the outer two movements while sick in bed. The work was premiered 10 March 1877<ref>26 February/10 March. Dates in scholarly texts for this and other Russian works are frequently shown with both the earlier [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]] dates, and later [[Gregorian calendar]] dates; Russia used the Eastern Orthodox calendar until the fall of tsarist Russia with the beginning of the [[communist]] regime when [[Lenin]] changed to the Gregorian calendar.</ref> under the baton of [[Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This symphony fits in the debate over the merit of [[folklore]] elements and traditional western art music values, which was a central conflict of [[Romantic nationalism]].<ref>Maes, A History of Russian Music, 8.</ref> The work was popular, but according to Rimsky-Korsakov, only enjoyed \"moderate success\" because Borodin had written the brass part too thickly.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBorodin's relationship with [[Liszt]] also had impacted his symphonic writing. Later in 1877, Borodin traveled to Germany in order to enroll some of his chemistry pupils in Jena University. While in Germany, Borodin visited Liszt in [[Weimar]] where the two played through both of Borodin's symphonies in four-hand piano arrangements. Liszt had been an admirer of Borodin's music and he arranged performances of Borodin's symphonies, making them the first Russian symphonies to be received abroad. Regarding Borodin's attempt to revise his score, Liszt said,\n\n{{quote|Heaven forbid! Do not touch it; alter nothing. Your modulations are neither extravagant nor faulty. Your artistic instinct is such that you need not fear to be original. Do not listen to those who would deter you from following your own way. You are on the right road. Similar advice was given to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who wisely ignored it. Despite the adage that \u2018there is nothing new under the sun,\u2019 your Second Symphony is entirely new. Nobody had done anything like it. And it is perfectly logical in structure.\"\u2026. From another source you are always lucid, intelligent and perfectly original [\u2026] work in your own way and pay no attention to anyone.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe symphony is scored for the following orchestra: \n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Woodwind]]s:\n:[[piccolo]]\n:2 [[flute]]s\n:2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling on [[cor anglais]])\n:2 [[clarinet]]s\n:2 [[bassoon]]s\n;[[Brass instrument|Brass]]:\n:4 [[French horn|horn]]s\n:2 [[trumpet]]s\n:3 [[trombone]]s\n:[[tuba]]\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Percussion]]:\n:3 [[timpani]]\n:[[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]]\n:[[tambourine]]\n:[[bass drum]]\n:[[cymbal]]s (in the finale only)\n\n;[[Harp]]\n\n;[[String section|Strings]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Score and edition==\nIn 1879 Borodin revised the orchestration of the symphony and thinned out the heavy brass parts. The premiere of this final version took place 4 March 1879 under the baton of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] at a Free School Concert.<ref>Abraham, foreword to Borodin's Symphony, v.</ref> Borodin became occupied with the symphony one last time in 1886, while preparing the manuscript full score for the printer. He made a few refinement changes suggested by Rimsky-Korsakov, who also provided the [[metronome]] markings based on the successful second performance.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Theme from the second symphony (Borodin's tomb).JPG|220 px|thumb|Theme of the first movement on Borodin's grave monument.]]\n\nThe B minor [[Symphony]] is arguably the most important large-scale work completed by the composer himself, and is considered to be one of his greatest.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> It has many melodic resemblances to both ''Prince Igor'' and ''[[Mlada]]'', which were two theatrical works that diverted Borodin's attention away from the B minor symphony between 1869\u201375.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> According to the account of Borodin's friend [[Nikolay Kashkin]], the symphony's striking and abrupt opening theme originated from the abandoned chorus of [[Polovtsian]]s,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] biographer Serge Dianin notes that there is a common thread present in all three pieces.<ref>Serge Dianin, Borodin, translated by Robert Lord (London: [[Oxford University Press]], 1963), 200.</ref> According to Dianin, \"it is for this reason that we find certain similarities in the themes Borodin uses in these works.\" <ref>According to Dianin, \"it is for this reason that we find certain similarities in the themes Borodin uses in these works.\"</ref> The relation to the heroic world of ''Prince Igor'' led Stasov to nickname the work the \"''Bogatirskaya simfoniya''\" (\"Heroic symphony\").<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Maes, A History of Russian Music, 70.</ref>\n\n===I. Allegro moderato===\n[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=73]]\n\nExcluding the E natural, the opening theme is made up of an [[octatonic]] subcollection which consists of the major and minor 3rd above the tonic. The alternation between major and minor thirds is found throughout the symphony, and is based on this opening theme.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The lyrical second theme in D major not only sets a contrast to the first theme, but also to present the cyclic elements evident in the whole work. This is very recognizable in the trio of the [[scherzo]] movement, and distantly echoed in the finale.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Maes states that the second theme is a protyazhnaya stylization, which he defines as \"a splendid form of melismatically decorated song set to poetry of great expressive power and lyrical intensity.\" <ref>Maes, A History of Russian Music, 3.</ref>\n\nThe second theme in the recapitulation is also in E-flat (a diminished fourth away from the opening theme), making it an [[enharmonic]] major third above B natural. This makes the interchange between the major and minor third not only melodic, but structural as well.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nMusicologist A. Peter Brown notes that the first movement is a [[sonata form]], shaped by a somewhat unusual key scheme in the recapitulation, and provides the following analysis of the first movement.<ref>A. Peter Brown and Brian Hart, The European Symphony from ca. 1800 to ca. 1930, vol. 3, part B: Great Britain, Russia, and France. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2008), 313.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| \n| ''Primary''\n| ''Secondary''\n| ''Closing''\n| \n| ''Pr.''\n| ''Sec.''\n| \n| ''Cl.''\n|-\n| ''Exposition:''\n| B minor\n| D\n| \n| ''Recapitulation:''\n| B minor\n| E-flat\n| C   \n| B minor\n|-\n| \n| 1\n| 78\n| 93\n| \n| 224\n| 263\n| \n| 283\n|}\n\nWhile Borodin treats the exposition in a typical manner, S in the [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] does not return to the tonic key or even to a closely related key. Instead, he uses two keys (E-flat and C) which are not only distant from B minor, but also unrelated to the tonic key of S in the exposition. Brown concludes with the following thoughts about the first movement:\n\n{{quote|For a supposedly dilettante [[composer]] who had little training in the academic studies of musical composition, this first movement is a significant accomplishment. Though it has virtually no [[polyphony]], Borodin has sustained this piece with attractive melodies motivically interrelated, a large-scale sense of rhythm, effective orchestration in the revised version, and idiosyncratic use of harmony and [[modulation]], particularly in the recapitulation. This masterly first movement is a considerable advance over that of his First Symphony, whose high originality made it at times less effective.<ref>Brown (2008), 316</ref>}}\n\nIn spite of the first movement's sonata-like form, according to Brown, musicologist Francis Maes states that because of a compulsive repetition of the motto \u2013 in sequences, diminutions, and augmentations \u2013 the orchestration \u2013 with intensive use of the low brass \u2013 and the peculiarity of tempo changes, \"all this turns the first movement into a montage of contrasts rather than into a developing sonata form.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Despite this apparent conflict, music critic David Fanning argues that Borodin's use of melodic material, and the heroic themes that result, are \"virtually unprecedented in the history of the symphony.\" <ref>Fanning, David. \"Building a Library; Borodin's Symphony No. 2.\" [[BBC Music Magazine]]. Vol. 5, issue 8. (London: [[BBC]] Magazines, 1997), 46.</ref>\n\n===II. Scherzo. Molto vivo===\n[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=74]]\n\nThe second movement is unconventional in many ways, as it moves to the key of F major \u2013 a very remote key; which may have been Balakirev's idea originally.<ref>Dianin, Borodin, 202.</ref> It breaks from the usual triple meter, and it groups together unusual lengths of phrases.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 318.</ref> Instead, Borodin opts for {{music|time|1|1}} time with a tempo marking of 108 \u2013 four quarter notes to a bar with a whole note receiving the beat \u2013 and alternates between four and five bar phrases, with an occasional one or two bar phrase.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 319.</ref> There is a great deal of rhythmic contrast between the two main ideas; the first is firmly on the beat, while the second is syncopated.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nAfter a four bar introduction, a majority of the [[Scherzo]] proper is a continuation of quarter note figures passed throughout the orchestra in a \"kaleidoscope of color.\"<ref>After a four bar introduction, a majority of the Scherzo proper is a continuation of quarter note figures passed throughout the orchestra in a \"kaleidoscope of color.\"</ref> Dianin notes that the second subject in this passage ends in an unusual fashion, marked by descending leaps of a fourth;<ref>Dianin, Borodin, 203.</ref> while Maes points out the recollection of [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], particularly the [[oriental]]-sounding Trio (Allegretto).<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Following the transition to the Allegretto section in {{music|time|6|4}}, we have the second main theme. Brown had the following thoughts of this portion of the second movement:\n\n{{quote|Perhaps, this Allegretto is a Russian Barcarolle with its lilting rhythms in compound-duple meter, mild [[hemiola]]s, and a melody marked [[cantabile]] e dolce. Borodin's orchestration of the background is almost [[Klangfarben]] with harp, triangle, and horns providing a pointilistic accompaniment. The form builds through repetitions of its four-measure theme with changes to its background in good kuchkist fashion.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 318.</ref>}}\n\nFollowing the Allegretto is a return of the Scherzo proper, which [[Rimsky-Korsakov]] found to be the weak link in the symphony.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 319.</ref>\n\n===III. Andante===\n[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=75]]\nAccording to Borodin's friend and chief biographer [[Vladimir Stasov]], the third movement of the symphony was intended to depict the Slavic minstrel [[Boyan (bard)|Boyan]] accompanying himself on a [[gusli]] (a type of [[zither]]), represented by the [[harp]]. While this movement is similar to the third movement of his first symphony, the structure differs being [[rondo]]-like:<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| ''Introd.''\n| ''A''\n| ''B''\n| ''A''\n| ''C(A)''\n| ''B''\n| ''A''\n| ''B''\n| ''A''\n| ''Introd.''\n|-\n| D-flat\n| \n| E minor\n| A-flat\n| A\n| D-flat\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|-\n| 1\n| 5\n| 23\n| 46\n| 80\n| 87\n| 91\n| 101\n| 113\n| 121\n|} \n \nThe Andante begins with what Oldani calls \"one of Borodin's most serene melodies,\" <ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> played by solo clarinet and accompanied by the harp, and what follows is a horn solo with the ornamental grace notes that are quite typical of Borodin's lyrical melodies.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This melody is heard from various instruments throughout the piece, while some of the material incorporates the interaction between minor and major thirds present in the Allegro (I).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe movement ends in a similar fashion to how it began, with clarinet solo followed by horn solo, accompanied by harp. Maes eloquently summarizes the mystique of the third movement by pointing out how powerfully it refers to the \"mythical, imaginary world of both ''Ruslan'' and ''Prince Igor''.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n===IV. Finale. Allegro===\n[[File:Orchesterwerke Romantik Themen.pdf|right|300px|page=76]]\nAccording to Oldani the finale is in sonata form, but more free than the first movement.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, Brown points out that there are at least three viable ways to interpret the formal structure of this movement:<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.</ref> 1) in the standard western tradition of the symphony with the movement being either in sonata or rondo form; 2) as a collection of dances that mimic sonata form; 3) as a programmatic piece that follows the events laid out by Stasov.<ref>1) in the standard western tradition of the symphony with the movement being either in sonata or rondo form; 2) as a collection of dances that mimic [[sonata]] form; 3) as a programmatic piece that follows the events laid out by Stasov.</ref> This section begins with a pentatonic theme in the violin and viola, with the development consisting of a [[whole-tone]] passage which is also used in both Mlada and the prologue of ''Prince Igor''.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n| ''Intr.''\n| ''Pr.''

These elements, combined with the addition of cymbals, triangle, tambourine, and bass drum, give the music not only a Slavic dance feel, but also makes it \"[[Music of Turkey|Turkish]]\" sounding to western ears.<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 321.</ref> Each dance has its own bold rhythmic motion which is a result of the syncopation, as well as the resilient anacrustic formations;<ref>Brown, The European Symphony, 3: 323.</ref> Dianin describes the tone of the movement as being \"bright and jubilant.\" <ref>Dianin, Borodin, 205.</ref>\n\n===Summary===\nAccording to Dianin, Stasov believed that Borodin had the knights and [[heroic]] figures of ancient Russia in mind with this piece. \"The first movement depicts an assembly of Russian knights [\u2026] the Scherzo could be intended to suggest a headlong chase, but it could equally well be a festive scene [\u2026] the third movement was to have depicted Bayan, the legendary minstrel who appears in the ''Lay of Igor's Campaign'' [\u2026] and the finale is meant to depict \u2018the knights\u2019 feast, the sound of the gusli, and a jubilant throng of people.\" <ref>Dianin, Borodin, 207\u2013208.</ref>\n\nDianin concludes by stating that the overall character of Borodin's Symphony No. 2 is patriotic, and that he is showing his sincere admiration for the strength and courage of the men of old, who \"saved Russia from her enemies.\"<ref name=\"Dianin, Borodin, 209\">Dianin, Borodin, 209.</ref> Borodin not only admired these great heroes of Russian history, but was able to capture their essence in his music.<ref name=\"Dianin, Borodin, 209\"/> In summing up the work, Brown had the following comment:\n\n{{quote|The Second Symphony proved to be Borodin's great work. Whatever Borodin's technical limitations as a composer, they fail to be revealed in this symphony.

The game was revealed at the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]], and is designed specifically for [[Kinect]].<ref>{{cite web |author=George |date=September 15, 2010 |url=http://segabits.com/blog/2010/09/15/rise-of-nightmare-segas-horror-kinect-game/ |title=Rise of Nightmares: SEGA\u2019s horror Kinect game |website=SEGAbits |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> It was the first M-rated game to be released for the Kinect.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Josh'''\n: The main [[protagonist]] of the game, on vacation in Romania with his wife, Kate. He has a drinking problem, and it is threatening his marriage. He survives the train wreck, and begins searching for his wife, who was kidnapped by Ernst at the behest of Viktor, a deranged mad scientist. He is the character the player controls for most of the game, in one form or another.\n\n* '''Kate'''\n: Josh's wife, who was on vacation with him in Romania in an attempt to patch up their failing marriage. She becomes angry upon catching him with a hip flask after he promised to stop drinking, and storms away, leading to the events of the game. She is kidnapped shortly after, before the train derails. Most of the game is spent searching for her. She has something she needs to talk to him about.\n\n* '''Viktor'''\n: A mad scientist with an interest in states of life and death, and the main [[antagonist]] of the game. He has Kate kidnapped, and is responsible for the deaths and transformations of almost everyone in the mansion, in pursuit of an ultimate goal. He has great plans in mind, for Josh and his wife both, for very personal reasons.\n\n* '''Yeli'''\n: A Romanian fortune teller, who predicts Josh's fate on the train. She inexplicably survives the train wreck, and immediately heads for the mansion, unknowingly leading the frightened survivors right to the hell she had once escaped. She was a prisoner there in the past, but was aided in her escape by an unnamed detective. Yeli is the wife of Ernst.\n\n*'''Ernst'''\n: The masked juggernaut, and Viktor's most trusted servant. He was dispatched to kidnap Kate and derail the train. He was once a prisoner in the mansion as well, but unlike his wife, he failed to escape. Instead, he became one of the most powerful of Viktor's warped experiments, and one of the most frightful. The helmet he wears severely obstructs his vision, but Ernst makes up for lack of sight with an inhumanly keen ear, which allows him to detect people in the area from just their movements. When he appears, Josh is forced to either flee or freeze, to avoid a rather gruesome death at his hands. Eventually, the player has to fight him\u2014but he isn't quite what he seems, something Josh will come to understand.\n\n* '''Mary'''\n: Viktor's wife, and supporting antagonist. Like the others in the mansion, Mary was subjected to her husband's strange curiosities, and has been transformed herself, and driven mad as a result. Seen only at a distance, she leads Josh through the mansion, and orchestrates several boss battles. However, she is not what she appears\u2014and ''her'' plans are even more personal than Viktor's are.\n\n* '''Sacha and Tasha'''\n: A pair of somewhat snobby [[Russia|Russian]] ballerinas, and (arguably) identical twins. They both survive the train wreck, only to vanish, and reappear as the undead stars of a dual boss battle, mocked up as a ballet performance. They come across as arrogant and bratty, and are prone to arguing amongst themselves when something goes wrong, as seen when the player dodges their dual attack. They are the first real boss encounter, overseen by Mary.\n\n* '''Jane'''\n: Jane is a [[British people|British]] psychiatrist. Mild-mannered and quiet, she is smart and uses it to her advantage, though she questions herself at times. She survives the train wreck, reappearing in the mansion, only to be captured and taken away by Ernst. She reappears to become an undead threat, insisting upon her state of life, even as her mutilated body and inexplicable abilities argue to the contrary. Unlike the others, her alterations are mostly mental, and she is unaware of what has happened to her, continuing to question it throughout the battle. Her quiet demeanor conceals a repressed, carnal nature.\n\n* '''Monica'''\n: A blonde, naive American girl, headed to a rave with her friends, Max, Katja and Aaron. An intoxicated Josh turns his attention to her while arguing with Kate, causing her to leave and triggering the events of the game. She survives the train wreck, only to be decapitated shortly afterward. She is the first meaningful survivor casualty, and later returns as a puppet-themed boss alongside Max. She alternates between mockery and apology throughout the battle, insisting that the two are being controlled. She and Max were involved, and she (mistakenly) believed he cared about her.\n\n* '''Max'''\n: A young German punk with a shaved head, headed to the rave with the others. Foul-mouthed and hot-tempered, Max is the first to shout and curse when things start going wrong, and plunges himself heedlessly into danger. He is captured with Josh, tortured, and murdered, only to reappear as a half-mechanized undead with Monica later in the game. Despite his personality, he shows some wit in the battle, using misdirection tricks to better get the drop on the player. Unlike Monica, he shows little remorse in being pitted against Josh. He has no real feelings for Monica, and planned to use her to smuggle contraband into the U.S.\n\n* '''Aaron'''\n: A German man with stringy brown hair, headed to the rave with the others. He is the first character the player controls, in the 'Chapter 0' tutorial before the beginning of the game. He unwillingly fights his way through the dungeon in attempts to find a way out for himself and Katja, only to walk into a crushing trap when they finally reach the apparent end. Not much is seen of his personality. Like the others, he survived the train wreck, and reappeared with Sacha and Tasha outside the mansion, before everyone is captured.\n\n* '''Katja'''\n: A dark-haired [[French people|French]] girl, headed to the rave with her friends. She survived the train wreck, only to be captured and locked in the dungeons with Aaron. She is the first other character the player comes across, and urges Aaron to find them both a way out. She suspects the trap before they trigger it, but notices the masked monster gesturing to them from outside the recently-dropped gate. She panics, failing to realize the significance of that, and runs right into it anyway, taking Aaron with her. She was well-aware of Max's true nature, but never mentioned it.\n\n* '''Fido/Marchosias'''\n: The head of a somewhat obese British man, attached to the body of a small dog. 'Fido' (as Josh calls him) was a servant of Viktor, until his master decided to take his head off his body and remove his heart, locking him in a shed. Fido promises to help the player in return for freedom and his stolen heart, which he needs to animate his real body. He has a polite, if not somewhat effeminate, manner about him. He reappears later and plays a rather surprising role.\n\n* '''Lin'''\n: A young Asian girl who ran away from home and traveled to [[Europe]] to find herself. Lin is a survivor from the crash, is seen on the train before the crash, and as the chaos begins. When Josh comes across the first [[Undead|undead creature]], Lin witnesses him kill it, and then she runs away and is never seen or heard from in the game again. Most people assume she was either killed, or she escaped right before the chaos started. It is not explained.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=May 2016}}\nThe game begins when a couple of prisoners attempting to escape from the dungeon they are imprisoned in. After breaking out of their cell, they found a door but it was locked, one of the prisoners pulled a nearby lever which unlocked the door, however it also let loose the other creatures that were locked in the dungeon. They made it hall and saw a door, however, a monstrous masked figure suddenly appears, they panicked and ran towards the door. The door was locked and it also turned out to be a trap, the wall closes in and kills them both.\n \nWhile on vacation in Romania, Josh, the main character, and his wife Kate are on a train with several other tourists. During the train ride, Kate is about to tell Josh something when she discovers he was hiding a bottle of alcohol, hinting at a drinking problem. Angry, she walks out and heads to the dining car. Josh comes across a Romanian man who tells him that his wife left a letter for him, and then Josh reads it. It says that Kate is sorry for getting angry at Josh and that she wasn't herself lately and also says for Josh to meet her at the dining cart. Feeling guilty, Josh heads to the dining car to apologize. On his way, he encounters many travelers, such as a Grandfather - Gregor, a student - Lin, two ballerinas called Sacha and Tasha; four teenagers - Monica, Max, Aaron and Katja - heading to a rave; an English psychiatrist called Jane; two Romanian generals; a Romanian ticket collector; a German businessman; and Yeli, a fortune-teller who gives Josh a grim prediction. He then proceeds further only to find the car covered in blood. Bursting into the car, he find his wife being carried out by a large man with an odd-looking mechanism on his face. One of the generals tries to stop the man but is ripped in half. Josh and Yeli follow, catching a glimpse of a strange man who is laughing maniacally. Suddenly, the train derails. Josh awakens to find the train in a river, and tries to save the ticket collector but fails. The general calls him to shore, and Josh runs to a cave where the other survivors are hiding.\n\nThe businessman walks away from the cave into the forest and is killed by something off-screen. Panicking, the survivors run deeper into the cave until they fall out the other side into a swamp. While making their way out the other general is pulled under and killed, causing the remaining survivors to panic. After escaping the swamp and walking through the forest, they come upon a cemetery where they meet up with another group of survivors, Aaron, Sacha and Tasha. The student wanders into a cellar and is heard screaming. Josh runs to help and finds her panicking, saying she saw a corpse move. Josh investigates and the corpse, along with several others reanimate and attack. The girl runs away and Josh fends them off before pursuing her. Josh exits the cellar and finds that all the survivors have run off due to the zombies. As Josh makes his way through the cemetery, he hears a scream and watches as Monica is decapitated by Ernst (the man who abducted his wife) and then thrown at a wall. Ernst then subdues Josh, who loses consciousness.\n\nJosh awakens to find that he has been tied to a chair by Viktor, the mad scientist responsible for the zombies. Max is tied up as well, but is soon killed by Viktor. He is about to kill Josh when he gets a phone call and exits urgently, leaving a zombie nurse to finish the job. Fortunately, Josh is rescued and freed by the Romanian who told Josh of Kate's letter, and they attempt to find their way out. The two make their way through a hall when the survivor inspects a fresh bloodstain, only to end up bisected by a trap. Josh fights his way through a horde of zombies and encounters Jane, but she is kidnapped by Ernst. He later comes across a ringing phone. Josh answers and hears Kate begging him to help, followed by a woman's voice telling him that he will never find her, and a projector shows footage of a webcam with a mysterious woman next to Kate, who is captive in a torture chair. He continues to find strange bedrooms; in one such room, there is a crib and a doll making sounds of crying. He then finds a sewing room, filled with dresses and mannequins, one of which resembles like a zombie. He advances to a cave to find that the two Russian ballerinas are now zombies. The strange woman from before traps him in with the zombie twins. After he defeats them, he wanders outside to a courtyard.\n\nIn the courtyard, he hears someone asking him to help him out of the shed. The man (Fido) is suspiciously calm and claims to have been Viktor's employee once, also claiming to know how to release Kate. He has Josh search for the key and when freed, Josh is surprised to find that his head has been sewn to the body of a small lapdog. Fido tells Josh that he will only help him if Josh helps return him to his human state. After being restored, he  gives Josh the key to the tall tower and tells him there's a surprise at the top. Josh then wanders to the top of the tower to find the raver couple, now resembling marionettes. He kills them, and then is transported to a cave, where he picks up a mystical weapon, Azoth, that attaches to his left hand.\n\nJosh eventually finds Kate, but she is strapped to a table with Viktor and Ernst next to her. Viktor tells Ernst to kill Josh, but Josh defeats him. Near death, Ernst becomes more human, and lets Josh and Kate escape. In a fit of rage, Viktor brutally murders Ernst. Josh and Kate run into a forest, but Kate is entranced by a sudden music that starts playing, and she wanders into a sacrificial site. Viktor is there, but in the body of a woman. He opens up a portal, but Josh destroys the towers that created it, and Viktor is burned to death. However, before he can reach Kate, Marchosias, or Fido in his human form, knocks Josh unconscious.\n\nJosh wakes up to find that he is strapped to a vertical table, with the bodies of Viktor and Ernst present too. Marchosias reveals that he was fascinated by Viktor, and will use Josh in order to reincarnate him. Out of Viktor's corpse he pulls out an eel-like creature, and inserts it into Josh's mouth, making Viktor take the body of Josh.\n\nJosh then reawakens to find himself in a prison cell, in the body of Ernst. He sees Kate walking along with Viktor, who is now in the body of Josh. Kate now believes that Viktor is Josh, and that Josh is Ernst. The two leave Josh/Ernst in his cell. Soon, Josh hears Aaron and Katja, who have escaped from their cell, an event that happens at the start of the game. They open all the cell doors, and Josh tries to follow them, but they scream and run away because they think that he is Ernst. Aaron and Katja run into a trap, and are crushed by two walls. Josh escapes, and also has the advantage of Ernst's two chain hands that can kill an enemy from a distance.\n\nJosh runs after Kate, and sees her walking off with Viktor in Josh's body. He follows, and meets Marchosias. He then reveals an altered Jane, and tells her to kill Josh. Josh overpowers her, and she goes into a mental breakdown. As she starts to burn up, she jumps onto Marchosias, and they both burn together. Josh staggers out into the forest, and collapses.\n\nHe wakes up to see Yeli dancing in front of him, saying that before Josh can kill Viktor and claim back his body, he must enter the dream realm to learn why everything happened, then she stabs him with a dagger that sends him back to the train, but in his imagination. Josh can also hear what the other passengers were thinking at the time, before all of them turn into a blood-like gas.\n\nHe encounters the man who told him of his wife's letter, and he thinks briefly about how he hates travelling through the cursed forest. Josh then sees the student, who is thinking about how her parents will hate her once they find out that she dropped out of school. When Josh sees the two ballerinas, they both are thinking that without the other, they could be stars. Then he sees the four going to the rave. Aaron first thinks about how he doesn't like 'love and peace', Monica is thinking about how she loves Europe and how lovely Max is, Max is thinking about how to use Monica to smuggle drugs into America, and Katja is lamenting about how Monica is being used as Max's puppet. Josh then meets Jane, who is thinking about her next project, and how half-dead people can be used. She then snaps out of her dream, thinking that she might need counselling. Next, Josh sees the two Romanian generals. One is thinking about how he lost his friends in war because his gun jammed, the other is thinking about marrying the woman he loves and setting up his own business. The next man he sees is the ticket collector, who is strangely thinking about the train derailing. Unable to see Yeli, Josh then sees the German businessman, who wants to embezzle his company's funds. Lastly, he sees Kate. She is thinking about the fact that she is pregnant, a fact Josh didn't know. Viktor then appears by her side, saying that she is the same as his wife Mary. Kate then turns into gas, Viktor sees Josh, and he runs away.\n\nNext, Josh is led to Viktor's memories with Mary. At first, Mary and Viktor were happy because they could have a baby. Then, Josh learns that Viktor tried to make the baby genetically perfect but accidentally killed it, and Mary shouted at him. He strangled Mary to death mindlessly, and then he vowed to learn how to resurrect the dead to bring Mary back. He then sees Viktor dressed in Mary's clothes, and then Josh goes into Viktor's dream world to defeat him. Viktor scolds Josh, saying that his baby is gone, before Viktor suddenly turns into a complete robotic being. Josh finds Yeli's dagger, and stabs Viktor in the heart.\n\nJosh wakes up to see that in real life, he has stabbed Yeli. Not only that, but he is in his own body, and not Ernst's. Josh coughs up Viktor's eel, and it dies. Yeli then tells Josh that Kate is at the ritual site, and she charges his Azoth. She then dies next to the body of Ernst. Josh proceeds to find Kate, and he is teleported to a staircase where he can hear Viktor and Mary. They are arguing, with Mary saying that Viktor killed their baby. Josh then arrives in Mary's dream world, a mystical land of floating islands. Josh finds Mary tending to his unborn baby. Mary demands that he leaves but Josh refuses and she battles him. She is actually a massive demon that flies, with another head in her heart-like body. Josh eventually kills her with the Azoth. Josh then takes back his baby, and the dream stops.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Josh and a pregnant Kate are leaving Romania on a train. As Josh leaves, he bumps into a man, his face and body badly burned and bandaged. The man sits down near Kate, and opens his suitcase to reveal three small phials with the parasites in them. The man then laughs, and the game ends.\n\n==Development==\nA teaser trailer was shown at the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]] upon the game's announcement.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sharky |date=September 19,

developed and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game was revealed at the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]], and is designed specifically for [[Kinect]].<ref>{{cite web |author=George |date=September 15, 2010 |url=http://segabits.com/blog/2010/09/15/rise-of-nightmare-segas-horror-kinect-game/ |title=Rise of Nightmares: SEGA\u2019s horror Kinect game |website=SEGAbits |accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> It was the first M-rated game to be released for the Kinect.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Josh'''\n: The main [[protagonist]] of the game, on vacation in Romania with his wife, Kate. He has a drinking problem, and it is threatening his marriage. He survives the train wreck, and begins searching for his wife, who was kidnapped by Ernst at the behest of Viktor, a deranged mad scientist. He is the character the player controls for most of the game, in one form or another.\n\n* '''Kate'''\n: Josh's wife, who was on vacation with him in Romania in an attempt to patch up their failing marriage. She becomes angry upon catching him with a hip flask after he promised to stop drinking, and storms away, leading to the events of the game. She is kidnapped shortly after, before the train derails. Most of the game is spent searching for her. She has something she needs to talk to him about.\n\n* '''Viktor'''\n: A mad scientist with an interest in states of life and death, and the main [[antagonist]] of the game. He has Kate kidnapped, and is responsible for the deaths and transformations of almost everyone in the mansion, in pursuit of an ultimate goal. He has great plans in mind, for Josh and his wife both, for very personal reasons.\n\n* '''Yeli'''\n: A Romanian fortune teller, who predicts Josh's fate on the train. She inexplicably survives the train wreck, and immediately heads for the mansion, unknowingly leading the frightened survivors right to the hell she had once escaped. She was a prisoner there in the past, but was aided in her escape by an unnamed detective. Yeli is the wife of Ernst.\n\n*'''Ernst'''\n: The masked juggernaut, and Viktor's most trusted servant. He was dispatched to kidnap Kate and derail the train. He was once a prisoner in the mansion as well, but unlike his wife, he failed to escape. Instead, he became one of the most powerful of Viktor's warped experiments, and one of the most frightful. The helmet he wears severely obstructs his vision, but Ernst makes up for lack of sight with an inhumanly keen ear, which allows him to detect people in the area from just their movements. When he appears, Josh is forced to either flee or freeze, to avoid a rather gruesome death at his hands. Eventually, the player has to fight him\u2014but he isn't quite what he seems, something Josh will come to understand.\n\n* '''Mary'''\n: Viktor's wife, and supporting antagonist. Like the others in the mansion, Mary was subjected to her husband's strange curiosities, and has been transformed herself, and driven mad as a result. Seen only at a distance, she leads Josh through the mansion, and orchestrates several boss battles. However, she is not what she appears\u2014and ''her'' plans are even more personal than Viktor's are.\n\n* '''Sacha and Tasha'''\n: A pair of somewhat snobby [[Russia|Russian]] ballerinas, and (arguably) identical twins. They both survive the train wreck, only to vanish, and reappear as the undead stars of a dual boss battle, mocked up as a ballet performance. They come across as arrogant and bratty, and are prone to arguing amongst themselves when something goes wrong, as seen when the player dodges their dual attack. They are the first real boss encounter, overseen by Mary.\n\n* '''Jane'''\n: Jane is a [[British people|British]] psychiatrist. Mild-mannered and quiet, she is smart and uses it to her advantage, though she questions herself at times. She survives the train wreck, reappearing in the mansion, only to be captured and taken away by Ernst. She reappears to become an undead threat, insisting upon her state of life, even as her mutilated body and inexplicable abilities argue to the contrary. Unlike the others, her alterations are mostly mental, and she is unaware of what has happened to her, continuing to question it throughout the battle. Her quiet demeanor conceals a repressed, carnal nature.\n\n* '''Monica'''\n: A blonde, naive American girl, headed to a rave with her friends, Max, Katja and Aaron. An intoxicated Josh turns his attention to her while arguing with Kate, causing her to leave and triggering the events of the game. She survives the train wreck, only to be decapitated shortly afterward. She is the first meaningful survivor casualty, and later returns as a puppet-themed boss alongside Max. She alternates between mockery and apology throughout the battle, insisting that the two are being controlled. She and Max were involved, and she (mistakenly) believed he cared about her.\n\n* '''Max'''\n: A young German punk with a shaved head, headed to the rave with the others. Foul-mouthed and hot-tempered, Max is the first to shout and curse when things start going wrong, and plunges himself heedlessly into danger. He is captured with Josh, tortured, and murdered, only to reappear as a half-mechanized undead with Monica later in the game. Despite his personality, he shows some wit in the battle, using misdirection tricks to better get the drop on the player. Unlike Monica, he shows little remorse in being pitted against Josh. He has no real feelings for Monica, and planned to use her to smuggle contraband into the U.S.\n\n* '''Aaron'''\n: A German man with stringy brown hair, headed to the rave with the others. He is the first character the player controls, in the 'Chapter 0' tutorial before the beginning of the game. He unwillingly fights his way through the dungeon in attempts to find a way out for himself and Katja, only to walk into a crushing trap when they finally reach the apparent end. Not much is seen of his personality. Like the others, he survived the train wreck, and reappeared with Sacha and Tasha outside the mansion, before everyone is captured.\n\n* '''Katja'''\n: A dark-haired [[French people|French]] girl, headed to the rave with her friends. She survived the train wreck, only to be captured and locked in the dungeons with Aaron. She is the first other character the player comes across, and urges Aaron to find them both a way out. She suspects the trap before they trigger it, but notices the masked monster gesturing to them from outside the recently-dropped gate. She panics, failing to realize the significance of that, and runs right into it anyway, taking Aaron with her. She was well-aware of Max's true nature, but never mentioned it.\n\n* '''Fido/Marchosias'''\n: The head of a somewhat obese British man, attached to the body of a small dog. 'Fido' (as Josh calls him) was a servant of Viktor, until his master decided to take his head off his body and remove his heart, locking him in a shed. Fido promises to help the player in return for freedom and his stolen heart, which he needs to animate his real body. He has a polite, if not somewhat effeminate, manner about him. He reappears later and plays a rather surprising role.\n\n* '''Lin'''\n: A young Asian girl who ran away from home and traveled to [[Europe]] to find herself. Lin is a survivor from the crash, is seen on the train before the crash, and as the chaos begins. When Josh comes across the first [[Undead|undead creature]], Lin witnesses him kill it, and then she runs away and is never seen or heard from in the game again. Most people assume she was either killed, or she escaped right before the chaos started. It is not explained.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=May 2016}}\nThe game begins when a couple of prisoners attempting to escape from the dungeon they are imprisoned in. After breaking out of their cell, they found a door but it was locked, one of the prisoners pulled a nearby lever which unlocked the door, however it also let loose the other creatures that were locked in the dungeon. They made it hall and saw a door, however a monstrous masked figure suddenly appears, they panicked and ran towards the door. The door was locked and it also turned out to be a trap, the wall closes in and kills them both.\n \nWhile on vacation in Romania, Josh, the main character, and his wife Kate are on a train with several other tourists. During the train ride, Kate is about to tell Josh something when she discovers he was hiding a bottle of alcohol, hinting at a drinking problem. Angry, she walks out and heads to the dining car. Josh comes across a Romanian man who tells him that his wife left a letter for him, and then Josh reads it. It says that Kate is sorry for getting angry at Josh and that she wasn't herself lately and also says for Josh to meet her at the dining cart. Feeling guilty, Josh heads to the dining car to apologize. On his way, he encounters many travelers, such as a Grandfather - Gregor, a student - Lin, two ballerinas called Sacha and Tasha; four teenagers - Monica, Max, Aaron and Katja - heading to a rave; an English psychiatrist called Jane; two Romanian generals; a Romanian ticket collector; a German businessman; and Yeli, a fortune-teller who gives Josh a grim prediction. He then proceeds further only to find the car covered in blood. Bursting into the car, he find his wife being carried out by a large man with an odd-looking mechanism on his face. One of the generals tries to stop the man, but is ripped in half. Josh and Yeli follow, catching a glimpse of a strange man who is laughing manically. Suddenly, the train derails. Josh awakens to find the train in a river, and tries to save the ticket collector but fails. The general calls him to shore, and Josh runs to a cave where the other survivors are hiding.\n\nThe businessman walks away from the cave into the forest and is killed by something off screen. Panicking, the survivors run deeper in the cave until they fall out the other side into a swamp. While making their way out the other general is pulled under and killed, causing the remaining survivors to panic. After escaping the swamp and walking through the forest, they come upon a cemetery where they meet up with another group of survivors, Aaron, Sacha and Tasha. The student wanders into a cellar and is heard screaming. Josh runs to help and finds her panicking, saying she saw a corpse move. Josh investigates and the corpse, along with several others reanimate and attack. The girl runs away and Josh fends them off before pursuing her. Josh exits the cellar and finds that all the survivors have run off due to the zombies. As Josh makes his way through the cemetery, he hears a scream and watches as Monica is decapitated by Ernst (the man who abducted his wife) and then thrown at a wall. Ernst then subdues Josh, who loses consciousness.\n\nJosh awakens to find that he has been tied to a chair by Viktor, the mad scientist responsible for the zombies. Max is tied up as well, but is soon killed by Viktor. He is about to kill Josh when he gets a phone call and exits urgently, leaving a zombie nurse to finish the job. Fortunately, Josh is rescued and freed by the Romanian who told Josh of Kate's letter, and they attempt to find their way out. The two make their way though a hall when the survivor inspects a fresh bloodstain, only to end up bisected by a trap. Josh fights his way through a horde of zombies and encounters Jane, but she is kidnapped by Ernst. He later comes across a ringing phone. Josh answers and hears Kate begging him to help, followed by a woman's voice telling him that he will never find her, and a projector shows footage of a webcam with a mysterious woman next to Kate, who is captive in a torture chair. He continues to find strange bedrooms; in one such room, there is a crib and a doll making sounds of crying. He then finds a sewing room, filled with dresses and mannequins, one of which resembles like a zombie. He advances to a cave to find that the two Russian ballerinas are now zombies. The strange woman from before traps him in with the zombie twins. After he defeats them, he wanders outside to a courtyard.\n\nIn the courtyard, he hears someone asking him to help him out of the shed. The man (Fido) is suspiciously calm and claims to have been Viktor's employee once, also claiming to know how to release Kate. He has Josh search for the key and when freed, Josh is surprised to find that his head has been sewn to the body of a small lapdog. Fido tells Josh that he will only help him if Josh helps return him to his human state. After being restored, he  gives Josh the key to the tall tower and tells him there's a surprise at the top. Josh then wanders to the top of the tower to find the raver couple, now resembling marionettes. He kills them, and then is transported to a cave, where he picks up a mystical weapon, Azoth, that attaches to his left hand.\n\nJosh eventually finds Kate, but she is strapped to a table with Viktor and Ernst next to her. Viktor tells Ernst to kill Josh, but Josh defeats him. Near death, Ernst becomes more human, and lets Josh and Kate escape. In a fit of rage, Viktor brutally murders Ernst. Josh and Kate run into a forest, but Kate is entranced by a sudden music that starts playing, and she wanders into a sacrificial site. Viktor is there, but in the body of a woman. He opens up a portal, but Josh destroys the towers that created it, and Viktor is burned to death. However, before he can reach Kate, Marchosias, or Fido in his human form, knocks Josh unconscious.\n\nJosh wakes up to find that he is strapped to a vertical table, with the bodies of Viktor and Ernst present too. Marchosias reveals that he was fascinated by Viktor, and will use Josh in order to reincarnate him. Out of Viktor's corpse he pulls out an eel- like creature, and inserts it into Josh's mouth, making Viktor take the body of Josh.\n\nJosh then reawakens to find himself in a prison cell, in the body of Ernst. He sees Kate walking along with Viktor, who is now in the body of Josh. Kate now believes that Viktor is Josh, and that Josh is Ernst. The two leave Josh/Ernst in his cell. Soon, Josh hears Aaron and Katja, who have escaped from their cell, an event that happens at the start of the game. They open all the cell doors, and Josh tries to follow them, but they scream and run away because they think that he is Ernst. Aaron and Katja run into a trap, and are crushed by two walls. Josh escapes, and also has the advantage of Ernst's two chain hands that can kill an enemy from a distance.\n\nJosh runs after Kate, and sees her walking off with Viktor in Josh's body. He follows, and meets Marchosias. He then reveals an altered Jane, and tells her to kill Josh. Josh overpowers her, and she goes into a mental breakdown. As she starts to burn up, she jumps onto Marchosias, and they both burn together. Josh staggers out into the forest, and collapses.\n\nHe wakes up to see Yeli dancing in front of him, saying that before Josh can kill Viktor and claim back his body, he must enter the dream realm to learn why everything happened, then she stabs him with a dagger that sends him back to the train, but in his imagination. Josh can also hear what the other passengers were thinking at the time, before all of them turn into a blood-like gas.\n\nHe encounters the man who told him of his wife's letter, and he thinks briefly about how he hates travelling through the cursed forest. Josh then sees the student, who is thinking about how her parents will hate her once they find out that she dropped out of school. When Josh sees the two ballerinas, they both are thinking that without the other, they could be stars. Then he sees the four going to the rave. Aaron first thinks about how he doesn't like 'love and peace', Monica is thinking about how she loves Europe and how lovely Max is, Max is thinking about how to use Monica to smuggle drugs into America, and Katja is lamenting about how Monica is being used as Max's puppet. Josh then meets Jane, who is thinking about her next project, and how half- dead people can be used. She then snaps out of her dream, thinking that she might need counselling. Next, Josh sees the two Romanian generals. One is thinking about how he lost his friends in war because his gun jammed, the other is thinking about marrying the woman he loves and setting up his own business. The next man he sees is the ticket collector, who is strangely thinking about the train derailing. Unable to see Yeli, Josh then sees the German businessman, who wants to embezzle his company's funds. Lastly, he sees Kate. She is thinking about the fact that she is pregnant, a fact Josh didn't know. Viktor then appears by her side, saying that she is the same as his wife Mary. Kate then turns into gas, Viktor sees Josh, and he runs away.\n\nNext, Josh is led to Viktor's memories with Mary. At first, Mary and Viktor were happy because they could have a baby. Then, Josh learns that Viktor tried to make the baby genetically perfect but accidentally killed it, and Mary shouted at him. He strangled Mary to death mindlessly, and then he vowed to learn how to resurrect the dead to bring Mary back. He then sees Viktor dressed in Mary's  clothes, and then Josh goes into Viktor's dream world to defeat him. Viktor scolds Josh, saying that his baby is gone, before Viktor suddenly turns into a complete robotic being. Josh finds Yeli's dagger, and stabs Viktor in the heart.\n\nJosh wakes up to see that in real life, he has stabbed Yeli. Not only that, but he is in his own body, and not Ernst's. Josh coughs up Viktor's eel, and it dies. Yeli then tells Josh that Kate is at the ritual site, and she charges his Azoth. She then dies next to the body of Ernst. Josh proceeds to find Kate, and he is teleported to a staircase where he can hear Viktor and Mary. They are arguing, with Mary saying that Viktor killed their baby. Josh then arrives in Mary's dream world, a mystical land of floating islands. Josh finds Mary tending to his unborn baby. Mary demands that he leaves but Josh refuses and she battles him. She is actually a massive demon that flies, with another head in her heart-like body. Josh eventually kills her with the Azoth. Josh then takes back his baby, and the dream stops.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Josh and a pregnant Kate are leaving Romania on a train. As Josh leaves, he bumps into a man, his face and body badly burned and bandaged. The man sits down near Kate, and opens his suitcase to reveal three small phials with the parasites in them. The man then laughs, and the game ends.\n\n==Development==\nA teaser trailer was shown at the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]] upon the game's announcement.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sharky |date=September 19,

Pope Pius procrastinated personnel decisions, but also  found it increasingly difficult to chastise  subordinates and appointees.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Domenico Tardini]] provides an insight: Pope Pius received a [[monsignor]] whose work performance left much to be desired. Upon leaving the Papal rooms, Tardini asked the monsignor how it went. ''The Holy Father is so happy with my work,'' Tardini interrupted him, but the Holy Father told me, ''\u2026yes was the answer, he told me that too,   but he is happy with me overall.'' <ref>Tardini 145</ref> He attempted to avoid unnecessary contacts with the clergy, because of their constant demands for recognition and positions.\n\n* Today I will receive a group of priests. Who knows, how many requests they will have\u201d. I told him, Your Holiness, just say no. \u201cOkay\u201d, said the Pope,\u201d I say no, but then they press and press and press.\u201d   A sign of resignation followed.<ref>Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960,  p 155</ref>\n\nDuring the last years of the pontificate, vacant Vatican positions were not always filled, .\u201dThe Roman Curia experienced  certain stagnation\u201d  <ref name=\"Tardini, 73\">Tardini,  73</ref>  In his last years, it was difficult for Pius to make decisions regarding the promotion of Curia priests.<ref>Schneider 96</ref>  [[Domenico Tardini]] gave a significant insight: A huge concern were appointments for Pius XII.\n\n* The higher the honour was to be, the more difficult and more desired were the positions.  It is well known, that for such occasions there is no shortage of candidates, even applicants, including those who claim to have capacities, which they are not always in possession of. They measure their value by the extent of their aspirations, calling on \u201crights\u201d, which simply do not exist.  It may even happen, that such non-virtuous aspirations find cover and support in  lavish red silk coats of some Cardinals. Pius suffered under all this, being subjected to contrary proposals and recommendations. His inclination to fulfil wished and agree spontaneously and his conscientiousness contradicted within him. Thus, the Pope did not like to make personnel changes and preferred to procrastinate.<ref name=\"Tardini, 73\"/>\n\nThe seeming inability to talk to appointees about their performance,  extended also to his one-time physician,  [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]].  He was finally dismissed by the Pope in 1956,  but  gained admittance October 1958, as the Pope lay dying and took photographs of Pius which he sold to ''Paris Match'', forcing him to resign as chief physician of the Vatican (\"pontifical archiater\") in the wake of massive public protests. When Pius died, Galeazzi-Lisi assumed the role of Pius' [[embalm]]er using controversial methods.<ref>Paul Hoffmann. (2002). ''The Vatican's Women''. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-27490-4}}. p. 44.</ref>\n\nThe pastoral needs of the Church were not affected by his procrastination on Vatican positions. New [[bishops]] were appointed  whenever necessary. The Pacelli-Pope favoured  naming [[unconventional]], often very young priests, such as [[Julius D\u00f6pfner]] (35 years) and [[Karol Wojtyla]] (38 years),  one of his last appointees in 1958.\n\n===Stories and rumours===\n\n[[Robert Leiber]], reports, that during the life of Pope Pius XII, fabrications were published about his personal life such as his allegedly  austere life, sleeping on a bare  iron bed and being attended to by four German Capuchin monks at six  a.m. every morning with a single cup of black coffee.<ref>Leiber,  49  Madre [[Pascalina Lehnert]] took care of the Papal household from 1939-1958 together with several Swiss nuns from Obermenzingen</ref> Horror stories continued after the death of [[Pius XII]], many originating in  Cornwell\u2019s ''Hitler\u2019s Pope'' published in 1999, such as  the allegation that the papal nose was falling off,  and collapsing Vatican guards.<ref>see ''Hitler's Pope'', p. 358.

Steven Palmer. YB News. June 2005.When Pius died, Galeazzi-Lisi assumed the role of Pius' [[embalm]]er. Rather than slow the process of decay, the doctor-mortician's self-made technique (''aromatizzazione''), which involved encasing Pius in a [[cellophane]] bag with [[herbs]] and [[spices]], sped it up, causing the Holy Father's corpse to disintegrate rapidly, turning purple. At one point, the body's nose fell off. It is reported that while transporting the pope's body from Castel Gandolfo to the Vatican, pressure within the coffin due to gases given off by decay blew off the seals.  This caused considerable embarrassment to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and one of the first acts of Pius' successor, [[Pope John XXIII]], was to ban and excommunicate the embalmer from Vatican City for life.([https://www.theguardian.com/pope/story/0,,1459496,00.html Guide to Age]). Alexander Chancellor. ''The Guardian''. April 16, 2005. The Italian Medical Council expelled Galeazzi-Lisi for \"infamous conduct\", but the High Court of the Italian Central Health Commission reversed the decision.([http://jloughnan.tripod.com/doctor.htm The Pope's Doctor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615130108/http://jloughnan.tripod.com/doctor.htm |date=2006-06-15 }}. Alan McElwain. ''Annals Australia''. July 1989).</ref>\n\n===Working Priests===\n\nSome controversy caused the Vatican  position on [[France|French]] [[Worker-Priest]]s. In 1941, Worker-Priest  Dominican Father [[Jacques Loew]] began a new priestly mission by working as a priest  in the docks at [[Marseilles]], France.<ref>Felix Corley Fr. Jacques Loew: Spawned the Worker-Priest Movement, [[The Times]], February 27, 1999</ref>   Many followed him. Originally, a dedicated idealistic group, they soon split, some of them joined political parties and unions, others left the priesthood altogether. Conflicts with the [[Holy See|Vatican]]  developed, after some worker-priests  advocated a close association between [[Marxism]] and [[Catholicism]], as American sympathizer [[Dorothy Day]] freely admitted.<ref>Dorothy Day, French Worker Priests and the Little Brothers of de Foucauld\" The Catholic Worker,   March 1954, 2,4</ref> Some like Jacques Loew, were able to  combine personal piety, spirituality with a full engagement in [[factory]] work. The French bishops were divided.<ref>Schneider, p. 78</ref>  The Vatican was divided too,  with Monsignor [[Giovanni Battista Montini]], later Pope Paul VI, allegedly in favour. Against considerable opposition of French bishops,  Pope Pius decided to stop the experiment. Priests were to work  in rectories not in factories. Allowed to work for three hours factory work, they were prohibited  to join unions, and had  to live in rectories or religious communities. [[Pope John XXIII]] continued and even sharpened the decision of his predecessor in 1959 by withdrawing the three-hour work permit completely.<ref name=\"Time Magazine, November 6, 1965\">Time Magazine, November 6, 1965</ref>\n\nTo Pius, a clear separation of priestly duties and the role of lay people was essential. This   position mirrored his earlier insistence, that Catholic priests should not be in politics. Loew bowed to the Vatican and in 1971, Pope Paul VI invited him to preach the Lenten retreat in the Vatican.   Earlier in 1965, he attempted to  resurrect the French  working priest experiment<ref name=\"Time Magazine, November 6, 1965\"/> but without much success.\n\n===Theologians===\n\nTheologians began to create problems from both ends of the philosophical spectre. On the ultra-conservative end was American Jesuit [[Leonard Feeney]], who taught that Protestants and other non-Catholics are on their way to hell, because ''extra ecclesiam nulla salus'': there is no salvation outside of the Church. This old teaching with numerous caveats always recognized that baptism is common to all Christians. Feeney overlooked that aspect and was not only silenced, he was excommunicated under Pope Pius XII for his interpretation of Catholic doctrine.\n\nIn  Europe,  Catholic theology  tried to go different roads, which did not all lead to Rome.  History was rediscovered, including the history of dogma, opening the door to theological relativism. The Cardinal of Paris,  Suhard asked, if the historically conditioned theological language of Thomas Aquinas is really the only permitted form of expressing one  truth.<ref>HK137</ref>\n[[Pope Pius XII]] first in 1950, in ''[[Humani generis]]'' warned against adopting  of philosophies, which today are modern, tomorrow hopelessly old-fashioned. Defending traditional [[Thomism]], Pope Pius asked for its reform and further improvement rather than rejection, which would lead to positivism and relativism in theology. In the following years,  the Sacred Congregation began to review critical theologians, issuing condemnations or threats of condemnations, which generated within the Church a sense of narrowness and   distrust.<ref>Schneider,  84</ref>  Mainly French and German theologians were affected. Theologians like [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Yves Congar]] and [[Karl Rahner]] were reprimanded or temporarily silenced.  Pius was not personally involved in this development,  and may have tried to change course: In his last speech to honour [[Pope Benedict XIV]], to be delivered to the Roman Curia in October 1958, he was to announce a revision of the review processes of the Church, increasing the rights of individuals and protecting them from secret investigations.<ref>Schneider, 84-85</ref> Several years later, this reform was  carried out by his successors.\n\n==Pope Pius XII and lay people==\n\n===Encouragement of lay people===\n\nIn his last years, Pope Pius devoted most of his energies to meetings with lay people and addressed their problems in an unprecedented range of topics to large and small organizations, in which he confronted the big questions of the time in light of their specific concerns or orientation. This was based on his theology of the Mystical Body of Christ,<ref>explained in the encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]''</ref>\n\n''Lay people not only belong to the Church, they are the Church''.<ref>AAS 1946, 141</ref>  ''Therefore they must  turn the world from a wilderness  to a humanistic  and from a humanistic  to a divine world, reflecting the Heart of God'' <ref name=\"Tardini 72\">Tardini 72</ref>\n\n*  The root of today\u2019s problem are not bad intentions but laxness of spirit,  limpness of  will and coldness of heart: the tiredness of all the good people.<ref name=\"Tardini 72\"/>    Following the encyclical,<ref>''Mystici corporis''</ref> the call to all Christians is theologically based on their guidance through the Holy Spirit and their participation in the redemptive works of Jesus Christ.  The Church can only be effective in a modern society, if lay people from their position  actively participate  at all levels, parish, community, society and international relations <ref>World Congress of Lay Apostolate, AAS 1951, 784;</ref><ref>Letter to Monsignor Cardijn JOC, AAS 1949, 324;</ref><ref>World Congress of Lay Apostolate AAS 1957,  933, Lay Apostolate in Uganda, AAS 1954, 35</ref>\n\nPope Pius XII  spoke to members of scientific  congresses, explaining Christian teachings in light of most recent scientific results. Sometimes he answered specific moral  questions, which were  addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings. During the last few weeks of his pontificate, Pius XII gave the following addresses:\n\n* ''The message of Lourdes to blue collar  workers '' International pilgrimage of Catholic blue collar workers to Lourdes,  July 21, 1958\n* ''The Contemplative Life'',   Radio  audience for members of contemplative convents throughout the World, July 26, 1958\n* ''Problems and Ideals in the health sector'',  International Catholic Health Conference, Brussels, Belgium,  July 27, 1958\n* ''The meaning of biblical studies'',  International biblical congress, Brussels,  Belgium,  July 28, 1958\n* ''The Contemplative Life,  Part Three'',  Radio  audience for members of contemplative convents throughout the World,  August 2, 1958\n* ''Classical antiquity as an educational force for Christianity'',  International Congress for Classical Archaeology,  August 7, 1958\n* ''Christian academicians forming a Christian world?''

In the following years,  the Sacred Congregation began to review critical theologians, issuing condemnations or threats of condemnations, which generated within the Church a sense of narrowness and   distrust.<ref>Schneider,  84</ref>  Mainly French and German theologians were affected. Theologians like [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Yves Congar]] and [[Karl Rahner]] were reprimanded or temporarily silenced.  Pius was not personally involved in this development,  and may have tried to change course: In his last speech to honour [[Pope Benedict XIV]], to be delivered to the Roman Curia in October 1958, he was to announce a revision of the review processes of the Church, increasing the rights of individuals and protecting them from secret investigations.<ref>Schneider, 84-85</ref> Several years later, this reform was  carried out by his successors.\n\n==Pope Pius XII and lay people==\n\n===Encouragement of lay people===\n\nIn his last years, Pope Pius devoted most of his energies to meetings with lay people and addressed their problems in an unprecedented range of topics to large and small organizations, in which he confronted the big questions of the time in light of their specific concerns or orientation. This was based on his theology of the Mystical Body of Christ,<ref>explained in the encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]''</ref>\n\n''Lay people not only belong to the Church, they are the Church''.<ref>AAS 1946, 141</ref>  ''Therefore they must  turn the world from a wilderness  to a humanistic  and from a humanistic  to a divine world, reflecting the Heart of God'' <ref name=\"Tardini 72\">Tardini 72</ref>\n\n*  The root of today\u2019s problem are not bad intentions but laxness of spirit,  limpness of  will and coldness of heart: the tiredness of all the good people.<ref name=\"Tardini 72\"/>    Following the encyclical,<ref>''Mystici corporis''</ref> the call to all Christians is theologically based on their guidance through the Holy Spirit and their participation in the redemptive works of Jesus Christ.

It is most widely practiced today in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] and in the pre-modern era was a major Buddhist current in [[Southeast Asia]]. \n\nIn the west, the study of Southern Esoteric Buddhism was pioneered by professor [[Fran\u00e7ois Bizot]] and his colleagues at the [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] with a particular focus on the material found at [[Angkor]].<ref name=Crosby>Crosby, Kate (2000).

[[Ari Buddhism]] was a form of Buddhism practiced in the [[Mon kingdoms]] of [[Burma]] which also contained Tantric elements borrowed from India and local [[Nat (spirit)|Nat]] (spirit) and [[N\u0101ga]] worship. In many of Bizot's works there is some suggestion that the Buddhism of the Mon may have influenced the later Yog\u0101vacara tradition. It is also possible that Southeast Asian Buddhism was influenced by the practice of [[Hinduism]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] which flourished in Southeast Asia during the time of the [[Khmer Empire]].<ref name=Crosby /> According to Cousins, it is also possible that Southern Esoteric Buddhism developed within the \"orthodox\" Mahavihara tradition of [[Sri Lanka]], citing the 5th century Buddhist scholar [[Buddhaghosa]]'s mention of secret texts (''gulhagantham'') as well as other textual evidence from the Pali commentaries. Cousins concludes that \"It is quite possible that present-day Southern Esoteric Buddhism contains ideas and practices deriving from more than one of these sources. Nevertheless it is certainly premature to assume that it has its origins in unorthodox circles.\"<ref name=Cousins />\n\n===Flowering===\nThe Yog\u0101vacara tradition was a mainstream Buddhist tradition in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand well into the modern era. An inscription from Northern Thailand with esoteric elements has been dated to the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] of the 16th century. Kate Crosby notes that this attestation makes the esoteric tradition earlier than \u201cany other living meditation tradition in the contemporary Theravada world.\u201d<ref name=\"Kate Crosby 2013\">Kate Crosby, Traditional Theravada Meditation and its Modern-Era Suppression Hong Kong: Buddha Dharma Centre of Hong Kong, 2013, {{ISBN|978-9881682024}}</ref>\n\n===Yog\u0101vacara (18th century)===\nDuring the reign of [[Rama I]], the Thai Yog\u0101vacara master Kai Thuean (1733-1823) was invited to Bangkok to be head of the meditation tradition there and was later made [[Sangharaja]] (head of the religious community) by [[Rama II of Siam]] in 1820.<ref name=Crosby /> In Sri Lanka, a revival of Buddhist meditation in the 1750s saw a proliferation of Yog\u0101vacara teachings and texts by Thai monks from the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], one of which is the ''[[Yog\u0101vacara's manual]]''.<ref>Kate Crosby, Andrew Skilton, Amal Gunasena (2012), The Sutta on Understanding Death in the Transmission of Boran Meditation From Siam to the Kandyan Court, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 40 (2), 177-198.</ref> Monks of the [[Siam Nikaya]] practiced these teachings and established several monasteries around [[Kandy]]. As late as the 1970s, Yog\u0101vacara practices such as the rapid repetition of ''Araham'' were recorded in [[Sri Lanka]].<ref name=Crosby />\n\n===Decline (19th century)===\nThe decline of the esoteric currents began with the rise of the reformed Buddhism in the 19th century, particularly the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] established by King [[Rama IV]] (1851\u20131868) of the Thai [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in 1833, which was imported into [[Cambodia]] as it was a protectorate of the kingdom.<ref name=Crosby /> In establishing the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]], [[Rama IV]] emphasized the use of the [[Pali Canon]] as the main authority for monastic practices and also attempted to remove all superstitious and folk religious elements.<ref>[http://www.dhammathai.org/e/thailand/ratanakosin.php Ratanakosin Period], Buddhism in Thailand, Dhammathai - Buddhist Information Network</ref> The textual tradition followed by this reform movement was that of the [[Sri Lanka]]n [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahavihara]] school (which itself dates from a set of [[Parakramabahu I#Religious reform|12th century reforms]]) which took the works of the 5th century scholar [[Buddhagosa]] as representing the orthodox interpretation and thus saw other Buddhist practices as unorthodox.<ref name=Crosby /> The reforms tightened monastic discipline and led to a decline in the practices and production of texts which were not in line with [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] orthodoxy. When Cambodia came under the rule of the [[French colonial empire]], the French continued this policy of suppressing pre-reform Cambodian Buddhism. In spite of this, traditional esoteric practices survived in rural areas.  \n\n===Legacy (20th-21st century)===\n[[File:Wat-bang-phra.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Yantra tattooing]] by monks of [[Wat Bang Phra]]]]\nThe devastation of Cambodian religion by the [[Khmer Rouge]] and religious repression in [[History of Laos since 1945|Communist Laos]] also had a heavy toll on these traditions.<ref name=\"Kate Crosby 2013\"/> Southern Esoteric Buddhist influences may be present in the practices and views of the modern Thai [[Dhammakaya movement]]<ref>Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, 327.</ref><ref>Mettanando Bhikkhu (1999), Meditation and Healing in the Theravada Buddhist Order of Thailand and Laos, Ph.D. thesis, University of Hamburg.</ref><ref>Mackenzie, Rory (2007), New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke, Abingdon: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-96646-5}}</ref> as well as in certain South Asian religious practices such as the use of [[Yantra tattooing|protective tattoos]] and amulets, the singing of protective [[Gathas]] (e.g. ''Jinapa\u00f1jara [[G\u0101th\u0101]]''), Thai [[astrology]] and the invocation of spirits and ghosts (such as [[Somdej Toh]] and [[Mae Nak Phra Khanong|Mae Nak]]).<ref>McDaniel, Justin Thomas. The Lovelorn Ghost and the Magical Monk: Practicing Buddhism in Modern Thailand.</ref> Today, magicians and forest monks using these techniques are most prevalent in the banks of the [[Mekong]] in Cambodia and Laos; they are believed to have magical powers, the [[Abhij\u00f1\u0101|divine eye]] and the ability to communicate with spirits. They practice [[Kasina]] meditation, mantra recitation, and ascetic practices ([[dhutanga]]). Thai forest monks such as Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo were also influenced by esoteric practices as is exemplified by his text \"The Divine Mantra.\"<ref>Ajaan Lee (2006), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/divinemantra.html The Divine Mantra]</ref>\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Buddhist prayer beads201.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Buddhist prayer beads]] used for mantra recitation.]]\nCousins sees the practice of Southern Esoteric Buddhism as being defined by the mapping of inner and outer worlds, and calls it 'tantro-kabbalistic' mysticism. By this he means \"a form of mysticism which utilizes a rather elaborate map of correspondences -between the human body, the cosmos and some kind of higher reality or knowledge. In the process it draws on the full resources of the widely-dispersed traditions of magic and the occult - letter, sound and number symbolism together with the use of structured patterns of shape or gesture.\"<ref name=Cousins />\n\nFeatures of Yog\u0101vacara practice include:<ref name=Cousins /><ref name=Crosby />\n\n*The use of encoded language\n*Energy centers & channels like cakra/marma & nadi\n*Esoteric interpretation of Buddhist words, objects, myths, numbers and the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] texts\n*The importance of initiation by a [[Guru]] (master)\n*The use of the symbolism of embryology\n*The practice of a type of meditation in which one visualizes and gives birth to a 'Buddha within' and the ''[[Dharmak\u0101ya]]''.\n*Chemistry of mercury as model for ongoing process of purification\n*The practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] for healing, longevity, protection, etc.\n*[[Alchemy]]\n*Worship ([[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]]) of Buddhas, Devas and Spirits\n*A path which is open to all, monastics and lay persons\n*Internal/external applications (Right hand-left hand)\n*The importance of [[ritual]].\n\nTwo of the most widely used sacred [[mantras]] in Yog\u0101vacara texts are ''Namo Buddhaya'' (\"Homage to the Buddha\") and ''Araham'' (\"Worthy One\"). Here is an example of esoteric interpretation of the letter and number symbolism of ''Namo Buddhaya'':<ref name=Cousins />\n\n*NA, symbolizes the twelve virtues of the mother;\n*MO, the twenty-one virtues of the father;\n*BU, the six virtues of the king;\n*DDHA., the seven virtues of the family;\n*YA, the ten virtues of the teacher.\n\nThe recitation of these sacred phrases was used as a meditation practice.<ref name=Crosby /> Robert Percival (in Ceylon from 1796 to 1800), described Buddhist mantra meditation thus: \"To their girdles they wear suspended strings of beads made of a brownish or black wood; and mutter prayers as they go along.\"<ref name=Cousins />\n\nIn one text studied by Bizot, meditation includes the use of visualization of colored lights paired with sacred syllables located throughout the body and visions of the Buddha and a [[stupa]] at the top of [[mount Sumeru]].<ref name=Crosby /> Another text called the ''Ratanamala'' uses the ''[[Buddh\u0101nussati#Theravada|itipi so]]'' formula for various purposes including spiritual protection, magical 'worldly' uses which are termed \"left-hand\", the transformation of the body into a ''kayasiddhi'', a spiritual body, as well as for the pursuit of [[nirvana]] (termed \"right-hand path\").<ref name=Crosby />\n\nSeveral studies by Bizot have also looked at certain \"rebirthing\" rituals which seem to have been common in pre-modern Cambodia. They included symbolic sacred syllables, the entrance into a cave which symbolized the womb, meditation on embryonic development, and the belief that this meditation would allow one's body to be reborn as the [[Dharmakaya]].<ref name=Crosby /> Another practice studied by Bizot was the use of [[yantras]] or sacred diagrams, which were made with Pali words and phrases and used as tattoos and on clothing.<ref name=Crosby /> \n[[File:Mount Popa 006.jpg|thumb|200px|A Burmese statue of [[Bo Min Gaung]], a famous ''weikza'' (wizard)]]\nIn his study of the ''Saddavimala'', a Yog\u0101vacara text which was widely circulated in Southeast Asia (with over two hundred extant manuscripts), Bizot gives an outline of Yog\u0101vacara practice:<ref name=Crosby />\n\n\"The yogavacara must:\n# memorise the stages of the embryonic development (with their alphabetic equivalents) which form the stages of his own formation;\n# through these stages build himself another body using the organs and constituents that are the letters, i.e. the portions of the Dhamma;\n# become conscious that this new body which he is going to produce outside of himself, first takes form within him, in his stomach at the level of the navel, taking the form of a Buddha the height of a thumb;\n# pursue and achieve in this life the construction of this immortal vehicle because it leads the person who possesses it to [[Nibbana]], in that it takes the place of the spent physical form at the moment of death.\"\n\nIn contemporary Southern Buddhism, these practices are sometimes termed ''Boran Kammatthana'' (ancient practices) and are most widely seen in Cambodian Buddhism. They usually involve \"the physical internalisation or manifestation of aspects of the Theravada path by incorporating them at points in the body between the nostril and navel.\"<ref>Kate Crosby, Andrew Skilton, Amal Gunasena; The Sutta on Understanding Death in the Transmission of Boran Meditation From Siam to the Kandyan Court.</ref>\n\nThe practices of the Burmese Buddhist [[Weizza]] (\"Wizards\") who follow an esoteric system of occult practices (such as recitation of spells, samatha and alchemy) which are believed to lead to supernormal powers and a life of immortality might also be related to Southern Esoteric Buddhism.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism]]\n*[[Buddhism in Cambodia]]\n*[[Buddhism in Thailand]]\n*[[Tantra]]\n*[[Vajrayana]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Mettanando Bhikkhu (1999), Meditation and Healing in the Theravada Buddhist Order of Thailand and Laos, Hamburg (Ph.D. thesis). \n*Woodward, EL.

It is most widely practiced today in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]] and in the pre-modern era was a major Buddhist current in [[Southeast Asia]]. \n\nIn the west, the study of Southern Esoteric Buddhism was pioneered by professor [[Fran\u00e7ois Bizot]] and his colleagues at the [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] with a particular focus on the material found at [[Angkor]].<ref name=Crosby>Crosby, Kate (2000).

[[Ari Buddhism]] was a form of Buddhism practiced in the [[Mon kingdoms]] of [[Burma]] which also contained Tantric elements borrowed from India and local [[Nat (spirit)|Nat]] (spirit) and [[N\u0101ga]] worship. In many of Bizot's works there is some suggestion that the Buddhism of the Mon may have influenced the later Yog\u0101vacara tradition. It is also possible that Southeast Asian Buddhism was influenced by the practice of [[Hinduism]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]] which flourished in Southeast Asia during the time of the [[Khmer Empire]].<ref name=Crosby /> According to Cousins, it is also possible that Southern Esoteric Buddhism developed within the \"orthodox\" Mahavihara tradition of [[Sri Lanka]], citing the 5th century Buddhist scholar [[Buddhaghosa]]'s mention of secret texts (''gulhagantham'') as well as other textual evidence from the Pali commentaries. Cousins concludes that \"It is quite possible that present-day Southern Esoteric Buddhism contains ideas and practices deriving from more than one of these sources. Nevertheless it is certainly premature to assume that it has its origins in unorthodox circles.\"<ref name=Cousins />\n\n===Flowering===\nThe Yog\u0101vacara tradition was a mainstream Buddhist tradition in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand well into the modern era. An inscription from Northern Thailand with esoteric elements has been dated to the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] of the 16th century. Kate Crosby notes that this attestation makes the esoteric tradition earlier than \u201cany other living meditation tradition in the contemporary Theravada world.\u201d<ref name=\"Kate Crosby 2013\">Kate Crosby, Traditional Theravada Meditation and its Modern-Era Suppression Hong Kong: Buddha Dharma Centre of Hong Kong, 2013, {{ISBN|978-9881682024}}</ref>\n\n===Yog\u0101vacara (18th century)===\nDuring the reign of [[Rama I]], the Thai Yog\u0101vacara master Kai Thuean (1733-1823) was invited to Bangkok to be head of the meditation tradition there and was later made [[Sangharaja]] (head of the religious community) by [[Rama II of Siam]] in 1820.<ref name=Crosby /> In Sri Lanka, a revival of Buddhist meditation in the 1750s saw a proliferation of Yog\u0101vacara teachings and texts by Thai monks from the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], one of which is the ''[[Yog\u0101vacara's manual]]''.<ref>Kate Crosby, Andrew Skilton, Amal Gunasena (2012), The Sutta on Understanding Death in the Transmission of Boran Meditation From Siam to the Kandyan Court, Journal of Indian Philosophy, 40 (2), 177-198.</ref> Monks of the [[Siam Nikaya]] practiced these teachings and established several monasteries around [[Kandy]]. As late as the 1970s, Yog\u0101vacara practices such as the rapid repetition of ''Araham'' were recorded in [[Sri Lanka]].<ref name=Crosby />\n\n===Decline (19th century)===\nThe decline of the esoteric currents began with the rise of the reformed Buddhism in the 19th century, particularly the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] established by King [[Rama IV]] (1851\u20131868) of the Thai [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in 1833, which was imported into [[Cambodia]] as it was a protectorate of the kingdom.<ref name=Crosby /> In establishing the [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]], [[Rama IV]] emphasized the use of the [[Pali Canon]] as the main authority for monastic practices and also attempted to remove all superstitious and folk religious elements.<ref>[http://www.dhammathai.org/e/thailand/ratanakosin.php Ratanakosin Period], Buddhism in Thailand, Dhammathai - Buddhist Information Network</ref> The textual tradition followed by this reform movement was that of the [[Sri Lanka]]n [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahavihara]] school (which itself dates from a set of [[Parakramabahu I#Religious reform|12th century reforms]]) which took the works of the 5th century scholar [[Buddhagosa]] as representing the orthodox interpretation and thus saw other Buddhist practices as unorthodox.<ref name=Crosby /> The reforms tightened monastic discipline and led to a decline in the practices and production of texts which were not in line with [[Dhammayuttika Nikaya]] orthodoxy. When Cambodia came under the rule of the [[French colonial empire]], the French continued this policy of suppressing pre-reform Cambodian Buddhism. In spite of this, traditional esoteric practices survived in rural areas.  \n\n===Legacy (20th-21st century)===\n[[File:Wat-bang-phra.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Yantra tattooing]] by monks of [[Wat Bang Phra]]]]\nThe devastation of Cambodian religion by the [[Khmer Rouge]] and religious repression in [[History of Laos since 1945|Communist Laos]] also had a heavy toll on these traditions.<ref name=\"Kate Crosby 2013\"/> Souther Esoteric Buddhist influences may be present in the practices and views of the modern Thai [[Dhammakaya movement]]<ref>Williams, Paul; Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, 327.</ref><ref>Mettanando Bhikkhu (1999), Meditation and Healing in the Theravada Buddhist Order of Thailand and Laos, Ph.D. thesis, University of Hamburg.</ref><ref>Mackenzie, Rory (2007), New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke, Abingdon: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-96646-5}}</ref> as well as in certain South Asian religious practices such as the use of [[Yantra tattooing|protective tattoos]] and amulets, the singing of protective [[Gathas]] (e.g. ''Jinapa\u00f1jara [[G\u0101th\u0101]]''), Thai [[astrology]] and the invocation of spirits and ghosts (such as [[Somdej Toh]] and [[Mae Nak Phra Khanong|Mae Nak]]).<ref>McDaniel, Justin Thomas. The Lovelorn Ghost and the Magical Monk: Practicing Buddhism in Modern Thailand.</ref> Today, magicians and forest monks using these techniques are most prevalent in the banks of the [[Mekong]] in Cambodia and Laos; they are believed to have magical powers, the [[Abhij\u00f1\u0101|divine eye]] and the ability to communicate with spirits. They practice [[Kasina]] meditation, mantra recitation, and ascetic practices ([[dhutanga]]). Thai forest monks such as Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo were also influenced by esoteric practices as is exemplified by his text \"The Divine Mantra.\"<ref>Ajaan Lee (2006), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/divinemantra.html The Divine Mantra]</ref>\n\n==Practices==\n[[File:Buddhist prayer beads201.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Buddhist prayer beads]] used for mantra recitation.]]\nCousins sees the practice of Southern Esoteric Buddhism as being defined by the mapping of inner and outer worlds, and calls it 'tantro-kabbalistic' mysticism. By this he means \"a form of mysticism which utilizes a rather elaborate map of correspondences -between the human body, the cosmos and some kind of higher reality or knowledge. In the process it draws on the full resources of the widely-dispersed traditions of magic and the occult - letter, sound and number symbolism together with the use of structured patterns of shape or gesture.\"<ref name=Cousins />\n\nFeatures of Yog\u0101vacara practice include:<ref name=Cousins /><ref name=Crosby />\n\n*The use of encoded language\n*Energy centers & channels like cakra/marma & nadi\n*Esoteric interpretation of Buddhist words, objects, myths, numbers and the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] texts\n*The importance of initiation by a [[Guru]] (master)\n*The use of the symbolism of embryology\n*The practice of a type of meditation in which one visualizes and gives birth to a 'Buddha within' and the ''[[Dharmak\u0101ya]]''.\n*Chemistry of mercury as model for ongoing process of purification\n*The practice of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] for healing, longevity, protection, etc.\n*[[Alchemy]]\n*Worship ([[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]]) of Buddhas, Devas and Spirits\n*A path which is open to all, monastics and lay persons\n*Internal/external applications (Right hand-left hand)\n*The importance of [[ritual]].\n\nTwo of the most widely used sacred [[mantras]] in Yog\u0101vacara texts are ''Namo Buddhaya'' (\"Homage to the Buddha\") and ''Araham'' (\"Worthy One\"). Here is an example of esoteric interpretation of the letter and number symbolism of ''Namo Buddhaya'':<ref name=Cousins />\n\n*NA, symbolizes the twelve virtues of the mother;\n*MO, the twenty-one virtues of the father;\n*BU, the six virtues of the king;\n*DDHA., the seven virtues of the family;\n*YA, the ten virtues of the teacher.\n\nThe recitation of these sacred phrases was used as a meditation practice.<ref name=Crosby /> Robert Percival (in Ceylon from 1796 to 1800), described Buddhist mantra meditation thus: \"To their girdles they wear suspended strings of beads made of a brownish or black wood; and mutter prayers as they go along.\"<ref name=Cousins />\n\nIn one text studied by Bizot, meditation includes the use of visualization of colored lights paired with sacred syllables located throughout the body and visions of the Buddha and a [[stupa]] at the top of [[mount Sumeru]].<ref name=Crosby /> Another text called the ''Ratanamala'' uses the ''[[Buddh\u0101nussati#Theravada|itipi so]]'' formula for various purposes including spiritual protection, magical 'worldly' uses which are termed \"left-hand\", the transformation of the body into a ''kayasiddhi'', a spiritual body, as well as for the pursuit of [[nirvana]] (termed \"right-hand path\").<ref name=Crosby />\n\nSeveral studies by Bizot have also looked at certain \"rebirthing\" rituals which seem to have been common in pre-modern Cambodia. They included symbolic sacred syllables, the entrance into a cave which symbolized the womb, meditation on embryonic development, and the belief that this meditation would allow one's body to be reborn as the [[Dharmakaya]].<ref name=Crosby /> Another practice studied by Bizot was the use of [[yantras]] or sacred diagrams, which were made with Pali words and phrases and used as tattoos and on clothing.<ref name=Crosby /> \n[[File:Mount Popa 006.jpg|thumb|200px|A Burmese statue of [[Bo Min Gaung]], a famous ''weikza'' (wizard)]]\nIn his study of the ''Saddavimala'', a Yog\u0101vacara text which was widely circulated in Southeast Asia (with over two hundred extant manuscripts), Bizot gives an outline of Yog\u0101vacara practice:<ref name=Crosby />\n\n\"The yogavacara must:\n# memorise the stages of the embryonic development (with their alphabetic equivalents) which form the stages of his own formation;\n# through these stages build himself another body using the organs and constituents that are the letters, i.e. the portions of the Dhamma;\n# become conscious that this new body which he is going to produce outside of himself, first takes form within him, in his stomach at the level of the navel, taking the form of a Buddha the height of a thumb;\n# pursue and achieve in this life the construction of this immortal vehicle because it leads the person who possesses it to [[Nibbana]], in that it takes the place of the spent physical form at the moment of death.\"\n\nIn contemporary Southern Buddhism, these practices are sometimes termed ''Boran Kammatthana'' (ancient practices) and are most widely seen in Cambodian Buddhism. They usually involve \"the physical internalisation or manifestation of aspects of the Theravada path by incorporating them at points in the body between the nostril and navel.\"<ref>Kate Crosby, Andrew Skilton, Amal Gunasena; The Sutta on Understanding Death in the Transmission of Boran Meditation From Siam to the Kandyan Court.</ref>\n\nThe practices of the Burmese Buddhist [[Weizza]] (\"Wizards\") who follow an esoteric system of occult practices (such as recitation of spells, samatha and alchemy) which are believed to lead to supernormal powers and a life of immortality might also be related to Southern Esoteric Buddhism.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism]]\n*[[Buddhism in Cambodia]]\n*[[Buddhism in Thailand]]\n*[[Tantra]]\n*[[Vajrayana]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Mettanando Bhikkhu (1999), Meditation and Healing in the Theravada Buddhist Order of Thailand and Laos, Hamburg (Ph.D. thesis). \n*Woodward, EL.

The song is also often used in [[funerals]], [[tributes]] and [[memorials]].\n\n==Original Asturian version==\n\n:Nel pozu Mar\u00eda Luisa\n:Trailarai larai, trailarai\n:Nel pozu Mar\u00eda Luisa\n:Trailarai larai, trailarai\n:Morrieron cuatro mineros\n:mir\u00e1i, mir\u00e1i Maruxina, mir\u00e1i\n:mir\u00e1i como vengo yo\n\n:Traigo la camisa roxa\n:Trailarai larai, trailarai\n:Traigo la camisa roxa\n:Trailarai larai, trailarai\n:De sangre d'un compa\u00f1eru\n:Mir\u00e1i, mir\u00e1i Maruxina, mir\u00e1i\n:mir\u00e1i como vengo yo\n\n:Traigo la cabeza rota\n:Trailarai larai, trailarai\n:Traigo la cabeza rota\n:Trailarai larai, trailarai\n:Que me la rompi\u00f3 un barrenu\n:Mir\u00e1i, mir\u00e1i Maruxi\u00f1a, mir\u00e1i\n:mir\u00e1i como vengo yo\n\n:Santa B\u00e1rbara bendita\n:Trailarai larai, trailarai\n:Santa B\u00e1rbara bendita\n:Trailarai larai, trailarai\n:patrona de los mineros\n:Mir\u00e1i, mir\u00e1i Maruxina, mir\u00e1i\n:mir\u00e1i como vengo yo\n:Patrona de los mineros\n:Mir\u00e1i, mir\u00e1i Maruxi\u00f1a, mir\u00e1i\n:mir\u00e1i como vengo yo\n\n==English translation==\n\n:In the Mar\u00eda Luisa pit //\n:''Trailarai larai, trailarai''\n:In the Mar\u00eda Luisa mine\n:''Trailarai larai, trailarai''\n:Four miners have died\n:Look, look Maruxina, look\n:look how I'm coming home\n\n:My shirt has turned red\n:''Trailarai larai, trailarai''\n:My shirt has turned red\n:''Trailarai larai, trailarai''\n:Stained with the blood of a fellow miner\n:Look, look Maruxina, look\n:look how I'm coming home\n\n:My head has broken\n:''Trailarai larai, trailarai''\n:My head has broken\n:''Trailarai larai, trailarai''\n:It was broken in a blast\n:Look, look Maruxi\u00f1a, look\n:look how I'm coming home\n\n:Blessed Saint Barbara,\n:''Trailarai larai, trailarai''\n:Blessed Saint Barbara\n:''Trailarai larai, trailarai''\n:Patron saint of the miners\n:Look, look Maruxina, look\n:look how I'm coming home\n:[[Patron saint]] of the miners\n:Look, look Maruxina, look\n:look how I'm coming home\n\nA last couplet , sometimes omitted because of non politically correct [[profanity]] runs likewise\n\nCago en los capataces\nArrivistas y esquiroles\n(Variant) Accionistas y esquiroles\n\nI Crap on the foremen\n(they're all) hustlers and union scabs\n(variant) And the shareholders and unions scabs too\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xvw8D6ILK4 Cover by folk band [[Nuberu]] at youtube.com (fanvid)]\n* [http://idd003x0.eresmas.net/mp3/En%20el%20Pozo%20Mar%EDa%20Luisa.mp3 Spanish language version sung by male choir]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Santa Barbara bendita}}\n[[Category:Asturian culture]]\n[[Category:Asturian music]]\n[[Category:Langreo]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toHeroic(link changed toHero) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_B%C3%A1rbara_bendita"}

It is the primary center of the Mekhitarists, while the [[Mekhitarist Monastery of Vienna]] is their primary abbey.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Historic Move Venice and Vienna Mekhitarist Orders Unite|url=http://asbarez.com/42794/in-historic-move-venice-and-vienna-mekhitarist-orders-unite/|work=[[Asbarez]]|date=24 July 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe islet lies {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} to the southeast of [[Venice]] proper and west of the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and covers an area of {{convert|3|ha}}. Settled in the 9th century, it was a [[leper colony]] during the Middle Ages, but fell into disuse by the early 18th century. In 1717 San Lazzaro was ceded by the [[Republic of Venice]] to [[Mkhitar Sebastatsi]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] Catholic monk, who established a monastery with his followers. It has since been the headquarters of the Mekhitarists and, as such, one of the world's prominent centers of [[Armenian culture]] and [[Armenian studies]]. Numerous important publications, such as the first complete dictionary of the Armenian language (1749\u201369) and the first modern history of Armenia (1781\u201386), were made in the island by the monks which made it an early major center of [[Armenian printing]].\n\nSan Lazzaro has been enlarged nearly four times from its original size through land reclamation. It was recognized as an academy by [[Napoleon]] in 1810 when nearly all monasteries of Venice were abolished. A significant episode in its history is [[Lord Byron]]'s visit in 1816\u201317. The island is one of the best known historic sites of the [[Armenian diaspora]]. The monastery has a large collection of books, journals, artifacts, and the third largest collection of Armenian manuscripts (more than 3,000). Over the centuries, dozens of artists, writers, political and religious leaders have visited the island. It has since become a tourist destination.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Venice San Lazzaro location map.png|thumb|A satellite image of the Venetian Lagoon.

In 810, the [[Republic of Venice]] allocated the island to the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] Monastery of St. Ilario of Fusina. In the 12th century, [[leprosy]] appeared in Venice as a result of trade with the East. Leone Paolini, a local nobleman, transferred the simple hospital of [[San Trovaso]] to the island in 1182.<ref name=\"mechitar.com\"/> Thus, a [[leper colony]]\u2014hospital for people with leprosy\u2014was established at the island, which was chosen for that purpose due to its relative distance from the principal islands forming the city of Venice. It received its name from [[Rich man and Lazarus|St. Lazarus]], the patron saint of lepers.{{sfn|Langlois|1874|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Gordan|2012}} The church of San Lazzaro was founded in 1348, which is attested by an inscription in [[Blackletter|Gothic script]]. In the same year, the hospital was renovated and its ownership transferred from the Benedictines to the patriarchal [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|cathedral of San Pietro]]. Leprosy declined by the mid-1500s and the island was abandoned by 1601 when only the chaplain and some gardeners remained at the island to grow vegetables. In the second half of the 17th century the island was leased to various religious groups. In 1651 a [[Dominican order]] settled at the island after fleeing from Turkish-occupied Crete. [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] also briefly settled in the island.<ref name=\"mechitar.com\"/> By the early 18th century only a few crumbling ruins remained in the isle.{{sfn|Langlois|1874|pp=12\u201313}}\n\n===Armenian period===\n[[File:The island of St. Lazarus, when Mechitar was there.png|thumb|\"The island of St. Lazarus, when Mechitar was there.\"{{sfn|Nurikhan|1915|p=[https://archive.org/stream/lifetimesofserva00nuriiala#page/231/mode/1up 231]}}]]\n\n====Establishment====\nIn April 1715, a group of twelve Armenian Catholic monks led by [[Mkhitar Sebastatsi]] (English: Mekhitar of Sebaste, Italian: Mechitar) arrived in Venice from [[Morea]], today known as the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula, following its [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u201318)|invasion by the Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Langlois|1874|p=13}} The monks were members of a Catholic order founded by Mkhitar in 1701, in [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Adalian|2010|p=426-427}} The order moved to [[Methoni, Messenia|Modone (Methoni)]], on the southern shore of the Peloponnese, in 1703,{{sfn|Langlois|1874|p=20}} after repressions by the Ottoman government and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

It is the primary center of the Mekhitarists, while the [[Mekhitarist Monastery of Vienna]] is their primary abbey.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Historic Move Venice and Vienna Mekhitarist Orders Unite|url=http://asbarez.com/42794/in-historic-move-venice-and-vienna-mekhitarist-orders-unite/|work=[[Asbarez]]|date=24 July 2000}}</ref>\n\nThe islet lies {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} to the southeast of [[Venice]] proper and west of the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and covers an area of {{convert|3|ha}}. Settled in the 9th century, it was a [[leper colony]] during the Middle Ages, but fell into disuse by the early 18th century. In 1717 San Lazzaro was ceded by the [[Republic of Venice]] to [[Mkhitar Sebastatsi]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] Catholic monk, who established a monastery with his followers. It has since been the headquarters of the Mekhitarists and, as such, one of the world's prominent centers of [[Armenian culture]] and [[Armenian studies]]. Numerous important publications, such as the first complete dictionary of the Armenian language (1749\u201369) and the first modern history of Armenia (1781\u201386), were made in the island by the monks which made it an early major center of [[Armenian printing]].\n\nSan Lazzaro has been enlarged nearly four times from its original size through land reclamation. It was recognized as an academy by [[Napoleon]] in 1810 when nearly all monasteries of Venice were abolished. A significant episode in its history is [[Lord Byron]]'s visit in 1816\u201317. The island is one of the best known historic sites of the [[Armenian diaspora]]. The monastery has a large collection of books, journals, artifacts, and the third largest collection of Armenian manuscripts (more than 3,000). Over the centuries, dozens of artists, writers, political and religious leaders have visited the island. It has since become a tourist destination.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Venice San Lazzaro location map.png|thumb|A satellite image of the Venetian Lagoon.

In 810, the [[Republic of Venice]] allocated the island to the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] Monastery of St. Ilario of Fusina. In the 12th century, [[leprosy]] appeared in Venice as a result of trade with the East. Leone Paolini, a local nobleman, transferred the simple hospital of [[San Trovaso]] to the island in 1182.<ref name=\"mechitar.com\"/> Thus, a [[leper colony]]\u2014hospital for people with leprosy\u2014was established at the island, which was chosen for that purpose due to its relative distance from the principal islands forming the city of Venice. It received its name from [[Rich man and Lazarus|St. Lazarus]], the patron saint of lepers.{{sfn|Langlois|1874|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|Gordan|2012}} The church of San Lazzaro was founded in 1348, which is attested by an inscription in [[Blackletter|Gothic script]]. In the same year, the hospital was renovated and its ownership transferred from the Benedictines to the patriarchal [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|cathedral of San Pietro]]. Leprosy declined by the mid-1500s and the island was abandoned by 1601 when only the chaplain and some gardeners remained at the island to grow vegetables. In the second half of the 17th century the island was leased to various religious groups. In 1651 a [[Dominican order]] settled at the island after fleeing from Turkish-occupied Crete.
