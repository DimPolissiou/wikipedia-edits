They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 11 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is 11 years old and an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is 36 years old in the first book and he is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\n'''Susan Heffley''' (known as '''Ann Heffley''' in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is a loving and caring mother but can be embarrassing, bossy, hypocritical, dimwitted, overprotective, and naive. Susan doesn't like technology thinking it doesn't make people socialize. She seems to have a very small knowledge of kid's Rodrick and Greg's age and constantly humiliates and ignores them. She constantly tries to get the family together which never works out. She and her husband Frank also shows immense favoritism towards their youngest son Manny.      Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\n'''Manny Heffley (born June 8, 1943) is an American war criminal and a former [[United States Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] convicted by [[court-martial]] of murdering 22 unarmed [[South Vietnam|South Vietnamese]] civilians in the [[My Lai Massacre]] on March 16, 1968, during the [[Vietnam War]]. manny was released to house arrest under orders by President Richard Nixon, three days after his conviction. Following a petition for ''[[habeas corpus]]'' by Manny, a new trial was ordered by the 5th Circuit Federal court in Georgia. That ruling however was overturned on an appeal and the Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]]. His initial conviction faced widespread public opposition, both due to the campaign circumstances of civilian embedded [[Viet Cong]] and also due toManny being singled out as the sole officer convicted with respect to the massacre.'''\n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is 16 years old in the first book and he is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is a BASTARD and infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him become much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids. She used to have a dog. Susan never trusts her to babysit Greg.\n\nShe only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Aunt Audra===\nAunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \"great Heffley road trip\".\n\n===Gramma's sisters===\nGramma's sisters are the great-aunts of Rodrick, Greg, and Manny. They are the aunt's of Susan Heffley and her sisters.\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence is Greg's first cousin once removed who is always traveling, and therefore is unable to make it to family events. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband. It was revealed that he died in ''The Ugly Truth''. Greg referred to him as Remus in ''The Do it Yourself Book''.\n\n===Georgia===\nGeorgia is Greg's second cousin who has an extremely loose tooth that she does not want to pull out. She only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Benjy===\nBenjy is Greg's third cousin. He can read chapter books and speak in full sentences. However, he still isn't potty trained. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Tony and Patricia===\nTony is Greg's second cousin once removed and Patricia is his wife. They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==Rowley's family==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\nHe is also open about his idea of being transgender and how he wants to go through the transition and give his shlong to Manny for lunch.\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school. Susan only likes him because he doesn't have electronics in his house and wants Maddox to be a role model for Greg; however, Maddox was rude to Greg. She gets angry at Greg instead of admitting her mistake about Maddox.\n\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{in-universe |date= April 2012}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2015}}\n}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2015}}\n\nThis is a list of characters in [[Jeff Kinney (author)|Jeff Kinney]]'s ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' graphic novel series, as well as in the film adaptations of the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|first]],<ref name=\"MDN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/news/x2118273676/Nothing-Wimpy-about-local-authors-success |title=Nothing 'Wimpy' about local author's success |last=McCarron |first=Heather |date=October 12, 2009 |publisher=[[Milford Daily News]] |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}</ref> [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (film)|second]],<ref name=\"Moviefone\">[http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' Sequel to Bow Next March] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325214154/http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 |date=2012-03-25 }}.

They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 11 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is 11 years old and an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids.

In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is 36 years old in the first book and he is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\n'''Susan Heffley''' (known as '''Ann Heffley''' in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is a loving and caring mother but can be embarrassing, bossy, hypocritical, dimwitted, overprotective, and naive. Susan doesn't like technology thinking it doesn't make people socialize. She seems to have a very small knowledge of kid's Rodrick and Greg's age and constantly humiliates and ignores them. She constantly tries to get the family together which never works out. She and her husband Frank also shows immense favoritism towards their youngest son Manny.      Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\n'''Manny Heffley (born June 8, 1943) is an American war criminal and a former [[United States Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] convicted by [[court-martial]] of murdering 22 unarmed [[South Vietnam|South Vietnamese]] civilians in the [[My Lai Massacre]] on March 16, 1968, during the [[Vietnam War]]. manny was released to house arrest under orders by President Richard Nixon, three days after his conviction. Following a petition for ''[[habeas corpus]]'' by Manny, a new trial was ordered by the 5th Circuit Federal court in Georgia. That ruling however was overturned on an appeal and the Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]]. His initial conviction faced widespread public opposition, both due to the campaign circumstances of civilian embedded [[Viet Cong]] and also due toManny being singled out as the sole officer convicted with respect to the massacre.'''\n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is 16 years old in the first book and he is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is a BASTARD and infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him become much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids. She used to have a dog. Susan never trusts her to babysit Greg.\n\nShe only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Aunt Audra===\nAunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \"great Heffley road trip\".\n\n===Gramma's sisters===\nGramma's sisters are the great-aunts of Rodrick, Greg, and Manny. They are the aunt's of Susan Heffley and her sisters.\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence is Greg's first cousin once removed who is always traveling, and therefore is unable to make it to family events. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband. It was revealed that he died in ''The Ugly Truth''. Greg referred to him as Remus in ''The Do it Yourself Book''.\n\n===Georgia===\nGeorgia is Greg's second cousin who has an extremely loose tooth that she does not want to pull out. She only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Benjy===\nBenjy is Greg's third cousin. He can read chapter books and speak in full sentences. However, he still isn't potty trained. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Tony and Patricia===\nTony is Greg's second cousin once removed and Patricia is his wife. They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==Rowley's family==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\n\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school. Susan only likes him because he doesn't have electronics in his house and wants Maddox to be a role model for Greg; however, Maddox was rude to Greg. She gets angry at Greg instead of admitting her mistake about Maddox.\n\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "name_user": "2601:1c0:5b80:210:9d60:b776:ac65:7066", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eChirag Gupta)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid_characters"}

Hist.'' (an abbreviation of the alternative title ''A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants'') and written between 1832 and 1838. He included in his new genus the two species hitherto known as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'' L. and ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' M. Bieb. \u2013 the latter published by Baron [[Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein]] in his ''Flora taurico-caucasica'' of 1808.\n\n==Common names==\nNot being native to Western Europe, plants belonging to the genus ''Physochlaina'' have no common name of any antiquity in English, nor have they acquired a more recent common name among English-speaking gardeners, despite the passage of two centuries since their introduction to cultivation in the U.K.\n\n[[Robert Sweet (botanist)|Robert Sweet]] coined the English name ''Oriental Henbane'' for ''P. orientalis'' in his work ''The British Flower Garden'' in 1823, but this is simply a translation of the ( now obsolete ) name ''Hyoscyamus orientalis''. He further coins the name ''Purple-flowered Henbane'' for the Siberian species ''P. physaloides'', but this adds to the confusion, as, not only is the species in question no longer classified as a Henbane ( i.e. ''Hyoscyamus'' ) , but there are also a number of ( true ) ''Hyoscyamus'' spp. which bear purple flowers \u2013 e.g. [[Hyoscyamus muticus]].\n\nThere is, however, a common name (age unknown) for ''Physochlaina'' in [[Russian (language)|Russian]], namely \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 (''Puzeernitsa'') \u2013 '[[Pig bladder|bladder]] / [[Bubble (physics)|bubble]] plant', qualified \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f (''Puzeernitsa Phizalisovaya'') \u2013 ''Physalis-like Bladder plant'' in the case of ''P. physaloides ''.<ref>YouTube.com Physochlaina videos produced by \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 (Vokrug Sveta) TV and \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0513\u0430 (Dmitriy Sutula).</ref> The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] common name for the genus \u2013 ''V\u00e5rbolm\u00f6rt'' \u2013 translates as '[[Spring (season)|Spring]](-flowering) [[Henbane]]',<ref>Glosbe online Swedish dictionary.</ref> while the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] common name ''Kievarinyrtti'' means '[[Inn]] Herb'<ref>Google translate: Finnish to English.</ref> and the Estonian common name is ''Ida-vullrohu'', meaning 'Eastern Henbane'.<ref>Facebook page for Tartu \u00dcllikooli botaanikaaed (= [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens]] )</ref>\n\nIn [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], where the species ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is native to the region abutting the easternmost stretch of Turkey's [[Black Sea]] coast, the common name given to the plant is ''Ta\u015f Banotu'', meaning ''Stone Henbane'' i.e. \"the henbane that grows on/out of, stone\" in reference to the plant's ability to thrive in rock crevices [see section below on ''P. orientalis'' with accompanying image of wild specimen growing in crevices in volcanic rock].<ref>https://www.bizimbitkiler.org.tr/v2/sonuc.php?i=Vm0xMFlWbFdWWGhVYmtwUFZsWndUMVl3Vm1GV01XeHpWMjVrV2xadGVIcFhhMUpQVkcxS1NHVkdhRmhXUlRWMldWVmFXbVF4WkhOalJtUlhaV3hhVFZkV1ZtRlhiVlowVW10c1ZXSklRazlaYkZWM1RWWmFWbGRyV2xCV2EwcFRWVVpSZDFCUlBUMD0= Retrieved at 1.30am on 12/2/20</ref><ref>http://www.bizimcicekler.org.tr/gallery.php?taxonID=12831 Retrieved at 2.10am on 12/2/20</ref> The late Professor [[Turhan Baytop]] lists the Turkish common name ''Yalanc\u0131 Banotu'' (= \"False Henbane\") for the plant in his 1963 work on the medicinal and poisonous plants of Turkey.

This Ossetian common name for the plant is thus very similar in meaning to the Russian ''Puzeernitsa'', but it is not clear whether it arose independently or is simply a translation of the Russian name for the plant. This said, [[Vasily Abaev|Abaev]] lists a second meaning (prevalent particularly in the [[Digor dialect]]) of the Ossetian word ''typpyr'', namely '[[kurgan]]' (burial mound), in which the primary sense of 'swelling' is applied specifically to a swelling in the landscape i.e. a [[tumulus]] or small artificial hill. It is thus possible that the compound ''Typpyrgerdeg'' is translateable as ''grave-grass'' i.e. a fodder plant associated in some way with grave mounds. Such a meaning for this compound would be compatible with a native Ossetian provenance - not unlikely in regard to the name of a plant native to the Caucasus (see below re.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' ').

The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub.

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<Blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</Blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<Blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.</Blockquote><ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]]. It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula,<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref> publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and ethnographer [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) \"Tchindat\" (= Chindanturuk) on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), straddling border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]], a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

Pallas en differentes provinces de l'Empire de Russie et dans l'Asie septentrionale, traduit de l'Allemande par m. Gauthier de la Peyronie 1793.</ref>\nAfter accepting a professorship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] offered him by Empress [[Catherine the Great]], Pallas led an expedition lasting from 1768 to 1774, which took him from the central provinces of Russia far to the east - all the way to the lands beyond [[Lake Baikal]]. It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to Chindanturuk never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream Udagata\u00ef, one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently. Entheogens, as their name suggests, are generally used in a ritual or religious setting,<ref>Furst, Peter T. ''Hallucinogens and Culture'' pub.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm. [N.B. relevant web link forbidden to be displayed because Iranian Students News Agency website blacklisted by Wikipedia].</ref>\n\n==Cultivation of ''P. physaloides'' at Leiden : evidence furnished by an early illustration==\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Comparison fruiting calyces Physochlaina orientalis and P. physaloides.jpg|thumb|Contrast between ripe fruiting calyces of ''P. orientalis'' and ''P. physaloides'' - marked enough probably to justify maintaining these as distinct species: calyx of ''P. orientalis'' resembles a squat, pyriform version of the (rigid) fruiting calyx of ''Hyoscyamus'', while that of ''P. physaloides'' resembles (as the specific name suggests) the (papery / bladder-like) fruiting calyx of ''Physalis''.]]\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( ten days ) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( eleven days ) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( twelve days ) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( thirteen days ) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

It is thus possible that the compound ''Typpyrgerdeg'' is translateable as ''grave-grass'' i.e. a fodder plant associated in some way with grave mounds.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub. Elsevier.</ref>\n\nThe nomenclatural association of ''P. infundibularis'' with Mount Hua \u2013 'West Great Mountain' of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Five Great Mountains of China]] of [[Taoism]] \u2013  is an interesting one and merits further study : in common with other mountains regarded in China as [[numinous]]/[[Xian ling]], Mount Hua (a precipitous assemblage of five (counted anciently only as three) peaks in the [[Qin Mountains|Qin range]]) is held to be a source of rare medicinal plants and life-prolonging [[Elixir of life|elixirs]]. Furthermore, at the foot of the West Peak of Mount Hua (known as Lianhua Feng (\u84ee\u82b1\u5cf0) or Furong Feng (\u8299\u84c9\u5cf0), both meaning [[Lotus Flower]] Summit) stood, from as early as the second century BCE, a [[Taoist temple]] which was the site of [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices undertaken by [[Tongji (spirit medium)|spirit mediums]] (see also [[Wu (shaman)]]) to contact an (unnamed) God of the [[Diyu|Underworld]] and his minions, believed to dwell in the heart of the mountain.(See also [[Chinese folk religion]]).<ref>Goossaert, Vincent. \"Huashan.\" in Fabrizio Pregadio, ed., The Encyclopedia of Taoism (London: Routledge, 2008), 481\u2013482.</ref> Tropane-containing, Solanaceous plants (such as ''[[Datura]]'' and ''[[Hyoscyamus]]'' spp.) have a long history of use as entheogens in shamanic practices<ref>Harner, Michael J., ''Hallucinogens and Shamanism'', pub.

In the traditional systems of medicine in China and Mongolia it is considered to have the effects of 'combatting weakness', 'warming up the [[stomach]]', 'soothing the mental condition' and relieving asthma. It is also used for treating 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold' and 'cough or asthma caused by excessive [[phlegm]] or [[neurasthenia]]'.\nNote : the medical concept neurasthenia \u2013 now largely abandoned in Western medicine \u2013 is expressed in Chinese as ''shenjing shuairuo'' (simplified Chinese: \u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u5f31), a compound of ''shenjing'' 'nervous' and ''shuairuo'' 'weakness', and the Chinese condition so described is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] encompassing debility, emotional turmoil, excitement, tension-induced pain and sleep disturbances, caused by a depletion of [[qi]] ('vital energy') and impaired functioning of the [[Zang-fu#Five System|''wuzang'']] (= 'five vital organs').<ref>Schwartz, Pamela Yew (September 2002). \"Why is neurasthenia important in Asian cultures?\".

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<Blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</Blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<Blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.</Blockquote><ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]]. It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula,<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref> publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and ethnographer [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) \"Tchindat\" (= Chindanturuk) on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), straddling border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]], a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to Chindanturuk never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream Udagata\u00ef, one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides'').

The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed.

New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

( Compare also a similar penchant for growing in rock crevices on the part of the Xinjiang species ''Physochlaina capitata'' \u2013 see above ).\n\nThe plant's country of origin is given in von Bieberstein's original description of ' ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' ' (now ''Physochlaina orientalis'') as Caucasian [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]  \u2013 a former kingdom, the heartland of which is the modern [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgian]] province of [[Kartli]]. The Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia also encompassed parts of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], southern [[Russia]] and eastern Turkey.\n\n[[Flora Iranica]] is in agreement on this range of occurrence for ''P. orientalis'', adding also to the list of territories not only north-western Iran but also 'Syr Darja' \u2013 the latter being referable to lands traversed by the river [[Syr Darya]] and, more especially the historic [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] and hence modern [[Uzbekistan]]. Uzbekistan lies outside the area encompassed by Flora Iranica, but parts of neighbouring [[Turkmenistan]] do not. Either way, Flora Iranica is unequivocal in describing the range of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' as extending eastward into [[Central Asia]].\n\n===Physochlaina alaica - an endangered medicinal plant of Central Asia===\nIn this context, it may be noted that Phillips and Rix include in their work on garden perennials a photograph of a second, (not universally accepted) ''Physochlaina'' species of unequivocally Central Asian provenance, namely ''P. alaica'' Korotk. ex Kovalevsk, recorded as growing in the [[Pamir-Alay]], a Central Asian mountain range taking in parts not only of Uzbekistan, but also of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. ''Physochlaina alaica'' differs from ''P. orientalis'' in having flowers of a beige or yellowish-buff colour and corolla 'throats' veined within in a contrasting dark brown. As is to be expected of a plant native to the [[Pamirs]], this species is extremely hardy, if grown in dry (i.e. well-drained) conditions.<ref name= \"Perennials 1991\"/> Its common name in the [[Uzbek language]] is ''Oloy xiyoli'',\nof which the first word ''Oloy'' signifies (like the Latin specific name ''alaica'') \"of the Alay mountains\" while the second element ''xiyoli'' appears to bear some relation to the Arabic loan-word ''xiyol'' [pronounced \"khiyol\"] translatable possibly in this context as \"short-lived\" - in reference to the plant's short growing season and quick flowering as a desert ephemeral, fuelled by food reserves stored in its fleshy roots.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\">Mamatqulova (Yuldasheva), Gulzira, (2016), ''Ekologik Omillarni O'zbekiston Hududida Tarqalgan Noyob O'simliklarga Ta'siri va Ularni Muhofaza Qilish'' (Translation: \"The Impact of Ecological Factors upon some Unique Plants found within the Territory of [[Uzbekistan]] and Measures Needed for their Protection\"), paper submitted for the degree of BSc, Dept. of Biology and Ecology in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, [[Andijan State University]], Republic of Uzbekistan.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm.

[See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Comparison fruiting calyces Physochlaina orientalis and P. physaloides.jpg|thumb|Contrast between ripe fruiting calyces of ''P. orientalis'' and ''P. physaloides'' - marked enough probably to justify maintaining these as distinct species: calyx of ''P. orientalis'' resembles a squat, pyriform version of the (rigid) fruiting calyx of ''Hyoscyamus'', while that of ''P. physaloides'' resembles (as the specific name suggests) the (papery / bladder-like) fruiting calyx of ''Physalis''.]]\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( ten days ) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( eleven days ) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( twelve days ) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot ( thirteen days ) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

By the middle Carboniferous, however, South China had already been in contact with North China long enough to allow floral exchange between the two continents. The Cimmerian blocks rifted from Gondwana in the Late Carboniferous.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\nIn the early Permian, the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened behind the Cimmerian terranes (Sibumasu, Qiantang, Lhasa) and, in the late Carboniferous, the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean closed in front. The eastern branch of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, however, remained opened while Siberia was added to Laurussia and Gondwana collided with Laurasia.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\n\nWhen the eastern Palaeo-Tethys closed 250\u2013230&nbsp;Mya, a series of Asian blocks&nbsp;\u2013 Sibumasu, Indochina, South China, Qiantang, and Lhasa&nbsp;\u2013 formed a separate southern Asian continent.  This continent collided 240\u2013220&nbsp;Mya with a northern continent&nbsp;\u2013 North China, Qinling, Qilian, Qaidam, Alex, and Tarim&nbsp;\u2013 along the Central China orogen to form a combined East Asian continent.  The northern margins of the northern continent collided with Baltica and Siberia 310\u2013250&nbsp;Ma, and thus the formation of the East Asian continent marked Pangaea at its greatest extent.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\nBy this time, the rifting of western Pangaea had already begun.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nPangaea split in two as the [[Tethys Seaway]] opened between Gondwana and Laurasia in the Late Jurassic.  As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

Lhasa, West Burma, Sikuleh, southwest Sumatra, West Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo broke off during the Late Triassic-Late Jurassic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalfe|1999|pp=15-16}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Carboniferous and Permian, Baltica first collided with Kazakhstania and Siberia, then North China with Mongolia and Siberia. By the middle Carboniferous, however, South China had already been in contact with North China long enough to allow floral exchange between the two continents. The Cimmerian blocks rifted from Gondwana in the Late Carboniferous.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\nIn the early Permian, the Neo-Tethys Ocean opened behind the Cimmerian terranes (Sibumasu, Qiantang, Lhasa) and, in the late Carboniferous, the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean closed in front. The eastern branch of the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean, however, remained opened while Siberia was added to Laurussia and Gondwana collided with Laurasia.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\n\nWhen the eastern Palaeo-Tethys closed 250\u2013230&nbsp;Mya, a series of Asian blocks&nbsp;\u2013 Sibumasu, Indochina, South China, Qiantang, and Lhasa&nbsp;\u2013 formed a separate southern Asian continent.  This continent collided 240\u2013220&nbsp;Mya with a northern continent&nbsp;\u2013 North China, Qinling, Qilian, Qaidam, Alex, and Tarim&nbsp;\u2013 along the Central China orogen to form a combined East Asian continent.  The northern margins of the northern continent collided with Baltica and Siberia 310\u2013250&nbsp;Ma, and thus the formation of the East Asian continent marked Pangaea at its greatest extent.<ref name=\"Zhao-etal2018-p14\" />\nBy this time, the rifting of western Pangaea had already begun.<ref name=\"Blakey-2003\" />\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nPangaea split in two as the [[Tethys Seaway]] opened between Gondwana and Laurasia in the Late Jurassic.  As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

Whilst [[St Blazey engine shed|St Blazey depot]] is still in use, [[St Blazey railway station|St Blazey station]] closed to passengers in 1925, and the town is now served by [[Par railway station|Par station]] on the [[Cornish Main Line]] in Par village.<ref name=\"osexp1\"/>\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Eden Project geodesic domes panorama.jpg|thumb|360px|Panoramic view of the geodesic biome domes at the Eden Project]]\nThe [[Eden Project]] is located within the civil parish, and about a mile and half (2&nbsp;km) from the centre of the town. The large number of visitors this attracts has led to the development of tourism in the town. Other attractions, such as the [[Treffry Viaduct]] and the [[Luxulyan Valley]], are also close by, although actually within the adjoining parish of [[Luxulyan]].<ref name=\"osexp1\"/>\n\n==Education==\nPrimary education is provided by Biscovey Nursery and Infant Community School and Biscovey Junior School.\n\n==Sport==\nThe town's football team, [[St Blazey A.F.C.]], was the first club of England International goalkeeper [[Nigel Martyn]].\n\nThe town is also home to St Blazey Cricket Club which has two teams.\nThe cricket club is based at the top of Middleway Road.\n\n==Notable people==\nNotable people from the town include [[Edward Long]], the historian, who was born at Roselyon, in 1734, and educated at [[Liskeard]].
