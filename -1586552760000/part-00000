He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nBorn in West Virginia, Spaid began his career in education as a schoolteacher in Virginia and as a school administrator in Ohio. He became principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1894, and superintendent of Delaware's New Castle County Public Schools in 1903. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools, he instituted pay raises for teachers to mitigate a teacher shortage, and he served on a committee to revise the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917. In November 1918, he issued a bulletin entitled, ''Our Children Must Be Educated'', in which he appealed to parents and school administrators to address rising teacher resignations, withdrawals of school children and other conditions that affected the state's public school system. He stressed that it was necessary to keep Delaware's children in school to avoid illiteracy. Under Spaid's initiative to bring efficiency to the state's public school system, the Delaware State Board of Education adopted a new school code in 1919. In May 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education urged county superintendents and school principals to observe [[Memorial Day]] at their schools. Spaid left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, Spaid also served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. Spaid had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936. According to historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]], Spaid \"placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware, and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell 1\">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=730.}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nArthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid was born on 27&nbsp;July 1866 in [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]], West Virginia, to John W.

He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nIn 1894, Spaid relocated to Delaware, where he was elected principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington and served in this position until 1903. Spaid became superintendent of New Castle County Public Schools in 1903 and remained in this position until 1913. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools. In response to a shortage of teachers, Spaid instituted pay raises for some teachers in July 1906 so that they would return for the fall term. In May 1908, the Delaware State Board of Education appointed Spaid and the county superintendents to a committee charged with revising the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917. In November 1918, he issued a bulletin entitled, ''Our Children Must Be Educated'', in which he appealed to parents and school administrators to address rising teacher resignations, withdrawals of school children and other conditions that affected the state's public school system. He stressed that it was necessary to keep Delaware's children in school to avoid illiteracy. Under Spaid's initiative to bring efficiency to the state's public school system, the Delaware State Board of Education adopted a new school code in 1919. In May 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education urged county superintendents and school principals to observe [[Memorial Day]] at their schools. Spaid left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, Spaid also served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. Spaid had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936. According to historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]], Spaid \"placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware, and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell 1\">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=730.}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nArthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid was born on 27&nbsp;July 1866 in [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]], West Virginia, to John W.

The Webling play was adapted by [[John L. Balderston]] and the screenplay written by [[Francis Edward Faragoh]] and [[Garrett Fort]], with uncredited contributions from [[Robert Florey]] and [[John Russell (screenwriter)|John Russell]].\n\n''Frankenstein'' stars [[Colin Clive]] as [[Henry Frankenstein]], an obsessed scientist who digs up corpses with his assistant in order to assemble a living being from dead body parts. The resulting creature, often known as [[Frankenstein's monster]], is portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]]. The make-up for the monster was provided by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]]. Alongside Clive and Karloff, the film's cast also includes [[Mae Clarke]], [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]], [[Dwight Frye]], and [[Edward Van Sloan]]. \n\nProduced and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], the film was a commercial success upon release, and was generally well-received by both critics and audiences. It spawned [[Frankenstein (Universal film series)|a number of]] [[sequel]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], and has had a significant impact on popular culture, with the imagery of a scientist's [[Igor (character)|hunchbacked assistant]]\u2014as well as the film's depiction of Frankenstein's monster\u2014becoming iconic. In 1991, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected ''Frankenstein'' for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/descriptions-and-essays/|title=Brief Descriptions and Expanded Essays of National Film Registry Titles|author=|date=|work=The Library of Congress|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Frankenstein trailer (1931).webm|thumb|right|250px|1931 ''Frankenstein'' [[trailer (promotion)|film trailer]]]]\n\n''Frankenstein'' begins with [[Edward Van Sloan]] stepping from behind a curtain to break the [[fourth wall]] and deliver a brief caution to the audience:\n\n<blockquote>How do you do? Mr. [[Carl Laemmle]] feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning: We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation; life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even'' horrify ''you. So, if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now's your chance to uh, well,\u2013\u2013we ''warned'' you!!</blockquote>\n\nIn a village of the Bavarian Alps, a young scientist named Henry Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz, a [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], piece together a human body. Some of the parts are stolen from freshly buried bodies in a cemetery, and some come from the bodies of recently hanged criminals. In a laboratory he's built inside an abandoned watchtower, Frankenstein desires to create a human, giving this body life through electrical devices he has perfected. But he still needs a brain for his creation. At a nearby school, Henry's former teacher [[Doctor Waldman|Dr. Waldman]] still teaches, showing his class the brain of an average human being and the corrupted brain of a criminal so that they can compare the two. Frankenstein sends Fritz to steal the healthy brain from Waldman's class during the night. But Fritz accidentally drops and damages it, and so brings Frankenstein the corrupt brain instead.\n\nHenry's fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth speaks with their friend Victor Moritz about the scientist's increasingly peculiar actions and how he secludes himself. Elizabeth and Victor ask Dr. Waldman for help in understanding Henry's new behavior and Waldman reveals he is aware Dr. Frankenstein wishes to create life. Concerned for Henry, they arrive at the lab just as the scientist makes his final preparations, the still lifeless body now ready on an operating table. As a storm rages outside, Henry Frankenstein claims he has now discovered the energy that brought life into the world and invites Elizabeth and the others to watch his great experiment. With a pulley system, Frankenstein and Fritz raise the operating table high in the room, moving it toward an opening at the top of the tower. The creature and Frankenstein's equipment are exposed to the lightning storm and empowered. The hand of Frankenstein's creature begins to move. The scientist triumphantly shouts, 'It's alive!'\n\nFrankenstein's Monster, despite its grotesque form, seems to be an innocent, child-like creation. Dr. Frankenstein welcomes it into his laboratory and asks his creation to sit, which it does. He then opens up the roof, causing the Monster to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the Monster. Its fright is mistaken by Frankenstein and Waldman as an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon. Thinking that it is not fit for society and will wreak havoc at any chance, they leave the Monster locked up, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. As Henry and Waldman consider the Monster's fate, they hear a shriek from the dungeon. Frankenstein and Waldman run down and find that the Monster has strangled Fritz. The Monster lunges at the two but they escape, locking the Monster inside. Realizing that the Monster must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the Monster and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the Monster lunges at Frankenstein as Waldman injects the drug into the Monster's back. The Monster falls to the floor unconscious.\n\nHenry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry's father arrive and take him home. Henry is worried about the Monster but Waldman reassures him that he will destroy it. Later, Henry is at home, recovered and preparing for his wedding while Waldman examines the Monster . As he is preparing to vivisect it, the Monster awakens and strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape. It has a short encounter with a farmer's young daughter, Maria. She is not afraid of him and asks him to play a game with her in which they toss flowers into a lake and watch them float. The Monster enjoys the game, but when they run out of flowers he thinks Maria will float as well, so he throws her into the lake where, to his puzzlement, she disappears beneath the surface. Upset by this outcome, the Monster runs away.\n\nWith preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is serenely happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. However, Victor rushes in, saying that Doctor Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the Monster. Meanwhile, the Monster enters Elizabeth's room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth unconscious on the bed. The Monster has escaped.\n\nMaria's father arrives, carrying his drowned daughter's body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form a search party to capture the Monster and bring it to justice, dead or alive. In order to search the whole country for the Monster, they split into three groups: Ludwig leads the first group into the woods, Henry leads the second group into the mountains, and the Burgomaster leads the third group by the lake. During the search, Henry becomes separated from the group and is discovered by the Monster, who attacks him. The Monster knocks Henry unconscious and carries him off to an old mill. The peasants hear his cries and they regroup to follow. They find the Monster has climbed to the top, dragging Henry with him. The Monster hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the vanes of the windmill, saving his life. Some of the villagers hurry him to his home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, with the Monster trapped inside.\n\nAt Castle Frankenstein, Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein, celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Poster - Frankenstein 02.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Frankenstein'' [[movie theater]] [[film poster|lobby card]]]]\n* [[Colin Clive]] as [[Henry Frankenstein]]\n* [[Mae Clarke]] as [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]\n* [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]] as Victor Moritz\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|The Monster]]\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Dr. Waldman]]\n* [[Frederick Kerr]] as Baron Frankenstein\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as [[Fritz (Frankenstein)|Fritz]]\n* [[Lionel Belmore]] as Herr Vogel, the [[Burgomaster]]\n* [[Marilyn Harris (actress)|Marilyn Harris]] as Little Maria\n* [[Michael Mark (actor)|Michael Mark]] as Ludwig, Maria's father\n\n==Production==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2019}}\nIn 1930, [[Universal Studios]] had lost $2.2&nbsp;million in revenues. Within 48 hours of its opening at New York's [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] on February 12, 1931, ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' starring [[Bela Lugosi]] had sold 50,000 tickets, building a momentum that culminated in a $700,000 profit, the largest of Universal's 1931 releases. As a result, the head of production, [[Carl Laemmle Jr.]], announced immediate plans for more horror films.<ref name=\"Vieira\">{{cite book\n|last1=Vieira | first1=Mark A. | title=Hollywood Horror: From Gothic to Cosmic\n|url=https://archive.org/details/hollywoodhorrorf0000viei |url-access=registration |year=2003 | publisher=Harry N.

However, the actor was expected by producer Carl Laemmle Jr. to play the Monster<ref>Gregory, Wiliam M. 1981. ''It's Alive! The Classic Cinema Saga of Frankenstein''. San Diego, CA: A. S. Barnes.</ref> (a common move for a contract player in a film studio at the time) to keep his famous name on the bill.<ref>{{cite news |title=\"Frankenstein\" Cast Chosen. |quote=The Universal production of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" is taking shape under the knowing guidance of [[James Whale]]. [[Boris Karloff]] and not Bela Lugosi is the final choice to play the Monster. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 30, 1931}}</ref> After several disastrous make-up tests (said to resemble that of Paul Wegener in ''[[The Golem (1915 film)|The Golem]]''), the ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' star left the project.\n\nAlthough this is often regarded as one of the worst decisions of Lugosi's career, in actuality, the part that Lugosi was offered was not the same character that Karloff eventually played. The initial director was [[Robert Florey]], who had re-characterized the Monster as a simple killing machine, without a touch of human interest or pathos, unlike in the original Shelley novel. This reportedly causing Lugosi to complain, \"I was a star in my country<ref>Bela Lugosi was born outside the western border of [[Transylvania]] in [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] (now [[Lugoj]], [[Romania]])</ref> and I will not be a scarecrow over here!\"<ref name=\"Sin42-43\">Vieira. pgs. 42\u20133</ref> Florey later wrote that \"the Hungarian actor didn't show himself very enthusiastic for the role and didn't want to play it.\" However, the decision may not have been Lugosi's in any case, since recent evidence suggests that he was kicked off the project, along with director Robert Florey, when the newly arrived [[James Whale]] asked for the property.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nWhale had been imported from England by the Laemmles and given a free hand as to his choice of projects at Universal. He was immediately attracted to ''Frankenstein'' and greatly revised the script and conceptualization of the project, which had troubled the management, back toward a monster with some humanity within, in keeping with Shelley's original story.\n\n[[Image:1931 lugosi frankenstein.jpg|right|thumb|210px|The 1931 \"Lugosi as Frankenstein's Monster\" promo poster, without the now famous flat head makeup]]\nActors who worked on the project either were, or shortly became familiar to the fans of the Universal horror films. These included [[Frederick Kerr]] as the old [[Baron Frankenstein]], Henry's father; [[Lionel Belmore]] as Herr Vogel, the B\u00fcrgermeister; [[Marilyn Harris (actor)|Marilyn Harris]] as Little Maria, the girl the Monster accidentally kills; [[Dwight Frye]] as Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant, Fritz; and Michael Mark as Ludwig, Maria's father. Kerr died a year and a half later.\n\n[[Kenneth Strickfaden]] designed the electrical effects that were used in the \"creation scene\". They were so successful that such effects came to be considered an essential part of every subsequent Universal film involving Frankenstein's Monster. Accordingly, the equipment used to produce them has come to be referred to in fan circles as \"Strickfadens\". It appears that Strickfaden managed to secure the use of at least one [[Tesla Coil]] built by the inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] himself.<ref>\n{{cite book | last = Golman | first = Harry\n| authorlink = | title = Kenneth Strickfaden, Dr. Frankenstein's Electrician\n| publisher = McFarland & Company | date = November 11, 2005\n| isbn = 0-7864-2064-2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to this same source, Strickfaden also doubled for Karloff during the creation scene, as Karloff was afraid of being burned by sparks being thrown off the arcing electrical equipment simulating lightning. Although he was partially covered by a surgical drape, Karloff's abdomen was otherwise exposed during the scene and the high-voltage arc \"scissors\" threw white-hot bits of metal when they were used to create flashes.\n\nThe film opened in [[New York City]] at the Mayfair Theatre on December 4, 1931, and grossed $53,000 in one week.<ref name=\"Sin42-43\"/>\n\nFlorey and Lugosi were given the ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' film, as a consolation. Lugosi would later go on to play Frankenstein's Monster in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' a decade later, when his career was in decline (in the original shooting script the Monster spoke, cancelling Lugosi's initial objection to the part, but his filmed dialogue sequences were cut prior to release, along with the premise that the Monster was blind, which was the way Lugosi had played it).<ref>''MagicImage Filmbooks Series: Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'',</ref>\n\nOther than during the opening credits, a short section where a village band plays on screen, and the final credits, there is no musical soundtrack to the film.\n\n==Pre-Code era scenes and censorship history==\nThe scene in which the Monster throws the little girl, Maria, into the lake and accidentally drowns her has long been controversial. Upon its original 1931 release, the second part of this scene was cut by state censorship boards in [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"Sin42-43\" /> Those states also objected to a line they considered [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] that occurred during Frankenstein's exuberance when he first learns that his creature is alive. The original relevant passage was:\n<blockquote>VICTOR: \"Henry, in the name of God!\" \nHENRY: \"In the name of God? Now I know what it feels like to BE God!\"<ref name=\"Sin42-43\"/></blockquote>\n[[Kansas]] requested the cutting of 32 scenes, which, if they had been removed, would have cut a literal half of the film.<ref>Doherty. pg. 297</ref> Jason Joy of the [[Studio Relations Committee]] sent [[Censorship|censor]] representative [[Joseph Breen]] to urge them to reconsider.

bride.\n\nThe next sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), was made, like all those that followed, without Whale or Clive (the latter of whom had died in 1937). This film featured Karloff's last full film performance as the Monster. ''Son of Frankenstein'' featured [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Wolf Frankenstein|Baron Wolf von Frankenstein]], [[Bela Lugosi]] as bearded hunchback Ygor, and [[Lionel Atwill]] as Inspector Krogh.\n\n''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' was released in 1942. The movie features [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as the Monster, taking over from [[Boris Karloff]], who played the role in the first three films of the series, and Bela Lugosi in his second appearance as the demented Ygor.\n\nThe fifth installment, ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' was released in 1943, directed by [[Roy William Neill]], and starring Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein's Monster. This is also the sequel to ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', with Lon Chaney Jr. returning as the Wolf Man. \n\nIn the follow-up, ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944), Karloff returned to the series, but not to reprise his role as the Monster, but as the Mad Doctor, the Monster was this time portrayed by [[Glenn Strange]]. Chaney returned as the Wolf Man. Dracula was also featured in the film, played by [[John Carradine]]. \n\nIts sequel, ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945), featured the same three monsters, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man with the same cast in their portrayal.\n\nMany of the subsequent films which featured Frankenstein's Monster demote the creature to a robotic henchman in someone else's plots, such as in its final Universal film appearance in the deliberately [[farce|farcical]] ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).\n\nThough it is unrelated to the Universal series, the later ''[[Frankenstein 1970]]'' has the scientist Frankenstein, here played by Karloff, animate the Monster using a nuclear reactor.\n\n==Other adaptations==\n* Karloff would return to the wearing of the makeup and to the role of the monster one last time in a 1962 episode of the television sitcom ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n* The popular 1960s television sitcom, ''[[The Munsters]]'', depicts the family's father [[Herman Munster|Herman]] as Frankenstein's monster, who married [[Count Dracula]]'s daughter. The make-up for Herman is based on the make-up of Boris Karloff.\n* Frankenstein appears in ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' (1967), a [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] [[Halloween]] special, where Dr. [[Victor Frankenstein|Boris von Frankenstein]] (voiced by Karloff) invites various classic monsters to a reunion at his castle with intentions to announce his retirement and to name his successor.\n* [[Mel Brooks]]'s comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974) parodied elements of the first three [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] ''Frankenstein'' movies. Brooks also recreated the movie into a [[Young Frankenstein (musical)|musical of the same name]]. Brooks incorporated the original 1931 electrical apparatus in the laboratory scenes.\n* A live-action parody film, ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (1984), depicting Victor Frankenstein as a modern [[Americans|American]] boy and his deceased pet [[dog]] as the monster, was made by [[Tim Burton]] in 1984. Burton remade it as [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|a full-length animated film]] in 2012.\n\n===Frankenstein's assistant===\nAlthough Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant is often referred to as \"[[Igor (fictional character)|Igor]]\" in descriptions of the films, he is not so called in the earliest films. In both ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'', Frankenstein has an assistant who is played both times by [[Dwight Frye]] who is crippled. In the original 1931 film the character is named \"Fritz\" who is hunchbacked and walks with the aid of a small cane. Fritz did not originate from the ''Frankenstein'' novel, and instead originated from the earliest recorded play adaptation, ''[[Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein]]'', where he was played by [[Robert Keeley (comedian)|Robert Keeley]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Behrendt |first=Stephen C. |date=2012 |title=\"A Hideous Bit of Morbidity\": An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I |publisher=McFarland |page=97 |isbn=978-0786469093 |quote=Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' was adapted for the stage many times, and the first of these interpretations was Richard Brinsley Peake's ''Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein'' (1823), which dramatized key scenes from the novel and added Frankenstein's assistant, Fritz, to the mix. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/peake/apparatus/cast-characters.html |title=Cast and Characters - Romantic Circles |last=Doe |first=John |publisher=RC |date=August 2001 |website=Romantic Circles |access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Bride of Frankenstein'', Frye plays \"Karl\" a murderer who stands upright but has a lumbering metal brace on both legs that can be heard clicking loudly with every step. Both characters would be killed by Karloff's monster in their respective films. It was not until ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939) that a character called \"Ygor\" first appears (here played by [[Bela Lugosi]] and revived by Lugosi in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) after his apparent murder in the earlier film).

The Webling play was adapted by [[John L. Balderston]] and the screenplay written by [[Francis Edward Faragoh]] and [[Garrett Fort]], with uncredited contributions from [[Robert Florey]] and [[John Russell (screenwriter)|John Russell]].\n\n''Frankenstein'' stars [[Colin Clive]] as [[Henry Frankenstein]], an obsessed scientist who digs up corpses with his assistant in order to assemble a living being from dead body parts. The resulting creature, often known as [[Frankenstein's monster]], is portrayed by [[Boris Karloff]]. The make-up for the monster was provided by [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]]. Alongside Clive and Karloff, the film's cast also includes [[Mae Clarke]], [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]], [[Dwight Frye]], and [[Edward Van Sloan]]. \n\nProduced and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], the film was a commercial success upon release, and was generally well-received by both critics and audiences. It spawned [[Frankenstein (Universal film series)|a number of]] [[sequel]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], and has had a significant impact on popular culture, with the imagery of a scientist's [[Igor (character)|hunchbacked assistant]]\u2014as well as the film's depiction of Frankenstein's monster\u2014becoming iconic. In 1991, the United States [[Library of Congress]] selected ''Frankenstein'' for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/descriptions-and-essays/|title=Brief Descriptions and Expanded Essays of National Film Registry Titles|author=|date=|work=The Library of Congress|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Frankenstein trailer (1931).webm|thumb|right|250px|1931 ''Frankenstein'' [[trailer (promotion)|film trailer]]]]\n\n''Frankenstein'' begins with [[Edward Van Sloan]] stepping from behind a curtain to break the [[fourth wall]] and deliver a brief caution to the audience:\n\n<blockquote>How do you do? Mr. [[Carl Laemmle]] feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning: We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation; life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even'' horrify ''you. So, if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now's your chance to uh, well,\u2013\u2013we ''warned'' you!!</blockquote>\n\nIn a village of the Bavarian Alps, a young scientist named Henry Frankenstein and his assistant Fritz, a [[Kyphosis|hunchback]], piece together a human body. Some of the parts are stolen from freshly buried bodies in a cemetery, and some come from the bodies of recently hanged criminals. In a laboratory he's built inside an abandoned watchtower, Frankenstein desires to create a human, giving this body life through electrical devices he has perfected. But he still needs a brain for his creation. At a nearby school, Henry's former teacher [[Doctor Waldman|Dr. Waldman]] still teaches, showing his class the brain of an average human being and the corrupted brain of a criminal so that they can compare the two. Frankenstein sends Fritz to steal the healthy brain from Waldman's class during the night. But Fritz accidentally drops and damages it, and so brings Frankenstein the corrupt brain instead.\n\nHenry's fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth speaks with their friend Victor Moritz about the scientist's increasingly peculiar actions and how he secludes himself. Elizabeth and Victor ask Dr. Waldman for help in understanding Henry's new behavior and Waldman reveals he is aware Dr. Frankenstein wishes to create life. Concerned for Henry, they arrive at the lab just as the scientist makes his final preparations, the still lifeless body now ready on an operating table. As a storm rages outside, Henry Frankenstein claims he has now discovered the energy that brought life into the world and invites Elizabeth and the others to watch his great experiment. With a pulley system, Frankenstein and Fritz raise the operating table high in the room, moving it toward an opening at the top of the tower. The creature and Frankenstein's equipment are exposed to the lightning storm and empowered. The hand of Frankenstein's creature begins to move. The scientist triumphantly shouts, 'It's alive!'\n\nFrankenstein's Monster, despite its grotesque form, seems to be an innocent, child-like creation. Dr. Frankenstein welcomes it into his laboratory and asks his creation to sit, which it does. He then opens up the roof, causing the Monster to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the Monster. Its fright is mistaken by Frankenstein and Waldman as an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon. Thinking that it is not fit for society and will wreak havoc at any chance, they leave the Monster locked up, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. As Henry and Waldman consider the Monster's fate, they hear a shriek from the dungeon. Frankenstein and Waldman run down and find that the Monster has strangled Fritz. The Monster lunges at the two but they escape, locking the Monster inside. Realizing that the Monster must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the Monster and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the Monster lunges at Frankenstein as Waldman injects the drug into the Monster's back. The Monster falls to the floor unconscious.\n\nHenry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry's father arrive and take him home. Henry is worried about the Monster but Waldman reassures him that he will destroy it. Later, Henry is at home, recovered and preparing for his wedding while Waldman examines the Monster . As he is preparing to vivisect it, the Monster awakens and strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape. It has a short encounter with a farmer's young daughter, Maria. She is not afraid of him and asks him to play a game with her in which they toss flowers into a lake and watch them float. The Monster enjoys the game, but when they run out of flowers he thinks Maria will float as well, so he throws her into the lake where, to his puzzlement, she disappears beneath the surface. Upset by this outcome, the Monster runs away.\n\nWith preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is serenely happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. However, Victor rushes in, saying that Doctor Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the Monster. Meanwhile, the Monster enters Elizabeth's room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth unconscious on the bed. The Monster has escaped.\n\nMaria's father arrives, carrying his drowned daughter's body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form a search party to capture the Monster and bring it to justice, dead or alive. In order to search the whole country for the Monster, they split into three groups: Ludwig leads the first group into the woods, Henry leads the second group into the mountains, and the Burgomaster leads the third group by the lake. During the search, Henry becomes separated from the group and is discovered by the Monster, who attacks him. The Monster knocks Henry unconscious and carries him off to an old mill. The peasants hear his cries and they regroup to follow. They find the Monster has climbed to the top, dragging Henry with him. The Monster hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the vanes of the windmill, saving his life. Some of the villagers hurry him to his home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, with the Monster trapped inside.\n\nAt Castle Frankenstein, Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein, celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Poster - Frankenstein 02.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Frankenstein'' [[movie theater]] [[film poster|lobby card]]]]\n* [[Colin Clive]] as [[Henry Frankenstein]]\n* [[Mae Clarke]] as [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]\n* [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]] as Victor Moritz\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Frankenstein's monster|The Monster]]\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Dr. Waldman]]\n* [[Frederick Kerr]] as Baron Frankenstein\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as [[Fritz (Frankenstein)|Fritz]]\n* [[Lionel Belmore]] as Herr Vogel, the [[Burgomaster]]\n* [[Marilyn Harris (actress)|Marilyn Harris]] as Little Maria\n* [[Michael Mark (actor)|Michael Mark]] as Ludwig, Maria's father\n\n==Production==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2019}}\nIn 1930, [[Universal Studios]] had lost $2.2&nbsp;million in revenues.

As a result, the head of production, [[Carl Laemmle Jr.]], announced immediate plans for more horror films.<ref name=\"Vieira\">{{cite book\n|last1=Vieira | first1=Mark A. | title=Hollywood Horror: From Gothic to Cosmic\n|url=https://archive.org/details/hollywoodhorrorf0000viei |url-access=registration |year=2003 | publisher=Harry N.

[[Boris Karloff]] and not Bela Lugosi is the final choice to play the Monster. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 30, 1931}}</ref> After several disastrous make-up tests (said to resemble that of Paul Wegener in ''[[The Golem (1915 film)|The Golem]]''), the ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' star left the project.\n\nAlthough this is often regarded as one of the worst decisions of Lugosi's career, in actuality, the part that Lugosi was offered was not the same character that Karloff eventually played. The initial director was [[Robert Florey]], who had re-characterized the Monster as a simple killing machine, without a touch of human interest or pathos, unlike in the original Shelley novel. This reportedly causing Lugosi to complain, \"I was a star in my country<ref>Bela Lugosi was born outside the western border of [[Transylvania]] in [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] (now [[Lugoj]], [[Romania]])</ref> and I will not be a scarecrow over here!\"<ref name=\"Sin42-43\">Vieira. pgs. 42\u20133</ref> Florey later wrote that \"the Hungarian actor didn't show himself very enthusiastic for the role and didn't want to play it.\" However, the decision may not have been Lugosi's in any case, since recent evidence suggests that he was kicked off the project, along with director Robert Florey, when the newly arrived [[James Whale]] asked for the property.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nWhale had been imported from England by the Laemmles and given a free hand as to his choice of projects at Universal. He was immediately attracted to ''Frankenstein'' and greatly revised the script and conceptualization of the project, which had troubled the management, back toward a monster with some humanity within, in keeping with Shelley's original story.\n\n[[Image:1931 lugosi frankenstein.jpg|right|thumb|210px|The 1931 \"Lugosi as Frankenstein's Monster\" promo poster, without the now famous flat head makeup]]\nActors who worked on the project either were, or shortly became familiar to the fans of the Universal horror films. These included [[Frederick Kerr]] as the old [[Baron Frankenstein]], Henry's father; [[Lionel Belmore]] as Herr Vogel, the B\u00fcrgermeister; [[Marilyn Harris (actor)|Marilyn Harris]] as Little Maria, the girl the Monster accidentally kills; [[Dwight Frye]] as Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant, Fritz; and Michael Mark as Ludwig, Maria's father. Kerr died a year and a half later.\n\n[[Kenneth Strickfaden]] designed the electrical effects that were used in the \"creation scene\". They were so successful that such effects came to be considered an essential part of every subsequent Universal film involving Frankenstein's Monster. Accordingly, the equipment used to produce them has come to be referred to in fan circles as \"Strickfadens\". It appears that Strickfaden managed to secure the use of at least one [[Tesla Coil]] built by the inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] himself.<ref>\n{{cite book | last = Golman | first = Harry\n| authorlink = | title = Kenneth Strickfaden, Dr. Frankenstein's Electrician\n| publisher = McFarland & Company | date = November 11, 2005\n| isbn = 0-7864-2064-2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to this same source, Strickfaden also doubled for Karloff during the creation scene, as Karloff was afraid of being burned by sparks being thrown off the arcing electrical equipment simulating lightning. Although he was partially covered by a surgical drape, Karloff's abdomen was otherwise exposed during the scene and the high-voltage arc \"scissors\" threw white-hot bits of metal when they were used to create flashes.\n\nThe film opened in [[New York City]] at the Mayfair Theatre on December 4, 1931, and grossed $53,000 in one week.<ref name=\"Sin42-43\"/>\n\nFlorey and Lugosi were given the ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' film, as a consolation. Lugosi would later go on to play Frankenstein's Monster in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' a decade later, when his career was in decline (in the original shooting script the Monster spoke, cancelling Lugosi's initial objection to the part, but his filmed dialogue sequences were cut prior to release, along with the premise that the Monster was blind, which was the way Lugosi had played it).<ref>''MagicImage Filmbooks Series: Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'',</ref>\n\nOther than during the opening credits, a short section where a village band plays on screen, and the final credits, there is no musical soundtrack to the film.\n\n==Pre-Code era scenes and censorship history==\nThe scene in which the Monster throws the little girl, Maria, into the lake and accidentally drowns her has long been controversial. Upon its original 1931 release, the second part of this scene was cut by state censorship boards in [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"Sin42-43\" /> Those states also objected to a line they considered [[Blasphemy|blasphemous]] that occurred during Frankenstein's exuberance when he first learns that his creature is alive. The original relevant passage was:\n<blockquote>VICTOR: \"Henry, in the name of God!\" \nHENRY: \"In the name of God? Now I know what it feels like to BE God!\"<ref name=\"Sin42-43\"/></blockquote>\n[[Kansas]] requested the cutting of 32 scenes, which, if they had been removed, would have cut a literal half of the film.<ref>Doherty. pg. 297</ref> Jason Joy of the [[Studio Relations Committee]] sent [[Censorship|censor]] representative [[Joseph Breen]] to urge them to reconsider. Eventually, an edited version was released in Kansas.<ref name=\"Sin42-43\"/>\n\nAs with many [[Pre-Code Hollywood|Pre-Code]] films that were reissued after strict enforcement of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] in 1934, Universal made cuts from the [[original camera negative]],<ref name=\"Sin48\">Vieira. pg. 48</ref> and thus the cut footage is often lost. However, the footage of the girl Maria being thrown into the lake was rediscovered during the 1980s in the collection of the British [[BFI National Archive|National Film Archive]], and it has been reincorporated into modern copies of the film.<ref>Robert Horton [https://books.google.com/books?id=o9irAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 ''Frankenstein''], New York & Chichester: Wallflower Press & Columbia University Press, 2014, p.24</ref>\n\nIn [[Ireland]], the film was banned on February 5, 1932, for being demoralizing and unsuitable for children or 'nervous people' \u2013 [[Irish Film Classification Office#Certificates|age-restricted certificates]] weren't introduced in the country until 1965.

Son-of-frankensteinCropped.jpg\n}}\n''Frankenstein'' was followed by a string of sequels, beginning with ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), in which [[Elsa Lanchester]] plays the Monster's bride.\n\nThe next sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939), was made, like all those that followed, without Whale or Clive (the latter of whom had died in 1937). This film featured Karloff's last full film performance as the Monster. ''Son of Frankenstein'' featured [[Basil Rathbone]] as [[Wolf Frankenstein|Baron Wolf von Frankenstein]], [[Bela Lugosi]] as bearded hunchback Ygor, and [[Lionel Atwill]] as Inspector Krogh.\n\n''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' was released in 1942. The movie features [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] as the Monster, taking over from [[Boris Karloff]], who played the role in the first three films of the series, and Bela Lugosi in his second appearance as the demented Ygor.\n\nThe fifth installment, ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' was released in 1943, directed by [[Roy William Neill]], and starring Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein's Monster. This is also the sequel to ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'', with Lon Chaney Jr. returning as the Wolf Man. \n\nIn the follow-up, ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944), Karloff returned to the series, but not to reprise his role as the Monster, but as the Mad Doctor, the Monster was this time portrayed by [[Glenn Strange]]. Chaney returned as the Wolf Man. Dracula was also featured in the film, played by [[John Carradine]]. \n\nIts sequel, ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945), featured the same three monsters, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man with the same cast in their portrayal.\n\nMany of the subsequent films which featured Frankenstein's Monster demote the creature to a robotic henchman in someone else's plots, such as in its final Universal film appearance in the deliberately [[farce|farcical]] ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948).\n\nThough it is unrelated to the Universal series, the later ''[[Frankenstein 1970]]'' has the scientist Frankenstein, here played by Karloff, animate the Monster using a nuclear reactor.\n\n==Other adaptations==\n* Karloff would return to the wearing of the makeup and to the role of the monster one last time in a 1962 episode of the television sitcom ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.\n* The popular 1960s television sitcom, ''[[The Munsters]]'', depicts the family's father [[Herman Munster|Herman]] as Frankenstein's monster, who married [[Count Dracula]]'s daughter. The make-up for Herman is based on the make-up of Boris Karloff.\n* Frankenstein appears in ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' (1967), a [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] [[Halloween]] special, where Dr. [[Victor Frankenstein|Boris von Frankenstein]] (voiced by Karloff) invites various classic monsters to a reunion at his castle with intentions to announce his retirement and to name his successor.\n* [[Mel Brooks]]'s comedy ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974) parodied elements of the first three [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] ''Frankenstein'' movies. Brooks also recreated the movie into a [[Young Frankenstein (musical)|musical of the same name]].\n* A live-action parody film, ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (1984), depicting Victor Frankenstein as a modern [[Americans|American]] boy and his deceased pet [[dog]] as the monster, was made by [[Tim Burton]] in 1984. Burton remade it as [[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|a full-length animated film]] in 2012.\n\n===Frankenstein's assistant===\nAlthough Frankenstein's hunchbacked assistant is often referred to as \"[[Igor (fictional character)|Igor]]\" in descriptions of the films, he is not so called in the earliest films. In both ''Frankenstein'' and ''Bride of Frankenstein'', Frankenstein has an assistant who is played both times by [[Dwight Frye]] who is crippled. In the original 1931 film the character is named \"Fritz\" who is hunchbacked and walks with the aid of a small cane. Fritz did not originate from the ''Frankenstein'' novel, and instead originated from the earliest recorded play adaptation, ''[[Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein]]'', where he was played by [[Robert Keeley (comedian)|Robert Keeley]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Behrendt |first=Stephen C. |date=2012 |title=\"A Hideous Bit of Morbidity\": An Anthology of Horror Criticism from the Enlightenment to World War I |publisher=McFarland |page=97 |isbn=978-0786469093 |quote=Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' was adapted for the stage many times, and the first of these interpretations was Richard Brinsley Peake's ''Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein'' (1823), which dramatized key scenes from the novel and added Frankenstein's assistant, Fritz, to the mix. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rc.umd.edu/editions/peake/apparatus/cast-characters.html |title=Cast and Characters - Romantic Circles |last=Doe |first=John |publisher=RC |date=August 2001 |website=Romantic Circles |access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Bride of Frankenstein'', Frye plays \"Karl\" a murderer who stands upright but has a lumbering metal brace on both legs that can be heard clicking loudly with every step. Both characters would be killed by Karloff's monster in their respective films. It was not until ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' (1939) that a character called \"Ygor\" first appears (here played by [[Bela Lugosi]] and revived by Lugosi in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) after his apparent murder in the earlier film). This character \u2013 a deranged blacksmith whose neck was broken and twisted due to a botched [[hanging]] \u2013 befriends the monster and later helps Dr. Wolf Frankenstein, leading to the \"hunchbacked assistant\" called \"Igor\" commonly associated with ''Frankenstein'' in popular culture.

It consists of both the {{convert|20|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the \"'''Blue Route'''\" (although no signs exist with that designation), through the suburban [[Philadelphia]]-area counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the [[Toll road|tolled]], {{convert|110.6|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Wyoming Valley]]. The Blue Route passes through suburban areas, while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains, forest and farmland, with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley. I-476 intersects many major roads including [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] (the [[Schuylkill Expressway]]) in [[West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|West Conshohocken]], Interstate 276 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] near [[Hickory Run State Park]].\n\nAt its opening in the early 1970s, I-476 was a 4 mile long, 4-lane spur expressway connecting the Schuylkill Expressway with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. It significantly helped reduce congestion through King of Prussia and the Schuylkill Expressway as it provided a more direct link from the Main Line suburbs to the Northern suburbs and New Jersey. The highway was initially planned to connect down to I-95 in Delaware County, but due to environmental and local opposition, this portion did not open until 1990.\n\nIn 1996, the I-476 designation was affixed to the pre-existing Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, replacing '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.  This was an older four lane pre Interstate limited access highway. Of earlier design, its cross section was very narrow, with only 10 feet between opposing lanes of traffic in places.  This extended I-476 north of Plymouth Meeting to Clarks Summit (near Scranton) as a part of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system.  The crown jewel of this expressway was a state-of-the-art three-level interchange, to connect the new I-476 with the older Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension. This provided direct access to both I-276 east and I-476 north, now on the Northeast Extension. The Northeast Extension served the Lehigh Valley at [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]], with connection to I-78, the southern bypass of Allentown/Bethlehem.  With the completion of the Northeast Extension, I-476 surpassed [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway, a record it will hold until the completion of [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|I-369]] in Texas.\n\nI-476 was widened to 6 lanes between I-76 and I-276 in 1990-1992. It was later widened to 6 lanes up to Lansdale between 2011-2017.\n\n<!--\nWhile proposed as early as 1929, the construction of the Mid-County Expressway did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1992 due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it \"the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history.\" In order to get the route through Delaware County, it was built with many environmental compromises such as a [[parkway]] design and four lanes south of the [[Pennsylvania Route 3]] interchange. The Mid-County Expressway received its \"Blue Route\" nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]]), but it may someday be surpassed in length by [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|Interstate 369]] in [[Texas]]. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as [[Interstate 83]] in [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 12]] in [[Louisiana]], [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]], [[Interstate 97]] in Maryland, and [[Interstate 2]] in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs. -->\n==Route description==\n\n===Blue Route===\n[[File:I-476 north of US 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Blue Route north of US 1.]]\nThe portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Pennsylvania Turnpike|Interstate 276]] runs north\u2013south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] Counties and is officially known as the Mid-County Expressway and the Veterans Memorial Highway, as well as by the nickname the \"Blue Route\".

While the redesigned highway was largely well-received, the constriction to four lanes has led to bottleneck conditions in the area, and many communities that originally opposed the road have now called for its widening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asphaltinstitute.org/upload/Summer_1997.pdf|title=Asphalt: the Magazine of the Asphalt Institute, Summer 1997|accessdate=March 7, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615072541/http://www.asphaltinstitute.org/upload/Summer_1997.pdf|archivedate=June 15, 2007}}</ref> ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' dubbed I-476 \"the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history\" due to the decades of opposition it garnered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byday/fhbd1219.htm|title=FHWA By Day - December 19|accessdate=March 7, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, the road underwent a complete rehabilitation project, including paving, bridge repair, and ramp maintenance of the entire length of the freeway between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.476blueroute.com/|title=I-476 Improvement Project|accessdate=March 7, 2007}}</ref> The section between I-95 and I-76 was completed in 2007 and the section between I-76 and I-276 was completed in the end of 2011.\n\n===Northeast Extension history===\n{{infobox road small\n|state=PA\n|type=PA\n|route=9\n|location=[[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]] &ndash; [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]]\n|length_mi=111.04\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"delorme\"/>\n|length_round=2\n|formed=1980\n|deleted=1996\n}}\nIn 1953, an extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike from the mainline near Plymouth Meeting north through Northeastern Pennsylvania to the [[New York (state)|New York]] border near [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] was proposed.<ref name=wsj8553>{{cite news|title=Tax-Exempts: Pennsylvania Turnpike Board Plans 125-Mile North-South Extension|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 5, 1953|page=11}}</ref><ref name=nyt8953>{{cite news|title=Surveys To Expand Pennsylvania Pike|work=The New York Times|date=August 9, 1953|page=56}}</ref> Groundbreaking for the Northeastern Extension occurred on March 25, 1954 in [[White Haven, Pennsylvania|White Haven]], with Governor [[John S.

It consists of both the {{convert|20|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Mid-County Expressway''', locally referred to as the \"'''Blue Route'''\" (although no signs exist with that designation), through the suburban [[Philadelphia]]-area counties of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]], and the [[Toll road|tolled]], {{convert|110.6|mi|km|2|sp=us|adj=on}} '''Northeast Extension''' of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] connecting the [[Delaware Valley|Philadelphia metropolitan area]] with the [[Lehigh Valley]], the [[Poconos]], and the [[Wyoming Valley]]. The Blue Route passes through suburban areas, while the Northeast Extension predominantly runs through rural areas of mountains, forest and farmland, with development closer to Philadelphia and in the Lehigh Valley and the Wyoming Valley. I-476 intersects many major roads including [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] (the [[Schuylkill Expressway]]) in [[West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania|West Conshohocken]], Interstate 276 (the Pennsylvania Turnpike) in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania|Plymouth Meeting]], [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]] near [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] near [[Hickory Run State Park]].\n\nAt its opening in the early 1970s, I-476 was a 4 mile long, 4-lane spur expressway connecting the Schuylkill Expressway with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Plymouth Meeting. It significantly helped reduce congestion through King of Prussia and the Schuylkill Expressway as it provided a more direct link from the Main Line suburbs to the Northern suburbs and New Jersey. The highway was initially planned to connect down to I-95 in Delaware County, but due to environmental and local opposition, this portion did not open until 1990.\n\nIn 1996, the I-476 designation was affixed to the pre-existing Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, replacing '''Pennsylvania Route 9'''.  This was an older four lane pre Interstate limited access highway. Of earlier design, its cross section was very narrow, with only 10 feet between opposing lanes of traffic in places.  This extended I-476 north of Plymouth Meeting to Clarks Summit (near Scranton) as a part of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] system.  The crown jewel of this expressway was a state-of-the-art three-level interchange, to connect the new I-476 with the older Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension. This provided direct access to both I-276 east and I-476 north, now on the Northeast Extension. The Northeast Extension served the Lehigh Valley at [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 22]], with connection to I-78, the southern bypass of Allentown/Bethlehem.  With the completion of the Northeast Extension, I-476 surpassed [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] in Massachusetts as the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway, a record it will hold until the completion of [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|I-369]] in Texas.\n\nI-476 was widened to 6 lanes between I-76 and I-276 in 1990-1992. It was later widened to 6 lanes up to Lansdale between 2011-2017.\n\n<!--\nWhile proposed as early as 1929, the construction of the Mid-County Expressway did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1992 due to massive community and environmental opposition during the [[freeway revolts]] of the 1960s and 1970s, leading ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' to dub it \"the most costly, most bitterly opposed highway in Pennsylvania history.\" In order to get the route through Delaware County, it was built with many environmental compromises such as a [[parkway]] design and four lanes south of the [[Pennsylvania Route 3]] interchange. The Mid-County Expressway received its \"Blue Route\" nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include the entire length of the existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] in [[Massachusetts]]), but it may someday be surpassed in length by [[Interstate 369 (Texas)|Interstate 369]] in [[Texas]]. In fact, it is longer than some mainline interstates (such as [[Interstate 83]] in [[Maryland]] and Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, [[Interstate 12]] in [[Louisiana]], [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]], [[Interstate 97]] in Maryland, and [[Interstate 2]] in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs. -->\n==Route description==\n\n===Blue Route===\n[[File:I-476 north of US 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Blue Route north of US 1.]]\nThe portion of Interstate 476 between [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Pennsylvania Turnpike|Interstate 276]] runs north\u2013south through [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware]] and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery]] Counties and is officially known as the Mid-County Expressway and the Veterans Memorial Highway, as well as by the nickname the \"Blue Route\".

The turnpike between the two I-81 interchanges carries an average of 10,000 vehicles per day vs. 70,000 on the parallel segment of I-81. This project will build two high-speed connections between I-476 and I-81: one south of Scranton in [[Dupont, Pennsylvania|Dupont]] and one north of Scranton in [[South Abington Township, Pennsylvania|South Abington Township]]. Tolls on the connections will be paid with E-ZPass or [[toll-by-plate]].
