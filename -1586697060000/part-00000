B\u00e9chirian was a key player in the British [[new wave music|new wave]] scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, best known for his work with [[Nick Lowe]], [[Paul Carrack]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Undertones]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[The Monkees]], the [[Flamin' Groovies]], and [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]].  He was also a member of the pseudonymous new wave group [[Blanket of Secrecy]], which issued one album in 1982.  More recently, B\u00e9chirian has worked with the [[Trashcan Sinatras]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].\n\n==Life and career==\nB\u00e9chirian was born and spent his early years in Calcutta, moving to England with his family at the age of 10.  His engineering career started at [[Eden Studios]], in London in the mid-1970s. The studio was based around an Ampex 4 track and a custom built desk based in part on EMI/BBC designs. B\u00e9chirian progressed to become assistant mastering engineer, using an early Scully lathe during the day, and spending the evenings in the studio with bands improving his engineering skills. Eden then moved to a much larger premises and built a brand new studio complex from the ground up. Being involved in the building of the facility, from wiring the studio to helping to build their custom desk, gained B\u00e9chirian a great insight into acoustic design and audio electronics. He even designed the studio's logo. Eden opened as a 16 track with Ampex MM1100, but made the rapid leap to 24 track recording, moving up to an Ampex MM1200 and Dolby A. It was one of the first few 24 track studios in London at that time.\n\n[[Stiff Records]] founder Dave Robinson sought out B\u00e9chirian and he began recording and mixing projects for the label's then fledgling artist roster.\n\nHe continued to develop his engineering talents at Eden as house engineer on an endless mixture of sessions ranging from solo artists to rock bands, big bands and orchestra. He worked as an assistant on sessions with some of the most successful producers and bands at the time, including [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[Moody Blues]], [[David Essex]], [[Georgie Fame]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Clover]] and many others.\n\nB\u00e9chirian had come to the attention of various A&R men, and also continued to work with a variety of Stiff artists. He was asked by Robinson to be involved with the production of [[Lene Lovich]]'s first album, which produced her first hit single, \"[[Lucky Number (song)|Lucky Number]]\". [[Malcolm McLaren]] brought the [[Sex Pistols]] into Eden to work on various drum and guitar tracking sessions, and around this time, Nick Lowe approached B\u00e9chirian to work on his solo project, which was to become ''[[Jesus of Cool]]''. As a result, he wanted B\u00e9chirian to act as his exclusive engineer on all his forthcoming projects, which led to working with [[Graham Parker]], [[Huey Lewis]] and [[Clover]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rockpile]], and others.\n\n[[Seymour Stein]], founder of Sire Records, signed the [[The Undertones|Undertones]], asking B\u00e9chirian to take on production duties for the band's first album.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGaVCwAAQBAJ|title=Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone|last=Bradley|first=Michael|date=2016-02-15|publisher=Music Sales Limited|isbn=9781783238521|language=en}}</ref> B\u00e9chirian ended up engineering and producing the band's first three albums. [[Jake Riviera]], who looked after Costello and Lowe, began representing B\u00e9chirian as manager.\n\nB\u00e9chirian continued to work with various bands and artists as engineer and producer. He produced (with Elvis Costello) and engineered Squeeze's hit album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'', and their American breakthrough hit single \"[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]\".\n\nAround that same time, he formed the band [[Blanket of Secrecy]]. Their first and only album was released in both the UK and the US, and garnered some attention as all the band members wrote and performed under pseudonyms (\"Tinker\", \"Tailor\" and \"Soldier\") and refused to be photographed. This led to speculation about the band members' identities\u2014as B\u00e9chirian was listed in the album's credits as a producer, it was posited that he may have been behind the group.  However, public and media interest in Blanket of Secrecy was short-lived after the album and associated singles failed to chart, and the group broke up.  The actual identities of the band members were not revealed for more than twenty years.\n\nB\u00e9chirian went on to build his own recording studio in London and formed Vinyltone Productions with Epic Records in New York, developing and releasing new artists. The next three years he divided his time between London and New York.  He later remastered Elvis Costello's first nine albums, and produced [[The Monkees]]' 1986 reunion album ''[[Pool It!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tapeop.com/interviews/90/roger-bechirian-bonus/|title=Roger Bechirian: Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Undertones|website=tapeop.com|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref>\n\nLooking for a new direction, B\u00e9chirian later formed Trick Management.  Amongst his clients are [[Tom McRae]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].  Signing Bell X1 to Island Records, he produced the band's breakthrough hit album ''[[Flock (album)|Flock]]''.\n\nNow based in London, B\u00e9chirian engineers and produces, as well as being involved with the development and co-management of new bands and artists.\n\n==Discography overview==\nNote: engineered (e), mixed (m), co-produced (cp), produced (p)\n\n'''[[Elvis Costello]]''': e-m-cp-p\n\nalbums:\n* ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (remixes)\n* ''[[This Year's Model|This Years Model]]''\n* ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]''\n* ''[[Get Happy!!

'Oliver's Army' |publisher=Soundonsound.com |date= |accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref> is an English [[audio engineer|engineer]] and record producer.  B\u00e9chirian was a key player in the British [[new wave music|new wave]] scene of the late 1970s and early 1980s, best known for his work with [[Nick Lowe]], [[Paul Carrack]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Undertones]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[The Monkees]], the [[Flamin' Groovies]], and [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]].  He was also a member of the pseudonymous new wave group [[Blanket of Secrecy]], which issued one album in 1982.  More recently, B\u00e9chirian has worked with the [[Trashcan Sinatras]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].\n\n==Life and career==\nB\u00e9chirian was born and spent his early years in Calcutta, moving to England with his family at the age of 10.  His engineering career started at [[Eden Studios]], in London in the mid-1970s. The studio was based around an Ampex 4 track and a custom built desk based in part on EMI/BBC designs. B\u00e9chirian progressed to become assistant mastering engineer, using an early Scully lathe during the day, and spending the evenings in the studio with bands improving his engineering skills. Eden then moved to a much larger premises and built a brand new studio complex from the ground up. Being involved in the building of the facility, from wiring the studio to helping to build their custom desk, gained B\u00e9chirian a great insight into acoustic design and audio electronics. He even designed the studio's logo. Eden opened as a 16 track with Ampex MM1100, but made the rapid leap to 24 track recording, moving up to an Ampex MM1200 and Dolby A. It was one of the first few 24 track studios in London at that time.\n\n[[Stiff Records]] founder Dave Robinson sought out B\u00e9chirian and he began recording and mixing projects for the label's then fledgling artist roster.\n\nHe continued to develop his engineering talents at Eden as house engineer on an endless mixture of sessions ranging from solo artists to rock bands, big bands and orchestra. He worked as an assistant on sessions with some of the most successful producers and bands at the time, including [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Manfred Mann]], [[Moody Blues]], [[David Essex]], [[Georgie Fame]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Clover]] and many others.\n\nB\u00e9chirian had come to the attention of various A&R men, and also continued to work with a variety of Stiff artists. He was asked by Robinson to be involved with the production of [[Lene Lovich]]'s first album, which produced her first hit single, \"[[Lucky Number (song)|Lucky Number]]\". [[Malcolm McLaren]] brought the [[Sex Pistols]] into Eden to work on various drum and guitar tracking sessions, and around this time, Nick Lowe approached B\u00e9chirian to work on his solo project, which was to become ''[[Jesus of Cool]]''. As a result, he wanted B\u00e9chirian to act as his exclusive engineer on all his forthcoming projects, which led to working with [[Graham Parker]], [[Huey Lewis]] and [[Clover]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Rockpile]], and others.\n\n[[Seymour Stein]], founder of Sire Records, signed the [[The Undertones|Undertones]], asking B\u00e9chirian to take on production duties for the band's first album.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGaVCwAAQBAJ|title=Teenage Kicks: My Life as an Undertone|last=Bradley|first=Michael|date=2016-02-15|publisher=Music Sales Limited|isbn=9781783238521|language=en}}</ref> B\u00e9chirian ended up engineering and producing the band's first three albums. [[Jake Riviera]], who looked after Costello and Lowe, began representing B\u00e9chirian as manager.\n\nB\u00e9chirian continued to work with various bands and artists as engineer and producer. He produced (with Elvis Costello) and engineered Squeeze's hit album ''[[East Side Story (Squeeze album)|East Side Story]]'', and their American breakthrough hit single \"[[Tempted (Squeeze song)|Tempted]]\".\n\nAround that same time, he formed the band [[Blanket of Secrecy]]. Their first and only album was released in both the UK and the US, and garnered some attention as all the band members wrote and performed under pseudonyms (\"Tinker\", \"Tailor\" and \"Soldier\") and refused to be photographed. This led to speculation about the band members' identities\u2014as B\u00e9chirian was listed in the album's credits as a producer, it was posited that he may have been behind the group.  However, public and media interest in Blanket of Secrecy was short-lived after the album and associated singles failed to chart, and the group broke up.  The actual identities of the band members were not revealed for more than twenty years.\n\nB\u00e9chirian went on to build his own recording studio in London and formed Vinyltone Productions with Epic Records in New York, developing and releasing new artists. The next three years he divided his time between London and New York.  He later remastered Elvis Costello's first nine albums, and produced [[The Monkees]]' 1986 reunion album ''[[Pool It!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tapeop.com/interviews/90/roger-bechirian-bonus/|title=Roger Bechirian: Elvis Costello, Squeeze, Undertones|website=tapeop.com|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref>\n\nLooking for a new direction, B\u00e9chirian later formed Trick Management.  Amongst his clients are [[Tom McRae]] and [[Bell X1 (band)|Bell X1]].  Signing Bell X1 to Island Records, he produced the band's breakthrough hit album ''[[Flock (album)|Flock]]''.\n\nNow based in London, B\u00e9chirian engineers and produces, as well as being involved with the development and co-management of new bands and artists.\n\n==Discography overview==\nNote: engineered (e), mixed (m), co-produced (cp), produced (p)\n\n'''[[Elvis Costello]]''' (e-m-cp-p)\n\nalbums:\n* ''[[My Aim Is True]]'' (remixes)\n* ''[[This Year's Model|This Years Model]]''\n* ''[[Armed Forces (album)|Armed Forces]]''\n* ''[[Get Happy!!

The [[UNB Reds]] are the current champions for the 2018\u20132019 season. The [[Alberta Golden Bears]] have won the most championships with 16. The [[2020 U Sports University Cup|2020 championship tournament]] was cancelled after two semi-final games had been played due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=corona>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/usports/u-sports-hockey-championships-cancelled-due-covid-19-outbreak/|title=U Sports hockey championships cancelled due to COVID-19 outbreak|date=March 12, 2020|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]}}</ref>\n\nOriginally called the '''CIAU University Cup''' in 1962, with minor changes through the decades when Canada\u2019s national university sports organization changed its own name, the cup\u2019s name was changed on March 13, 2018, to honour [[David Johnston]], a few months after he served as [[Governor General of Canada]].<ref name=\"theglobeandmail.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/u-sports-mens-hockey-trophy-named-after-former-governor-general-david-johnston/article38280385/|title=U Sports men\u2019s hockey trophy named after former Governor-General David Johnston|publisher=|accessdate=March 13, 2018|via=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe trophy was presented to U Sports, then known as the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU), for presentation to a national champion starting with the 1962\u201363 season, by [[Queen's University, Kingston|Queen's University]] and the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].  These two schools, located in [[Kingston, Ontario]], had been the participants in the first organized interuniversity hockey game, played in Kingston in 1885.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://usports.ca/en/championships/hockey/m/history|title=History|website=U SPORTS|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}</ref> The cup is meant to recognize the overall contribution made to the game of hockey by outstanding university players.\n\nThe CIAU changed its name to Canadian Interuniversity Sport (renaming the trophy the CIS University Cup) in 2001, and in October 2016 to U Sports (renaming the trophy the U Sports University Cup).\n\nOn March 13, 2018, U Sports renamed the cup the '''David Johnston University Cup''' in honour of [[David Johnston]], former [[Governor General of Canada]].<ref name=\"theglobeandmail.com\"/>\n\nThe original University Cup is located at the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in [[Toronto]] and does not travel publicly. A replica was created with a less ornate cup in 2006. Between 2006 and 2015, the trophy has been modified after several repairs - the metal bowl is now of simpler design, and mounts more flush to the main wooden portion. The two handles that used to be attached to the bowl, and frequently broke off, were removed. An additional black wooden ring was added to the bottom of the trophy in order to incorporate more school shields, as an engraved metal shield, with diagonal stripes in the winning school's colours, is added to the trophy every year.\n\nWith the completion of the 2018\u201319 championship, 27 different teams have played in the national championship final (however [[Sir George Williams University]] merged with [[Loyola College (Montreal)|Loyola College]] in 1974 to create [[Concordia University]], so it could be described as 26 different teams). In all, 17 different teams have won the national championship.\n\nThe [[Alberta Golden Bears]] hold the record of 16 championship wins, as well as the record of 22 championship final appearances. The [[Toronto Varsity Blues]] hold the record of 5 consecutive championship trophy wins, from 1969 through 1973. In the last seven years from [[2013 CIS University Cup|2013]] through [[2019 U Sports University Cup|2019]], only the Alberta Golden Bears (3 wins) or the [[UNB Reds]] (4 wins) have won the championship. The winningest coach is [[Tom Watt]], who at the helm as the Toronto Varsity Blues won nine University Cup championships between 1966 and 1977. Second is current [[UNB Reds]] coach Gardiner MacDougall with seven UCup wins between 2007 and 2019, while [[Clare Drake]] is third behind the bench as the Alberta Golden Bears won six University Cup championships between 1964 and 1986.\n\n==Format==\nStarting in 1998, the CIS changed the format of the University Cup from a four team/single elimination weekend (the format used most recently, but not the only format used over the previous 30 years) to a six-team/two-pool tournament that would be hosted by a CIS member institution/team rather than in Toronto at Varsity Stadium. The host would automatically be included in the tournament leaving five spots for regional representatives. The three conference champions and OUA Queen's Cup Runner-up would automatically be included with the fifth spot as a rotating 'wild-card' team from a non-host conference.\n\nWith the [[2015 CIS University Cup|2015 University Cup]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], the U Sports championship expanded from six to eight teams and moved from a two-pool format to a single-elimination competition (quarter-finals, semifinals and final with a bronze medal game).\n\nThe eight teams competing include the four regional conference champions: [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association|Canada West]], [[Ontario University Athletics|OUA]] West, OUA East (where the three hockey teams from the [[Quebec Student Sport Federation|RSEQ]] compete) and [[Atlantic University Sport|AUS]]. The remaining four teams are: the host, the Canada West runner-up, the AUS runner-up and the OUA 3rd place finisher (Bronze medalist). The conference champions would be ranked 1-4 while the remaining teams would be ranked 5-8, all based on the pre-tournament Top 10 Ranking Poll.\n\n==Champions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\";

Between 2006 and 2015, the trophy has been modified after several repairs - the metal bowl is now of simpler design, and mounts more flush to the main wooden portion. The two handles that used to be attached to the bowl, and frequently broke off, were removed. An additional black wooden ring was added to the bottom of the trophy in order to incorporate more school shields, as an engraved metal shield, with diagonal stripes in the winning school's colours, is added to the trophy every year.\n\nWith the completion of the 2018\u201319 championship, 27 different teams have played in the national championship final (however [[Sir George Williams University]] merged with [[Loyola College (Montreal)|Loyola College]] in 1974 to create [[Concordia University]], so it could be described as 26 different teams). In all, 17 different teams have won the national championship.\n\nThe [[Alberta Golden Bears]] hold the record of 16 championship wins, as well as the record of 22 championship final appearances. The [[Toronto Varsity Blues]] hold the record of 5 consecutive championship trophy wins, from 1969 through 1973. In the last seven years from [[2013 CIS University Cup|2013]] through [[2019 U Sports University Cup|2019]], only the Alberta Golden Bears (3 wins) or the [[UNB Reds]] (4 wins) have won the championship. The winningest coach is [[Tom Watt]], who at the helm as the Toronto Varsity Blues won nine University Cup championships between 1966 and 1977. Second is current [[UNB Reds]] coach Gardiner MacDougall with seven UCup wins between 2007 and 2019, while [[Clare Drake]] is third behind the bench as the Alberta Golden Bears won six University Cup championships between 1964 and 1986.\n\n==Format==\nStarting in 1998, the CIS changed the format of the University Cup from a four team/single elimination weekend (the format used most recently, but not the only format used over the previous 30 years) to a six-team/two-pool tournament that would be hosted by a CIS member institution/team rather than in Toronto at Varsity Stadium. The host would automatically be included in the tournament leaving five spots for regional representatives. The three conference champions and OUA Queen's Cup Runner-up would automatically be included with the fifth spot as a rotating 'wild-card' team from a non-host conference.\n\nWith the [[2015 CIS University Cup|2015 University Cup]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], the U Sports championship expanded from six to eight teams and moved from a two-pool format to a single-elimination competition (quarter-finals, semifinals and final with a bronze medal game).\n\nThe eight teams competing include the four regional conference champions: [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association|Canada West]], [[Ontario University Athletics|OUA]] West, OUA East (where the three hockey teams from the [[Quebec Student Sport Federation|RSEQ]] compete) and [[Atlantic University Sport|AUS]]. The remaining four teams are: the host, the Canada West runner-up, the AUS runner-up and the OUA 3rd place finisher (Bronze medalist). The conference champions would be ranked 1-4 while the remaining teams would be ranked 5-8, all based on the pre-tournament Top 10 Ranking Poll.\n\n==Champions==\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"

Though that negative has never been located, it has been widely suspected that this version was produced and distributed by the [[Stasi]] or the [[KGB]] in order to arouse anti-semitism among Egyptian and Palestinians against the US backed Israel (and henceforth, support for the Soviet backed Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]).<ref name=\"Hull1973\">{{cite book|last=Hull|first=David Stewart |title=Film in the Third Reich; art and propaganda in Nazi Germany|url=https://archive.org/details/film3rdreichp00davi|url-access=registration|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1973|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Magill|first=Frank Northen |title=Magill's survey of cinema, foreign language films|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3GZZAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Salem Press|isbn=978-0-89356-247-2}}</ref><ref name=\"Berkeley1960\">{{cite book|author=University of California, Berkeley|title=Film quarterly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8UAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2011-12-19|year=1960|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> The copyright of the film is held by the government-owned [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation|F.W.

This was not because of the alleged copycat violence inspired by the film contemporaneously reported by the media, as commonly believed,{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} but because Kubrick had received death threats against his family.

At first, it was screened in theaters all over the United Kingdom and was a grossing hit. However, as time went by the film became unavailable for 11 years; it was said to cause mental and physical health issues all around the world. In addition, religious groups feared what would become of their relation with God if they watched the film. Eventually, the pseudo ban was lifted in 1991 because it was believed the film no longer had the gruesome impact it once did. <ref>https://bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/exorcist</ref>\n|}\n\n==United States==\n{{Main|List of films banned in the United States}}\n\n==Venezuela==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

However, as time went by the film became unavailable for 11 years; it was said to cause mental and physical health issues all around the world. In addition, religious groups feared what would become of their relation with God if they watched the film.
