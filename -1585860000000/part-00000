Occasionally termed ''neo-Orthodoxy'', his philosophy, together with that of [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], has had a considerable influence on the development of [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref name=Klugman>{{cite book |author=Eliyahu Meir Klugman |title=Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch: Architect of Judaism for the Modern World |publisher=Artscroll Mesorah |location=Brooklyn, NY |year=1996 |isbn=0-89906-632-1}}</ref>\n\nHirsch was rabbi in [[Oldenburg]], [[Emden]], and was subsequently appointed chief rabbi of [[Moravia]]. From 1851 until his death, Hirsch led the secessionist Orthodox community in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. He wrote a number of influential books, and for a number of years published the monthly journal ''Jeschurun'', in which he outlined his philosophy of Judaism. He was a vocal opponent of [[Reform Judaism]], and similarly opposed early forms of [[Conservative Judaism]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n== Early years and education ==\nHirsch was born in [[Hamburg]], which was then a part of Napoleonic [[First French Empire|France]]. His father, though a merchant, devoted much of his time to [[Torah]] studies; his grandfather, Mendel Frankfurter, was the founder of the [[Talmud Torah]] schools in Hamburg and unsalaried assistant rabbi of the neighboring congregation of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]; and his granduncle, L\u00f6b Frankfurter, was the author of several Hebrew works, including ''Harechasim le-Bik'ah'' (\u05d4\u05e8\u05db\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d1\u05e7\u05e2\u05d4), a [[Torah]] commentary. Hirsch was a pupil of ''[[hakham|Chacham]]'' [[Isaac Bernays]], and the [[Tanakh|Biblical]] and [[Talmud]]ical education which he received, combined with his teacher's influence, led him to determine not to become a merchant, as his parents had desired, but to choose the rabbinical vocation. In furtherance of this plan, he studied [[Talmud]] from 1828 to 1829 in [[Mannheim]] under Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]]. He then entered the [[University of Bonn]], where he studied at the same time as his future antagonist, [[Abraham Geiger]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n==Career==\n=== Oldenburg ===\nIn 1830, Hirsch was elected [[chief rabbi]] (''Landesrabbiner'') of the [[principality]] of [[Oldenburg]]. During this period, he wrote his ''Neunzehn Briefe \u00fcber Judenthum,'' (''[[Nineteen Letters]] on Judaism'') which were published, under the pseudonym of \"Ben Usiel\" (or \"Uziel\"), at Altona in 1836. This work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles because it was something new \u2014 a brilliant, intellectual presentation of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in classic German, and a fearless, uncompromising defense of all its institutions and ordinances.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1838, Hirsch published, as a necessary concomitant of the ''Letters'', his ''Horeb, oder Versuche \u00fcber Jissroel's Pflichten in der Zerstreuung'', which is a text-book on Judaism for educated Jewish youth. In fact, he wrote Horeb first, but his publishers doubted that a work defending traditional Judaism would find a market in those times, when reform was in vogue.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1839, he published ''Erste Mittheilungen aus Naphtali's Briefwechsel'', a polemical essay against the [[Reform Judaism|reforms in Judaism]] proposed by Geiger and the contributors to the latter's ''Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Theologie'' (such as [[Michael Creizenach]]); and in 1844, he published ''Zweite Mittheilungen aus einem Briefwechsel \u00fcber die Neueste J\u00fcdische Literatur'', also polemical in tendency and attacking [[Samuel Holdheim|Holdheim's]] ''Die Autonomie der Rabbinen'' (1843).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Emden ===\nHirsch remained in Oldenburg until 1841, when he was elected chief rabbi of the Hanoverian districts of [[Aurich]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], with his residence in [[Emden]]. During this five-year post, he was taken up almost completely by communal work, and had little time for writing. He did, however, found a secondary school with a curriculum featuring both [[Judaism|Jewish studies]] and a secular program, for the first time employing his motto ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' (\"The Torah is maximalized in partnership with worldly involvement\").<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1843, Hirsch applied for the post of [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[British Empire]]. Out of 13 candidates, mostly from Germany, he reached the short list of four: [[Nathan Marcus Adler]], Hirsch Hirschfeld, [[Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach]], and Hirsch.<ref name=Klugman/> Adler won the position on December 1, 1844. With 135 communities having one vote each, Adler received 121 votes, Hirschfeld 12, and Hirsch 2.<ref>{{cite news |author=Rosenberg, Stephen Gabriel | title= Samson Raphael Hirsch: The British connection |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Guest-Column-Samson-Raphael-Hirsch-The-British-connection |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=2008-06-12 | accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Nikolsburg ===\nIn 1846, Hirsch was called to the rabbinate of [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]] in [[Moravia]], and in 1847, he became chief rabbi of [[Moravia]] and Austrian Silesia. In Austria, he spent five years in the re-organization of the Jewish congregations and the instruction of numerous disciples; he was also, in his official capacity as chief rabbi, a member of the Moravian ''[[Landtag]]'', where he campaigned for more civil rights for Jews in Moravia.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn Moravia, Hirsch had a difficult time, on the one side receiving criticism from the Reform-minded, and on the other side from a deeply traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] element, which found some of his reforms too radical. Hirsch placed a much stronger emphasis on deep study of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], rather than just the [[Torah]] and selected Bible readings, in addition to [[Talmud]], as had been the custom of religious Jews up until then.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Frankfurt am Main ===\n[[Image:SamsonHirsch1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An 1868 illustration (despite the caption mentioning the \"Dr.\" title, Hirsch did not in fact have a doctorate).<ref name=Klugman/>]]\nIn 1851, he accepted a call as rabbi of an Orthodox separatist group in [[Frankfurt am Main]], a part of the Jewish community of which had otherwise largely accepted classical Reform Judaism. This group, known as the \"Israelite Religious Society\" (\"Israelitische Religions-Gesellschaft\", or IRG), became, under his administration, a great congregation, numbering about 500 families. Hirsch remained rabbi of this congregation for the rest of his life.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch organized the ''Realschule'' and the ''B\u00fcrgerschule'', in which thorough Jewish training was provided, along with those aspects of secular training deemed true according to the [[Torah]] (''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]''). He also founded and edited the monthly magazine ''Jeschurun'' (1855\u20131870; new series, 1882 et seq); most of the pages of the Jeschurun were filled by himself.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1876, [[Edward Lasker (politician)|Edward Lasker]] (a Jewish parliamentarian in the [[Prussian Landtag]]) introduced the \"Secession Bill\" (''Austrittsgesetz''), which would enable Jews to secede from a religious congregation without having to relinquish their religious status. The law was passed on July 28, 1876. Despite the new legislation, a conflict arose whether \"''Austritt''\" (secession) was required by [[halakha|Jewish law]]. Hirsch held this was mandatory, even though it involved a court appearance and visible disapproval of the Reform-dominated \"Main Community\" (''Grossgemeinde''). His contemporary [[Seligman Baer Bamberger|Isaac Dov Bamberger]], [[Rabbi]] of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], argued that as long as the ''Grossgemeinde'' made appropriate arrangements for the Orthodox element, secession was unnecessary. The schism caused a terrible rift and many hurt feelings, and its aftershocks could be felt until the ultimate destruction of the Frankfurt community by the Nazis.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Final years ===\nDuring the final years of his life, Hirsch put his efforts in the founding of the \"''Freie Vereinigung f\u00fcr die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums''\", an association of independent Jewish communities. During the 30 years after his death, this organization would be used as a model for the formation of the international Orthodox [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudas Yisrael]] movement. Hirsch had a great love for the [[Land of Israel]], which is apparent from his writings, but was opposed to the proto-[[Zionism|Zionist]] activities of [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nFrom reports of his family members, it seems likely that Hirsch contracted [[malaria]] while in Emden, which continued to plague him during the rest of life with febrile episodes.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch died in 1888 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and is buried there.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch's son [[:de:Mendel Hirsch|Mendel Hirsch]] {{in lang|de}} (1833\u20131900) was a scholar and writer; his granddaughter [[Rahel Hirsch]] (1870\u20131953) became the first female professor of medicine in [[Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Lindner, Petra | title=Rahel Hirsch | work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia | date=1 March 2009 | publisher=Jewish Women's Archive | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hirsch-rahel}}</ref>\n\n== Works==\n[[File:Samson Raphael Hirsch.

Hirsch\u2019s innovative and influential commentary on the Pentateuch (''Uebersetzung und Erkl\u00e4rung des Pentateuchs'', \"Translation and explanation of the Pentateuch\"), 5 volumes published 1867-78, has been \"hailed as a classic\" since the publication of the first volume, ''[[Book of Genesis|Bereshit]]''.\nAccording to Hirsch, the goal of the commentary was to expound the text by ascertaining the exact meaning of the words, their etymology, [[philology]], and origin, and, this achieved, \"to establish, on the basis of [[halakha|halakhic]] and [[aggada|aggadic]] interpretations, [[Hashkafah|the Jewish ''Weltanschauung]]''\".\n<ref>Simon Langer (1961).

See under [[#Oldenburg]] above.\nIt was written in the form of a fictional correspondence between a young rabbi / philosopher and a youthful intellectual.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Nineteen_Letters ''Nineteen Letters''] on [[sefaria]].org</ref> \nThe first letter, the intellectual's, outlines the challenges that [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] created for modern Jews, and questions the continued relevance of Judaism. The Rabbi responds in the subsequent letters, discussing, in a structured sequence, God, Man, and Jewish History; \nleading to a discussion of the ''Mitzvot'' and their classification (as employed in ''Horeb'').  \nThis work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles, and has been republished and translated several times;\nit is still influential, and often taught. <ref>See for example, [https://outorah.org/series/3115/ ''19 Letters''], lectures by Daniel Adler on outorah.org</ref>\n\n===Horeb===\n''Horeb'' (subtitled ''Versuche \u00fcber Jissroel's Pflichten in der Zerstreuung'', \u201cEssays on the Duties of the Jewish People in the Diaspora\u201d), published 1838, is Rabbi Hirsch's presentation of Jewish law and observances, with particular emphasis on their underlying ideas, capturing the \"unifying ideological threads\"; \nthese discussions are still regularly taught and referenced.<ref>See for example [http://www.sarahlipman.com/horeb \"Rav Hirsch Horeb Shiurim\"], Sarah Lipman</ref>\nIt is organized into six sections, according to Hirsch's classification of the commandments. \nAs for the ''Letters'', its historical background is the [[Haskalah|enlightenment]], and particularly the beginnings of [[Reform Judaism]], and it thus constituted an attempt \"to lead the young generation of Jewry back to the Divine law.\"<ref>Dayan [[Isidor Grunfeld]]. [https://web.stevens.edu/golem/llevine/rsrh/horebaphilosophy027897mbp.pdf ''Introduction to Horeb'']</ref>\nSee  also [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Themes in his work|below]].\nIn it Hirsch shows that the Torah's ''mitzvot'', are not mere \"ceremonies\", but \"duties\" of Israel. \nIt was then, to some extent, \"a necessary concomitant of the Letters\".\nIt was conceived, also, to deal with the practical observances of Judaism - providing summarised Halachot relevant to each sub-section.\n(The title is a reference to the the [[Ten Commandments|(Ten) Commandments]]; [[Mount Horeb]], {{bibleverse||Exodus|3:1|HE}}, is another name for [[Mount Sinai]].)\n\n===Commentary on the ''Siddur'' and Psalms===\nRabbi Hirsch left in manuscript at the time of his death a translation and explanation of the [[siddur|prayer-book]], which was subsequently published. \nHis commentary on [[Pirkei Avot]] here, has been republished separately. \nHis commentary on the book of [[Psalms]] (''Uebersetzung und Erkl\u00e4rung der Psalmen'', 1882) is still widely read; it underpins much of his ''siddur'' commentary.\n\n===Works of activism===\nWorks here (besides similar mentioned above) include:\n* Pamphlet: ''J\u00fcdische Anmerkungen zu den Bemerkungen eines Protestanten'' (anon.), Emden, 1841- response to a provocative and anti-Semitic pamphlet by an anonymous [[Protestant]]\n* Pamphlet: ''Die Religion im Bunde mit dem Fortschritt'' (anon.), Frankfurt am Main, 1854 - response to provocations from the side of the Reform-dominated \"Main Community\"\n* Pamphlets during the Secession Debate:\n** ''Das Princip der Gewissensfreiheit'' (The principle of freedom of conscience), 1874\n** ''Der Austritt aus der Gemeinde'' (Leaving the community), 1876\n* ''Ueber die Beziehungen des Talmuds zum Judenthum'' (On the Talmud's Relationships with Judaism), 1884  - a defense of [[Talmud]]ic literature against anti-Semitic slanders in Russia\n\n===Translations and collections===\nMost of Hirsch's writings have been translated into English and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] by his descendants, starting with \"Horeb\" in the 1950s (by Dayan [[Isidor Grunfeld]] of London) and his [[Torah]] commentary in the 1960s (by his grandson Isaac Levi, also of London). Horeb was translated into Hebrew already in 1892.<ref>[https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/41649 Hebrew translation] @ hebrewbooks.org</ref>\n\nThe publication, in several volumes, of his collected writings (''Gesammelte Schriften'' or ''Nachalath Zwi'') was begun in 1902.<ref name=Klugman/> The bulk of these, that had previously been published in German in 1902-1912 under the title ''Nachalath Zwi'', were translated between 1984 and 2012 by the \"Rabbi Dr. [[Joseph Breuer]]  [https://www.rabbibreuerfoundation.org Foundation]\" (established to perpetuate the memory of Breuer, Hirsch's grandson, via publication of Hirsch's (and Breur's) writings).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n== Themes in his work ==\nHirsch lived in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, an epoch when Jews had been granted civil rights in a large number of European countries, leading to a call for [[Reform Judaism|reform]]. A large segment of his work focuses on the possibilities for [[Orthodox Judaism]] in such an era, when [[freedom of religion]] also meant the freedom to practice [[Torah]] precepts without persecution and ridicule.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nThe principle of \"''Austritt''\", an independent [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], flows naturally from his view on the place of [[Judaism]] in his epoch: If Judaism is to gain from these civil liberties, it has to be able to develop independently \u2014 without having to lend implicit or explicit approval to [[reform Judaism|efforts at reformation]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHis other major work involves the [[symbol]]ic meaning of many [[Torah]] commandments and passages. Indeed, his work \"Horeb\" (1837) focuses to a large degree on the possible meanings and symbols in religious precepts. This work was continued in his [[Torah]] commentary and his articles in the Jeschurun journal (''Collected Writings'', vol. III, is a collation of these articles).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nA final area of his work, which has only recently been re-discovered, was his etymological analysis of the [[Hebrew language]]. Most of this work is contained in his [[Torah]] commentary, where he analyses and compares the ''shorashim'' (three-letter root forms) of a large number of Hebrew words and develops an etymological system of the Hebrew language. This approach is based on the idea that letters that share a phonetic similarity, have similar meaning. For example, the words Zohar (light), Tzohar (translucent window), and Tahor (purity) are related words because the letters Zayin, Tzadie, and Tet are phonetically similar. This is an approach used in many places by the renowned biblical commentator Rashi as well. Although this effort was, in his own words, \"totally unscientific\", it has led to the recent publication of an \"etymological dictionary of the Hebrew language\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Hirsch, Samson Raphael |author2=Matityahu Clark |title=Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: Based on the Commentaries of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch |publisher=Feldheim |location=Jerusalem, New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=1-58330-431-2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Hirsch does not mention his influences (apart from traditional Jewish sources), later authors have identified ideas from the [[Kuzari]] ([[Yehuda Halevi]]), [[Nahmanides]], and the [[Maharal of Prague]] in his works. Nevertheless, most of his ideas are original.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn a 1995 edition of Hirsch' Nineteen Letters, commentator Rabbi Joseph Elias makes an extensive effort to show Hirsch' sources in [[Rabbinic literature]], parallels in his other works and those of other post-Talmudic Jewish thinkers. Elias also attempts to refute particular interpretations of his philosophy, such as the notion that much of his thinking was rooted in [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] secular philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Joseph P. Elias |author2=Hirsch, Samson Raphael |title=The nineteen letters |publisher=Feldheim Publishers |location=Jerusalem |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-87306-696-0}}</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement was not founded during his lifetime, it is clear from his responses to Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]], and in several places in his commentary to the Bible and Siddur, that although he had a deep love for the Land of Israel, he opposed a movement to wrest political independence for the Land of Israel before the Messianic Era.<ref name=Klugman/> In later works, he makes it clear that Jewish sovereignty is dependent only on Divine Providence.<ref>{{cite book | author=Samson Raphael Hirsch | title=Siddur | publisher=Feldheim | year=1969 | pages=703}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and controversy ==\n{{Refimprove section| date=June 2008}}\n{{further2|[[Torah im Derech Eretz#Interpretation|Torah im Derech Eretz]].}}\nThere is considerable controversy over Hirsch's legacy; this is a matter of debate amongst three parties: [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (sometimes called Ultra-Orthodox), [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]], and Hirsch's descendants. While it is undisputed that his ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' was his real innovation, the exact implementation has been greatly debated.\n\nThose on Orthodoxy's right wing hold that Hirsch himself approved of secular studies as a \"Horaas Sha'ah\", or temporary dispensation, only in order to save Orthodox Jewry of the nineteenth century from the threat posed by assimilation. While a ''[[yeshiva]]'' student in Eastern Europe, Rabbi Shimon Schwab obtained the opinions of various [[Poskim]] (authorities in Jewish law) to this effect (see Selected Writings, \"These and Those\", where Schwab himself disagrees).\n\nAt the other end of the Orthodox continuum, some Modern Orthodox Jews understand Hirsch in the sense of [[Torah Umadda]], meaning a synthesis of Torah knowledge and secular knowledge - each for its own sake (this view is propagated in several articles in ''Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought'', published by the Rabbinical Council of America). In this view, Hirsch thought that it was permissible, and even productive, for Jews to learn Gentile philosophy, music, art, literature, and ethics for their own sake.\n\nIn contrast, a third middle opinion held by Hirsch's descendants (his son-in-law and successor Rabbi [[Solomon Breuer]], his grandson Rabbi [[Joseph Breuer]], and the latter's successor Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]]), Rabbi Joseph Elias, in his commentary to ''The Nineteen Letters'' (Feldheim 1995), and some Jewish historians say that both of these understandings of Hirsch's philosophy are misguided; they refer to these readings of Hirsch as improper historical revisionism. In response to the \"temporary dispensation\" theory, they point to Hirsch in Collected Writings as continually stressing the philosophical and religious imperative of Torah im Derech Eretz for all times. (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"Torah im Derech Eretz ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (Gesammelte Schriften vi p.&nbsp;221); see further Rabbi Shimon Schwab in Selected Writings - \"These and Those\".) In response to the \"[[Torah Umadda]]\" theory, they say that Hirschian philosophy demands the domination of Torah over secular knowledge, not a separate synthesis. On this basis, many adherents of Hirsch's philosophy have preferred the natural sciences over the humanities as a subject of secular study, seemingly because they are easier to judge through the prism of Torah thought than the more abstract humanities.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Nineteen Letters'', Translated by Karin Paritzky, annotated by Rabbi Joseph Elias.

Occasionally termed ''neo-Orthodoxy'', his philosophy, together with that of [[Azriel Hildesheimer]], has had a considerable influence on the development of [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref name=Klugman>{{cite book |author=Eliyahu Meir Klugman |title=Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch: Architect of Judaism for the Modern World |publisher=Artscroll Mesorah |location=Brooklyn, NY |year=1996 |isbn=0-89906-632-1}}</ref>\n\nHirsch was rabbi in [[Oldenburg]], [[Emden]], and was subsequently appointed chief rabbi of [[Moravia]]. From 1851 until his death, Hirsch led the secessionist Orthodox community in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. He wrote a number of influential books, and for a number of years published the monthly journal ''Jeschurun'', in which he outlined his philosophy of Judaism. He was a vocal opponent of [[Reform Judaism]], and similarly opposed early forms of [[Conservative Judaism]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n== Early years and education ==\nHirsch was born in [[Hamburg]], which was then a part of Napoleonic [[First French Empire|France]]. His father, though a merchant, devoted much of his time to [[Torah]] studies; his grandfather, Mendel Frankfurter, was the founder of the [[Talmud Torah]] schools in Hamburg and unsalaried assistant rabbi of the neighboring congregation of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]]; and his granduncle, L\u00f6b Frankfurter, was the author of several Hebrew works, including ''Harechasim le-Bik'ah'' (\u05d4\u05e8\u05db\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d1\u05e7\u05e2\u05d4), a [[Torah]] commentary. Hirsch was a pupil of ''[[hakham|Chacham]]'' [[Isaac Bernays]], and the [[Tanakh|Biblical]] and [[Talmud]]ical education which he received, combined with his teacher's influence, led him to determine not to become a merchant, as his parents had desired, but to choose the rabbinical vocation. In furtherance of this plan, he studied [[Talmud]] from 1828 to 1829 in [[Mannheim]] under Rabbi [[Jacob Ettlinger]]. He then entered the [[University of Bonn]], where he studied at the same time as his future antagonist, [[Abraham Geiger]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n==Career==\n=== Oldenburg ===\nIn 1830, Hirsch was elected [[chief rabbi]] (''Landesrabbiner'') of the [[principality]] of [[Oldenburg]]. During this period, he wrote his ''Neunzehn Briefe \u00fcber Judenthum,'' (''[[Nineteen Letters]] on Judaism'') which were published, under the pseudonym of \"Ben Usiel\" (or \"Uziel\"), at Altona in 1836. This work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles because it was something new \u2014 a brilliant, intellectual presentation of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in classic German, and a fearless, uncompromising defense of all its institutions and ordinances.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1838, Hirsch published, as a necessary concomitant of the ''Letters'', his ''Horeb, oder Versuche \u00fcber Jissroel's Pflichten in der Zerstreuung'', which is a text-book on Judaism for educated Jewish youth. In fact, he wrote Horeb first, but his publishers doubted that a work defending traditional Judaism would find a market in those times, when reform was in vogue.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1839, he published ''Erste Mittheilungen aus Naphtali's Briefwechsel'', a polemical essay against the [[Reform Judaism|reforms in Judaism]] proposed by Geiger and the contributors to the latter's ''Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Theologie'' (such as [[Michael Creizenach]]); and in 1844, he published ''Zweite Mittheilungen aus einem Briefwechsel \u00fcber die Neueste J\u00fcdische Literatur'', also polemical in tendency and attacking [[Samuel Holdheim|Holdheim's]] ''Die Autonomie der Rabbinen'' (1843).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Emden ===\nHirsch remained in Oldenburg until 1841, when he was elected chief rabbi of the Hanoverian districts of [[Aurich]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], with his residence in [[Emden]]. During this five-year post, he was taken up almost completely by communal work, and had little time for writing. He did, however, found a secondary school with a curriculum featuring both [[Judaism|Jewish studies]] and a secular program, for the first time employing his motto ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' (\"The Torah is maximalized in partnership with worldly involvement\").<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1843, Hirsch applied for the post of [[Chief Rabbi]] of the [[British Empire]]. Out of 13 candidates, mostly from Germany, he reached the short list of four: [[Nathan Marcus Adler]], Hirsch Hirschfeld, [[Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach]], and Hirsch.<ref name=Klugman/> Adler won the position on December 1, 1844. With 135 communities having one vote each, Adler received 121 votes, Hirschfeld 12, and Hirsch 2.<ref>{{cite news |author=Rosenberg, Stephen Gabriel | title= Samson Raphael Hirsch: The British connection |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Guest-Column-Samson-Raphael-Hirsch-The-British-connection |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=2008-06-12 | accessdate=2018-04-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Nikolsburg ===\nIn 1846, Hirsch was called to the rabbinate of [[Mikulov|Nikolsburg]] in [[Moravia]], and in 1847, he became chief rabbi of [[Moravia]] and Austrian Silesia. In Austria, he spent five years in the re-organization of the Jewish congregations and the instruction of numerous disciples; he was also, in his official capacity as chief rabbi, a member of the Moravian ''[[Landtag]]'', where he campaigned for more civil rights for Jews in Moravia.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn Moravia, Hirsch had a difficult time, on the one side receiving criticism from the Reform-minded, and on the other side from a deeply traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] element, which found some of his reforms too radical. Hirsch placed a much stronger emphasis on deep study of the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], rather than just the [[Torah]] and selected Bible readings, in addition to [[Talmud]], as had been the custom of religious Jews up until then.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Frankfurt am Main ===\n[[Image:SamsonHirsch1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An 1868 illustration (despite the caption mentioning the \"Dr.\" title, Hirsch did not in fact have a doctorate).<ref name=Klugman/>]]\nIn 1851, he accepted a call as rabbi of an Orthodox separatist group in [[Frankfurt am Main]], a part of the Jewish community of which had otherwise largely accepted classical Reform Judaism. This group, known as the \"Israelite Religious Society\" (\"Israelitische Religions-Gesellschaft\", or IRG), became, under his administration, a great congregation, numbering about 500 families. Hirsch remained rabbi of this congregation for the rest of his life.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch organized the ''Realschule'' and the ''B\u00fcrgerschule'', in which thorough Jewish training was provided, along with those aspects of secular training deemed true according to the [[Torah]] (''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]''). He also founded and edited the monthly magazine ''Jeschurun'' (1855\u20131870; new series, 1882 et seq); most of the pages of the Jeschurun were filled by himself.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn 1876, [[Edward Lasker (politician)|Edward Lasker]] (a Jewish parliamentarian in the [[Prussian Landtag]]) introduced the \"Secession Bill\" (''Austrittsgesetz''), which would enable Jews to secede from a religious congregation without having to relinquish their religious status. The law was passed on July 28, 1876. Despite the new legislation, a conflict arose whether \"''Austritt''\" (secession) was required by [[halakha|Jewish law]]. Hirsch held this was mandatory, even though it involved a court appearance and visible disapproval of the Reform-dominated \"Main Community\" (''Grossgemeinde''). His contemporary [[Seligman Baer Bamberger|Isaac Dov Bamberger]], [[Rabbi]] of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], argued that as long as the ''Grossgemeinde'' made appropriate arrangements for the Orthodox element, secession was unnecessary. The schism caused a terrible rift and many hurt feelings, and its aftershocks could be felt until the ultimate destruction of the Frankfurt community by the Nazis.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n=== Final years ===\nDuring the final years of his life, Hirsch put his efforts in the founding of the \"''Freie Vereinigung f\u00fcr die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums''\", an association of independent Jewish communities. During the 30 years after his death, this organization would be used as a model for the formation of the international Orthodox [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudas Yisrael]] movement. Hirsch had a great love for the [[Land of Israel]], which is apparent from his writings, but was opposed to the proto-[[Zionism|Zionist]] activities of [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nFrom reports of his family members, it seems likely that Hirsch contracted [[malaria]] while in Emden, which continued to plague him during the rest of life with febrile episodes.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch died in 1888 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and is buried there.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHirsch's son [[:de:Mendel Hirsch|Mendel Hirsch]] {{in lang|de}} (1833\u20131900) was a scholar and writer; his granddaughter [[Rahel Hirsch]] (1870\u20131953) became the first female professor of medicine in [[Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Lindner, Petra | title=Rahel Hirsch | work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia | date=1 March 2009 | publisher=Jewish Women's Archive | accessdate=December 5, 2011 | url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/hirsch-rahel}}</ref>\n\n== Works==\n[[File:Samson Raphael Hirsch.

Hirsch\u2019s innovative and influential commentary on the Pentateuch (''Uebersetzung und Erkl\u00e4rung des Pentateuchs'', \"Translation and explanation of the Pentateuch\"), 5 volumes published 1867-78, has been \"hailed as a classic\" since the publication of the first volume, ''[[Book of Genesis|Bereshit]]''.\nAccording to Hirsch, the goal of the commentary was to expound the text by ascertaining the exact meaning of the words, their etymology, [[philology]], and origin, and, this achieved, \"to establish, on the basis of [[halakha|halakhic]] and [[aggada|aggadic]] interpretations, [[Hashkafah|the Jewish ''Weltanschauung]]''\".\n<ref>Simon Langer (1961).

See under [[#Oldenburg]] above.\nIt was written in the form of a fictional correspondence between a young rabbi / philosopher and a youthful intellectual.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Nineteen_Letters ''Nineteen Letters''] on [[sefaria]].org</ref> \nThe first letter, the intellectual's, outlines the challenges that [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] created for modern Jews, and questions the continued relevance of Judaism. The Rabbi responds in the subsequent letters, discussing, in a structured sequence, God, Man, and Jewish History; \nleading to a discussion of the ''Mitzvot'' and their classification (as employed in ''Horeb'').  \nThis work made a profound impression in German Jewish circles, and has been republished and translated several times;\nit is still influential, and often taught. <ref>See for example, [https://outorah.org/series/3115/ ''19 Letters''], lectures by Daniel Adler on outorah.org</ref>\n\n===Horeb===\n''Horeb'' (subtitled ''Versuche \u00fcber Jissroel's Pflichten in der Zerstreuung'', \u201cEssays on the Duties of the Jewish People in the Diaspora\u201d), published 1838, is Rabbi Hirsch's presentation of Jewish law and observances, with particular emphasis on their underlying ideas, capturing the \"unifying ideological threads\"; \nthese discussions are still regularly taught and referenced.<ref>See for example [http://www.sarahlipman.com/horeb \"Rav Hirsch Horeb Shiurim\"], Sarah Lipman</ref>\nIt is organized into six sections, according to Hirsch's classification of the commandments. \nAs for the ''Letters'', its historical background is the [[Haskalah|enlightenment]], and particularly the beginnings of [[Reform Judaism]], and it thus constituted an attempt \"to lead the young generation of Jewry back to the Divine law.\"<ref>Dayan [[Isidor Grunfeld]]. [https://web.stevens.edu/golem/llevine/rsrh/horebaphilosophy027897mbp.pdf ''Introduction to Horeb'']</ref>\nSee  also [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Themes in his work|below]].\nIn it Hirsch shows that the Torah's ''mitzvot'', are not mere \"ceremonies\", but \"duties\" of Israel. \nIt was then, to some extent, \"a necessary concomitant of the Letters\".\nIt was conceived, also, to deal with the practical observances of Judaism - providing summarised Halachot relevant to each sub-section.\n(The title is a reference to the the [[Ten Commandments|(Ten) Commandments]]; [[Mount Horeb]], {{bibleverse||Exodus|3:1|HE}}, is another name for [[Mount Sinai]].)\n\n===Commentary on the ''Siddur'' and Psalms===\nHe left in manuscript at the time of his death a translation and explanation of the [[siddur|prayer-book]], which was subsequently published. \nHis commentary on [[Pirkei Avot]] has been republished separately. \nHis commentary on the book of [[Psalms]] (''Uebersetzung und Erkl\u00e4rung der Psalmen'', 1882) is still widely read; it underpins much of his ''siddur'' commentary.\n\n===Works of activism===\nWorks here (besides similar mentioned above) include:\n* Pamphlet: ''J\u00fcdische Anmerkungen zu den Bemerkungen eines Protestanten'' (anon.), Emden, 1841- response to a provocative and anti-Semitic pamphlet by an anonymous [[Protestant]]\n* Pamphlet: ''Die Religion im Bunde mit dem Fortschritt'' (anon.), Frankfurt am Main, 1854 - response to provocations from the side of the Reform-dominated \"Main Community\"\n* Pamphlets during the Secession Debate:\n** ''Das Princip der Gewissensfreiheit'' (The principle of freedom of conscience), 1874\n** ''Der Austritt aus der Gemeinde'' (Leaving the community), 1876\n* ''Ueber die Beziehungen des Talmuds zum Judenthum'' (On the Talmud's Relationships with Judaism), 1884  - a defense of [[Talmud]]ic literature against anti-Semitic slanders in Russia\n\n===Translations and collections===\nMost of Hirsch's writings have been translated into English and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] by his descendants, starting with \"Horeb\" in the 1950s (by Dayan [[Isidor Grunfeld]] of London) and his [[Torah]] commentary in the 1960s (by his grandson Isaac Levi, also of London). Horeb was translated into Hebrew already in 1892.<ref>[https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/41649 Hebrew translation] @ hebrewbooks.org</ref>\n\nThe publication, in several volumes, of his collected writings (''Gesammelte Schriften'' or ''Nachalath Zwi'') was begun in 1902.<ref name=Klugman/> The bulk of these, that had previously been published in German in 1902-1912 under the title ''Nachalath Zwi'', were translated between 1984 and 2012 by the \"Rabbi Dr. [[Joseph Breuer]]  [https://www.rabbibreuerfoundation.org Foundation]\" (established to perpetuate the memory of Breuer, Hirsch's grandson, via publication of Hirsch's (and Breur's) writings).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\n== Themes in his work ==\nHirsch lived in the post-[[Napoleon]]ic era, an epoch when Jews had been granted civil rights in a large number of European countries, leading to a call for [[Reform Judaism|reform]]. A large segment of his work focuses on the possibilities for [[Orthodox Judaism]] in such an era, when [[freedom of religion]] also meant the freedom to practice [[Torah]] precepts without persecution and ridicule.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nThe principle of \"''Austritt''\", an independent [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], flows naturally from his view on the place of [[Judaism]] in his epoch: If Judaism is to gain from these civil liberties, it has to be able to develop independently \u2014 without having to lend implicit or explicit approval to [[reform Judaism|efforts at reformation]].<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nHis other major work involves the [[symbol]]ic meaning of many [[Torah]] commandments and passages. Indeed, his work \"Horeb\" (1837) focuses to a large degree on the possible meanings and symbols in religious precepts. This work was continued in his [[Torah]] commentary and his articles in the Jeschurun journal (''Collected Writings'', vol. III, is a collation of these articles).<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nA final area of his work, which has only recently been re-discovered, was his etymological analysis of the [[Hebrew language]]. Most of this work is contained in his [[Torah]] commentary, where he analyses and compares the ''shorashim'' (three-letter root forms) of a large number of Hebrew words and develops an etymological system of the Hebrew language. This approach is based on the idea that letters that share a phonetic similarity, have similar meaning. For example, the words Zohar (light), Tzohar (translucent window), and Tahor (purity) are related words because the letters Zayin, Tzadie, and Tet are phonetically similar. This is an approach used in many places by the renowned biblical commentator Rashi as well. Although this effort was, in his own words, \"totally unscientific\", it has led to the recent publication of an \"etymological dictionary of the Hebrew language\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Hirsch, Samson Raphael |author2=Matityahu Clark |title=Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew: Based on the Commentaries of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch |publisher=Feldheim |location=Jerusalem, New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=1-58330-431-2}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Hirsch does not mention his influences (apart from traditional Jewish sources), later authors have identified ideas from the [[Kuzari]] ([[Yehuda Halevi]]), [[Nahmanides]], and the [[Maharal of Prague]] in his works. Nevertheless, most of his ideas are original.<ref name=Klugman/>\n\nIn a 1995 edition of Hirsch' Nineteen Letters, commentator Rabbi Joseph Elias makes an extensive effort to show Hirsch' sources in [[Rabbinic literature]], parallels in his other works and those of other post-Talmudic Jewish thinkers. Elias also attempts to refute particular interpretations of his philosophy, such as the notion that much of his thinking was rooted in [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] secular philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Joseph P. Elias |author2=Hirsch, Samson Raphael |title=The nineteen letters |publisher=Feldheim Publishers |location=Jerusalem |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-87306-696-0}}</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement was not founded during his lifetime, it is clear from his responses to Rabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]], and in several places in his commentary to the Bible and Siddur, that although he had a deep love for the Land of Israel, he opposed a movement to wrest political independence for the Land of Israel before the Messianic Era.<ref name=Klugman/> In later works, he makes it clear that Jewish sovereignty is dependent only on Divine Providence.<ref>{{cite book | author=Samson Raphael Hirsch | title=Siddur | publisher=Feldheim | year=1969 | pages=703}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and controversy ==\n{{Refimprove section| date=June 2008}}\n{{further2|[[Torah im Derech Eretz#Interpretation|Torah im Derech Eretz]].}}\nThere is considerable controversy over Hirsch's legacy; this is a matter of debate amongst three parties: [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (sometimes called Ultra-Orthodox), [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]], and Hirsch's descendants. While it is undisputed that his ''[[Torah im Derech Eretz]]'' was his real innovation, the exact implementation has been greatly debated.\n\nThose on Orthodoxy's right wing hold that Hirsch himself approved of secular studies as a \"Horaas Sha'ah\", or temporary dispensation, only in order to save Orthodox Jewry of the nineteenth century from the threat posed by assimilation. While a ''[[yeshiva]]'' student in Eastern Europe, Rabbi Shimon Schwab obtained the opinions of various [[Poskim]] (authorities in Jewish law) to this effect (see Selected Writings, \"These and Those\", where Schwab himself disagrees).\n\nAt the other end of the Orthodox continuum, some Modern Orthodox Jews understand Hirsch in the sense of [[Torah Umadda]], meaning a synthesis of Torah knowledge and secular knowledge - each for its own sake (this view is propagated in several articles in ''Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought'', published by the Rabbinical Council of America). In this view, Hirsch thought that it was permissible, and even productive, for Jews to learn Gentile philosophy, music, art, literature, and ethics for their own sake.\n\nIn contrast, a third middle opinion held by Hirsch's descendants (his son-in-law and successor Rabbi [[Solomon Breuer]], his grandson Rabbi [[Joseph Breuer]], and the latter's successor Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]]), Rabbi Joseph Elias, in his commentary to ''The Nineteen Letters'' (Feldheim 1995), and some Jewish historians say that both of these understandings of Hirsch's philosophy are misguided; they refer to these readings of Hirsch as improper historical revisionism. In response to the \"temporary dispensation\" theory, they point to Hirsch in Collected Writings as continually stressing the philosophical and religious imperative of Torah im Derech Eretz for all times. (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"Torah im Derech Eretz ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (Gesammelte Schriften vi p.&nbsp;221); see further Rabbi Shimon Schwab in Selected Writings - \"These and Those\".) In response to the \"[[Torah Umadda]]\" theory, they say that Hirschian philosophy demands the domination of Torah over secular knowledge, not a separate synthesis. On this basis, many adherents of Hirsch's philosophy have preferred the natural sciences over the humanities as a subject of secular study, seemingly because they are easier to judge through the prism of Torah thought than the more abstract humanities.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Nineteen Letters'', Translated by Karin Paritzky, annotated by Rabbi Joseph Elias.
