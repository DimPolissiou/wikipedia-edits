The album was supported by the singles \"[[Midnight (Jessie Ware song)|Midnight]]\", \"[[Selfish Love (song)|Selfish Love]]\" and \"[[Alone (Jessie Ware song)|Alone]]\".\n\n==Background==\nCommenting on the creation process, Ware elaborated that she \"really tried to rush this record\" because she wanted to finish the album before having her first baby in September 2016, and \"was being led by other people in the songwriting rooms, more than I was leading\" as she was pregnant when the album was being written. She further added: \"I was writing really shit music because I had this fear like, 'Must provide. Must make a hit for my unborn child' [...] I think I'd lost a bit of my identity, and it took my mate [[Benny Blanco]] to be like, 'This is really shit. I don't know what you're doing. Why are you not doing what you do?' It was such a relief, because I knew exactly what he meant.\"<ref name=\"fader\"/> Following her conversation with Blanco in December 2016, she decided to reconstruct the album and booked additional recordings sessions with musicians such as producer [[Starsmith]] and songwriter [[James Newman (musician)|James Newman]].<ref name=\"fader\"/>\n\nNext to Starmsith and Newman the singer collaborated with a variety of producers and songwriters on ''Glasshouse'', including [[Julia Michaels]], [[Francis and the Lights]], [[Cashmere Cat]], [[Benny Blanco]] and [[Ed Sheeran]].<ref name=\"fader\"/>  Ware cited [[Childish Gambino]]'s ''[[\"Awaken, My Love!\"|Awaken, My Love!]]'' (2016), and [[Solange Knowles|Solange]]'s ''[[A Seat at the Table]]'' (2016), and [[Christine and the Queens]]' ''[[Chaleur humaine]]'' (2014) as her major inspirations for the album, noting: \"They all have such strong identities, and I wanted that.

It's quite a personal record, which I didn't realize [when writing it]. I thought I was just writing songs, but it's become this record that's for my husband and my baby.

In the positive review he wrote that \"Ware's third album is packed with finely woven adult-pop ballads about lust, longing, commitment, and reassurance.\" He found that \"Though Ware co-wrote all the songs and is in full command from start to finish, the album has a stitched-together quality that starts to slowly unravel during the second half.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n''[[The A.V.

If it weren\u2019t executed so sincerely, the whole thing would fall flat. But Ware walks the tightwire, and the result is as thrilling, in its own quiet way, as anything she\u2019s produced.\"<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Michael Cragg, writing for ''[[The Observer]]'', described the release as \"solid ground\" and a \"pivotal release for Ware.\" He felt that while the singles released in advance of the album \"hinted at a more robust sound [...] it still feels a little too safe,\" though all song \"perfectly showcase Ware\u2019s crystalline vocals \u2013 you just wish she\u2019d step out of her comfort zone more often.\"<ref name=\"observer\"/> The same rating was given by ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]''{{'}}s Robin Murray, who wrote that ''Glasshouse'' \"promised to break the glass ceiling, but instead finds the singer treading lukewarm water [...] Too often, it fails to challenge itself.\"<ref name=\"clash\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Glasshouse'' debuted at number seven in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2017, with 8,448 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, as reported by ''[[Music Week]]''.<ref name=\"musicweek\">{{cite web|first=Ben|last=Homewood|url=http://www.musicweek.com/labels/read/top-of-the-pops-how-bbc-one-s-new-primetime-music-show-has-impacted-the-biz/070361|title=Top of the pops?: How BBC One's new primetime music show has impacted the biz|work=[[Music Week]]|date=3 November 2017|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref> The album became Ware's third consecutive top ten entry on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"musicweek\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline      = Standard version<ref>{{cite web|title=Glasshouse by Jessie Ware on Apple Music|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/glasshouse/id1277710839|website=[[iTunes Store]] (AU)|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n\n| total_length  = 46:19\n| all_writing   =\n| title1        = [[Midnight (Jessie Ware song)|Midnight]]\n| writer1       = {{hlist|[[Pop Wansel]]|Kiah Victoria|[[Jessie Ware]]|Bastian Langebaek|Jordan Thomas}}\n| extra1        = {{hlist|Langebaek|Wansel{{ref|a|[a]}}}}\n| length1       = 3:57\n| title2        = Thinking About You\n| writer2       = {{hlist|Ware|[[Kid Harpoon|Thomas Hull]]}}\n| extra2        = {{hlist|[[Kid Harpoon]]|Sammy Witte{{ref|b|[b]}}}}\n| length2       = 3:28\n| title3        = Stay Awake, Wait for Me\n| writer3       = {{hlist|Ware|[[Stint (producer)|Ajay Battacharya]]|[[Danny Parker (songwriter)|Danny Parker]]|[[Alexandra Govere]]}}\n| extra3        = {{hlist|[[Stint (producer)|Stint]]}}\n| length3       = 3:35\n| title4        = Your Domino\n| writer4       = {{hlist|Ware|Battacharya|Parker|Danny Schnair|Govere}}\n| extra4        = {{hlist|Stint}}\n| length4       = 3:47\n| title5        = [[Alone (Jessie Ware song)|Alone]]\n| writer5       = {{hlist|Ware|Sarah Aarons|Hull}}\n| extra5        = {{hlist|Kid Harpoon|Stint}}\n| length5       = 3:36\n| title6        = [[Selfish Love (song)|Selfish Love]]\n| writer6       = {{hlist|Ware|[[Ross Golan]]|[[Benny Blanco|Benjamin Levin]]|[[Cashmere Cat|Magnus August H\u00f8iberg]]|Nathan Perez|[[Ryan Tedder]]|[[Ammar Malik]]}}\n| extra6        = {{hlist|Happy Perez|[[Benny Blanco]]|[[Cashmere Cat]]}}\n| length6       = 3:57\n| title7        = First Time\n| writer7       = {{hlist|Ware|[[Starsmith|Finlay Dow-Smith]]|James Newman}}\n| extra7        = {{hlist|[[Starsmith]]}}\n| length7       = 4:05\n| title8        = Hearts\n| writer8       = {{hlist|Ware|[[Julia Michaels]]|Levin|[[Two Inch Punch|Benjamin Ash]]}}\n| extra8        = {{hlist|Blanco|[[Two Inch Punch]]}}\n| length8       = 3:33\n| title9        = Slow Me Down\n| writer9       = {{hlist|Ware|[[Nina Nesbitt]]|[[Fred Ball (producer)|Frederik Ball]]|[[Preston (singer)|Samuel Preston]]}}\n| extra9        = {{hlist|[[Fred Ball (producer)|Fred Ball]]}}\n| length9       = 3:24\n| title10       = Finish What We Started\n| writer10      = {{hlist|Ware|[[John Ryan (musician)|John Ryan]]|[[Jamie Scott]]|Julian Bunetta}}\n| extra10       = {{hlist|Ryan|Bunetta}}\n| length10      = 3:49\n| title11       = Last of the True Believers\n| note11        = featuring [[The Blue Nile|Paul Buchanan]]\n| writer11      = {{hlist|Ware|[[Liam Howe]]|Hugo White|Felix White}}\n| extra11       = {{hlist|H.

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin script was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Pala'wan script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" B1 Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha''') which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage: straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n====Pre-colonial and colonial usage====\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''suyat'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.

original script introduced by Spaniards. And the other one \" \u1734\" was introduced by Antoon Postma. \n\n=== Punctuation and spelling ===\nBaybayin writing makes use of only two punctuation marks (originally only one), the Philippine single ({{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}) (acting today as a comma, or verse splitter in poetry) and double punctuation ({{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}) (main punctuation, acting today as a period or end of paragraph), which are similar to single and double danda signs in other Brahmic scripts. These signs (which may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes) are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the [[Hanunoo alphabet|Hanun\u00f3o script]] block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch17.pdf#G26723|title=Chapter 17: Indonesia and Oceania, Philippine Scripts|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=March 2020}}</ref> Space separation of words was historically not used on traditional supports, but is common today.\n\n=== Example sentences ===\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170c\u170b\u1705\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u1708\u1704\u1714\u1703\u1703\u1702\u1708\u170f\u1700\u1708\u1714\u1735 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u170b\u1704\u1714 \u1709\u1703\u1711\u1712\u1708\u1711\u1713\u1708\u1714\u1736}}\n*: ''Yamang \u2018di nagkakaunawaan, ay mag-pakahinahon.''\n*: Remain calm in disagreements.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u1704\u1714\u1706\u1708\u1712\u170b\u1714 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u170a\u1712\u1707\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''Magtanim ay 'di bir\u00f2.''\n*: Planting is not a joke.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u170b\u1711\u170e\u1712\u1708\u1714 \u1703\u1712\u1706 \u1711\u1705\u1714\u1704\u1705\u1714 \u1710 \u1709\u1713\u170b\u1713\u1706\u1712 \u1700\u1705\u1714 \u170a\u1713\u1711\u1713\u1703\u1714 \u1703\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''M\u00e1mahalin kit\u00e1 hangg\u00e1ng sa pumut\u00ed ang buh\u00f3k ko.''\n*: I will love you until my hair turns white.\n\n=== Collation ===\n* In the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', the letters of Baybayin were collated (without any connection with other similar script, except sorting vowels before consonants) as:\n*: '''A, U/O, I/E;

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin script was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Pala'wan script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" B1 Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha''') which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage: straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n====Pre-colonial and colonial usage====\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''suyat'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010. The word used on the bills was \"Pilipino\" ({{Script|Tglg|\u1709\u1712\u170e\u1712\u1709\u1712\u1708\u1713}}).\n\nIt is also used in [[Philippine passport]]s, specifically the latest [[Biometric passport|e-passport]] edition issued 11 August 2009 onwards. The odd pages of pages 3\u201343 have \"{{Script|Tglg|\u1700\u1705\u1714 \u1703\u1706\u1713\u170f\u1712\u1707\u1708\u1714 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u1708\u1704\u1714\u1709\u1709\u1707\u1703\u1712\u170e \u1710 \u1701\u1710\u1705\u1714 \u170a\u170c\u1708\u1714}}\" (\"{{lang|tl|Ang katuwiran ay nagpapadakila sa isang bayan}}\"/\"Righteousness exalts a nation\") in reference to [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 14:34.\n\nBaybayin influence may also explain the preference for making [[Acronyms in the Philippines|acronyms]] from initial consonant-vowel pairs of the component words, rather than the more common use of just the first letter.\n\nA number of legislative bills have been proposed periodically aiming to promote the writing system, none of which have yet been passed into law.

These signs (which may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes) are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the [[Hanunoo alphabet|Hanun\u00f3o script]] block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch17.pdf#G26723|title=Chapter 17: Indonesia and Oceania, Philippine Scripts|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=March 2020}}</ref> Space separation of words was historically not used on traditional supports, but is common today.\n\n=== Example sentences ===\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170c\u170b\u1705\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u1708\u1704\u1714\u1703\u1703\u1702\u1708\u170f\u1700\u1708\u1714\u1735 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u170b\u1704\u1714 \u1709\u1703\u1711\u1712\u1708\u1711\u1713\u1708\u1714\u1736}}\n*: ''Yamang \u2018di nagkakaunawaan, ay mag-pakahinahon.''\n*: Remain calm in disagreements.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u1704\u1714\u1706\u1708\u1712\u170b\u1714 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u170a\u1712\u1707\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''Magtanim ay 'di bir\u00f2.''\n*: Planting is not a joke.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u170b\u1711\u170e\u1712\u1708\u1714 \u1703\u1712\u1706 \u1711\u1705\u1714\u1704\u1705\u1714 \u1710 \u1709\u1713\u170b\u1713\u1706\u1712 \u1700\u1705\u1714 \u170a\u1713\u1711\u1713\u1703\u1714 \u1703\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''M\u00e1mahalin kit\u00e1 hangg\u00e1ng sa pumut\u00ed ang buh\u00f3k ko.''\n*: I will love you until my hair turns white.\n\n=== Collation ===\n* In the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', the letters of Baybayin were collated (without any connection with other similar script, except sorting vowels before consonants) as:\n*: '''A, U/O, I/E;

{"title_page": "John Melvin (architect)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2014}}\n{{BLP sources|date=March 2013}}\n\n'''John Leonard Melvin''' (born 31 October 1935) is a British architect, town planner, and author. He is the former Chairman of the London Region of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA). His architectural work has been widely exhibited in the UK and abroad by the RIBA and the British Council. In 1993, the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]] honoured him with the Building of the Year Award. In 1995, he was named to a [[Sargant Fellowship]] at the [[British School at Rome]] to research the idea of memory in architecture.\n\n== Personal background ==\nMelvin was educated at [[Sutton Valence School]], the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]], and the Department of Town Planning, [[University College London]]. AA Dip. MRIBA, Dip. TP (UCL), MRITPI. He married Julia Rosalind (n\u00e9e Gandy).<ref>Julia Melvin: Sir James Colquhoun Irvine, St Andrew's Second Founder: Julia Melvin, Birlinn Ltd</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter earning a post-graduate diploma in town planning under Sir William Holford, Melvin worked for the London Borough of Islington as the senior architect-planner. At that time, Islington had one of the largest housing programmes in the country and one of the largest concentrations of listed buildings in London.\n\nIn 1970, he went into private practice, setting up John Melvin Architects and Town Planners. His most significant work has been in the field of social housing. The housing development in Penton Street 1977 (wide Survey of London) can be seen as a seminal work which won commendations from the Civic Trust and the DoE.<ref>Survey of London Volume 46: Penton Street and Chapel Market area. See also The Stones of Oxford, Conjectures on a Cockleshell. John Melvin. Papadakis 2011</ref> The design of the Penton Street flats attempted to link modern functionalism with the 19th century terraced houses of the two adjoining Conservation Areas. Signifiers of home, such as the railings, the door case with its fanlight and stone sills, became a hallmark of John Melvin's work.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn 1975 Melvin and [[Alison Smithson]] founded The Architects' Standing Committee for Planning Reform (ASCPR), a pressure group of professionals working in the built environment with the remit to free up excessive government control of city development.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[Andreas Papadakis]], director of the leading architectural publishing house, Academy Editions, promoted a series of symposia held at the Tate, the Royal Academy and the Royal Institution. Melvin served as chairman to these events, which had an international profile. As a guest of Papadakis, he edited the House of the Future edition of ''Architectural Design'', and wrote frequently for this magazine.\n\nPenton Street flats were followed by a similar development of housing at Blackstock Road (1981) in London N5.<ref>Buildings of England. London 4: North. Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner</ref> John Melvin's design here is a reflection of the later 19th century villa as found in Highbury.  This received awards from the RIBA and the Civic Trust.\n\nIn the 1980s, Melvin developed the conservation aspect of his practice with a series of large restoration projects: examples being the transformation of the Royal Agricultural Hall to be the Business Design Centre in [[Islington]] 1984\u201386{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, the Elizabethan house, Kilbees Farm at [[Windsor Forest]],{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Mercers' Place at Brook Green (1986), a residential building for the St Paul's Schools in Hammersmith and Barnes.<ref>London 3: North West. Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner</ref>\n\nThe developed housing and a doctor's group practice surgery at Essex Road and Mitchison Road, London N1, for the Mercers' Company.<ref>The Buildings Around Us: Thom Gorst.

Reaktion Books 2007</ref> Like his earlier housing schemes, this explored the possibility of reintroducing into modern architecture something of a terrace vernacular. Mercers House received the Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers Brickwork Award; the Brick Development Association Design Award; and the First Commendation from the Royal Fine Art Commission and Sunday Times Building of the Year Award 1993.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn 1995, Melvin was awarded the Sargant Fellowship at the British School at Rome to research the idea of memory in architecture.\n\nIn 1996, the practice moved to Oxfordshire, where in addition to his private client work Melvin received from [[Wadham College, Oxford]], the commission to restore the 18th century Holywell Music Room (2006). For this work of restoration he won an award from the Oxford Preservation Trust.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nMelvin was for many years a member of the Bishop of London's Diocesan Advisory Committee for the Care of Churches.  For over 10 years he was a member and then Chairman of the Fabric Advisory Committee of Guildford Cathedral.\n\nMelvin's work has been published in the architectural journals.

He is the former Chairman of the London Region of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA). His architectural work has been widely exhibited in the UK and abroad by the RIBA and the British Council. In 1993, the [[Royal Fine Art Commission]] honoured him with the Building of the Year Award. In 1995, he was named to a [[Sargant Fellowship]] at the [[British School at Rome]] to research the idea of memory in architecture.\n\n== Personal background ==\nMelvin was educated at [[Sutton Valence School]], the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]], and the Department of Town Planning, [[University College London]]. AA Dip. MRIBA, Dip. TP (UCL), MRITPI. He married Julia Rosalind (n\u00e9e Gandy).<ref>Julia Melvin: Sir James Colquhoun Irvine, St Andrew's Second Founder: Julia Melvin, Birlinn Ltd</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter earning a post-graduate diploma in town planning under Sir William Holford, Melvin worked for the London Borough of Islington as the senior architect-planner. At that time, Islington had one of the largest housing programmes in the country and one of the largest concentrations of listed buildings in London.\n\nIn 1970, he went into private practice, setting up John Melvin Architects and Town Planners. His most significant work has been in the field of social housing. The housing development in Penton Street 1977 (wide Survey of London) can be seen as a seminal work which won commendations from the Civic Trust and the DoE.<ref>Survey of London Volume 46: Penton Street and Chapel Market area. See also The Stones of Oxford, Conjectures on a Cockleshell. John Melvin. Papadakis 2011</ref> The design of the Penton Street flats attempted to link modern functionalism with the 19th century terraced houses of the two adjoining Conservation Areas. Signifiers of home, such as the railings, the door case with its fanlight and stone sills, became a hallmark of John Melvin's work.{{cn|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn 1975 Melvin and [[Alison Smithson]] founded The Architects' Standing Committee for Planning Reform (ASCPR), a pressure group of professionals working in the built environment with the remit to free up excessive government control of city development.{{cn|date=October 2014}}\n\nDuring the 1980s, [[Andreas Papadakis]], director of the leading architectural publishing house, Academy Editions, promoted a series of symposia held at the Tate, the Royal Academy and the Royal Institution. Melvin served as chairman to these events, which had an international profile. As a guest of Papadakis, he edited the House of the Future edition of ''Architectural Design'', and wrote frequently for this magazine.\n\nPenton Street flats were followed by a similar development of housing at Blackstock Road (1981) in London N5.<ref>Buildings of England. London 4: North. Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner</ref> John Melvin's design here is a reflection of the later 19th century villa as found in Highbury.  This received awards from the RIBA and the Civic Trust.\n\nIn the 1980s, Melvin developed the conservation aspect of his practice with a series of large restoration projects: examples being the transformation of the Royal Agricultural Hall to be the Business Design Centre in [[Islington]] 1984\u201386{{cn|date=October 2014}}, the Elizabethan house, Kilbees Farm at [[Windsor Forest]],{{cn|date=October 2014}} and Mercers' Place at Brook Green (1986), a residential building for the St Paul\u2019s Schools in Hammersmith and Barnes.<ref>London 3: North West.

Mercers House received the Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers Brickwork Award; the Brick Development Association Design Award; and the First Commendation from the Royal Fine Art Commission and Sunday Times Building of the Year Award 1993.{{cn|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn 1995, Melvin was awarded the Sargant Fellowship at the British School at Rome to research the idea of memory in architecture.\n\nIn 1996, the practice moved to Oxfordshire, where in addition to his private client work Melvin received from [[Wadham College, Oxford]], the commission to restore the 18th century Holywell Music Room (2006). For this work of restoration he won an award from the Oxford Preservation Trust.{{cn|date=October 2014}}\n\nMelvin was for many years a member of the Bishop of London's Diocesan Advisory Committee for the Care of Churches.  For over 10 years he was a member and then Chairman of the Fabric Advisory Committee of Guildford Cathedral.\n\nMelvin's work has been published in the architectural journals. His work has attracted praise from writers including Roger Scruton and Justin Cartwright,{{cn|date=October 2014}} both of whom wrote forewords in his books.\n\n== Appointments ==\nHe was Vice-President of the Architectural Association, of which he was a Council member for many years.

The hill station is surrounded by meadows and forests.  It is about {{convert|6500|ft|m|order=flip}} above sea level in the foothills of the [[Dhauladhar]] ranges of the Western [[Himalayas]] and peaks can be seen in the distance.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://hpchamba.nic.in/destkhajjiar.htm \n |title=Chamba Government official website \n |accessdate=2006-09-23 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716022137/http://hpchamba.nic.in/destkhajjiar.htm \n |archivedate=16 July 2006 \n}}</ref> It is part of the [[Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary]].\n\nKhajjiar can be reached from Dalhousie, the nearest major town and hill station, by bus in an hour or so. It has a rare combination of three [[ecosystem]]s: [[lake]], [[pasture]] and [[forest]].\n\n==Mini Switzerland==\n\nOn 7 July 1992, Swiss Envoy Willy P. Blazer, Vice Counselor and Head of Chancery of Switzerland in India brought Khajjiar on the world tourism map by calling it \"Mini Switzerland\". He also put a sign of a yellow Swiss hiking footpath showing Khajjiar's distance from the Swiss capital [[Berne]]: \"{{cvt|6194|km|mi|disp=x|\" or }}. Khajjiar is among the 160 locations in the world that bear topographical resemblance with [[Switzerland]]. The counselor also took from Khajjiar a stone which will form part of a stone collage around the Swiss Parliament to remind the visitors of Khajjiar as a \"Mini Switzerland of India\".<ref name=\"Himchal\" />\n\n==Accommodation==\n[[File:Khajjiar during august.jpg|thumb|400px|Khajjiar during August]]\n[[File:Khajjiar view 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Khajjiar view]]\nThere is a hotel and some cottages run by HP Tourism at Khajjiar where the tourists can stay. Besides that, there are two rest houses one each of P.W.D. and Forest Deptt. A couple of private hotels have also come up, which do not match the above places in terms of location and amenities.<ref name=Himchal/>\n\n==Travel==\nMost tourists travel to Khajjiar by private or rented vehicles. Bus service to and from Khajjiar is limited and timing changes according to local demands.<ref name=Himchal/>\n\n==Places of interest==\nThe best entertainment in Khajjiar is to walk around the lake or to go for long walks in the thick pine forests. In winter there is snow which can be up to {{cvt|3|ft|order=flip}} of height. Children enjoy this place because of the freedom of movement and the sloped terrain which permits them to roll down to the lake without getting hurt. Another attraction is horse riding. There is a huge Hanuman Statue and a park.<ref name=Himchal/>\n\n===Dauladhar mountains===\nDense deodars, pines and lush green meadows are characteristic of Khajjiar. Since Khajjiar is situated at the base of the Dauladhar mountains, the tourists here can get panoramic views of the mountains.\n\n===Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary===\n{{main|Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary}}\nThe Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary is a wildlife sanctuary which has a wide variety of flora and fauna. It is densely covered with Deodar and [[Fir]] forest.The place is a favorite spot for picnics and trekking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Himachal Tourism|url=http://himachaltourism.gov.in/nature_sanctuaries.php|website=himachaltourism.gov.in|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Khajjiar Lake===\n{{main|Khajjiar Lake}}\nKhajjiar Lake is a small lake, surrounded by saucer-shaped lush green meadow and a floating island. The dense growth of weed called [[Acorus calamus|vacha]] has made its earth spongy. Now the banks stand covered by a thick layer of earth, formed by the years of dust settling down on the weeds.\n\n===Khajji Nag temple===\nA little away from the lake is the temple of Khajji Nag belonging to the 12th century AD made by the king of chamba Prithvi Singh. The temple has a golden dome due to which it is also known as Golden Devi Temple. In the ''[[mandapa]]'' of the temple one can see the images of the Pandavas and the defeated Kaurvas hanging from the roof of the circumambulatory path. The sanctum of the temple has been beautifully carved from wood.<ref name=Himchal/> This temple is dedicated to snake ([[N\u0101ga]]) worship and there are some snake idols inside. The temple also has idols of [[Shiva]] and Goddess Hadimba.\n\n==Trekking==\nKhajjiar offers numerous trekking opportunities.

The hill station is surrounded by meadows and forests.  It is about {{convert|6500|ft|m|order=flip}} above sea level in the foothills of the [[Dhauladhar]] ranges of the Western [[Himalayas]] and peaks can be seen in the distance.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://hpchamba.nic.in/destkhajjiar.htm \n |title=Chamba Government official website \n |accessdate=2006-09-23 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716022137/http://hpchamba.nic.in/destkhajjiar.htm \n |archivedate=16 July 2006 \n}}</ref> It is part of the [[Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary]].\n\nKhajjiar can be reached from Dalhousie, the nearest major town and hill station, by bus in an hour or so. It has a rare combination of three [[ecosystem]]s: [[lake]], [[pasture]] and [[forest]].\n\n==Mini Switzerland==\n\nOn 7 July 1992, Swiss Envoy Willy P. Blazer, Vice Counselor and Head of Chancery of Switzerland in India brought Khajjiar on the world tourism map by calling it \"Mini Switzerland\". He also put a sign of a yellow Swiss hiking footpath showing Khajjiar's distance from the Swiss capital [[Berne]]: \"{{cvt|6194|km|mi|disp=x|\" or }}. Khajjiar is among the 160 locations in the world that bear topographical resemblance with [[Switzerland]]. The counselor also took from Khajjiar a stone which will form part of a stone collage around the Swiss Parliament to remind the visitors of Khajjiar as a \"Mini Switzerland of India\".<ref name=\"Himchal\" />\n\n==Accommodation==\n[[File:Khajjiar during august.jpg|thumb|400px|Khajjiar during August]]\n[[File:Khajjiar view 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Khajjiar view]]\nThere is a hotel and some cottages run by HP Tourism at Khajjiar where the tourists can stay. Besides that, there are two rest houses one each of P.W.D. and Forest Deptt. A couple of private hotels have also come up, which do not match the above places in terms of location and amenities.<ref name=Himchal/>\n\n==Travel==\nMost tourists travel to Khajjiar by private or rented vehicles. Bus service to and from Khajjiar is limited and timing changes according to local demands.<ref name=Himchal/>\n\n==Places of interest==\nThe best entertainment in Khajjiar is to walk around the lake or to go for long walks in the thick pine forests. In winter there is snow which can be up to {{cvt|3|ft|order=flip}} of height. Children enjoy this place because of the freedom of movement and the sloped terrain which permits them to roll down to the lake without getting hurt. Another attraction is horse riding. There is a huge Hanuman Statue and a park.<ref name=Himchal/>\n\n===Dauladhar mountains===\nDense deodars, pines and lush green meadows are characteristic of Khajjiar. Since Khajjiar is situated at the base of the Dauladhar mountains, the tourists here can get panoramic views of the mountains.\n\n===Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary===\n{{main|Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary}}\nThe Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary is a wildlife sanctuary which has a wide variety of flora and fauna. It is densely covered with Deodar and [[Fir]] forest.The place is a favorite spot for picnics and trekking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Himachal Tourism|url=http://himachaltourism.gov.in/nature_sanctuaries.php|website=himachaltourism.gov.in|accessdate=25 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Khajjiar Lake===\n{{main|Khajjiar Lake}}\nKhajjiar Lake is a small lake, surrounded by saucer-shaped lush green meadow and a floating island. The dense growth of weed called [[Acorus calamus|vacha]] has made its earth spongy. Now the banks stand covered by a thick layer of earth, formed by the years of dust settling down on the weeds.\n\n===Khajji Nag temple===\nA little away from the lake is the temple of Khajji Nag belonging to the 12th century AD made by the king of chamba Prithvi Singh. The temple has a golden dome due to which it is also known as Golden Devi Temple. In the ''[[mandapa]]'' of the temple one can see the images of the Pandavas and the defeated Kaurvas hanging from the roof of the circumambulatory path. The sanctum of the temple has been beautifully carved from wood.<ref name=Himchal/> This temple is dedicated to snake ([[N\u0101ga]]) worship and there are some snake idols inside. The temple also has idols of [[Shiva]] and Goddess Hadimba.\n\n==Trekking==\nKhajjiar offers numerous trekking opportunities. Khajjiar to Dainkund is a 3.5 kilometre easy to moderate trek. The trek starts 6 kilometres from Khajjiar on the Dalhousie-Khajjiar road and ends at Pholani Devi Temple at Dainkund.

It is an [[annual plant]] known for its [[Lens (geometry)|lens]]-shaped [[seed]]s. It is about {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, and the seeds grow in [[Legume|pods]], usually with two seeds in each. As a food crop, the majority of world production comes from Canada and India, producing 58% combined of the world total.\n\nIn [[cuisines of the Indian subcontinent]], where lentils are a [[staple food|staple]], split lentils (often with their hulls removed) known as [[dal|daal]] are often cooked into a thick [[curry]]/gravy that is usually eaten with [[rice]] or ''[[roti]]s''.\n\n== Background ==\n=== History ===\n\nThe cultivated lentil ''Lens culinaris'' was derived from its wild subspecies ''L. culinaris subsp. orientalis'', although other species may also have contributed some genes, according to Jonathan Sauer (''Historical Geography of Crop Plants'', 2017.)<ref name=\"Sauer\">{{cite book |last= Sauer |first=Jonathan D. |date= 2017|title= Historical Geography of Crop Plants: A Select Roster|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=moZHDwAAQBAJ |publisher= Routledge  |isbn= 9781351440622 |quote=The primary progenitor of the cultigen is evidently ''L. orientalis'' native to the Near East; the other species may have contributed some genetic diversity to the crop.

Among the different taxa of wild lentils, ''L. orientalis'' is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated lentil and is now generally classified as ''L. culinaris'' subsp. ''orientalis''. Therefore, the genus ''Lens'' comprises seven [[Taxon|taxa]] in six species:<ref name=\":2\" />\n* ''Lens culinaris'' subsp. ''culinaris'' (and ''L. culinaris'' subsp. ''orientalis'')\n* ''Lens odemensis''\n* ''Lens ervoides''\n* ''Lens nigricans''\n* ''Lens lamottei''\n* ''Lens tomentosus''\n\n== Botanical description ==\n[[File:Illustration_Lens_culinaris0.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the lentil plant, 1885|323x323px]]\n\nLentil is [[hypogeal]], which means the [[cotyledon]]s of the germinating seed stay in the ground and inside the seed coat. Therefore, it is less vulnerable to frost, wind erosion, or insect attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulseaus.com.au/growing-pulses/bmp/lentil/southern-guide#plant-physiology|title=Pulse Australia - Southern guide|website=pulseaus.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe plant is a diploid, annual, bushy herb of erect, semierect, or spreading and compact growth and normally varies from {{convert|30|to|50|cm}} in height. It has many hairy branches and its stem is slender and angular. The [[rachis]] bears 10 to 15 leaflets in five to eight pairs. The leaves are alternate, of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour. In general, the upper leaves are converted into [[tendrils]], whereas the lower leaves are mucronate. If  [[stipule]]s are present, they are small. The flowers, one to four in number, are small, white, pink, purple, pale purple, or pale blue in colour. They arise from the axils of the leaves, on a slender footstalk almost as long as the leaves. The pods are oblong, slightly inflated, and about {{convert|1.5|cm}} long. Normally, each of them contains two seeds, about {{convert|0.5|cm}} in diameter, in the characteristic lens shape. The seeds can also be mottled and speckled. The several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size, hairiness, and colour of the leaves, flowers, and seeds.\n\nLentils are [[self-pollinating]]. The flowering begins from the lowermost buds and gradually moves upward, so-called acropetal flowering. About two weeks are needed for all the flowers to open on the single branch. At the end of the second day and on the third day after the opening of the flowers, they close completely and the colour begins to fade. After three to four days, the setting of the pods takes place.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:Lentils_red_and_brown.jpg|thumb|Red and brown comparison]]\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}\n\nTypes can be classified according to their size, whether they are split or whole, or shelled or unshelled. Seed coats can range from light green to deep purple, as well as being tan, grey, brown, black or mottled. Shelled lentils show the colour of the cotyledon which can be yellow, orange, red, or green.\n\n'''Red-cotyledon types:'''\n* Nipper (Australia)\n* Northfield (Australia)\n* Cobber (Australia)\n* Digger (Australia)\n* Nugget (Australia)\n* Aldinga (Australia)\n* Masoor daal (unshelled lentils with a brown seed coat and an orange-red cotyledon)\n* Petite crimson(shelled Masoor lentils)\n* Red Chief (light tan seed coat and red cotyledon)\n\n'''Small green/brown-seed coat types:'''\n* Eston Green\n* Pardina (Spain)\n* Verdina (Spain)\n\n'''Medium green/brown-seed coat types'''\n* Avondale (USA)\n* Matilda (Australia)\n* Richlea\n\n'''Large green/brown-seed coat types:'''\n* Boomer (Australia)\n* Brewer's: a large brown lentil which is often considered the \"regular\" lentil in the United States<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thechalkboardmag.com/lentils-101-what-to-do-with-lentils-and-why-bother|title=What To Do With Lentils And Why Bother|date=2014-03-17|work=The Chalkboard|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* Castellana (Spanish)\n* Laird: the commercial standard for large green lentils in western Canada <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slinkard |first1=A.

In the [[temperate climate]]s lentils are planted in the winter and spring under low temperatures and vegetative growth occurs in later spring and the summer. Rainfall during this time is not limited. In the [[subtropics]], lentils are planted under relatively high temperatures at the end of the rainy season, and vegetative growth occurs on the residual soil moisture in the summer season. Rainfall during this time is limited. In [[Western Asia|West Asia]] and [[North Africa]], some lentils are planted as a winter crop before snowfall. Plant growth occurs during the time of snow melting. Under such cultivation, seed yields are often much higher.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Seedbed requirements and sowing ===\nThe lentil requires a firm, smooth [[seedbed]] with most of the previous [[crop residue]]s incorporated. For the seed placement and for later harvesting it is important that the surface is not uneven with large clods, stones, or protruding crop residue. It is also important that the soil is made friable and weed-free so that seeding could be done at a uniform depth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe plant densities for lentils vary between [[genotype]]s, seed size, planting time and growing conditions and also from region to region. In South Asia a seed rate of {{convert|30|to|40|kg/ha}} is recommended. In West Asian countries a higher seed rate is recommended and also leads to a higher yield. The seeds should be sown {{convert|3|to|4|cm}} deep.

After destoning, they may be sorted by a color sorter and then packaged.\n\nA major part of the world's red lentil production undergoes a secondary processing step. These lentils are [[Husk|dehulled]], split and polished. In the [[Indian subcontinent]], this process is called dhal milling.<ref name=\":0\" /> The moisture content of the lentils prior dehulling is crucial to guarantee a good dehulling efficiency.<ref name=\":0\" /> The hull of lentils usually accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the total seed weight, which is lower than most legumes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HUGHES|first=Joe S.|last2=Swanson|first2=Barry G.|year=1986|title=Microstructure of lentil seeds (Lens culinaris)|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1140&context=foodmicrostructure|journal=Food Structure|volume=5|pages=241\u2013246|via=digitalcommons.usu.edu}}</ref> Lentil flour can be produced by milling the seeds, like cereals.\n\n=== Culinary use ===\n[[File:Split_Red_Lentil.jpg|thumb|Split red lentils (size 6 mm)]]Lentils are consumed in many ways.

The most common preparation method is boiling.<ref name=\":0\" /> The seeds require a cooking time of 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the variety; shorter for small varieties with the husk removed, such as the common red lentil. Most varieties have a distinctive, earthy flavor. Lentils with husks remain whole with moderate cooking; lentils without husks tend to disintegrate into a thick pur\u00e9e, which leads to quite different dishes.

Lentil dishes are most widespread throughout [[South Asia]], the [[Mediterranean]] regions and [[West Asia]].[[File:Daal_after_Tadka_Pulse_Soup_India.jpg|thumb|[[Dal tadka]] (lentil soup)]]\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], lentil curry is part of the everyday diet, eaten with both rice and [[roti]]. Boiled lentils and lentil stock are used to thicken most vegetarian curries. They are also used as stuffing in [[dal]] [[paratha]]s and [[Puri (food)|puri]] for breakfast or snacks. Lentils are also used in many regional varieties of sweets. Lentil flour is used to prepare several different bread varieties, such as  [[papadum]].\n\nThey are frequently combined with [[rice]], which has a similar cooking time. A lentil and rice dish is referred to in Levantine countries as ''[[mujaddara]]'' or ''mejadra''. In Iran, rice and lentil is served with fried [[raisin]]; this dish is called ''adas polo''. Rice and lentils are also cooked together in ''[[khichdi]]'', a popular dish in the Indian subcontinent (India and Pakistan); a similar dish, ''[[kushari]]'', made in Egypt, is considered one of two [[national dish]]es.\n\nLentils are used to prepare an inexpensive and nutritious [[Lentil soup|soup]] all over Europe and [[Americas|North and South America]], sometimes combined with some form of [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] or [[pork]]. In western countries, cooked lentils are often used in salads.<ref name=\":0\" /> In Italy, the traditional dish for New Year's Eve is [[Cotechino]] served with lentils.\n\nLentils are commonly eaten in Ethiopia in a stew-like dish called ''kik'', or ''kik wot'', one of the dishes people eat with Ethiopia's national food, ''[[injera]]'' flatbread. Yellow lentils are used to make a non-spicy stew, which is one of the first solid foods Ethiopian women feed their babies.\n\nLentils were a chief part of the diet of ancient Iranians, who consumed lentils daily in the form of a stew poured over rice.\n\n=== Nutritional value ===\n\n==== Composition ====\n{{nutritionalvalue|name=Lentils, mature seeds, cooked, boiled, with salt)|kJ=477|water=69.64 g|protein=9.02 g|fat=0.38 g|carbs=19.54 g|sugars=1.8 g|fiber=7.9 g|calcium_mg=19|iron_mg=3.3|magnesium_mg=36|phosphorus_mg=180|potassium_mg=369|sodium_mg=238|zinc_mg=1.27|copper_mg=0.251|manganese_mg=0.494|selenium_ug=2.8|vitamin A_IU=8|vitC_mg=1.5|vitD_iu= 0|vitE_mg=0.11|vitK_ug=1.7|thiamin_mg=0.169|riboflavin_mg=0.073|niacin_mg=1.06|pantothenic_mg=0.638|vitB6_mg=0.178|folate_ug=181|vitB12_ug=0|note=[https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/175254/nutrients Link to Full USDA Database entry]}}\n\nAccording to the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]], 100 g of raw lentils (variety unspecified) provide 353 [[calories]]; the same weight of cooked lentils provides 116 calories.

Since the inception of The International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas ([[ICARDA]]) breeding programme in 1977 significant gains have been made. It supplies landraces and breeding lines for countries around the world, supplemented by other programmes in both developing (e.g. India) and developed (e.g. Australia and Canada) countries. In recent years, such collaborations among breeders and agronomists are becoming increasingly important.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe focus lies on high yielding and stable cultivars for diverse environments to match the demand of a growing population.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Jitendra|last2=Gupta|first2=Sunanda|last3=Gupta|first3=Priyanka|last4=Dubey|first4=Sonali|last5=Tomar|first5=Ram Sewak Singh|last6=Kumar|first6=Shiv|date=2016|title=Breeding strategies to improve lentil for diverse agro-ecological environments|journal= Indian Journal of Genetics and Plant Breeding |volume=76|issue=4|pages=530|doi=10.5958/0975-6906.2016.00071.7|issn=0019-5200}}</ref> In particular, progress in quantity and quality as well as in the resistance to disease and abiotic stresses are the major breeding aims.<ref name=\":2\" /> Several varieties have been developed applying [https://www.bats.ch/bats/publikationen/1995-1_TA/2-methods.php conventional breeding methodologies]. Serious genetic improvement for yield has been made, however, the full potential of production and productivity could not yet be tapped due to several biotic and abiotic stresses.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWild ''Lens'' species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop. The wild species possess many diverse traits including disease resistances and abiotic stress tolerances. The above-mentioned ''L. nigricans'' and ''L. orientalis'' possess morphological similarities to the cultivated ''L. culinaris''. But only ''L. culinaris'' and ''L. culinaris'' subsp. orientalis are crossable and produce fully fertile seed. Between the different related species hybridisation barriers exist. According to their inter-crossability ''Lens'' species can be divided into three gene pools: \n\n# Primary gene pool'':'' ''L. culinaris'' (and ''L. culinaris'' subsp''. orientalis'') and ''L. odemensis''\n# Secondary gene pool: ''L. ervoides'' and ''L. nigricans''\n# Tertiary gene pool: ''L. lamottei'' and ''L. tomentosus'' \n\nCrosses generally fail between members of different gene pools. However, [[Plant hormone|plant growth regulators]] and/or [[embryo rescue]] allows the growth of viable [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between groups. Even if crosses are successful, many undesired genes may be introduced as well in addition to the desired ones. This can be resolved by using a [[backcrossing]] programme. Thus, [[Mutagenesis (molecular biology technique)|mutagenesis]] is crucial to create new and desirable varieties. According to Yadav et al. other biotechnology techniques which may impact on lentil breeding are [[Micropropagation|micro-propagation]] using meristamatic explants, callus culture and regeneration, protoplast culture and doubled haploid production.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dal]]\n* [[Lentil soup]]\n* [[Linsen mit Sp\u00e4tzle|Lentils with Swabian pasta]]\n* [[Moujadara]]\n* [[National Lentil Festival]]\n{{div col end}}{{Portal|Food}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''The Oxford Companion to Food''. {{ISBN|0-19-211579-0}}\n* S S Yadav et al.

Among the different taxa of wild lentils, ''L. orientalis'' is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated lentil and is now generally classified as ''L. culinaris'' subsp. ''orientalis''. Therefore, the genus ''Lens'' comprises seven [[Taxon|taxa]] in six species:<ref name=\":2\" />\n* ''Lens culinaris'' subsp. ''culinaris'' (and ''L. culinaris'' subsp. ''orientalis'')\n* ''Lens odemensis''\n* ''Lens ervoides''\n* ''Lens nigricans''\n* ''Lens lamottei''\n* ''Lens tomentosus''\n\n== Botanical description ==\n[[File:Illustration_Lens_culinaris0.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the lentil plant, 1885|323x323px]]\n\nLentil is [[hypogeal]], which means the [[cotyledon]]s of the germinating seed stay in the ground and inside the seed coat. Therefore, it is less vulnerable to frost, wind erosion, or insect attack.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulseaus.com.au/growing-pulses/bmp/lentil/southern-guide#plant-physiology|title=Pulse Australia - Southern guide|website=pulseaus.com.au|language=en|access-date=2017-11-18}}</ref>\n\nThe plant is a diploid, annual, bushy herb of erect, semierect, or spreading and compact growth and normally varies from {{convert|30|to|50|cm}} in height. It has many hairy branches and its stem is slender and angular. The [[rachis]] bears 10 to 15 leaflets in five to eight pairs. The leaves are alternate, of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour. In general, the upper leaves are converted into [[tendrils]], whereas the lower leaves are mucronate. If  [[stipule]]s are present, they are small. The flowers, one to four in number, are small, white, pink, purple, pale purple, or pale blue in colour. They arise from the axils of the leaves, on a slender footstalk almost as long as the leaves. The pods are oblong, slightly inflated, and about {{convert|1.5|cm}} long. Normally, each of them contains two seeds, about {{convert|0.5|cm}} in diameter, in the characteristic lens shape. The seeds can also be mottled and speckled. The several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size, hairiness, and colour of the leaves, flowers, and seeds.\n\nLentils are [[self-pollinating]]. The flowering begins from the lowermost buds and gradually moves upward, so-called acropetal flowering. About two weeks are needed for all the flowers to open on the single branch. At the end of the second day and on the third day after the opening of the flowers, they close completely and the colour begins to fade. After three to four days, the setting of the pods takes place.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:Lentils_red_and_brown.jpg|thumb|Red and brown comparison]]\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}\n\nTypes can be classified according to their size, whether they are split or whole, or shelled or unshelled. Seed coats can range from light green to deep purple, as well as being tan, grey, brown, black or mottled.

In the [[temperate climate]]s lentils are planted in the winter and spring under low temperatures and vegetative growth occurs in later spring and the summer. Rainfall during this time is not limited. In the [[subtropics]], lentils are planted under relatively high temperatures at the end of the rainy season, and vegetative growth occurs on the residual soil moisture in the summer season. Rainfall during this time is limited. In [[Western Asia|West Asia]] and [[North Africa]], some lentils are planted as a winter crop before snowfall. Plant growth occurs during the time of snow melting. Under such cultivation, seed yields are often much higher.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Seedbed requirements and sowing ===\nThe lentil requires a firm, smooth [[seedbed]] with most of the previous [[crop residue]]s incorporated. For the seed placement and for later harvesting it is important that the surface is not uneven with large clods, stones, or protruding crop residue. It is also important that the soil is made friable and weed-free so that seeding could be done at a uniform depth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe plant densities for lentils vary between [[genotype]]s, seed size, planting time and growing conditions and also from region to region. In South Asia a seed rate of {{convert|30|to|40|kg/ha}} is recommended. In West Asian countries a higher seed rate is recommended and also leads to a higher yield.

After destoning, they may be sorted by a color sorter and then packaged.\n\nA major part of the world's red lentil production undergoes a secondary processing step. These lentils are [[Husk|dehulled]], split and polished. In the [[Indian subcontinent]], this process is called dhal milling.<ref name=\":0\" /> The moisture content of the lentils prior dehulling is crucial to guarantee a good dehulling efficiency.<ref name=\":0\" /> The hull of lentils usually accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the total seed weight, which is lower than most legumes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HUGHES|first=Joe S.|last2=Swanson|first2=Barry G.|year=1986|title=Microstructure of lentil seeds (Lens culinaris)|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1140&context=foodmicrostructure|journal=Food Structure|volume=5|pages=241\u2013246|via=digitalcommons.usu.edu}}</ref> Lentil flour can be produced by milling the seeds, like cereals.\n\n=== Culinary use ===\n[[File:Split_Red_Lentil.jpg|thumb|Split red lentils (size 6 mm)]]Lentils are consumed in many ways. They can be eaten soaked, germinated, boiled, fried and baked. The most common preparation method is boiling.<ref name=\":0\" /> The seeds require a cooking time of 10 to 40 minutes, depending on the variety; shorter for small varieties with the husk removed, such as the common red lentil. Most varieties have a distinctive, earthy flavor. Lentils with husks remain whole with moderate cooking; lentils without husks tend to disintegrate into a thick pur\u00e9e, which leads to quite different dishes. The composition of lentils leads to a high emulsifying capacity which can be even increased by dough fermentation in bread making.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bora|first=Pushkar Singh|title=Functional properties of native and succinylated lentil (Lens culinaris) globulins|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=77|issue=2|pages=171\u2013176|doi=10.1016/s0308-8146(01)00332-6|year=2002}}</ref>\n\n==== Lentil dishes ====\nLentils are used worldwide to cook many different dishes. Lentil dishes are most widespread throughout [[South Asia]], the [[Mediterranean]] regions and [[West Asia]].[[File:Daal_after_Tadka_Pulse_Soup_India.jpg|thumb|[[Dal tadka]] (lentil soup)]]\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], lentil curry is part of the everyday diet, eaten with both rice and [[roti]]. Boiled lentils and lentil stock are used to thicken most vegetarian curries. They are also used as stuffing in [[dal]] [[paratha]]s and [[Puri (food)|puri]] for breakfast or snacks. Lentils are also used in many regional varieties of sweets. Lentil flour is used to prepare several different bread varieties, such as  [[papadum]].\n\nThey are frequently combined with [[rice]], which has a similar cooking time. A lentil and rice dish is referred to in Levantine countries as ''[[mujaddara]]'' or ''mejadra''. In Iran, rice and lentil is served with fried [[raisin]]; this dish is called ''adas polo''. Rice and lentils are also cooked together in ''[[khichdi]]'', a popular dish in the Indian subcontinent (India and Pakistan); a similar dish, ''[[kushari]]'', made in Egypt, is considered one of two [[national dish]]es.\n\nLentils are used to prepare an inexpensive and nutritious [[Lentil soup|soup]] all over Europe and [[Americas|North and South America]], sometimes combined with some form of [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] or [[pork]]. In western countries, cooked lentils are often used in salads.<ref name=\":0\" /> In Italy, the traditional dish for New Year's Eve is [[Cotechino]] served with lentils.\n\nLentils are commonly eaten in Ethiopia in a stew-like dish called ''kik'', or ''kik wot'', one of the dishes people eat with Ethiopia's national food, ''[[injera]]'' flatbread. Yellow lentils are used to make a non-spicy stew, which is one of the first solid foods Ethiopian women feed their babies.\n\nLentils were a chief part of the diet of ancient Iranians, who consumed lentils daily in the form of a stew poured over rice.\n\n=== Nutritional value ===\n\n==== Composition ====\n{{nutritionalvalue|name=Lentils, mature seeds, cooked, boiled, with salt)|kJ=477|water=69.64 g|protein=9.02 g|fat=0.38 g|carbs=19.54 g|sugars=1.8 g|fiber=7.9 g|calcium_mg=19|iron_mg=3.3|magnesium_mg=36|phosphorus_mg=180|potassium_mg=369|sodium_mg=238|zinc_mg=1.27|copper_mg=0.251|manganese_mg=0.494|selenium_ug=2.8|vitamin A_IU=8|vitC_mg=1.5|vitD_iu= 0|vitE_mg=0.11|vitK_ug=1.7|thiamin_mg=0.169|riboflavin_mg=0.073|niacin_mg=1.06|pantothenic_mg=0.638|vitB6_mg=0.178|folate_ug=181|vitB12_ug=0|note=[https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/175254/nutrients Link to Full USDA Database entry]}}\n\nAccording to the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]], 100 g of raw lentils (variety unspecified) provide 353 [[calories]]; the same weight of cooked lentils provides 116 calories.

Since the inception of The International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas ([[ICARDA]]) breeding programme in 1977 significant gains have been made. It supplies landraces and breeding lines for countries around the world, supplemented by other programmes in both developing (e.g. India) and developed (e.g. Australia and Canada) countries. In recent years, such collaborations among breeders and agronomists are becoming increasingly important.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe focus lies on high yielding and stable cultivars for diverse environments to match the demand of a growing population.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Jitendra|last2=Gupta|first2=Sunanda|last3=Gupta|first3=Priyanka|last4=Dubey|first4=Sonali|last5=Tomar|first5=Ram Sewak Singh|last6=Kumar|first6=Shiv|date=2016|title=Breeding strategies to improve lentil for diverse agro-ecological environments|journal= Indian Journal of Genetics and Plant Breeding |volume=76|issue=4|pages=530|doi=10.5958/0975-6906.2016.00071.7|issn=0019-5200}}</ref> In particular, progress in quantity and quality as well as in the resistance to disease and abiotic stresses are the major breeding aims.<ref name=\":2\" /> Several varieties have been developed applying [https://www.bats.ch/bats/publikationen/1995-1_TA/2-methods.php conventional breeding methodologies]. Serious genetic improvement for yield has been made, however, the full potential of production and productivity could not yet be tapped due to several biotic and abiotic stresses.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWild ''Lens'' species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop. The wild species possess many diverse traits including disease resistances and abiotic stress tolerances. The above-mentioned ''L. nigricans'' and ''L. orientalis'' possess morphological similarities to the cultivated ''L. culinaris''. But only ''L. culinaris'' and ''L. culinaris'' subsp. orientalis are crossable and produce fully fertile seed. Between the different related species hybridisation barriers exist. According to their inter-crossability ''Lens'' species can be divided into three gene pools: \n\n# Primary gene pool'':'' ''L. culinaris'' (and ''L. culinaris'' subsp''. orientalis'') and ''L. odemensis''\n# Secondary gene pool: ''L. ervoides'' and ''L. nigricans''\n# Tertiary gene pool: ''L. lamottei'' and ''L. tomentosus'' \n\nCrosses generally fail between members of different gene pools. However, [[Plant hormone|plant growth regulators]] and/or [[embryo rescue]] allows the growth of viable [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between groups. Even if crosses are successful, many undesired genes may be introduced as well in addition to the desired ones. This can be resolved by using a [[backcrossing]] programme. Thus, [[Mutagenesis (molecular biology technique)|mutagenesis]] is crucial to create new and desirable varieties. According to Yadav et al. other biotechnology techniques which may impact on lentil breeding are [[Micropropagation|micro-propagation]] using meristamatic explants, callus culture and regeneration, protoplast culture and doubled haploid production.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dal]]\n* [[Lentil soup]]\n* [[Linsen mit Sp\u00e4tzle|Lentils with Swabian pasta]]\n* [[Moujadara]]\n* [[National Lentil Festival]]\n{{div col end}}{{Portal|Food}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''The Oxford Companion to Food''. {{ISBN|0-19-211579-0}}\n* S S Yadav et al.

It is classified as a late [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] site with [[Upper Mississippian]] Huber (aka Blue Island) affiliation.<ref name=\"Bluhm\">{{cite book |last1=Bluhm |first1=Elaine A. |last2=Liss |first2=Allen |title=The Anker Site, IN Chicago Area Archaeology |date=1961 |publisher=Illinois Archaeological Survey, Bulletin No. 3 |location=Urbana, Illinois}}</ref>\n\n== History of Archaeological Investigations ==\n\nIn 1958 prehistoric remains were uncovered during construction of a subdivision in suburban [[Chicago]].  A salvage operation was undertaken under the auspices of the [[Illinois Archaeological Survey]], along with several individuals who excavated some of the burials and features on their own and shared their findings with the Survey.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n== Results of Data Analysis ==\n\nExcavations at the site yielded [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], a house structure, [[Feature (archaeology)|pit features]], [[Burial|burials]] and animal bone.  The site consisted of two parts: the village area and a [[cemetery]] containing burials with rich [[grave goods]].<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n=== Features ===\n\n[[File:Anker_site_map.jpeg|thumb|right|Site Map]]\n[[File:Anker_House_1.jpeg|thumb|right|House 1]]\n\nA structure was defined by the presence of post molds and other features.  It was 55 feet long by 13 feet wide and oval in shape.  There were 3 fireplaces along the center line and 7 refuse/cache pits inside and 2 outside the structure.  Charcoal in some of the post molds implies that the structure was burned.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nEight structures located at the nearby [[Oak Forest Site|Oak Forest site]] ranged from 25 to 47.5 feet long.<ref name=\"Bluhm1\">{{cite book |last1=Bluhm |first1=Elaine A. |last2=Fenner |first2=Gloria J. |editor1-last=Bluhm |editor1-first=Elaine A. |title=The Oak Forest Site, IN Chicago Area Archaeology |date=1961 |publisher=Illinois Archaeological Survey, Bulletin No. 3 |location=Urbana, Illinois}}</ref>  The Anker structure is significantly larger.  [[Ceremony|Ceremonial]] structures were known to be longer than residential structures in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] society, and therefore the Anker structure may have been ceremonial-related or religious in nature.  A [[dog]] skull was placed in one of the [[Fire pit|fire pits]] of this structure, which also indicates it may be ceremonial in nature.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Kinietz\">{{cite book |last1=Kinietz |first1=W.

One of the trash pits included 3 reconstructable [[Middle Mississippian]] [[pottery]] vessels, which are extremely rare in the [[Great Lakes area]].<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n=== Burials ===\n\nTwo types of [[burials]] were noted: 9 bundle burials with few [[grave goods]], and 31 extended burials, many of which contained a rich assortment of grave goods.

The main species present were [[deer]], [[fish]] (especially [[bowfin]] and [[catfish]]) and [[turtle]] (especially [[painted turtle]]); also present were [[beaver]], [[Raccoon|raccoon]], [[dog]], unidentifiable [[bird]] bone fragments and fresh water [[Mussel|mussels]] (especially Amblema costata).  These remains were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog, the remains of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] activities.

The pottery artifacts will be discussed in more detail below.\n* Stone artifacts - including 84 [[projectile points]], 155 [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] (subdivided into 4 types based on manufacturing technique), 5 [[drill|drills]] and 59 random-flake [[Knife|knives]].  Of the projectile points, the most numerous category was the small triangular Madison point.\n* Ground stone artifacts - including 1 [[Rubstone|rubbing stone]], 2 arrowshaft straighteners, 2 [[Mano (stone)|manos]], 10 [[Hammerstone|hammerstones]], 3 [[Celt (tool)|celts]] and 1 [[gouge (chisel)|gouge]].\n* [[Bone]] and [[antler]] artifacts - including 4 [[scapula]] [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], 1 scapula scraper, 4 bone needles, 2 bone awls, 7 socketed antler [[Projectile point|projectile points]], 2 antler flakers, 2 [[antler]] [[Knife|knives]] and numerous other artifacts, almost all of them [[grave goods]].  Many of these are described further below.\n* [[Seashell|Shell]] artifacts - including 13 shell [[beads]], 5 shell spoons, 4 mussel shell [[Pendant|pendants]], 1 shell hoe, a unique shell mask [[gorget]] with \u201cweeping eye\u201d motif, and numerous other artifacts, almost all of them grave goods. Some of the shell artifacts were made with marine shell.  Many of these are described further below.\n* [[Pipe smoking|Pipes]] - including 4 elbow pipes, 4 disc pipes, 1 pipe with block-shaped bowl, 1 pipe with tapering base, 1 vase shaped pipe, 1 truncated cone pipe, 1 [[bear]] effigy pipe, 1 human head effigy pipe and one celt-shaped pipe with incised decoration of a [[bison]] with arrow inside.  Almost all of these artifacts are grave goods.  Many of them are described further below.\n* [[Copper]] - including 2 copper ear plugs, 4 tubular copper beads, 1 disc-shaped copper bead, 1 sheet copper [[Bangle|bangles]], 5 copper [[snake|serpents]], 3 copper rings, 2 copper bracelet and a copper wire coil that may have been an ear plug or earring.  Almost all of these artifacts are grave goods.  Many of them are described further below.

A.D. 1400-1680s).  Although the Huber tradition was well-known by archaeologists for decades following the original excavations at the [[Huber Site|Huber site]], a formalized [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] was not developed until Charles Faulkner devised one in his 1972 report on the [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer site]] in northwestern [[Indiana]], just to the east of [[Chicago]].<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=James Bennett |title=The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippi Valley Archaeology |date=1943 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |edition=1966}}</ref><ref name=\"Faulkner\">{{cite journal |last1=Faulkner |first1=Charles H. |title=The Late Prehistoric Occupation of Northwestern Indiana: A Study of the Upper Mississippi Cultures of the Kankakee Valley |journal=Prehistory Research Series |date=1972 |volume=V |issue=1 |pages=1-222}}</ref>\n\nHuber pottery is characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]], plain surface pottery with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims.  Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from just below the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\nThe 1958 excavations recovered 823 sherds, almost all of it Huber ware.  Surfaces were primarily plain and decorated with medium- to wide-trailed lines on the shoulder area.  Most of the lips were notched.  Rarely, punctates accompanied the incised lines.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nHowever, some of the whole or reconstructible pots recovered were obviously trade ware from outside the [[Chicago]] area.  These vessels were characteristic of types found on the [[Mississippi River]] near the [[Arkansas]] area:<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n* One was decorated with nodes over the entire body of the vessel\n* One had a narrow, straight neck and globular body; it was decorated with a black painted design and wavy black band was painted over a red [[Slip (ceramics)|slipped]] surface\n* One was a red slipped vessel with a [[frog]] effigy at the mouth\n* One was a slightly squat, globular vessel decorated by a white band on one side and a white oval surrounded by red band on the other side, with a human head effigy at the mouth\n\nFollowing Faulkner\u2019s [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]],<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\">{{cite book |last1=Herold |first1=Elaine Bluhm |last2=O'Brien |first2=Patricia J. |last3=Wenner |first3=David J., Jr. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=Hoxie Farm and Huber: Two Upper Mississippian Archaeological Sites in Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois}}</ref>\n\n* Huber Plain - 75%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 4%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 6%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 12%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - 1.5%\n* Other types - 1.2%\n\nChronology of Anker pottery within the Huber (aka Blue Island) sequence\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Early Huber sites have also been observed to have significant amounts of Fisher Ware as well.  Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nIn the Anker site assemblage, 12% of sherds are cordmarked (more than any other Huber site except [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm]]), and 59% of decorated sherds have wide-line decoration.  Also, 74% of the lips are notched, and there is a small presence of Fisher Ware in the assemblage.  This combination of traits indicates a relatively early time placement for Anker within the Huber sequence.  The researchers who excavated the site estimated the range of occupation to be approximately A.D. 1400-1500.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n== Huber (aka Blue Island) within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region in the states of northern [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]] and southwest [[Michigan]].  Both have shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: The Oneota Tradition}}</ref><ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers No. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations at the Huber site, felt that Huber was a Component of the [[Oneota]] Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the one that survived to the Historic period,  based on the association of Huber pottery with early Historic European trade goods at several sites.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nNevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm]], [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] and [[Moccasin Bluff Site|Moccasin Bluff]] are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the [[Oneota]] tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like [[Fifield Site|Fifield]], where Fisher pottery is associated with late [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the [[Protohistoric]] or early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nThe Anker site is unique among Huber sites in the amount of trade goods and ceremonial/religious items present.  The site may have been a ceremonial or trade center; or there may have been a migration of peoples coming from the lower portion of the [[Mississippi River]] to interact with the Huber Culture population and perhaps settle in the area.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe Anker site is a site belonging to the Huber tradition (aka Blue Island) and is considered to be closely related to the [[Oneota]] Orr Focus.  The site is unique among Huber sites in the large amount of trade goods, mostly from the lower [[Mississippi River]] area but also from northern [[Michigan]] and the [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] area of [[Ontario]] and [[New York State]].  This could mean either extensive trade networks or movements of people.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nThe structure present at Anker is larger than other Huber period houses noted at the [[Oak Forest Site|Oak Forest site]]<ref name=\"Bluhm1\"/> and therefore may be a [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] structure.  The fact that a [[dog]] skull was placed in one of the pits supports that possibility.  Also, many of the [[grave goods]] may be interpreted as parts of [[Medicine bundle|medicine bundles]] or otherwise have spiritual or religious implications.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>. The presence of the [[gorget]] with \"weeping eye\" motif and the trade vessels from the [[Middle Mississippian Culture|Middle Mississippian]] area suggest that the Anker residents participated in or at least had knowledge of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].\n\nBased on the animal bone found at the site, and the presence of scapula hoes, it is thought that the site was occupied at least during the summer months.  It may have functioned as a religious/ceremonial center in the settlement pattern of the Huber culture, while other sites such as [[Oak Forest Site|Oak Forest]] served as semi-permanent residential areas.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThere are no radiocarbon dates available for the site, but based on the artifacts present, the researchers believe the site was occupied from approximately A.D. 1400 to 1500.  The specific [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe represented by the remains is unknown; however, [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Illinois tribe|Illinois]] or a Chewere [[Sioux]] group are possibilities.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 5: Ethnohistoric Connections}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | author1 = Elaine A.

One of the trash pits included 3 reconstructable [[Middle Mississippian]] [[pottery]] vessels, which are extremely rare in the [[Great Lakes area]].<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n=== Burials ===\n\nTwo types of [[burials]] were noted: 9 bundle burials with few [[grave goods]], and 31 extended burials, many of which contained a rich assortment of grave goods.  Many of the grave goods are described below and include [[Pipe smoking|pipes]], [[pottery]] vessels and animal bones/skulls that may have been components of [[Medicine bundle|medicine bundles]].<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n=== Animal Remains ===\n\nRemains from several species were recovered from the site.  The main species present were [[deer]], [[fish]] (especially [[bowfin]] and [[catfish]]) and [[turtle]] (especially [[painted turtle]]); also present were [[beaver]], [[Raccoon|raccoon]], [[dog]], unidentifiable [[bird]] bone fragments and fresh water [[Mussel|mussels]] (especially Amblema costata).  These remains were not modified into tools like the bone tools described in the Artifacts section below, and may be considered food remains or, in the case of the dog, the remains of [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] activities.

The pottery artifacts will be discussed in more detail below.\n* Stone artifacts - including 84 [[projectile points]], 155 [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]] (subdivided into 4 types based on manufacturing technique), 5 [[drill|drills]] and 59 random-flake [[Knife|knives]].  Of the projectile points, the most numerous category was the small triangular Madison point.\n* Ground stone artifacts - including 1 [[Rubstone|rubbing stone]], 2 arrowshaft straighteners, 2 [[Mano (stone)|manos]], 10 [[Hammerstone|hammerstones]], 3 [[Celt (tool)|celts]] and 1 [[gouge (chisel)|gouge]].\n* [[Bone]] and [[antler]] artifacts - including 4 [[scapula]] [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], 1 scapula scraper, 4 bone needles, 2 bone awls, 7 socketed antler [[Projectile point|projectile points]], 2 antler flakers, 2 [[antler]] [[Knife|knives]] and numerous other artifacts, almost all of them [[grave goods]].  Many of these are described further below.\n* [[Seashell|Shell]] artifacts - including 13 shell [[beads]], 5 shell spoons, 4 mussel shell [[Pendant|pendants]], 1 shell hoe, a unique shell mask [[gorget]] with \u201cweeping eye\u201d motif, and numerous other artifacts, almost all of them grave goods. Some of the shell artifacts were made with marine shell.  Many of these are described further below.\n* [[Pipe smoking|Pipes]] - including 4 elbow pipes, 4 disc pipes, 1 pipe with block-shaped bowl, 1 pipe with tapering base, 1 vase shaped pipe, 1 truncated cone pipe, 1 [[bear]] effigy pipe, 1 human head effigy pipe and one celt-shaped pipe with incised decoration of a [[bison]] with arrow inside.  Almost all of these artifacts are grave goods.  Many of them are described further below.\n* [[Copper]] - including 2 copper ear plugs, 4 tubular copper beads, 1 disc-shaped copper bead, 1 sheet copper [[Bangle|bangles]], 5 copper [[snake|serpents]], 3 copper rings, 2 copper bracelet and a copper wire coil that may have been an ear plug or earring.  Almost all of these artifacts are grave goods.  Many of them are described further below.  The copper was all made from metals originating in the [[Upper Peninsula]] of  [[Michigan]] and may have been obtained through trade.  Either the artifacts could have been manufactured in Michigan and traded; or the metal was traded and the artifacts manufactured in [[Illinois]].\n\nThe non-pottery artifacts found at an archaeological site can provide useful cultural context as well as a glimpse into the [[Home|domestic]] tasks performed at a site; [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] or [[Religion|religious]] activities; [[Recreation|recreational]] activities; and [[clothing]] or [[adornment|personal adornment]].<ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nAt Anker, the vast majority of these items were grave goods recovered from the numerous burials present at the site.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nSome of the most prominent and diagnostic non-pottery artifacts are presented here in more detail:<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n!

Although the Huber tradition was well-known by archaeologists for decades following the original excavations at the [[Huber Site|Huber site]], a formalized [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] was not developed until Charles Faulkner devised one in his 1972 report on the [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer site]] in northwestern [[Indiana]], just to the east of [[Chicago]].<ref name=\"Griffin\">{{cite book |last1=Griffin |first1=James Bennett |title=The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippi Valley Archaeology |date=1943 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan |edition=1966}}</ref><ref name=\"Faulkner\">{{cite journal |last1=Faulkner |first1=Charles H. |title=The Late Prehistoric Occupation of Northwestern Indiana: A Study of the Upper Mississippi Cultures of the Kankakee Valley |journal=Prehistory Research Series |date=1972 |volume=V |issue=1 |pages=1-222}}</ref>\n\nHuber pottery is characterized by shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]], plain surface pottery with globular vessel shape and restricted orifices with everted rims.  Some vessels also have strap handles.  Decoration (when present) usually consists of vertical or obliquely applied incised lines generally running from just below the lip to the shoulder.  Rarely, surfaces are [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] or smoothed over cordmarked.  The top of the lip is either plain or decorated with fine to wide notching.  A minority also have punctate decoration, mostly in combination with the trailed lines.<ref name=\"Griffin\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/>\n\nThe 1958 excavations recovered 823 sherds, almost all of it Huber ware.  Surfaces were primarily plain and decorated with medium- to wide-trailed lines on the shoulder area.  Most of the lips were notched.  Rarely, punctates accompanied the incised lines.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nHowever, some of the whole or reconstructible pots recovered were obviously trade ware from outside the [[Chicago]] area.  These vessels were characteristic of types found on the [[Mississippi River]] near the [[Arkansas]] area:<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n* One was decorated with nodes over the entire body of the vessel\n* One had a narrow, straight neck and globular body; it was decorated with a black painted design and wavy black band was painted over a red [[Slip (ceramics)|slipped]] surface\n* One was a red slipped vessel with a [[frog]] effigy at the mouth\n* One was a slightly squat, globular vessel decorated by a white band on one side and a white oval surrounded by red band on the other side, with a human head effigy at the mouth\n\nFollowing Faulkner\u2019s [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]],<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/> this is the proportion of the pottery types at the site:<ref name=\"Herold\">{{cite book |last1=Herold |first1=Elaine Bluhm |last2=O'Brien |first2=Patricia J. |last3=Wenner |first3=David J., Jr. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=Hoxie Farm and Huber: Two Upper Mississippian Archaeological Sites in Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois}}</ref>\n\n* Huber Plain - 75%, characterized by a plain surface \n* Huber Trailed - 4%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with fine incised lines\n* Huber Bold - 6%, characterized by a plain surface decorated with wide lines, possibly finger-trailed\n* Huber Cordmarked - 12%, characterized by a cordmarked surface\n* Fisher - 1.5%\n* Other types - 1.2%\n\nChronology of Anker pottery within the Huber (aka Blue Island) sequence\n\nThe trends in certain pottery traits are very time-sensitive and can be used as indicators of relative age. Based on information on other Huber sites in the area, archaeologists have determined early Huber pottery is more likely to have [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface finish; wide-trailed decoration; and notched lips. Early Huber sites have also been observed to have significant amounts of Fisher Ware as well.  Late Huber pottery has predominately smooth surface finish; fine-line incised decoration; and unnotched lips.<ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nIn the Anker site assemblage, 12% of sherds are cordmarked (more than any other Huber site except [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm]]), and 59% of decorated sherds have wide-line decoration.  Also, 74% of the lips are notched, and there is a small presence of Fisher Ware in the assemblage.  This combination of traits indicates a relatively early time placement for Anker within the Huber sequence.  The researchers who excavated the site estimated the range of occupation to be approximately A.D. 1400-1500.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n== Huber (aka Blue Island) within the Upper Mississippian Culture ==\n\nHuber ware (and Huber culture) are often mentioned together with Fisher.  Both Fisher and Huber are [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures which existed in the southern [[Lake Michigan]] region in the states of northern [[Illinois]] and [[Indiana]] and southwest [[Michigan]].  Both have shell-[[Temper (pottery)|tempered]] pottery but Huber is predominantly plain surface with fine-line decoration and Fisher is predominantly [[Cord-marked pottery|cordmarked]] surface with wide-line decoration.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |last2=Asch |first2=David L. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 4: Cultural Setting: The Oneota Tradition}}</ref><ref name=\"Bettarel\">{{cite book |last1=Bettarel |first1=Robert Louis |last2=Smith |first2=Hale G. |title=The Moccasin Bluff Site and the Woodland Cultures of Southwestern Michigan |date=1973 |publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology, Anthropological Papers No. 49 |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship of Huber and Fisher both with each other and with other [[Upper Mississippian]] cultures in the area has long been a matter of debate and speculation among archaeologists.  James Griffin, upon examining the artifacts from the original 1929 excavations at the Huber site, felt that Huber was a Component of the [[Oneota]] Aspect based on the form and design of the pottery, close to the Orr and Lake Winnebago foci, and that Fisher was part of a separate Focus.  Since that date, we\u2019ve obtained a great deal more information and now we know that Fisher is the older of the two and Huber is the one that survived to the Historic period,  based on the association of Huber pottery with early Historic European trade goods at several sites.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nNevertheless, both Fisher and Huber coexist at the same sites seemingly at the same time.  [[Hoxie Farm Site|Hoxie Farm]], [[Griesmer Site|Griesmer]] and [[Moccasin Bluff Site|Moccasin Bluff]] are examples of this.<ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nMost archaeologists now believe that both Fisher and Huber are taxonomically-related phases within the [[Oneota]] tradition.  The relationship between the two is time-related in that Huber is derived from Fisher; but there are also late Fisher sites like [[Fifield Site|Fifield]], where Fisher pottery is associated with late [[Prehistory|Prehistoric]] artifacts, so it is possible that Fisher also survived until the [[Protohistoric]] or early [[Historical archaeology|Historic]] period.<ref name=\"Brown\"/><ref name=\"Faulkner\"/><ref name=\"Bettarel\"/>\n\nThe Anker site is unique among Huber sites in the amount of trade goods and ceremonial/religious items present.  The site may have been a ceremonial or trade center; or there may have been a migration of peoples coming from the lower portion of the [[Mississippi River]] to interact with the Huber Culture population and perhaps settle in the area.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\n== Significance ==\n\nThe Anker site is a site belonging to the Huber tradition (aka Blue Island) and is considered to be closely related to the [[Oneota]] Orr Focus.  The site is unique among Huber sites in the large amount of trade goods, mostly from the lower [[Mississippi River]] area but also from northern [[Michigan]] and the [[Iroquois|Iroquoian]] area of [[Ontario]] and [[New York State]].  This could mean either extensive trade networks or movements of people.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>\n\nThe structure present at Anker is larger than other Huber period houses noted at the [[Oak Forest Site|Oak Forest site]]<ref name=\"Bluhm1\"/> and therefore may be a [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] structure.  The fact that a [[dog]] skull was placed in one of the pits supports that possibility.  Also, many of the [[grave goods]] may be interpreted as parts of [[Medicine bundle|medicine bundles]] or otherwise have spiritual or religious implications.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/>. The presence of the [[gorget]] with \"weeping eye\" motif and the trade vessels from the [[Middle Mississippian Culture|Middle Mississippian]] area suggest that the Anker residents participated in or at least had knowledge of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].\n\nBased on the animal bone found at the site, and the presence of scapula hoes, it is thought that the site was occupied at least during the summer months.  It may have functioned as a religious/ceremonial center in the settlement pattern of the Huber culture, while other sites such as [[Oak Forest Site|Oak Forest]] served as semi-permanent residential areas.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Herold\"/>\n\nThere are no radiocarbon dates available for the site, but based on the artifacts present, the researchers believe the site was occupied from approximately A.D. 1400 to 1500.  The specific [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe represented by the remains is unknown; however, [[Miami people|Miami]], [[Illinois tribe|Illinois]] or a Chewere [[Sioux]] group are possibilities.<ref name=\"Bluhm\"/><ref name=\"Brown1\">{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=James A. |editor1-last=Brown |editor1-first=James A. |editor2-last=O'Brien |editor2-first=Patricia J. |title=The Oak Forest Site: Investigations into Oneota Subsistence-Settlement in the Cal-Sag Area of Cook County, Illinois, IN At the Edge of Prehistory: Huber Phase Archaeology in the Chicago Area |date=1990 |publisher=Center for American Archaeology |location=Kampsville, Illinois |chapter=Chapter 5: Ethnohistoric Connections}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{citation | author1 = Elaine A.
