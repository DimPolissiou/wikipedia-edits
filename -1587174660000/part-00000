In week two, Clark persisted to wind Barlow up by first performing part of Barlow's \"[[Back for Good (song)|Back for Good]]\", and then by claiming that he had booked Barlow a cab in advance in case he stormed off stage again (to which Barlow responded \"That's funny cause I've had yours on hold for two weeks.\").

Their audition was shown in a montage entitled \"Hot Hunks\" rather than shown as its own segment, so that they could be portrayed as auditioning directly before soloist George Paul Shelley. Triple J sang [[Rihanna]]'s \"[[We Found Love]]\", while Shelley sang an acoustic guitar version of [[Britney Spears]]' \"[[Toxic (Britney Spears song)|Toxic]]\". Both acts received \"yes\" votes from all judges present (Contostavlos, Walsh, Barlow, and [[Rita Ora]] for Triple J; only Contostavlos, Walsh, and Barlow were present for Shelley's audition).\n\nAt bootcamp, Shelley performed [[Labrinth]]'s \"[[Earthquake (Labrinth song)|Earthquake]]\" with female contestants Charlie Cammish and Meg O'Neill as part of a mixed group, but was not selected for judges' houses. Triple J sang with GMD3 (later District3) for their group challenge and, as the last event of bootcamp, both groups battled for a place at judges' houses, with GMD3 taking the last slated groups slot. However, after fellow contestants [[Rough Copy]] had to withdraw from the show, Triple J's manager, Blair Dreelan, who had previously signed Shelley as a solo act, was called by the show's producers with an invitation to send Triple J to judges' houses if Shelley were added to the group. Three days before the flight to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Shelley was added to the group and they were renamed ''Union J''.<ref>{{cite web|last=SWNS News|title=Please mum, no!

In week 4, Union J were in the bottom two with Jade Ellis, but were saved by Barlow, Scherzinger, and Walsh (they also received more votes than Ellis). They were in the bottom two again in week 6 against District3 and were saved by the judges, with both Barlow and Scherzinger choosing Union J and Walsh refusing to vote since both acts were in his category (Union J also received more votes than District3). On the night of the week 7 live shows, after Saturday's performance of \"Call Me Maybe\", Hensley officially came out as gay in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which he then credited on Sunday night as being because he had been sure they would be voted out, and he wanted to leave the competition \"honest and himself\". They were not in the bottom two, however. They were in the bottom two for the third time in quarter-final, and were saved by Walsh, Barlow and Contostavlos over Rylan Clark (they also received more votes than Clark).

It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty.

The ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'', led by former [[Premier (Canada)|premier]] [[Maurice Duplessis]], defeated the incumbent [[Quebec Liberal Party]], led by [[Ad\u00e9lard Godbout]].  This was the first Quebec provincial election in which women were allowed to vote, having been granted suffrage at the provincial level in 1940 and at the federal level in 1919.\n\nThis election marked Duplessis's comeback after having defeated Godbout in the [[1936 Quebec general election|1936 election]] and having lost to him in the [[1939 Quebec general election|1939 election]]. Unlike in the 1939 election, when the alcoholic Duplessis was clearly drunk at numerous campaign rallies, ''le chef'' had benefited from the time he had spent in an American sanatorium in 1942-43, where he had sobered up, and in the 1944 election, Duplessis refrained from drinking.\n\nThe biggest issue during this election was provincial autonomy. In order to appeal to nationalist voters, Duplessis attacked the incumbent premier, claiming that he was not taking a strong enough stand against Ottawa. He mainly criticized Godbout for agreeing to transfer unemployment insurance from the province to the federal government. He also criticized the [[Rowell-Sirois Commission]] for its stance on [[unemployment insurance]] and [[equalization payments]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sarra-Bournet |first1=Michel |title=Biography - DUPLESSIS, MAURICE LE NOBLET |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/duplessis_maurice_le_noblet_18E.html |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref>\n\nAnother reason Duplessis won the election was by appealing to anti-Semitic prejudices in Quebec by making the false claim in a violently anti-Semitic speech that the Dominion government together with the Godbout government had made a secret deal with the \"International Zionist Brotherhood\" to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war in exchange for Jewish campaign contributions to both the federal and provincial Liberal parties.<ref>Knowles, Valerie ''Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540-2006'', Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149.</ref> By contrast, Duplessis claimed that he was not taking any money from the Jews, and if he were elected Premier, he would stop this plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec. To further push on the message, the ''Union Nationale'' handed out campaign pamphlets warning about the alleged plan to bring 100,000 Jewish refugees to Quebec, which featured a cartoon of the standard stereotype of an evil-looking, hook-nosed Jew handing bags of money to Godbout while in the background a vast horde of dirty, disreputable-looking, hook-nosed Jewish refugees were ready to descend on ''la belle province''.<ref>Abella, Irving & Troper, Harold ''None is too many: Canada and the Jews of Europe, 1933-1948'', Toronto: L & O Denny, 1986 page 162.</ref> Through Duplessis's story about the plan to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec was entirely false, his story was widely believed in Quebec, and ensured he won the election.<ref>Knowles, Valerie ''Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540-2006'', Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149.</ref> Duplessis's biographer [[Conrad Black]] argued that Duplessis was in no way personally anti-Semitic, but because the majority of Quebecois were at the time, Duplessis had merely used antisemitism to win the 1944 election.<ref>Black, Conrad ''Duplesisis'', Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1977 page 719</ref> Duplessis won another three elections in a row, for a total of five terms of office (four consecutive), before dying in office in 1959.\n\nIn this [[World War II|wartime]] election, Godbout's support for Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] in the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]] may have contributed to his defeat.\n\nThe ''[[Bloc populaire canadien|Bloc Populaire]]'' won four seats on an anti-conscription platform. The [[Parti social d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (predecessor of the [[New Democratic Party of Quebec|New Democratic Party]]) won one seat. Party member [[David C\u00f4t\u00e9]] was elected to the legislature, but in July 1945, he decided to sit as an independent.\n\n==Results==\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\"\n|- bgcolor=\"darkgray\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader\n!rowspan=\"2\"|# of<br />candidates\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|- bgcolor=\"darkgray\"\n|align=\"center\"|[[1939 Quebec general election|1939]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''Elected'''\n|align=\"center\"|% Change\n|align=\"center\"|#\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|align=\"center\"|% Change\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|UN|row-name}}\n| [[Maurice Duplessis]] <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|90  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|15  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|48    <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|+220%  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;

The ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'', led by former [[Premier (Canada)|premier]] [[Maurice Duplessis]], defeated the incumbent [[Quebec Liberal Party]], led by [[Ad\u00e9lard Godbout]].  This was the first Quebec provincial election in which women were allowed to vote, having been granted suffrage at the provincial level in 1940 and at the federal level in 1919.\n\nThis election marked Duplessis's comeback after having defeated Godbout in the [[1936 Quebec general election|1936 election]] and having lost to him in the [[1939 Quebec general election|1939 election]]. Unlike in the 1939 election, when the alcoholic Duplessis was clearly drunk at numerous campaign rallies, ''le chef'' had benefited from the time he had spent in an American sanatorium in 1942-43, where he had sobered up, and in the 1944 election, Duplessis refrained from drinking.\n\nThe biggest issue during this election was provincial autonomy. In order to appeal to nationalist voters, Duplessis attacked the incumbent premier, claiming that he was not taking a strong enough stand against Ottawa. He mainly criticized Godbout for agreeing to transfer unemployment insurance from the province to the federal government. He also criticized the [[Rowell-Sirois Commission]] for its stance on [[unemployment insurance]] and [[equalization payments]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sarra-Bournet |first1=Michel |title=Biography - DUPLESSIS, MAURICE LE NOBLET |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/duplessis_maurice_le_noblet_18E.html |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref>\n\nAnother reason Duplessis won the election was by appealing to anti-Semitic prejudices in Quebec by making the false claim in a violently anti-Semitic speech that the Dominion government together with the Godbout government had made a secret deal with the \"International Zionist Brotherhood\" to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war in exchange for Jewish campaign contributions to both the federal and provincial Liberal parties.<ref>Knowles, Valerie ''Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540-2006'', Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149.</ref> By contrast, Duplessis claimed that he was not taking any money from the Jews, and if he were elected Premier, he would stop this plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec. To further push on the message, the ''Union Nationale'' handed out campaign pamphlets warning about the alleged plan to bring 100,000 Jewish refugees to Quebec, which featured a cartoon of the standard stereotype of an evil-looking, hook-nosed Jew handing bags of money to Godbout while in the background a vast horde of dirty, disreputable-looking, hook-nosed Jewish refugees were ready to descend on ''la belle province''.<ref>Abella, Irving & Troper, Harold ''None is too many: Canada and the Jews of Europe, 1933-1948'', Toronto: L & O Denny, 1986 page 162.</ref> Through Duplessis's story about the plan to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec was entirely false, his story was widely believed in Quebec, and ensured he won the election.<ref>Knowles, Valerie ''Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540-2006'', Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149.</ref> Duplessis's biographer [[Conrad Black]] argued that Duplessis was in no way personally anti-Semitic, but because the majority of Quebecois were at the time, Duplessis had merely used antisemitism to win the 1944 election.<ref>Black, Conrad ''Duplesisis'', Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1977 page 719</ref> Duplessis won another three elections in a row, for a total of five terms of office (four consecutive), before dying in office in 1959.\n\nIn this [[World War II|wartime]] election, Godbout's support for Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] in the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]] may have contributed to his defeat.\n\nThe ''[[Bloc populaire canadien|Bloc Populaire]]'' won four seats on an anti-conscription platform. The [[Parti social d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (predecessor of the [[New Democratic Party of Quebec|New Democratic Party]]) won one seat. Party member [[David C\u00f4t\u00e9]] was elected to the legislature, but in July 1945, he decided to sit as an independent.\n\n==Results==\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\"\n|- bgcolor=\"darkgray\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader\n!rowspan=\"2\"|# of<br />candidates\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|- bgcolor=\"darkgray\"\n|align=\"center\"|[[1939 Quebec general election|1939]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''Elected'''\n|align=\"center\"|% Change\n|align=\"center\"|#\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|align=\"center\"|% Change\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|UN|row-name}}\n| [[Maurice Duplessis]] <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|90  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|15  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|48    <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|+220%  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| 38.02%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|-1.1%   <!--%ch.votes-->\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|Liberal|row-name}} \n| [[Ad\u00e9lard Godbout]] <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|91  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|70  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|37    <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|-47.1%  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| '''39.35'''%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|-14.7%   <!--%ch.votes-->\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|Bloc populaire|row-name}}\n| [[Andr\u00e9 Laurendeau]] <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|80  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|*  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|4    <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|*  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| 14.40%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|*   <!--%ch.votes-->\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|CCF|row}}\n|[[Parti social d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec|Co-operative Commonwealth]] \n| Romuald-Joseph Lamoureux <ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-0-17-271-1381-11/index_souvenirs/politique_economie/maurice_duplessis_ministre Maurice Duplessis reprend le pouvoir, Les Archives de Radio-Canada, August 8, 1944]</ref> <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|25  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|0  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|1   <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|*  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| 2.56%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|*   <!--%ch.votes-->\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Independents/row}}\n|colspan=2|Other\n|align=\"right\"|47  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|1   <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|1 <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;      <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| 5.67%    <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|+3.3%   <!--%ch.votes-->\n|- \n|colspan=\"3\"|'''Total'''\n!align=\"right\"|&nbsp;  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|86   <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|91  <!--elected-->\n!align=\"right\"|+5.8%  <!--%ch.seats-->\n!align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n!align=\"right\"|100%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;  <!--%ch.votes-->\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Note:'''\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Information on party's actions in previous election not available.{{bar box|title=Popular vote|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars={{bar percent|PLQ|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Liberal}}|39.35}}\n{{bar percent|UN|{{Canadian party colour|QC|UN}}|38.02}}\n{{bar percent|BP|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Bloc populaire}}|14.40}}\n{{bar percent|CCF|{{Canadian party colour|QC|CCF}}|2.56}}\n{{bar percent|Others|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Independent}}|5.67}}}}{{bar box|title=Seats summary|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars={{bar percent|UN|{{Canadian party colour|QC|UN}}|52.75}}\n{{bar percent|PLQ|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Liberal}}|40.66}}\n{{bar percent|BP|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Bloc populaire}}|4.40}}\n{{bar percent|CCF|{{Canadian party colour|QC|CCF}}|1.10}}\n{{bar percent|Others|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Independent}}|1.10}}}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Quebec premiers]]\n* [[Politics of Quebec]]\n* [[Timeline of Quebec history]]\n* [[List of political parties in Canada#Quebec|List of Quebec political parties]]\n* [[22nd Legislative Assembly of Quebec]]\n\n{{Quebec elections}}\n\n[[Category:1944 elections in Canada]]\n[[Category:Elections in Quebec]]\n[[Category:1944 in Quebec]]\n[[Category:August 1944 events]]\n", "name_user": "Kawnhr", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_Quebec_general_election"}

However the ALN obtained only 4.5% of the vote and no seats. It soon disbanded.  Also, a rump Conservative Party ran three candidates who won 0.2% of the vote and no seats.

The aperture likewise slopes to the front and has a sinuous margin. The venter is narrowly rounded to acute while the dorsum is more broad. The juvenile shell, found at the apex, is coiled in one or two whorls and described as minute, about a centimeter in diameter. Adult ''Baculites'' ranged in size from about seven centimeters (''Baculites larsoni'') up to two meters in length.\n\nAs with other [[Ammonoidea|ammonites]], the shell consisted of a series of camerae, or chambers, that were connected to the animal by a narrow tube called a siphuncle by which gas content and thereby buoyancy could be regulated in the same manner as ''[[Nautilus]]'' does today.  The chambers are separated by walls called septa. The line where each septum meets the outer shell is called the suture or suture line. Like other true [[Ammonitida|ammonites]], ''Baculites'' have intricate suture patterns on their shells that can be used to identify different species.\n\nOne notable feature about ''Baculites'' is that the males may have been a third to a half the size of the females and may have had much lighter ribbing on the surface of the shell.\n\nThe shell morphology of ''Baculites'' with slanted striations or ribbing, similarly slanted aperture, and more narrowly rounded to acute keel-like venter points to its having had a horizontal orientation in life as an adult. This same type of cross section is found in much earlier [[Nautiloidea|nautiloids]] such as ''[[Bassleroceras]]'' and ''[[Clitendoceras]]'' from the [[Ordovician]] period, which can be shown to have had a horizontal orientation. In spite of this, some researchers have concluded that Baculites lived in a vertical orientation, head hanging straight down, since lacking an apical counterweight, movement was largely restricted to that direction.  More recent research, notably by Gerd Westermann, has reaffirmed that at least some ''Baculites'' species in fact lived in a more or less horizontal orientation.<ref>Westermann, G. E. G. 1996.

New York: Plenum Press.</ref>\n\nFrom shell isotope studies, it is thought that ''Baculites'' inhabited the middle part of the water column, not too close to either the bottom or surface of the ocean. In some rock deposits ''Baculites'' are common, and they are thought to have lived in great shoals.  However, they are not known to occur so densely as to be rock-forming, as do certain other extinct, straight-shelled cephalopods (e.g., [[orthoceras|orthocerid nautiloids]]).\n\n''Baculites'' fossils are very brittle and almost always break.  They are most commonly found broken in half or several pieces, usually along suture lines.  Individual chambers found this way are sometimes referred to as \"stone buffaloes\" (due to their shapes), though the Native-American attribution typically given as part of the story behind the name is likely apocryphal.{{Clarify|date=August 2018}} The Blackfoot have oral traditions that tell a story of the Iniskimm (Buffalo Calling Stone). They are still in use today by Indigenous peoples. \n\n''Baculites'' and related [[Cretaceous]] straight [[ammonite]] cephalopods are often confused with the superficially similar [[orthocerid]] [[nautiloid]] cephalopods.  Both are long and tubular in form, and both are common items for sale in rock shops (often under each other's names).  Both lineages evidently evolved the tubular form independently, and at different times in earth history.  The [[orthocerid]] [[nautiloid]]s lived much earlier (common during the [[Paleozoic]] Era and extinct by the end of the [[Triassic]] Period) than ''Baculites'' (Late [[Cretaceous]] Period only).  The two types of fossils can be distinguished by many features, most obvious among which is the suture line: it is simple in orthocerid nautiloids and intricately folded in ''Baculites'' and related ammonoids.\n\nStudies<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kruta | first1 = I. | last2 = Landman | first2 = N. | last3 = Rouget | first3 = I. | last4 = Cecca | first4 = F. | last5 = Tafforeau | first5 = P. | title = The Role of Ammonites in the Mesozoic Marine Food Web Revealed by Jaw Preservation | doi = 10.1126/science.1198793 | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6013 | pages = 70\u201372| year = 2011 | pmid =  21212354| pmc = |bibcode = 2011Sci...331...70K }}</ref> on exceptionally preserved specimens have revealed a [[radula]] by [[synchrotron]] imagery.

However, they are not known to occur so densely as to be rock-forming, as do certain other extinct, straight-shelled cephalopods (e.g., [[orthoceras|orthocerid nautiloids]]).\n\n''Baculites'' fossils are very brittle and almost always break.  They are most commonly found broken in half or several pieces, usually along suture lines.  Individual chambers found this way are sometimes referred to as \"stone buffaloes\" (due to their shapes), though the Native-American attribution typically given as part of the story behind the name is likely apocryphal.{{Clarify|date=August 2018}} The Blackfoot have oral traditions that tell a story of the Iniskimm (Buffalo Calling Stone). They are still in use today by Indigenous peoples. \n\n''Baculites'' and related [[Cretaceous]] straight [[ammonite]] cephalopods are often confused with the superficially similar [[orthocerid]] [[nautiloid]] cephalopods.  Both are long and tubular in form, and both are common items for sale in rock shops (often under each other's names).  Both lineages evidently evolved the tubular form independently, and at different times in earth history.  The [[orthocerid]] [[nautiloid]]s lived much earlier (common during the [[Paleozoic]] Era and extinct by the end of the [[Triassic]] Period) than ''Baculites'' (Late [[Cretaceous]] Period only).  The two types of fossils can be distinguished by many features, most obvious among which is the suture line: it is simple in orthocerid nautiloids and intricately folded in ''Baculites'' and related ammonoids.\n\nStudies<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kruta | first1 = I. | last2 = Landman | first2 = N. | last3 = Rouget | first3 = I. | last4 = Cecca | first4 = F. | last5 = Tafforeau | first5 = P. | title = The Role of Ammonites in the Mesozoic Marine Food Web Revealed by Jaw Preservation | doi = 10.1126/science.1198793 | journal = Science | volume = 331 | issue = 6013 | pages = 70\u201372| year = 2011 | pmid =  21212354| pmc = |bibcode = 2011Sci...331...70K }}</ref> on exceptionally preserved specimens have revealed a [[radula]] by [[synchrotron]] imagery.
