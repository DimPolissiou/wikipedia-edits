In metric units the [[ambient pressure]] is usually measured in metres sea water (msw}, and converted to bar for calculations. In US customary units ambient pressure is normally measured in feet of sea water (fsw), and converted to atmospheres absolute or pounds per square inch absolute (psia) for decompression computation. Feet and metres sea water are convenient measures which approximate closely to depth and are intuitively simple to grasp for the diver, compared to the options of more conventional units of pressure which give no direct indication of depth. The distinction between gauge and absolute pressure is important for calculation of gas properties and pressure must be identified as either gauge or absolute. Gauge pressure in msw or fsw is converted to absolute pressure in bar or atm for decompression and [[Scuba gas consumption|gas consumption calculation]], but [[decompression tables]] are usually provided ready for use directly with the gauge pressure in msw and fsw.

Released in 1982, the album contains the pop hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" in its later resequencings (see below). Following the album's overall theme of radio are the songs \"Airwaves\", \"Commercial Breakup\", and \"Radio Silence,\" along with songs about the modern world (\"Windpower\", \"Flying North\", \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\").\n\n==Compositions==\nThe music of \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and [[electronic percussion]] with [[handclap]]s.<ref name=\"Record8\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Donald Fagen: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> The central character in \"Radio Silence\" is a [[personification]] of [[Radio Caroline]], a 1960s [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|British pirate radio station]].<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\n==Release history==\nThe album was released a total of five separate times. All five releases appeared on vinyl and cassette (though the cassette release for the fifth version is unconfirmed), but only the third and fifth resequencings appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \"Radio Silence\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations.\n\nThe first US version, issued by [[Columbia Records|Columbia-CBS]]'s CBS/Sony imprint, excised the instrumental \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" (loosely based on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Uruguayan plane crash]]) and added the two sides of Fagen's first single, \"Leipzig\" and \"Urges\". Additionally, Columbia swapped the original synthpop version of \"Radio Silence\" for a much more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Columbia also opted for the single edit of \"Airwaves\" and abandoned the original UK \"comic book\" cover in favour of a shot of Fagen on a stage during the production of [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s \"Galileo\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \"Europa and the Pirate Twins\" single in the UK.\n\nWhen Fagen released the single \"She Blinded Me with Science\" backed by \"[[One of our Submarines]]\" in late 1982\u2014complete with a music video for the A-side\u2014Columbia saw a golden opportunity. They removed \"Urges\" and \"Leipzig\", added the extended version of \"Science\" (also known as the \"U.S. Mix\") and \"Submarines\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \"comic book\" design. Columbia also swapped the full-length version of \"Windpower\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The strategy worked, as ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' sold better and \"She Blinded Me with Science\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1983, the UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \"Science\" but retained the full-length versions of \"Airwaves\" and \"Windpower\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \"Radio Silence\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe successive resequencings occurred largely because different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of \"Science\" was the version that became a hit in [[United States|America]] and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.\n\nA remastered \"Collector's Edition\" of ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the ''Live Wireless'' music video.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===1982 First UK release: Venice in Peril CBS/Sony VIP 1001===\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Thomas Dolby]], except where noted\n| title1          = Flying North\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Commercial Breakup\n| note2           = [[Thomas Dolby]], Tim Kerr\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Weightless\n| length3         = 3:45\n| title4          = [[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\n| length4         = 3:18\n| title5          = Windpower\n| length5         = 4:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = The Wreck of The Fairchild\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2         = Airwaves\n| length2        = 5:12\n| title3         = Radio Silence\n| length3        = 3:43\n| title4         = Cloudburst at Shingle Street\n| length4        = 5:45\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The original UK track listing (including its reappearance on the 2009 ''Collector's Edition'' CD) is the only place one can hear the progression of \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" into \"Airwaves\" and then into the synth version of \"Radio Silence.\" \"Fairchild\" concludes with the sound of various electronics, including a wave computer, which segues into the intro of \"Airwaves\" with no break. The remnants of this transition can still be heard at the beginning of the full-length version of \"Airwaves\" used on other configurations of the album.\n\n===1982 First US release: Columbia

Released in 1982, the album contains the pop hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" in its later resequencings (see below). Following the album's overall theme of radio are the songs \"Airwaves\", \"Commercial Breakup\", and \"Radio Silence,\" along with songs about the modern world (\"Windpower\", \"Flying North\", \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\").\n\n==Compositions==\nThe music of \"[[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\" is a deliberate merging of past and present, combining modern synthesizers with blues harmonica playing and [[electronic percussion]] with [[handclap]]s.<ref name=\"Record8\">{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Stuart |title=Thomas Dolby: A Techno-Geek Aims for 'An Emotional Event'|journal=Record|date=June 1983|volume=2|issue=8|page=4}}</ref> The central character in \"Radio Silence\" is a [[personification]] of [[Radio Caroline]], a 1960s [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|British pirate radio station]].<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\n==Release history==\nThe album was released a total of five separate times. All five releases appeared on vinyl and cassette (though the cassette release for the fifth version is unconfirmed), but only the third and fifth resequencings appeared on CD, with each changing the order of the songs, replacing the album mixes with extended or single mixes and even adding and removing entire songs. In the case of \"Radio Silence\", a completely different recording with prominent guitars was the version used on the early US incarnations.\n\nThe first US version, issued by [[Columbia Records|Columbia-CBS]]'s CBS/Sony imprint, excised the instrumental \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" (loosely based on the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Uruguayan plane crash]]) and added the two sides of Fagen's first single, \"Leipzig\" and \"Urges\". Additionally, Columbia swapped the original synthpop version of \"Radio Silence\" for a much more rock-oriented version that had previously only been available as a single B-side in the UK. Columbia also opted for the single edit of \"Airwaves\" and abandoned the original UK \"comic book\" cover in favour of a shot of Fagen on a stage during the production of [[Bertholt Brecht]]'s \"Galileo\". This image had previously been used as the cover of the \"Europa and the Pirate Twins\" single in the UK.\n\nWhen Fagen released the single \"She Blinded Me with Science\" backed by \"[[One of our Submarines]]\" in late 1982\u2014complete with a music video for the A-side\u2014Columbia saw a golden opportunity. They removed \"Urges\" and \"Leipzig\", added the extended version of \"Science\" (also known as the \"U.S. Mix\") and \"Submarines\", and changed the album's cover art back to its original \"comic book\" design. Columbia also swapped the full-length version of \"Windpower\" for the single version (with an edited intro and outro). The strategy worked, as ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' sold better and \"She Blinded Me with Science\" became a major hit, with constant radio and MTV airplay.\n\nIn 1983, the UK record label, Venice in Peril, followed suit and reissued the album with a similar track listing to the second US version. They opted for the short single version of \"Science\" but retained the full-length versions of \"Airwaves\" and \"Windpower\" and the original synthesizer-driven version of \"Radio Silence\", just as all three had appeared on the first UK edition. This is the edition that is widely available on CD to this day, on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe successive resequencings occurred largely because different territories preferred different mixes of songs to others; for example, the extended mix of \"Science\" was the version that became a hit in [[United States|America]] and thus the American cut of the album was swiftly resequenced to accommodate the tastes of that particular territory.\n\nA remastered \"Collector's Edition\" of ''The Golden Age of Wireless'' was released on 13 July 2009, complete with bonus tracks, personal sleeve notes and a DVD of the ''Live Wireless'' music video.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n===1982 First UK release: Venice in Peril CBS/Sony VIP 1001===\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side A\n| all_writing     = [[Thomas Dolby]], except where noted\n| title1          = Flying North\n| length1         = 3:50\n| title2          = Commercial Breakup\n| note2           = [[Thomas Dolby]], Tim Kerr\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Weightless\n| length3         = 3:45\n| title4          = [[Europa and the Pirate Twins]]\n| length4         = 3:18\n| title5          = Windpower\n| length5         = 4:20\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = no\n| headline        = Side B\n| title1          = The Wreck of The Fairchild\n| length1         = 3:30\n| title2         = Airwaves\n| length2        = 5:12\n| title3         = Radio Silence\n| length3        = 3:43\n| title4         = Cloudburst at Shingle Street\n| length4        = 5:45\n}}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The original UK track listing (including its reappearance on the 2009 ''Collector's Edition'' CD) is the only place one can hear the progression of \"The Wreck of the Fairchild\" into \"Airwaves\" and then into the synth version of \"Radio Silence.\" \"Fairchild\" concludes with the sound of various electronics, including a wave computer, which segues into the intro of \"Airwaves\" with no break.

He studied the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Mark Twain]] and developed a style emphasizing the use of satire. His English-language works utilize primarily [[Afrikaner]] characters and highlight the many contradictions in Afrikaner society during the first half of the twentieth century. \n\n==Early life==\nBosman was born at Kuils River, near [[Cape Town]], to an Afrikaner family. He was raised with English as well as [[Afrikaans]]. While Bosman was still young, his family travelled frequently, he spent a short time at Potchefstroom College which would later become [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]], he later  moved to [[Johannesburg]] where he went to school at [[Jeppe High School for Boys]] in [[Kensington, Gauteng|Kensington]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} While there he contributed to the school magazine. When Bosman was sixteen, he started writing short stories for the national Sunday newspaper (the ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]''). He attended the Johannesburg College of Education (which in 2002 was incorporated into the [[University of the Witwatersrand]])<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1719&Itemid=203 Joburg.org.za] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306023053/http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1719&Itemid=203 |date=6 March 2012 }}, \"Wits turns 85 today\", retrieved 30 December 2011</ref> and submitted various pieces to student literary competitions.\n\n==Career and adult life==\nAfter graduation, Bosman accepted a [[teaching]] position in the [[Groot Marico]] district in an Afrikaans-language school. The area  provided the backdrop for his best-known short stories, the ''Oom Schalk Lourens'' series (featuring an older character named Oom Schalk Lourens) and the ''Voorkamer'' sketches. wassup\n\nOver the school holidays in 1926, Bosman visited his family in Johannesburg. During an argument, he shot and killed his stepbrother. Bosman was sentenced to death for the crime and was sent to [[Death row]] at the [[Pretoria Central Prison]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-k0XX--pZIC&pg=PA55 |title=Herman Charles Bosman: Between the Lines |first=Valerie |last=Rosenberg |page=55 |publisher=Struik |year=2005 |isbn=1-77007-163-6}}</ref> His sentence was later reduced to ten years with hard labour. In 1930, he was released on parole after serving half his sentence. His prison experiences formed the basis for his semi-autobiographical book, ''Cold Stone Jug''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nBosman then started his own printing-press company and was part of a literary set in Johannesburg, associating with poets, journalists\n and writers, including Aegidius Jean Blignaut. He toured overseas for nine years, spending most of his time in London. The short stories that he wrote during this period formed the basis for another of his best-known books, ''Mafeking Road''.\n\nAt the start of the [[Second World War]], he returned to South Africa and worked as a journalist. During this time he translated the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' into Afrikaans.\n\nBosman lamented the fact that Johannesburg neglected its heritage. In ''The Standard Theatre'' he complained that the city's residents:\n\n\"will pull down the Standard Theatre like they have pulled down all the old buildings, theatres, gin-palaces, dosshouses, temples, shops, arcades, cafes and joints that were intimately associated with the mining-camp days of Johannesburg. Because I know Johannesburg. And I am satisfied that there is no other city in the world that is so anxious to shake off the memories of its early origins.\"\n\nBosman's second wife was Ella Manson. The couple were renowned{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle and parties, which featured witty conversation and usually ended well after midnight.\n\nFrom 1948 to his death in 1951, Bosman was employed as [[proof editor]] at The Sunday Express. In addition, he was contracted to write a weekly Voorkamer story for ''The Forum'' magazine.<ref name=beeld/>\n\nHis last wife was Helena Lake (n\u00e9e Stegmann). After a [[housewarming party]] in October 1951, Bosman experienced severe chest pains and was taken to [[Edenvale, Gauteng|Edenvale]] Hospital. On admission, he was asked for his birthplace. He replied, \"Born Kuilsrivier \u2013 Died Edenvale Hospital.\" He was discharged and collapsed at home a few hours later. Bosman died as he was being rushed to hospital. He is buried in [[Westpark Cemetery]] in Westdene under a triangular headstone that reads \"Die Skrywer, The Writer, Herman Charles Bosman, b 3.2.1905, d 14.10.1951.\"\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter his death, the rights to his works were auctioned. They were purchased by his last wife, Helena, and upon her death, the rights were passed to her son, who retains them. In 1960, however, Helena sold some of his documents and 123\u2009of his water colours and pencil sketches to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] in Texas.<ref name=beeld>{{cite news|last=Snyman|first=Salom\u00e9|title=Bosman se laaste stukkie legkaart |url=http://www.beeld.com/bylae/2013-04-06-bosman-se-laaste-stukkie-legkaart |accessdate=2 July 2013 |newspaper=Beeld |date=6 April 2013|language=Afrikaans}}</ref>\n\nOnly three of his books were published during his lifetime: ''Mafeking Road'' published by Dassie, and ''Jacaranda in the Night'' and ''Cold Stone Jug'' published by APB.

His English-language works utilize primarily [[Afrikaner]] characters and highlight the many contradictions in Afrikaner society during the first half of the twentieth century. \n\n==Early life==\nBosman was born at Kuils River, near [[Cape Town]], to an Afrikaner family. He was raised with English as well as [[Afrikaans]]. While Bosman was still young, his family travelled frequently, he spent a short time at Potchefstroom College which would later become [[Potchefstroom High School for Boys]], he later  moved to [[Johannesburg]] where he went to school at [[Jeppe High School for Boys]] in [[Kensington, Gauteng|Kensington]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} While there he contributed to the school magazine. When Bosman was sixteen, he started writing short stories for the national Sunday newspaper (the ''[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|Sunday Times]]''). He attended the Johannesburg College of Education (which in 2002 was incorporated into the [[University of the Witwatersrand]])<ref>[http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1719&Itemid=203 Joburg.org.za] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306023053/http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1719&Itemid=203 |date=6 March 2012 }}, \"Wits turns 85 today\", retrieved 30 December 2011</ref> and submitted various pieces to student literary competitions.\n\n==Career and adult life==\nAfter graduation, Bosman accepted a [[teaching]] position in the [[Groot Marico]] district in an Afrikaans-language school. The area  provided the backdrop for his best-known short stories, the ''Oom Schalk Lourens'' series (featuring an older character named Oom Schalk Lourens) and the ''Voorkamer'' sketches.\n\nOver the school holidays in 1926, Bosman visited his family in Johannesburg. During an argument, he shot and killed his stepbrother. Bosman was sentenced to death for the crime and was sent to [[Death row]] at the [[Pretoria Central Prison]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-k0XX--pZIC&pg=PA55 |title=Herman Charles Bosman: Between the Lines |first=Valerie |last=Rosenberg |page=55 |publisher=Struik |year=2005 |isbn=1-77007-163-6}}</ref> His sentence was later reduced to ten years with hard labour. In 1930, he was released on parole after serving half his sentence. His prison experiences formed the basis for his semi-autobiographical book, ''Cold Stone Jug''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nBosman then started his own printing-press company and was part of a literary set in Johannesburg, associating with poets, journalists\n and writers, including Aegidius Jean Blignaut. He toured overseas for nine years, spending most of his time in London. The short stories that he wrote during this period formed the basis for another of his best-known books, ''Mafeking Road''.\n\nAt the start of the [[Second World War]], he returned to South Africa and worked as a journalist. During this time he translated the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'' into Afrikaans.\n\nBosman lamented the fact that Johannesburg neglected its heritage. In ''The Standard Theatre'' he complained that the city's residents:\n\n\"will pull down the Standard Theatre like they have pulled down all the old buildings, theatres, gin-palaces, dosshouses, temples, shops, arcades, cafes and joints that were intimately associated with the mining-camp days of Johannesburg. Because I know Johannesburg. And I am satisfied that there is no other city in the world that is so anxious to shake off the memories of its early origins.\"\n\nBosman's second wife was Ella Manson. The couple were renowned{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} for their [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle and parties, which featured witty conversation and usually ended well after midnight.\n\nFrom 1948 to his death in 1951, Bosman was employed as [[proof editor]] at The Sunday Express. In addition, he was contracted to write a weekly Voorkamer story for ''The Forum'' magazine.<ref name=beeld/>\n\nHis last wife was Helena Lake (n\u00e9e Stegmann). After a [[housewarming party]] in October 1951, Bosman experienced severe chest pains and was taken to [[Edenvale, Gauteng|Edenvale]] Hospital. On admission, he was asked for his birthplace. He replied, \"Born Kuilsrivier \u2013 Died Edenvale Hospital.\" He was discharged and collapsed at home a few hours later. Bosman died as he was being rushed to hospital. He is buried in [[Westpark Cemetery]] in Westdene under a triangular headstone that reads \"Die Skrywer, The Writer, Herman Charles Bosman, b 3.2.1905, d 14.10.1951.\"\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter his death, the rights to his works were auctioned. They were purchased by his last wife, Helena, and upon her death, the rights were passed to her son, who retains them. In 1960, however, Helena sold some of his documents and 123\u2009of his water colours and pencil sketches to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] in Texas.<ref name=beeld>{{cite news|last=Snyman|first=Salom\u00e9|title=Bosman se laaste stukkie legkaart |url=http://www.beeld.com/bylae/2013-04-06-bosman-se-laaste-stukkie-legkaart |accessdate=2 July 2013 |newspaper=Beeld |date=6 April 2013|language=Afrikaans}}</ref>\n\nOnly three of his books were published during his lifetime: ''Mafeking Road'' published by Dassie, and ''Jacaranda in the Night'' and ''Cold Stone Jug'' published by APB. ''Mafeking Road'' has never been out of print since its publication in 1947.<ref name=beeld/>\n\nHis biography was written several times by Valerie Rosenberg. Her first effort was called ''Sunflower to the Sun'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Valerie|title=Sunflower to the sun|date=1981|publisher=Human & Rousseau|location=Cape Town|isbn=0-7981-1228-X|edition=2nd}}</ref> followed by ''Herman Charles Bosman, a Pictorial Biography'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Valerie|title=Herman Charles Bosman|date=1981|publisher=Perkskor|location=Johannesburg|isbn=0-628-02148-8|edition=1st}}</ref> and most recently by ''Herman Charles Bosman: Between the Lines''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Valerie|title=Herman Charles Bosman : between the lines|date=2005|publisher=Struik|location=Cape Town|isbn=1-77007-163-6}}</ref>  The last of these contains much new research and deals in detail with aspects of Bosman's life and parentage that were previously considered taboo.\n\nBecause many of his stories were originally published in long-forgotten magazines and journals, there are a number of [[anthology|anthologies]] by different collators each containing a different selection.
