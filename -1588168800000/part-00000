[[Hermes]] asks Prometheus one last time to finally name the hetaerae who would cost Zeus and his followers their eternal rule. When Prometheus refuses, he is struck by lightning and thunder from an earthquake which throws him into the shadowy realm of the [[Hades]].\n\n[[Kratos (mythology)|Kratos]] (Greek: \"Power\") and [[Bia (mythology)|Bia]] (Greek: \"Violence\"), the servants of [[Zeus]], drag Prometheus to the [[Caucasus]] mountains, where, at Zeus' command, the reluctant [[Hephaistos]] chains Prometheus to a rock of the Caucasus. Hephaistos takes pity on Prometheus, but is also afraid of Zeus and his accomplices.\n\nAfter Hephaistos, Kratos and Bia have left, the chorus of the daughters of [[Okeanos]] appears; they assures him of his friendship and inquire about the reason for this punishment. Prometheus tells about his fight against [[Cronus|Kronos]], helping Zeus to overthrow his father through cunning and cleverness. Zeus then passed the offices, but did not think of the humans, so that only Prometheus came to their support; he gave them the fire, hope and the art of prophecy. The chorus warns him of his audacity, whereupon Prometheus declares that despite his knowledge of his future punishment, he did it for the sake of people.\n\nThe chorus flies away, whereupon Okeanos rides on stage on his griffin. He describes himself as the greatest friend of Prometheus and claims that he hurried to his side as quickly as possible. But Prometheus asks him if he wants to indulge in his suffering and is outraged again about Zeus. Okeanos also warns him about the lack of submission to the new ruler. Prometheus should submit and ask for mercy so that he would be redeemed. But he reacts with irony to this advice from Okeanos, who had not supported the people with him. Okeanos offers to appeal to Zeus, but Prometheus advises him against it, referring to his brothers [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[Typhon (mythology)|Typhon]]. Okeanos is persuaded and flies away.\n\nThe chorus returns and laments Prometheus's deplorable fate. Thereupon Prometheus tells what knowledge he brought to the human race, including medicine, seafaring, meteorology and divination. He also announces that Zeus will abdicate one day and Prometheus will be redeemed. The Okeanids, though, should not tell Zeus about his future so that his prophecy will come true. The chorus laments the suffering of Prometheus and the lack of help from the human race which had enjoyed Prometheus's support.\n\nThe horned [[Io (mythology)|Io]], daughter of Inachos, enters on stage. Prometheus announces the end of Zeus's reign to her by a son of [[Hera]]. When Io learns that Prometheus has mastered the art of divination, she wants him to predict her own fate. Before that, however, she reports how she dreamed of Zeus's love. Therefore, Inachos, the father of Io, received the news from an [[oracle]] and decided to expel his daughter from the country. To cover up the love for Io, he turned her into a cow. But this was not hidden from Hera; she sent Argos as a guard and had the cow chased by a [[Horse-fly|gadfly]]. Now Prometheus announces Io's future: She will cross the [[Bosphorus]] (which will be named after her) and will eventually reach [[Ethiopia]] following the Nile Delta to [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] to give birth to [[Epaphos]] there. A descendant of the Io's in the 13th generation, a \"hero of the bow\" (i.e. [[Herakles]]) will one day save Prometheus. Since Io can no longer bear the stings of the gadfly, she escapes.\n\nPrometheus reveals to the chorus of the [[Oceanids]] that Zeus' curse will come to an end. Hermes comes in and demands that Prometheus open up to Zeus who will overthrow him. He threatens with lightning and storm, which would hurt Prometheus badly; an eagle sent by Zeus would come to eat Prometheus's liver. Since Prometheus refuses to disclose this knowledge, he is punished by Zeus: the rock with the titan forged onto it sinks into Hades.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Orchestra ===\nThe score of Orff's ''Prometheus'' calls for an instrumentation that is unique in music history:\n{{div col}}\n* 6 [[flute|flutes]], all also [[piccolo]]s, 1 also bass flute\n* 6 [[oboe]]s, oboes 5\u20136 also [[cor anglais]]\n* 6 [[trumpet]]s\n* 6 [[trombone]]s\n* 4 [[harp]]s\n* 4 [[banjo|tenor banjo]]s\n* 1 [[organ (music)|organ]]\n* 1 [[regal (instrument)|regal]]\n* 1 [[electronic organ|electric organ]]\n* 4 [[grand piano]]s with 8 players\n* 9 [[double bass]]es\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe large percussion section requires 15 to 18 players:\n{{div col}}\n* 5 [[timpani]]\n* 2 small timpani with wooden cover\n* 1 [[snare drum]] with resonant strings\n* 3 Basque drums\n* 2 [[bass drum]]s, 1 with a cymbal attached\n* 1 O-Daiko\n* 1 [[taiko]]\n* 4 [[darabukka]]s\n* 2 [[conga]]s\n* 1 [[lithophone]]\n* 2 [[xylophone]]s\n* 2 chromatic tenor xylophones\n* 2 [[marimbaphone]]s\n* 1 bass xylophone\n* 1 [[glockenspiel]]\n* 1 metallophone\n* 1 bass metallophone\n* 6 [[tubular bells]]\n* 1 [[triangle]]\n* 1 pair of [[cymbal]]s \n* 3 hanging cymbals (small \u2013 medium \u2013 large)\n* 5 hanging Turkish cymbals\n* 3 hanging Chinese cymbals\n* 2 cymbales antiques\n* 1 pair of small cymbales antiques (c<sup>5</sup>)\n* 6 pairs [[Crotales|antique cymbals]]\n* 3 [[tamtam]]\n* 3 [[gong]]s\n* 2 large metal plates (e<sup>3</sup> and f<sup>3</sup>)\n* 1 plate bell (contra-C<sub>1</sub>)\n* 1 [[g\u00fciro]]\n* 5 wood blocks\n* 3 wood bells\n* 1 large wood bell\n* 1 African slot drum\n* wooden planks\n* 1 pair of bamboo tubes\n* 2 pairs of [[hy\u014dshigi]]\n* 1 wasamba\n* 1 [[binzasara]]\n* 4 [[maraca]]s\n* 2 [[angklung]] (g<sup>1</sup> and b flat<sup>1</sup>)\n* 7 glasses (tuned)\n* 1 [[wind machine]]\n* 1 thunder machine\n{{div col end}}\nThe chromatic tenor xylophones are instruments of the [[Orff-Schulwerk]]. Since they are not normally used in the percussion section of the symphony orchestra because of the [[chromatic]] arrangement of their keys, in current performance practice marimbaphones are substituted. However, since chromatic glissandi can only be performed on chromatic tenor xylphones, these instruments from Orff's Schulwerk are included in limited numbers in order to allow for the performance of chromatic glissandi. The score of '' Prometheus '' therefore reflects the performance practice of all three of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.{{sfn|M\u00f6ller|1995|p={{page needed|date=April 2020}}}}\n\nWhile at the time of the premiere, the performance of the percussion section required considerable skills from the percussionists, thanks to the extraordinary development of the percussion technology in the past decades, Orff's score no longer offers insurmountable obstacles.\n\n=== Musical language ===\nAs Pietro Massa was able to show, an intensive exchange of ideas with the classical philologist [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]], the musicologist [[Thrasybulos Georgiades]] and with [[Wieland Wagner]], the director who had originally been selected by the composer for the staging of the world premiere,  accompanied the genesis of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.{{sfn|Massa|2006|loc=''passim''}} Orff made the decision, revolutionary for the time when the work was created, to set the original Greek text after extensive consultation with Wolfgang Schadewaldt, who advised the composer on detailed questions of Greek metrics.{{sfn|Flashar|2015|pp=103\u2013111}} Since the quantitative metrics of Ancient Greek poetry are incompatible with the accent metrics of modern European languages as well as with the metrical structure of European art music, the composer chose the solution not to let the text, which had to be declaimed rhythmically by the singer's speaking voice during long passages of the opera, be decanted in a rhythm that corresponded to the ancient Greek meter of the original, but to add to the syllable order of the ancient Greek text the second layer of an autonomous musical rhythm.{{sfn|R\u00f6sch|2003|loc=''passim''}} Since vast parts of the score require a rhythmic declamation of the Greek text in the speaking voice of the soloists, which is only occasionally interrupted by strong accents of the gigantic percussion, the score of ''Prometheus'' also marked a new stage in Orff's departure from traditional pitch structures in comparison with his previous operas on Greek dramas.\n\nConcentrating on an ensemble of percussion instruments with a specific and indefinite pitch, originally certainly born out of the fascination that the orchestra's only still evolving group exercised on 20th-century composers, appeared to be a veritable patent solution for a composer for whom the creation of purely diastematic organizations had never been a central concern. The idea of a differentiated cooperation based on the division of labor, which has distinguished the orchestra of Western art music that has grown organically over the centuries, in the orchestra of Orff's operas on Greek Antiquity appears transposed onto instrument constellations that were previously unknown to European art music. In the score of ''Prometheus'', the six pianos and the xylophones, which in the traditional orchestra were only given marginal tasks, take on the role that the string body had in the orchestration of Viennese classical music. On the other hand, the basic instruments of the traditional European symphony orchestra \u2013 such as flutes, oboes, trumpets and double basses \u2013 become entrusted in Orff's scores with functions that had been the realm of the rare percussion instruments in the 19th-century orchestra tradition. Their special timbres, which possess an  almost exotic sound appeal, are only used for special, dramaturgically motivated tasks.{{sfn|Maehder|2015|pp=197\u2013229.}}\n\nThe inclusion of numerous non-European percussion instruments that had not previously been used in the orchestra of European art music cannot be interpreted as musical [[exoticism]], especially since the composer hardly uses the new timbres unmixed.{{sfn|Vars\u00e1ny|2015|pp=175\u2013196}} Rather, the gathering of instruments from all parts of the world in the orchestra of Orff's last works for the stage serves to substantiate the claim that the setting of the ancient Greek myth should reveal the all-encompassing nature of the Greek myth which appeals to mankind in its entirety.{{sfn|Maehder|2007|pp=441\u2013462}}\n\nIn the history of 20th-century music, Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity appear as an extraordinarily original development of musical dramaturgy after 1949. In recent decades, and especially after the year 2000, Orff's late style has attracted an increasing interest from opera houses and from musicological research alike, not least because of the obvious relationship between Orff's musical language and the tendencies of [[minimalism]].\n\n== Performance history ==\nOnly five months after the opera's world premiere, on 1 August 1968, Orff's ''Prometheus'' received a second, highly successful production at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] Munich, conducted by [[Michael Gielen]] and staged by [[August Everding]] with the sets and costumes designed by [[Josef Svoboda]]; this production has received the composer's special praise.{{sfn|Flashar|2015|pp=103\u2013111}} After the great success of these initial performances, the enormous difficulties of the title role, the problem of assembling a large collection of exotic percussion instruments and the reluctance of smaller opera houses to stage a work written in Ancient Greek have hindered a broader diffusion of Orff's score, although some basic notions of Ancient Greek would have been present at least among some members of an educated opera audience in Western Germany. After the year 2000, a renewed interest in Carl Orff's late style has led to a rediscovery of his operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity; in the meantime, opera scores with a [[libretto]] in rare or non-Western languages had become increasingly common. Among the productions of the last decade, a production in the context of the festival [[Ruhrtriennale]] (Duisburg 2012), conducted by [[Peter Rundel]] and with the staging, sets and costumes by the Samoan director [[Lemi Ponifasio]], has met with special success. Further performances in concert were presented in 2013 (Munich), in 2015 in the context of the Orff festival in Diessen/Ammersee, and again 2015 in Munich. A new production of ''Prometheus'' had been announced for the summer of 2020; the opera should have been staged in the context of the ''Jugendfestspiele Bayreuth'', a branch of [[Bayreuth Festival]].\n\n== Recordings ==\n* Roland Hermann, [[Colette Lorand]], [[Fritz Uhl]], Heinz Cramer, [[Josef Greindl]], [[Kieth Engen]]; [[WDR Sinfonieorchester K\u00f6ln|Rundfunk-Symphonieorchester K\u00f6ln]], conductor: [[Ferdinand Leitner]]. 1972.

Okeanos offers to appeal to Zeus, but Prometheus advises him against it, referring to his brothers [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[Typhon (mythology)|Typhon]]. Okeanos is persuaded and flies away.\n\nThe chorus returns and laments Prometheus's deplorable fate. Thereupon Prometheus tells what knowledge he brought to the human race, including medicine, seafaring, meteorology and divination. He also announces that Zeus will abdicate one day and Prometheus will be redeemed. The Okeanids, though, should not tell Zeus about his future so that his prophecy will come true. The chorus laments the suffering of Prometheus and the lack of help from the human race which had enjoyed Prometheus's support.\n\nThe horned [[Io (mythology)|Io]], daughter of Inachos, enters on stage. Prometheus announces the end of Zeus's reign to her by a son of [[Hera]]. When Io learns that Prometheus has mastered the art of divination, she wants him to predict her own fate. Before that, however, she reports how she dreamed of Zeus's love. Therefore, Inachos, the father of Io, received the news from an [[oracle]] and decided to expel his daughter from the country. To cover up the love for Io, he turned her into a cow. But this was not hidden from Hera; she sent Argos as a guard and had the cow chased by a [[Horse-fly|gadfly]]. Now Prometheus announces Io's future: She will cross the [[Bosphorus]] (which will be named after her) and will eventually reach [[Ethiopia]] following the Nile Delta to [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] to give birth to [[Epaphos]] there. A descendant of the Io's in the 13th generation, a \"hero of the bow\" (i.e. [[Herakles]]) will one day save Prometheus. Since Io can no longer bear the stings of the gadfly, she escapes.\n\nPrometheus reveals to the chorus of the [[Oceanids]] that Zeus' curse will come to an end. Hermes comes in and demands that Prometheus open up to Zeus who will overthrow him. He threatens with lightning and storm, which would hurt Prometheus badly; an eagle sent by Zeus would come to eat Prometheus's liver. Since Prometheus refuses to disclose this knowledge, he is punished by Zeus: the rock with the titan forged onto it sinks into Hades.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Orchestra ===\nThe score of Orff's ''Prometheus'' calls for an instrumentation that is unique in music history:\n{{div col}}\n* 6 [[flute|flutes]], all also [[piccolo]]s, 1 also bass flute\n* 6 [[oboe]]s, oboes 5\u20136 also [[cor anglais]]\n* 6 [[trumpet]]s\n* 6 [[trombone]]s\n* 4 [[harp]]s\n* 4 [[banjo|tenor banjo]]s\n* 1 [[organ (music)|organ]]\n* 1 [[regal (instrument)|regal]]\n* 1 [[electronic organ|electric organ]]\n* 4 [[grand piano]]s with 8 players\n* 9 [[double bass]]es\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe large percussion section requires 15 to 18 players:\n{{div col}}\n* 5 [[timpani]]\n* 2 small timpani with wooden cover\n* 1 [[snare drum]] with resonant strings\n* 3 Basque drums\n* 2 [[bass drum]]s, 1 with a cymbal attached\n* 1 O-Daiko\n* 1 [[taiko]]\n* 4 [[darabukka]]s\n* 2 [[conga]]s\n* 1 [[lithophone]]\n* 2 [[xylophone]]s\n* 2 chromatic tenor xylophones\n* 2 [[marimbaphone]]s\n* 1 bass xylophone\n* 1 [[glockenspiel]]\n* 1 metallophone\n* 1 bass metallophone\n* 6 [[tubular bells]]\n* 1 [[triangle]]\n* 1 pair of [[cymbal]]s \n* 3 hanging cymbals (small \u2013 medium \u2013 large)\n* 5 hanging Turkish cymbals\n* 3 hanging Chinese cymbals\n* 2 cymbales antiques\n* 1 pair of small cymbales antiques (c<sup>5</sup>)\n* 6 pairs [[Crotales|antique cymbals]]\n* 3 [[tamtam]]\n* 3 [[gong]]s\n* 2 large metal plates (e<sup>3</sup> and f<sup>3</sup>)\n* 1 plate bell (contra-C<sub>1</sub>)\n* 1 [[g\u00fciro]]\n* 5 wood blocks\n* 3 wood bells\n* 1 large wood bell\n* 1 African slot drum\n* wooden planks\n* 1 pair of bamboo tubes\n* 2 pairs of [[hy\u014dshigi]]\n* 1 wasamba\n* 1 [[binzasara]]\n* 4 [[maraca]]s\n* 2 [[angklung]] (g<sup>1</sup> and b flat<sup>1</sup>)\n* 7 glasses (tuned)\n* 1 [[wind machine]]\n* 1 thunder machine\n{{div col end}}\nThe chromatic tenor xylophones are instruments of the [[Orff-Schulwerk]]. Since they are not normally used in the percussion section of the symphony orchestra because of the [[chromatic]] arrangement of their keys, in current performance practice marimbaphones are substituted. However, since chromatic glissandi can only be performed on chromatic tenor xylphones, these instruments from Orff's Schulwerk are included in limited numbers in order to allow for the performance of chromatic glissandi. The score of '' Prometheus '' therefore reflects the performance practice of all three of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.{{sfn|M\u00f6ller|1995|p={{page needed|date=April 2020}}}}\n\nWhile at the time of the premiere, the performance of the percussion section required considerable skills from the percussionists, thanks to the extraordinary development of the percussion technology in the past decades, Orff's score no longer offers insurmountable obstacles.\n\n=== Musical language ===\nAs Pietro Massa was able to show, an intensive exchange of ideas with the classical philologist [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]], the musicologist [[Thrasybulos Georgiades]] and with [[Wieland Wagner]], the director who had originally been selected by the composer for the staging of the world premiere,  accompanied the genesis of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.{{sfn|Massa|2006|passim}} Orff made the decision, revolutionary for the time when the work was created, to set the original Greek text after extensive consultation with Wolfgang Schadewaldt, who advised the composer on detailed questions of Greek metrics.{{sfn|Flashar|2015|pp=103\u2013111}} Since the quantitative metrics of Ancient Greek poetry are incompatible with the accent metrics of modern European languages as well as with the metrical structure of European art music, the composer chose the solution not to let the text, which had to be declaimed rhythmically by the singer's speaking voice during long passages of the opera, be decanted in a rhythm that corresponded to the ancient Greek meter of the original, but to add to the syllable order of the ancient Greek text the second layer of an autonomous musical rhythm.{{sfn|R\u00f6sch|2003|passim}} Since vast parts of the score require a rhythmic declamation of the Greek text in the speaking voice of the soloists, which is only occasionally interrupted by strong accents of the gigantic percussion, the score of ''Prometheus'' also marked a new stage in Orff's departure from traditional pitch structures in comparison with his previous operas on Greek dramas.\n\nConcentrating on an ensemble of percussion instruments with a specific and indefinite pitch, originally certainly born out of the fascination that the orchestra's only still evolving group exercised on 20th-century composers, appeared to be a veritable patent solution for a composer for whom the creation of purely diastematic organizations had never been a central concern. The idea of a differentiated cooperation based on the division of labor, which has distinguished the orchestra of Western art music that has grown organically over the centuries, in the orchestra of Orff's operas on Greek Antiquity appears transposed onto instrument constellations that were previously unknown to European art music. In the score of ''Prometheus'', the six pianos and the xylophones, which in the traditional orchestra were only given marginal tasks, take on the role that the string body had in the orchestration of Viennese classical music. On the other hand, the basic instruments of the traditional European symphony orchestra \u2013 such as flutes, oboes, trumpets and double basses \u2013 become entrusted in Orff's scores with functions that had been the realm of the rare percussion instruments in the 19th-century orchestra tradition. Their special timbres, which possess an  almost exotic sound appeal, are only used for special, dramaturgically motivated tasks.{{sfn|Maehder|2015|pp=197\u2013229.}}\n\nThe inclusion of numerous non-European percussion instruments that had not previously been used in the orchestra of European art music cannot be interpreted as musical [[exoticism]], especially since the composer hardly uses the new timbres unmixed.{{sfn|Vars\u00e1ny|2015|pp=175\u2013196}} Rather, the gathering of instruments from all parts of the world in the orchestra of Orff's last works for the stage serves to substantiate the claim that the setting of the ancient Greek myth should reveal the all-encompassing nature of the Greek myth which appeals to mankind in its entirety.{{sfn|Maehder|2007|pp=441\u2013462}}\n\nIn the history of 20th-century music, Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity appear as an extraordinarily original development of musical dramaturgy after 1949. In recent decades, and especially after the year 2000, Orff's late style has attracted an increasing interest from opera houses and from musicological research alike, not least because of the obvious relationship between Orff's musical language and the tendencies of [[minimalism]].\n\n== Performance history ==\nOnly five months after the opera's world premiere, on 1 August 1968, Orff's ''Prometheus'' received a second, highly successful production at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] Munich, conducted by [[Michael Gielen]] and staged by [[August Everding]] with the sets and costumes designed by [[Josef Svoboda]]; this production has received the composer's special praise.{{sfn|Flashar|2015|pp=103\u2013111}} After the great success of these initial performances, the enormous difficulties of the title role, the problem of assembling a large collection of exotic percussion instruments and the reluctance of smaller opera houses to stage a work written in Ancient Greek have hindered a broader diffusion of Orff's score, although some basic notions of Ancient Greek would have been present at least among some members of an educated opera audience in Western Germany. After the year 2000, a renewed interest in Carl Orff's late style has led to a rediscovery of his operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity; in the meantime, opera scores with a [[libretto]] in rare or non-Western languages had become increasingly common. Among the productions of the last decade, a production in the context of the festival [[Ruhrtriennale]] (Duisburg 2012), conducted by [[Peter Rundel]] and with the staging, sets and costumes by the Samoan director [[Lemi Ponifasio]], has met with special success. Further performances in concert were presented in 2013 (Munich), in 2015 in the context of the Orff festival in Diessen/Ammersee, and again 2015 in Munich. A new production of ''Prometheus'' had been announced for the summer of 2020; the opera should have been staged in the context of the ''Jugendfestspiele Bayreuth'', a branch of [[Bayreuth Festival]].\n\n== Recordings ==\n* Roland Hermann, [[Colette Lorand]], [[Fritz Uhl]], Heinz Cramer, [[Josef Greindl]], [[Kieth Engen]]; [[WDR Sinfonieorchester K\u00f6ln|Rundfunk-Symphonieorchester K\u00f6ln]], conductor: [[Ferdinand Leitner]]. 1972.

Notable Bollywood singers are [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Geeta Dutt]], [[Shamshad Begum]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Sadhana Sargam]] , [[Alka Yagnik]] and [[Shreya Goshal]] (female), and K. L. Saigal, Talat Mahmood, [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Manna Dey]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Kumar Sanu]], [[Udit Narayan]] and [[Sonu Nigam]] (male). Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi have been considered the finest singers of Bollywood songs, followed by Lata Mangeshkar (who has recorded thousands of songs for Indian films in her six-decade career). Composers of film music, known as music directors, are also well-known. [[Remix]]ing of film songs with modern rhythms is common, and producers may release remixed versions of some of their films' songs with the films' soundtrack albums.\n\nDancing in Bollywood films, especially older films, is modeled on Indian dance: classical dance, dances of north-Indian courtesans ([[tawaif]]) or [[folk dance]]s. In modern films, Indian dance blends with Western dance styles as seen on MTV or in Broadway musicals; Western pop and classical-dance numbers are commonly seen side-by-side in the same film. The hero (or heroine) often performs with a troupe of supporting dancers. Many song-and-dance routines in Indian films contain unrealistically-quick shifts of location or changes of costume between verses of a song. If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet, it is often staged in natural surroundings or architecturally-grand settings.\n\nSongs typically comment on the action taking place in the film. A song may be worked into the plot, so a character has a reason to sing. It may externalise a character's thoughts, or presage an event in the film (such as two characters falling in love). The songs are often referred to as a \"dream sequence\", with things happening which would not normally happen in the real world.

Some producers also release music videos, usually (but not always) with a song from the film.\n\n==Finances==\nBollywood films are multi-million dollar productions, with the most expensive productions costing up to {{INR}}1 billion (about US$20&nbsp;million). The science-fiction film ''[[Ra.One]]'' was made on a budget of {{INR}}1.35 billion (about $27 million), making it the most expensive Bollywood film of all time.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Times of India |author2=movie report |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-06/special-report/30366066_1_ke-liye-shah-rukh-khan-big-stars|accessdate=12 December 2011|work=The Times of India|title=It took me 20 years to be an overnight success: Shah Rukh Khan|date=6 November 2011}}</ref> [[Set (drama)|Sets]], costumes, special effects and [[cinematography]] were less than world-class, with some notable exceptions, until the mid-to-late 1990s. As Western films and television are more widely distributed in India, there is increased pressure for Bollywood films to reach the same production levels (particularly in action and special effects). Recent Bollywood films, like ''[[Krrish]]'' (2006), have employed international technicians such as Hong Kong-based action choreographer [[Tony Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The increasing accessibility of professional action and special effects, coupled with rising film budgets, have seen an increase in action and science-fiction films.\n\nSince overseas scenes are attractive at the box office, Mumbai film crews are filming in Australia, Canada, [[New Zealand]], the United Kingdom, the United States, [[Europe]] and elsewhere. Indian producers have also obtained funding for big-budget films shot in India, such as ''[[Lagaan]]'' and ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]''.\n\nFunding for Bollywood films often comes from private distributors and a few large [[Movie studio|studios]]. Although Indian banks and financial institutions had been forbidden from lending to film studios, the ban has been lifted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/mar/31sush.htm |title=I & B Ministry will help film industry |publisher=Rediff |date=31 March 2001 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> Finances are not regulated; some funding comes from illegitimate sources such as the Mumbai underworld, which is known to influence several prominent film personalities. Mumbai organised-crime hitmen shot [[Rakesh Roshan]], a film director and father of star [[Hrithik Roshan]], in January 2000. In 2001, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] seized all prints of ''[[Chori Chori Chupke Chupke]]'' after the film was found to be funded by members of the Mumbai underworld.<ref>{{cite web|author=Singh, Vijay|title=Bharat Shah sentenced, but won't have to spend time in prison|date=1 October 2003|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/oct/01shah.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=14 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAnother problem facing Bollywood is widespread [[copyright infringement]] of its films. Often, bootleg [[DVD#DVD Video|DVD]] copies of movies are available before they are released in cinemas. Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is an established small-scale industry in parts of south and [[southeast Asia]]. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $100 million annually from unlicensed home videos and DVDs. In addition to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst portions of the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]]. Bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the Pakistani government has banned their sale, distribution and telecast. Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by small cable-TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia. Small convenience stores, run by members of the Indian diaspora in the US and the UK, regularly stock tapes and DVDs of dubious provenance; consumer copying adds to the problem. The availability of illegal copies of movies on the Internet also contributes to industry losses.\n\nSatellite TV, television and imported foreign films are making inroads into the domestic Indian entertainment market. In the past, most Bollywood films could make money; now, fewer do. Most Bollywood producers make money, however, recouping their investments from many sources of revenue (including the sale of ancillary rights). There are increasing returns from theatres in Western countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, where Bollywood is slowly being noticed. As more Indians migrate to these countries, they form a growing market for upscale Indian films. In 2002, Bollywood sold 3.6 billion tickets and had a total revenue (including theatre tickets, DVDs and television) of $1.3 billion; Hollywood films sold 2.6 billion tickets, and had a total revenue of $51 billion.\n\n==Advertising==\nA number of Indian artists hand-painted movie billboards and posters.

Unlike Europe and North America, where Indian films cater to the expatriate marke, Bollywood films became popular in West Africa despite the lack of a significant Indian audience. One possible explanation is cultural similarity: the wearing of turbans, animals in markets; porters carrying large bundles, and traditional wedding celebrations. Within Muslim culture, Indian movies were said to show \"respect\" toward women; Hollywood movies were seen as having \"no shame\". In Indian movies, women are modestly dressed; men and women rarely kiss and there is no [[nudity]], so the films are said to \"have culture\" which Hollywood lacks.

This was closely followed by ''Shirheen Farhad'' (1931) by [[Jamshedji Framji Madan]], also by Madan, which had as many as 42 song sequences strung together in the manner of an opera, and later by ''Indra Sabha'' which had as many as 69 song sequences. However, the practice subsided and subsequent films usually featured between six and ten songs in each production.\n\nRight from the advent of Indian cinema in 1931, musicals with song numbers have been a regular feature in Indian cinema. In 1934 Hindi film songs began to be recorded on gramophones and later, played on radio channels, giving rise to a new form of mass entertainment in India which was responsive to popular demand. Within the first few years itself, Hindi cinema had produced a variety of films which easily categorised into genres such as \"historicals\", \"mythologicals\", \"devotional, \"fantasy\" etc. but each having songs embedded in them such that it is incorrect to classify them as \"musicals\".\n\nThe Hindi song was such an integral features of Hindi mainstream cinema, besides other characteristics, that post-independence alternative cinema, of which the [[Satyajit Ray filmography|films]] of [[Satyajit Ray]] are an example, discarded the song and dance motif in its effort to stand apart from mainstream cinema.\n\nThe Hindi film song now began to make its presence felt as a predominating characteristic in the culture of the nation and began to assume roles beyond the limited purview of cinema. In multi-cultural India, as per film historian Partha Chatterjee, \"the Hindi film song cut through all the language barriers in India, to engage in lively communication with the nation where more than twenty languages are spoken and ... scores of dialects exist\". Bollywood music has drawn its inspiration from numerous traditional sources such as ''[[Ramleela]]'', ''[[nautanki]]'', ''[[tamasha]]'' and [[Parsi theatre]], as well as from the West, Pakistan, and other Indic musical subcultures.\n\nFor over five decades, these songs formed the staple of popular music in South Asia and along with Hindi films, was an important cultural export to most countries around Asia and wherever the Indian diaspora had spread. The spread was galvanised by the advent of cheap plastic tape cassettes which were produced in the millions till the industry crashed in 2000. Even today Hindi film songs are available on radio, on television, as live music by performers, and on media, both old and new such as cassette tapes, compact disks and DVDs and are easily available, both legally and illegally, on the internet.\n\nThe Pakistani [[Qawwali]] musician [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] had a big impact on Bollywood music, inspiring numerous Indian musicians working in Bollywood, especially during the 1990s. However, there were many instances of Indian music directors plagiarising Khan's music to produce hit [[filmi]] songs.<ref name=\"nusrat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1418/14181230.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011230173145/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1418/14181230.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 December 2001|title=The stilled voice |author=Amit Baruah, R.

Notable Bollywood singers are [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Geeta Dutt]], [[Shamshad Begum]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Sadhana Sargam]] , [[Alka Yagnik]] and [[Shreya Goshal]] (female), and K. L. Saigal, Talat Mahmood, [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Manna Dey]], [[Hemant Kumar]], [[Kishore Kumar]], [[Kumar Sanu]], [[Udit Narayan]] and [[Sonu Nigam]] (male). Kishore Kumar and Mohammed Rafi have been considered the finest singers of Bollywood songs, followed by Lata Mangeshkar (who has recorded thousands of songs for Indian films in her six-decade career). Composers of film music, known as music directors, are also well-known. [[Remix]]ing of film songs with modern rhythms is common, and producers may release remixed versions of some of their films' songs with the films' soundtrack albums.\n\nDancing in Bollywood films, especially older films, is modeled on Indian dance: classical dance, dances of north-Indian courtesans ([[tawaif]]) or [[folk dance]]s. In modern films, Indian dance blends with Western dance styles as seen on MTV or in Broadway musicals; Western pop and classical-dance numbers are commonly seen side-by-side in the same film. The hero (or heroine) often performs with a troupe of supporting dancers. Many song-and-dance routines in Indian films contain unrealistically-quick shifts of location or changes of costume between verses of a song. If the hero and heroine dance and sing a duet, it is often staged in natural surroundings or architecturally-grand settings.\n\nSongs typically comment on the action taking place in the film. A song may be worked into the plot, so a character has a reason to sing. It may externalise a character's thoughts, or presage an event in the film (such as two characters falling in love). The songs are often referred to as a \"dream sequence\", with things happening which would not normally happen in the real world.

Some producers also release music videos, usually (but not always) with a song from the film.\n\n==Finances==\nBollywood films are multi-million dollar productions, with the most expensive productions costing up to {{INR}}1 billion (about US$20&nbsp;million). The science-fiction film ''[[Ra.One]]'' was made on a budget of {{INR}}1.35 billion (about $27 million), making it the most expensive Bollywood film of all time.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Times of India |author2=movie report |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-06/special-report/30366066_1_ke-liye-shah-rukh-khan-big-stars|accessdate=12 December 2011|work=The Times of India|title=It took me 20 years to be an overnight success: Shah Rukh Khan|date=6 November 2011}}</ref> [[Set (drama)|Sets]], costumes, special effects and [[cinematography]] were less than world-class, with some notable exceptions, until the mid-to-late 1990s. As Western films and television are more widely distributed in India, there is increased pressure for Bollywood films to reach the same production levels (particularly in action and special effects). Recent Bollywood films, like ''[[Krrish]]'' (2006), have employed international technicians such as Hong Kong-based action choreographer [[Tony Ching Siu-Tung|Tony Ching]]. The increasing accessibility of professional action and special effects, coupled with rising film budgets, have seen an increase in action and science-fiction films.\n\nSince overseas scenes are attractive at the box office, Mumbai film crews are filming in Australia, Canada, [[New Zealand]], the United Kingdom, the United States, [[Europe]] and elsewhere. Indian producers have also obtained funding for big-budget films shot in India, such as ''[[Lagaan]]'' and ''[[Devdas (2002 Hindi film)|Devdas]]''.\n\nFunding for Bollywood films often comes from private distributors and a few large [[Movie studio|studios]]. Although Indian banks and financial institutions had been forbidden from lending to film studios, the ban has been lifted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/mar/31sush.htm |title=I & B Ministry will help film industry |publisher=Rediff |date=31 March 2001 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> Finances are not regulated; some funding comes from illegitimate sources such as the Mumbai underworld, which is known to influence several prominent film personalities. Mumbai organised-crime hitmen shot [[Rakesh Roshan]], a film director and father of star [[Hrithik Roshan]], in January 2000. In 2001, the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] seized all prints of ''[[Chori Chori Chupke Chupke]]'' after the film was found to be funded by members of the Mumbai underworld.<ref>{{cite web|author=Singh, Vijay|title=Bharat Shah sentenced, but won't have to spend time in prison|date=1 October 2003|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/oct/01shah.htm|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|accessdate=14 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nAnother problem facing Bollywood is widespread [[copyright infringement]] of its films. Often, bootleg [[DVD#DVD Video|DVD]] copies of movies are available before they are released in cinemas. Manufacturing of bootleg DVD, VCD, and VHS copies of the latest movie titles is an established small-scale industry in parts of south and [[southeast Asia]]. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) estimates that the Bollywood industry loses $100 million annually from unlicensed home videos and DVDs. In addition to the homegrown market, demand for these copies is large amongst portions of the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]]. Bootleg copies are the only way people in Pakistan can watch Bollywood movies, since the Pakistani government has banned their sale, distribution and telecast. Films are frequently broadcast without compensation by small cable-TV companies in India and other parts of South Asia. Small convenience stores, run by members of the Indian diaspora in the US and the UK, regularly stock tapes and DVDs of dubious provenance; consumer copying adds to the problem. The availability of illegal copies of movies on the Internet also contributes to industry losses.\n\nSatellite TV, television and imported foreign films are making inroads into the domestic Indian entertainment market. In the past, most Bollywood films could make money; now, fewer do. Most Bollywood producers make money, however, recouping their investments from many sources of revenue (including the sale of ancillary rights). There are increasing returns from theatres in Western countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, where Bollywood is slowly being noticed. As more Indians migrate to these countries, they form a growing market for upscale Indian films. In 2002, Bollywood sold 3.6 billion tickets and had a total revenue (including theatre tickets, DVDs and television) of $1.3 billion; Hollywood films sold 2.6 billion tickets, and had a total revenue of $51 billion.\n\n==Advertising==\nA number of Indian artists hand-painted movie billboards and posters.

Unlike Europe and North America, where Indian films cater to the expatriate marke, Bollywood films became popular in West Africa despite the lack of a significant Indian audience. One possible explanation is cultural similarity: the wearing of turbans, animals in markets; porters carrying large bundles, and traditional wedding celebrations. Within Muslim culture, Indian movies were said to show \"respect\" toward women; Hollywood movies were seen as having \"no shame\". In Indian movies, women are modestly dressed; men and women rarely kiss and there is no [[nudity]], so the films are said to \"have culture\" which Hollywood lacks.

This was closely followed by ''Shirheen Farhad'' (1931) by [[Jamshedji Framji Madan]], also by Madan, which had as many as 42 song sequences strung together in the manner of an opera, and later by ''Indra Sabha'' which had as many as 69 song sequences. However, the practice subsided and subsequent films usually featured between six and ten songs in each production.\n\nRight from the advent of Indian cinema in 1931, musicals with song numbers have been a regular feature in Indian cinema. In 1934 Hindi film songs began to be recorded on gramophones and later, played on radio channels, giving rise to a new form of mass entertainment in India which was responsive to popular demand. Within the first few years itself, Hindi cinema had produced a variety of films which easily categorised into genres such as \"historicals\", \"mythologicals\", \"devotional, \"fantasy\" etc. but each having songs embedded in them such that it is incorrect to classify them as \"musicals\".\n\nThe Hindi song was such an integral features of Hindi mainstream cinema, besides other characteristics, that post-independence alternative cinema, of which the [[Satyajit Ray filmography|films]] of [[Satyajit Ray]] are an example, discarded the song and dance motif in its effort to stand apart from mainstream cinema.\n\nThe Hindi film song now began to make its presence felt as a predominating characteristic in the culture of the nation and began to assume roles beyond the limited purview of cinema. In multi-cultural India, as per film historian Partha Chatterjee, \"the Hindi film song cut through all the language barriers in India, to engage in lively communication with the nation where more than twenty languages are spoken and ... scores of dialects exist\". Bollywood music has drawn its inspiration from numerous traditional sources such as ''[[Ramleela]]'', ''[[nautanki]]'', ''[[tamasha]]'' and [[Parsi theatre]], as well as from the West, Pakistan, and other Indic musical subcultures.\n\nFor over five decades, these songs formed the staple of popular music in South Asia and along with Hindi films, was an important cultural export to most countries around Asia and wherever the Indian diaspora had spread. The spread was galvanised by the advent of cheap plastic tape cassettes which were produced in the millions till the industry crashed in 2000. Even today Hindi film songs are available on radio, on television, as live music by performers, and on media, both old and new such as cassette tapes, compact disks and DVDs and are easily available, both legally and illegally, on the internet.\n\nThe Pakistani [[Qawwali]] musician [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] had a big impact on Bollywood music, inspiring numerous Indian musicians working in Bollywood, especially during the 1990s. However, there were many instances of Indian music directors plagiarising Khan's music to produce hit [[filmi]] songs.<ref name=\"nusrat\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1418/14181230.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011230173145/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1418/14181230.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 December 2001|title=The stilled voice |author=Amit Baruah, R.

The Duchess came to visit Eliza in secret. Eliza named her firstborn daughter Georgiana.\n\nThe name Courtney, extinct since the death of Charles Kelland Courtney in 1761, was derived from her great-uncle, her maternal grandmother's brother, William Poyntz (d. 1809), having married Isabella (d. 1805), sister and co-heiress of the aforementioned Charles Courtney, the last of the west country family of ''Courtney of Trethurfe'' and ''Courtney of Tremeer''.\n\n==Upbringing==\n[[File:Duchess of Devonshire by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|Her mother with an elder sibling]]\n[[File:Charlesgrey2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Her father]]\n[[File:Stipple engraving of Georgiana Devonshire after Diana Beauclerk.jpg|thumb|Her mother, Georgiana, a stipple engraving (published 1782) after a drawing by [[Lady Diana Beauclerk]] dated 1779.]]\nEliza Courtney was born in France, in [[Aix-en-Provence]] on 20 February 1792. She was brought to [[Falloden]], Northumberland in northern England and adopted by [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|her paternal grandparents]]. Unlike her mother's legitimate children from her marriage, Eliza was not raised as part of the [[Devonshire House]] set in London. Her mother, Georgiana, could not acknowledge her daughter and visited her in secret until her own death. Several anguish-ridden poems from mother to daughter survive; two are reproduced below:\n\n<poem>\nAnd yet remote from public view flower there is of timid hue,\nBeneath a sacred shade it grows,\nBut sweet in native fragrance blows.\nFrom storms secure, from tempests free,\nBut ah! too seldom seen by me.\nFor scarce permitted to behold\nWith longing eyes each grace unfold.\n\nMy bosom struggles with its pain\nAnd checks the wishes form'd in vain;\nYet when I perchance supremely blest,\nI hold the floweret to my breast,\nEnraptur'd watch its purple glow\nAnd blessings (all I have) bestow.\nThe gentle fragrance soothes my care\nAnd fervent is my humble prayer\nThat no dread evil may beset\nMy sweet but hidden violet.<ref>(December 1805) Copied from Lord Bessborough's ''Georgiana'', 1955, appendix IV</ref>\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nUnhappy child of indiscretion,\npoor slumberer on a breast forlorn\npledge of reproof of past transgression\nDear tho' unfortunate to be born\n\nFor thee a suppliant wish addressing\nTo Heaven thy mother fain would dare\nBut conscious blushes stain the blessing\nAnd sighs suppress my broken prayer\n\nBut in spite of these my mind unshaken\nIn present duty turns to thee\nTho' long repented ne'er forgotten\nThy days shall lov'd and guarded be\n\nAnd should th'ungenerous world upbraid thee\nfor mine and for thy father's ill\nA nameless mother oft shall assist thee\nA hand unseen protect thee still\n\nAnd tho' to rank and wealth a stranger\nThy life a humble course must run\nSoon shalt thou learn to fly the danger\nWhich I too late have learnt to shun\n\nMeanwhile in these sequested vallies\nHere may'st thou live in safe content\nFor innocence may smile at malice\nAnd thou-Oh ! Thou art innocent<ref>copied from Foreman, 1998, page 267/8. From: ''Verses copied by Lady Charlotte Cholomondeley in her common place book, circa 1816''. Lady Charlotte (Seymour) was the mother-in-law of Eliza's daughter Georgiana.</ref>\n</poem>\n\nGeorgiana was allowed to see her daughter occasionally when the Greys brought Eliza to [[London]], and acted as a sort of unofficial [[godparent|godmother]].\n\nIn 1808, her maternal aunt [[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough]], who didn't know she was Eliza's aunt, visited the Greys and was dismayed at what she observed:\n\n{{Quote|Eliza is a fine girl, and will, I think, be handsome; but tho' they are kind to her, it goes to my heart to see her\u2014she is so evidently thrown into the background, and has such a look of mortification about her that it is not pleasant, yet ''he'' [Charles Grey] seems very fond of her. Lord B. [Harriet's husband] has this moment ask'd me whether she is not the Governess.}}\n\nEliza was not informed of her true parentage until after the death of [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]].\n\n==Husband==\nIn 1809 her \"quasi-sister\" (but actual aunt) Lady Hannah Althea Grey, widow of [[George Edmund Byron Bettesworth]], married the [[Member of Parliament]] and trader the [[The Right Honourable|Rt. Hon.]] [[Edward Ellice, Sr.|Edward \"Bear\" Ellice]] (1783&ndash;1863). Five years later, on 10 December 1814 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[North Yorkshire]], Eliza married Lt. Col. [[Robert Ellice|Robert Charles Ellice]], a younger brother of her \"brother-in-law\" Edward Ellice. Their father was the [[Scottish people|Scots-born]] Alexander Ellice (1743&ndash;1805) of Bath, London and [[Montreal]], a partner in the [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]] firm of Phyn, Ellice & Co.\n\nIn March 1814, [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|Lord Broughton]] recorded meeting Eliza at dinner and described her as:\n\n{{Quote|the daughter of the late Duchess of Devonshire by Lord Grey, \u2026 a fine girl, sensible and talkative, and easy mannered.}}\n\nRobert Ellice had a distinguished military career, rising from the [[military rank]] of \"[[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]\" to General. \n{|\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" | Rank \n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n|-\n| Ensign &nbsp;\n|&nbsp; 8 November 1798\n|-\n| Captain &nbsp;\n|&nbsp; 4 May 1801\n|-\n| Major &nbsp;\n|&nbsp; 12 May 1808\n|- \n| Lt.

He died 18 June 1856.\n\n==Children==\nEliza Courtney, Mrs Ellice, had three daughters and two sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Eliza-Courtenay/6000000003275515569|title=Eliza Courtenay Ellice|website=geni_family_tree}}</ref>\n\n===Georgiana===\nHer daughter '''Georgiana''' was born on 12 October 1817. On 4 November 1846, Georgiana Ellice married Hugh Horatio Seymour (1821&ndash;1892). Seymour was the son of Lt. Col. Hugh Henry Seymour (1790&ndash;1821), himself son of [[Lord Hugh Seymour|Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour]] (1759&ndash;1801), who was the fifth son of the [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|first Marquess of Hertford]] by his marriage to Charlotte Cholmondeley, daughter of the [[George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley|first Marquess of Cholmondeley]].  \n\nHis grandson was [[Horace James Seymour|Sir Horace James Seymour]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]] [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (1885\u20131978), a diplomat who was British Minister in [[Tehran]] from 1936 to 1939 and [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to China|British Ambassador to China]], 1942 to 1946.  One of Sir Horace's grandsons, James Seymour (born 1956) is married to [[Anya Hindmarch]].\n\n===Eliza===\nEliza had another daughter, also named '''Eliza''', the following year, in 1818. This Eliza married [[Henry Bouverie William Brand]] (1814&ndash;1892) in 1838. After a distinguished speakership of the House of Commons, Eliza's husband was created [[Viscount Hampden]]; later still he inherited from his brother the [[Baron Dacre|Barony of Dacre]], as 23rd in line. Descendants include the present [[John Charles Dodson, 3rd Baron Monk Bretton|Lord Monk Bretton]]; [[Sarah, Duchess of York]] and her daughters [[Princess Beatrice of York]] and [[Princess Eugenie]]; and [[Anthony David Brand, 6th Viscount Hampden|Viscount Hampden]]. Eliza Ellice Brand died on 8 March 1899 at Pelham House, [[Lewes]].\n\n===Alexandra===\nAlexandra married the Rev. H. Harvey.<ref>Bessaborough, 1955, appendix IV, p.295</ref>\n\n===Robert===\nEliza's first son, '''Robert''', was born on 1 January 1816. In March 1853, he married Eglantine Charlotte Louisa Balfour (died 18 April 1907), third daughter of [[General Robert Balfour of Balbirnie|Lt-General Robert Balfour of Balbirnie]]. Robert Ellice died on 19 December 1858.\n\nIn 1880 his son, Major Edward Charles Ellice, [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (1917/8), J.P., M.P. (1903-6, Liberal, [[St Andrews Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|St. Andrews Boroughs]]), (1858\u20131934) succeeded his first cousin once removed, [[Edward Ellice (Scottish politician)|Edward Ellice II]], to the Ellice estate at [[Invergarry]], Inverness-shire.\n\nIn April 1889 Major Edward Charles Ellice married another [[first cousin once removed]], Margaret Georgiana Freeman Thomas (died 1929), daughter of Frederick Freeman Thomas by his wife Mabel Brand, daughter of the 1st [[Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden|Viscount Hampden]]. Like him Margaret Georgiana was a descendant of Eliza Courtney, through Eliza's second daughter Eliza. Her brother was [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Freeman Freeman-Thomas]], [[Viceroy of India]] and was created 1st [[Marquess of Willingdon]].\n\nTheir fifth son, Russell (1902\u20131989) succeeded his father, his four elder brothers having perished young: three of them in the 1914-1918 war. [One was in the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|Cameron Highlanders]] (killed in action), one was in the Grenadiers (killed in action) and the third was lost on [[HMS Bulwark (1899)|HMS Bulwark]].]\n\n===Charles===\nEliza's second son, [[Charles Ellice|Charles Henry]], was born in 1823 in [[Florence]]. Charles followed his father into the [[24th Regiment of Foot]] and was sometime [[Quartermaster-General]] and then [[Adjutant-General to the Forces]]. He married Louisa Caroline Lambton, a daughter of William Henry Lambton and niece of the [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|1st Earl of Durham]]. Thom's ''[[Upper Ten Thousand]]'' for 1876 lists him as of Horningsheath, [[Bury St Edmunds]]. He was subject of [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] treatment, 20 October 1877. Lt. Gen. Sir Charles Henry Ellice, KCB died in 1888.\n\n==Death==\nEliza died a widow in Norwood, Surrey, on 2 May, 1859, at the age of 67. \"Norwood in Surrey\" in this case is [[Upper Norwood]]; [[South Norwood]]; [[West Norwood]]; or [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]].\n\nEliza Courtney's descendants include [[Sarah, Duchess of York]] and her daughters [[Princess Beatrice of York|Princesses Beatrice]] and [[Princess Eugenie of York|Eugenie of York]], who are eighth<ref>[[Princess Beatrice of York]]</ref> and ninth<ref>[[Princess Eugenie of York]]</ref> in line to the British throne, respectively.\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

The Duchess came to visit Eliza in secret. Eliza named her firstborn daughter Georgiana.\n\nThe name Courtney, extinct since the death of Charles Kelland Courtney in 1761, was derived from her great-uncle, her maternal grandmother's brother, William Poyntz (d. 1809), having married Isabella (d. 1805), sister and co-heiress of the aforementioned Charles Courtney, the last of the west country family of ''Courtney of Trethurfe'' and ''Courtney of Tremeer''.\n\n==Upbringing==\n[[File:Duchess of Devonshire by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|Her mother with an elder sibling]]\n[[File:Charlesgrey2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Her father]]\n[[File:Stipple engraving of Georgiana Devonshire after Diana Beauclerk.jpg|thumb|Her mother, Georgiana, a stipple engraving (published 1782) after a drawing by [[Lady Diana Beauclerk]] dated 1779.]]\nEliza Courtney was born in France, in [[Aix-en-Provence]] on 20 February 1792. She was brought to [[Falloden]], Northumberland in northern England and adopted by [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|her paternal grandparents]]. Unlike her mother's legitimate children from her marriage, Eliza was not raised as part of the [[Devonshire House]] set in London. Her mother, Georgiana, could not acknowledge her daughter and visited her in secret until her own death. Several anguish-ridden poems from mother to daughter survive; two are reproduced below:\n\n<poem>\nAnd yet remote from public view flower there is of timid hue,\nBeneath a sacred shade it grows,\nBut sweet in native fragrance blows.\nFrom storms secure, from tempests free,\nBut ah! too seldom seen by me.\nFor scarce permitted to behold\nWith longing eyes each grace unfold.\n\nMy bosom struggles with its pain\nAnd checks the wishes form'd in vain;\nYet when I perchance supremely blest,\nI hold the floweret to my breast,\nEnraptur'd watch its purple glow\nAnd blessings (all I have) bestow.\nThe gentle fragrance soothes my care\nAnd fervent is my humble prayer\nThat no dread evil may beset\nMy sweet but hidden violet.<ref>(December 1805) Copied from Lord Bessborough's ''Georgiana'', 1955, appendix IV</ref>\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nUnhappy child of indiscretion,\npoor slumberer on a breast forlorn\npledge of reproof of past transgression\nDear tho' unfortunate to be born\n\nFor thee a suppliant wish addressing\nTo Heaven thy mother fain would dare\nBut conscious blushes stain the blessing\nAnd sighs suppress my broken prayer\n\nBut in spite of these my mind unshaken\nIn present duty turns to thee\nTho' long repented ne'er forgotten\nThy days shall lov'd and guarded be\n\nAnd should th'ungenerous world upbraid thee\nfor mine and for thy father's ill\nA nameless mother oft shall assist thee\nA hand unseen protect thee still\n\nAnd tho' to rank and wealth a stranger\nThy life a humble course must run\nSoon shalt thou learn to fly the danger\nWhich I too late have learnt to shun\n\nMeanwhile in these sequested vallies\nHere may'st thou live in safe content\nFor innocence may smile at malice\nAnd thou-Oh ! Thou art innocent<ref>copied from Foreman, 1998, page 267/8. From: ''Verses copied by Lady Charlotte Cholomondeley in her common place book, circa 1816''. Lady Charlotte (Seymour) was the mother-in-law of Eliza's daughter Georgiana.</ref>\n</poem>\n\nGeorgiana was allowed to see her daughter occasionally when the Greys brought Eliza to [[London]], and acted as a sort of unofficial [[godparent|godmother]].\n\nIn 1808, her maternal aunt [[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough]], who didn't know she was Eliza's aunt, visited the Greys and was dismayed at what she observed:\n\n{{Quote|Eliza is a fine girl, and will, I think, be handsome; but tho' they are kind to her, it goes to my heart to see her\u2014she is so evidently thrown into the background, and has such a look of mortification about her that it is not pleasant, yet ''he'' [Charles Grey] seems very fond of her. Lord B. [Harriet's husband] has this moment ask'd me whether she is not the Governess.}}\n\nEliza was not informed of her true parentage until after the death of [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire]].\n\n==Husband==\nIn 1809 her \"quasi-sister\" (but actual aunt) Lady Hannah Althea Grey, widow of [[George Edmund Byron Bettesworth]], married the [[Member of Parliament]] and trader the [[The Right Honourable|Rt. Hon.]] [[Edward Ellice, Sr.|Edward \"Bear\" Ellice]] (1783&ndash;1863). Five years later, on 10 December 1814 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[North Yorkshire]], Eliza married Lt. Col. [[Robert Ellice|Robert Charles Ellice]], a younger brother of her \"brother-in-law\" Edward Ellice. Their father was the [[Scottish people|Scots-born]] Alexander Ellice (1743&ndash;1805) of Bath, London and [[Montreal]], a partner in the [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[New York (state)|New York]] firm of Phyn, Ellice & Co.\n\nIn March 1814, [[John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton|Lord Broughton]] recorded meeting Eliza at dinner and described her as:\n\n{{Quote|the daughter of the late Duchess of Devonshire by Lord Grey, \u2026 a fine girl, sensible and talkative, and easy mannered.}}\n\nRobert Ellice had a distinguished military career, rising from the [[military rank]] of \"[[Ensign (rank)|ensign]]\" to General. \n{|\n|+\n! scope=\"col\" | Rank \n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n|-\n| Ensign &nbsp;\n|&nbsp; 8 November 1798\n|-\n| Captain &nbsp;\n|&nbsp; 4 May 1801\n|-\n| Major &nbsp;\n|&nbsp; 12 May 1808\n|- \n| Lt.

He died 18 June 1856.\n\n==Children==\nEliza Courtney, Mrs Ellice, had three daughters and two sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Eliza-Courtenay/6000000003275515569|title=Eliza Courtenay Ellice|website=geni_family_tree}}</ref>\n\n===Georgiana===\nHer daughter '''Georgiana''' was born on 12 October 1817. On 4 November 1846, Georgiana Ellice married Hugh Horatio Seymour (1821&ndash;1892). Seymour was the son of Lt. Col. Hugh Henry Seymour (1790&ndash;1821), himself son of [[Lord Hugh Seymour|Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour]] (1759&ndash;1801), who was the fifth son of the [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford|first Marquess of Hertford]] by his marriage to Charlotte Cholmondeley, daughter of the [[George Cholmondeley, 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley|first Marquess of Cholmondeley]].  \n\nHis grandson was [[Horace James Seymour|Sir Horace James Seymour]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|GCMG]] [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (1885\u20131978), a diplomat who was British Minister in [[Tehran]] from 1936 to 1939 and [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to China|British Ambassador to China]], 1942 to 1946.  One of Sir Horace's grandsons, James Seymour (born 1956) is married to [[Anya Hindmarch]].\n\n===Eliza===\nEliza had another daughter, also named '''Eliza''', the following year, in 1818. This Eliza married [[Henry Bouverie William Brand]] (1814&ndash;1892) in 1838. After a distinguished speakership of the House of Commons, Eliza's husband was created [[Viscount Hampden]]; later still he inherited from his brother the [[Baron Dacre|Barony of Dacre]], as 23rd in line. Descendants include the present [[John Charles Dodson, 3rd Baron Monk Bretton|Lord Monk Bretton]]; [[Sarah, Duchess of York]] and her daughters [[Princess Beatrice of York]] and [[Princess Eugenie]]; and [[Anthony David Brand, 6th Viscount Hampden|Viscount Hampden]]. Eliza Ellice Brand died on 8 March 1899 at Pelham House, [[Lewes]].\n\n===Alexandra===\nAlexandra married the Rev. H. Harvey.<ref>Bessaborough, 1955, appendix IV, p.295</ref>\n\n===Robert===\nEliza's first son, '''Robert''', was born on 1 January 1816. In March 1853, he married Eglantine Charlotte Louisa Balfour (died 18 April 1907), third daughter of [[General Robert Balfour of Balbirnie|Lt-General Robert Balfour of Balbirnie]]. Robert Ellice died on 19 December 1858.\n\nIn 1880 his son, Major Edward Charles Ellice, [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (1917/8), J.P., M.P. (1903-6, Liberal, [[St Andrews Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|St. Andrews Boroughs]]), (1858\u20131934) succeeded his first cousin once removed, [[Edward Ellice (Scottish politician)|Edward Ellice II]], to the Ellice estate at [[Invergarry]], Inverness-shire.\n\nIn April 1889 Major Edward Charles Ellice married another [[first cousin once removed]], Margaret Georgiana Freeman Thomas (died 1929), daughter of Frederick Freeman Thomas by his wife Mabel Brand, daughter of the 1st [[Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden|Viscount Hampden]]. Like him Margaret Georgiana was a descendant of Eliza Courtney, through Eliza's second daughter Eliza. Her brother was [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Freeman Freeman-Thomas]], [[Viceroy of India]] and was created 1st [[Marquess of Willingdon]].\n\nTheir fifth son, Russell (1902\u20131989) succeeded his father, his four elder brothers having perished young: three of them in the 1914-1918 war. [One was in the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders|Cameron Highlanders]] (killed in action), one was in the Grenadiers (killed in action) and the third was lost on [[HMS Bulwark (1899)|HMS Bulwark]].]\n\n===Charles===\nEliza's second son, [[Charles Ellice|Charles Henry]], was born in 1823 in [[Florence]]. Charles followed his father into the [[24th Regiment of Foot]] and was sometime [[Quartermaster-General]] and then [[Adjutant-General to the Forces]]. He married Louisa Caroline Lambton, a daughter of William Henry Lambton and niece of the [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|1st Earl of Durham]]. Thom's ''[[Upper Ten Thousand]]'' for 1876 lists him as of Horningsheath, [[Bury St Edmunds]]. He was subject of [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] treatment, 20 October 1877. Lt. Gen. Sir Charles Henry Ellice, KCB died in 1888.\n\n==Death==\nEliza died a widow in Norwood, Surrey, aged 67. \"Norwood in Surrey\" in this case is [[Upper Norwood]]; [[South Norwood]]; [[West Norwood]]; or [[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]].\n\nEliza Courtney's descendants include [[Sarah, Duchess of York]] and her daughters [[Princess Beatrice of York|Princesses Beatrice]] and [[Princess Eugenie of York|Eugenie of York]], who are eighth<ref>[[Princess Beatrice of York]]</ref> and ninth<ref>[[Princess Eugenie of York]]</ref> in line to the British throne, respectively.\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

In the past, the city was also among Russia's principal production sites for chemical weapons. Owing to its strategic significance, this city was, until recently, [[closed city|officially closed]] to foreign visitors.\n\nManufacture of various chemical weapons started in 1941, particularly concentrating on the production of [[lewisite]]\u2014the poisonous effects of which are owed to its arsenic trioxide content\u2014and [[yperite]] ([[mustard gas]]). The factory producing these substances was called the ''Kaprolactam'' (or ''Caprolaktam'') Organic Glass Factory, and in addition to its [[arsenic]]-based weapons, also produced [[prussic acid]] and [[phosgene]].\n\nChemical weapons production at Dzerzhinsk ceased in 1965. Some materials were transferred to storage units, while large amounts of waste material\u2014frequently containing high concentrations of [[arsenic]]\u2014were buried in dumps on the site of the factory. Full dismantling of the yperite facility was commenced in 1994. As of 1998, the lewisite production unit was still not completely disassembled.\n\n{{As of|2008}}, Dzerzhinsk had 38 large industrial enterprises, which export their goods worldwide. About one thousand varieties of chemical products are produced in Dzerzhinsk. The largest factories, which exist {{As of|2012|lc=y}} or existed in the past, include:\n*''[[Yakov Sverdlov|Sverdlov]] Plant, FSE (Federal State Enterprise)'' manufactures munitions, battle and industrial explosives, and chemicals for industrial purposes (phenol-formaldehyde resin, [[epoxy resin]], carbamide-furane resin, plasticizers, hardeners of various modifications, [[nitrobenzene]], sulphanole, [[acetic anhydride]], various cleaners and detergents, as well as other products). The plant is included in the presidential list of the country's strategic enterprises.

In the past, the city was also among Russia's principal production sites for chemical weapons. Owing to its strategic significance, this city was, until recently, [[closed city|officially closed]] to foreign visitors.\n\nManufacture of various chemical weapons started in 1941, particularly concentrating on the production of [[lewisite]]\u2014the poisonous effects of which are owed to its arsenic trioxide content\u2014and [[yperite]] ([[mustard gas]]). The factory producing these substances was called the ''Kaprolactam'' (or ''Caprolaktam'') Organic Glass Factory, and in addition to its [[arsenic]]-based weapons, also produced [[prussic acid]] and [[phosgene]].\n\nChemical weapons production at Dzerzhinsk ceased in 1965. Some materials were transferred to storage units, while large amounts of waste material\u2014frequently containing high concentrations of [[arsenic]]\u2014were buried in dumps on the site of the factory. Full dismantling of the yperite facility was commenced in 1994. As of 1998, the lewisite production unit was still not completely disassembled.\n\n{{As of|2008}}, Dzerzhinsk had 38 large industrial enterprises, which export their goods worldwide. About one thousand varieties of chemical products are produced in Dzerzhinsk. The largest factories, which exist {{As of|2012|lc=y}} or existed in the past, include:\n*''[[Yakov Sverdlov|Sverdlov]] Plant, FSE (Federal State Enterprise)'' manufactures munitions, battle and industrial explosives, and chemicals for industrial purposes (phenol-formaldehyde resin, [[epoxy resin]], carbamide-furane resin, plasticizers, hardeners of various modifications, [[nitrobenzene]], sulphanole, [[acetic anhydride]], various cleaners and detergents, as well as other products). The plant is included in the presidential list of the country's strategic enterprises.

Measuring {{cvt|7.6|ha|acre}} in area, it is the largest square in the French capital. It is located in the city's [[8th arrondissement of Paris|eighth arrondissement]], at the eastern end of the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]. It was the site of many notable public executions, including the execution of [[King Louis XVI]], during the [[French Revolution]].\n\n== History ==\n== USA does not exist ==\nI have know idea what people are talking about when they say ''the states'' because that is just a large pile of poo. The USA does not exist and you know that, just except the truth thst ''The United states of America'' does not exist\n===Design===\nThe place was designed by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]] in 1755 as a moat-skirted [[octagon]] between the Champs-Elys\u00e9es to the west and the [[Tuileries Garden]] to the east. Decorated with statues and fountains, the area was named the ''Place Louis XV'' to honor the king at that time. The square showcased an equestrian statue of the king, which had been commissioned in 1748 by the city of Paris, sculpted mostly by [[Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon]], and completed by [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]] after the death of Bouchardon.\n\nAt the north end, two magnificent identical stone buildings were constructed. Separated by the [[Rue Royale, Paris|rue Royale]], these structures remain among the best examples of [[Louis Quinze]] style architecture. Initially, the eastern building served as the [[French Naval Ministry]]. Shortly after its construction, the western building became the opulent home of the Duc d'Aumont. It was later purchased by the Comte de Crillon, whose family resided there until 1907. The famous luxury [[H\u00f4tel de Crillon]], which currently occupies the building, took its name from its previous owners.\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n\nDuring the  [[French Revolution]] in 1789 the statue of [[Louis XV of France]] was torn down and the area renamed the '''Place de la R\u00e9volution'''. The new revolutionary government erected a [[guillotine]] in the square, and it was here that [[Execution of Louis XVI|King Louis XVI was executed]] on 21 January 1793.\n\nOther important figures guillotined on the site, often in front of cheering crowds, were Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Princess \u00c9lisabeth of France]], [[Charlotte Corday]], [[Madame du Barry]], [[Georges Danton]], [[Camille Desmoulins]], [[Antoine Lavoisier]], [[Maximilien Robespierre]], [[Louis de Saint-Just]], and [[Olympe de Gouges]].\n\n[[File:Place Louis XVI plaque.jpg|thumb|The old plaque, for \"Place Louis XVI\", and replacement plaque at the corner of [[H\u00f4tel de Crillon]]]]\n[[Image:Place de la Concorde fountain dsc00774.jpg|thumb| The Fountain of River Commerce and Navigation, one of the two [[Fontaines de la Concorde]] (1840) on the Place de la Concorde.

It is one of two the Egyptian government gave to the French in the 19th century. The other one stayed in Egypt, too difficult and heavy to move to France with the technology at that time. In the 1990s, President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] gave the second obelisk back to the Egyptians.\n\nThe obelisk once marked the entrance to the [[Luxor Temple]]. The self-declared [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], offered the 3,300-year-old [[Luxor]] Obelisk to France in 1829. It arrived in Paris on 21 December 1833. Three years later, on 25 October 1836, King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] had it placed in the center of Place de la Concorde.\n\nThe obelisk, a yellow [[granite]] column, rises {{convert|23|m|ft|0}} high, including the base, and weighs over {{convert|250|t|ST|lk=on}}. Given the technical limitations of the day, transporting it was no easy feat \u2014 on the pedestal are drawn diagrams explaining the machinery that was used for the transportation. The obelisk is flanked on both sides by fountains constructed at the time of its erection on the Place.\n\nMissing its original cap, believed stolen in the 6th century BC, the government of France added a gold-leafed pyramid cap to the top of the obelisk in 1998.\n\n== The fountains ==\n[[File:Fontaine de la place de la Concorde Paris 04 07 97 8x6.jpg|thumb|right|Fountain of River Commerce and Navigation (1840) with the [[Eiffel Tower]] in the background.]]\n{{Main|Fontaines de la Concorde}}\nThe two fountains in the Place de la Concorde have been the most famous of the fountains built during the time of [[Louis-Philippe]], and came to symbolize the [[fountains in Paris]].   They were designed by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], a student of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical designer]] [[Charles Percier]] at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]]. The German-born Hittorff had served as the official Architect of Festivals and Ceremonies for the deposed King, and had spent two years studying the architecture and fountains of Italy.\n\nHittorff's two fountains were on the theme of rivers and seas, in part because of their proximity to the Ministry of Navy, and to the [[Seine]]. Their arrangement, on a north-south axis aligned with the Obelisk of Luxor and the Rue Royale, and the form of the fountains themselves, were influenced by the fountains of Rome, particularly [[Piazza Navona]] and the Piazza San Pietro, both of which had obelisks aligned with fountains.\n\nBoth fountains had the same form: a stone basin; six figures of [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]] or [[naiad]]s holding fish spouting water; six seated allegorical figures, their feet on the prows of ships, supporting the pedestal, of the circular ''vasque''; four statues of different forms of genius in arts or crafts supporting the upper inverted upper vasque; whose water shot up and then cascaded down to the lower vasque and then the basin.\n\nThe north fountain was devoted to the Rivers, with allegorical figures representing the [[Rhone]] and the [[Rhine]], the arts of the harvesting of flowers and fruits, harvesting and grape growing; and the geniuses of river navigation, industry, and agriculture.\n\nThe south fountain, closer to the Seine, represented the seas, with figures representing the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; harvesting coral; harvesting fish; collecting shellfish; collecting pearls; and the geniuses of astronomy, navigation and commerce.<ref>Beatrice Lamoitier, ''L'essor des fontaines monumentales'', in ''Paris et ses fontaines'', pg. 173.</ref>\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nIn the 1961 experimental documentary ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]'', [[Marceline Loridan-Ivens]] walks through the Place de la Concorde while reflecting on memories of her father and her time in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]].\n\nIn the ''[[Star Trek]]'' novels, the Place de la Concorde is the location of the offices of the President and the Council of the [[United Federation of Planets]].\n\nIn ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', Andrea Sachs throws her phone into one of the [[Fontaines de la Concorde]].\n\n''Angel'', the seventh book in the ''[[Maximum Ride]]'' novel series, includes the Place de la Concorde as a rally area to a crime organization known as the Doomsday Group.\n\nIn the video game ''[[Tom Clancy's EndWar]]'', the Place de la Concorde is across the bridge from the spawn point and is a major firefight zone.

After the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 the name was returned to ''Place de la Concorde'' and has remained that way since.\n\n== Features ==\n[[File:Paris - Place de la Concorde vue de la Terrasse des Tuileries.jpg|thumb|Place de la Concorde as seen from la Terrasse des Tuileries ''ca'' 1900]]\n* To the west of the Place is the famous [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]].\n* To the east of the Place are the [[Tuileries Gardens]].

It is one of two the Egyptian government gave to the French in the 19th century. The other one stayed in Egypt, too difficult and heavy to move to France with the technology at that time. In the 1990s, President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] gave the second obelisk back to the Egyptians.\n\nThe obelisk once marked the entrance to the [[Luxor Temple]]. The self-declared [[Khedive]] of [[Egypt]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], offered the 3,300-year-old [[Luxor]] Obelisk to France in 1829. It arrived in Paris on 21 December 1833. Three years later, on 25 October 1836, King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] had it placed in the center of Place de la Concorde.\n\nThe obelisk, a yellow [[granite]] column, rises {{convert|23|m|ft|0}} high, including the base, and weighs over {{convert|250|t|ST|lk=on}}. Given the technical limitations of the day, transporting it was no easy feat \u2014 on the pedestal are drawn diagrams explaining the machinery that was used for the transportation. The obelisk is flanked on both sides by fountains constructed at the time of its erection on the Place.\n\nMissing its original cap, believed stolen in the 6th century BC, the government of France added a gold-leafed pyramid cap to the top of the obelisk in 1998.\n\n== The fountains ==\n[[File:Fontaine de la place de la Concorde Paris 04 07 97 8x6.jpg|thumb|right|Fountain of River Commerce and Navigation (1840) with the [[Eiffel Tower]] in the background.]]\n{{Main|Fontaines de la Concorde}}\nThe two fountains in the Place de la Concorde have been the most famous of the fountains built during the time of [[Louis-Philippe]], and came to symbolize the [[fountains in Paris]].   They were designed by [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], a student of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical designer]] [[Charles Percier]] at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]]. The German-born Hittorff had served as the official Architect of Festivals and Ceremonies for the deposed King, and had spent two years studying the architecture and fountains of Italy.\n\nHittorff's two fountains were on the theme of rivers and seas, in part because of their proximity to the Ministry of Navy, and to the [[Seine]]. Their arrangement, on a north-south axis aligned with the Obelisk of Luxor and the Rue Royale, and the form of the fountains themselves, were influenced by the fountains of Rome, particularly [[Piazza Navona]] and the Piazza San Pietro, both of which had obelisks aligned with fountains.\n\nBoth fountains had the same form: a stone basin; six figures of [[Triton (mythology)|tritons]] or [[naiad]]s holding fish spouting water; six seated allegorical figures, their feet on the prows of ships, supporting the pedestal, of the circular ''vasque''; four statues of different forms of genius in arts or crafts supporting the upper inverted upper vasque; whose water shot up and then cascaded down to the lower vasque and then the basin.\n\nThe north fountain was devoted to the Rivers, with allegorical figures representing the [[Rhone]] and the [[Rhine]], the arts of the harvesting of flowers and fruits, harvesting and grape growing; and the geniuses of river navigation, industry, and agriculture.\n\nThe south fountain, closer to the Seine, represented the seas, with figures representing the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; harvesting coral; harvesting fish; collecting shellfish; collecting pearls; and the geniuses of astronomy, navigation and commerce.<ref>Beatrice Lamoitier, ''L'essor des fontaines monumentales'', in ''Paris et ses fontaines'', pg. 173.</ref>\n\n== References in popular culture ==\nIn the 1961 experimental documentary ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]'', [[Marceline Loridan-Ivens]] walks through the Place de la Concorde while reflecting on memories of her father and her time in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]].\n\nIn the ''[[Star Trek]]'' novels, the Place de la Concorde is the location of the offices of the President and the Council of the [[United Federation of Planets]].\n\nIn ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'', Andrea Sachs throws her phone into one of the [[Fontaines de la Concorde]].\n\n''Angel'', the seventh book in the ''[[Maximum Ride]]'' novel series, includes the Place de la Concorde as a rally area to a crime organization known as the Doomsday Group.\n\nIn the video game ''[[Tom Clancy's EndWar]]'', the Place de la Concorde is across the bridge from the spawn point and is a major firefight zone.

The packages, called ''snaps'', and the tool for using them, snapd, work across a range of [[Linux distribution]]s allowing distribution-agnostic [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] software packaging. Snappy was originally designed for [[Ubuntu Touch]]. The system is designed to work for [[internet of things]], cloud and [[desktop computing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://snapcraft.io/|title=Snapcraft - Snaps are universal Linux packages|website=Snapcraft}}</ref>\n\n==Functionality==\nSnap application packages of software are [[Portable application|self-contained]] and work across a range of [[Linux distribution]]s. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] or [[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|YUM]], which require specifically adapted packages for each Linux distribution therefore adding delay between application development and its deployment for end-users.<ref>[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/578045 Upgrading packaged Ubuntu application unreasonably involves upgrading entire OS Bug #578045] on bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu by John King (2010-05-10)</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PmHRSeA2c8&t=581 Linus Torvalds on the problems of distro packaging] [[Linus Torvalds]] on [[DebConf]] 2014</ref>\n\nSnaps themselves have no dependency on any \"[[app store]]\", can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] software deployment.

The packages, called ''snaps'', and the tool for using them, snapd, work across a range of [[Linux distribution]]s allowing distribution-agnostic [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] software packaging. Snappy was originally designed for [[Ubuntu Touch]]. The system is designed to work for [[internet of things]], cloud and [[desktop computing]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://snapcraft.io/|title=Snapcraft - Snaps are universal Linux packages|website=Snapcraft}}</ref>\n\n==Functionality==\nSnap application packages of software are [[Portable application|self-contained]] and work across a range of [[Linux distribution]]s. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] or [[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|YUM]], which require specifically adapted packages for each Linux distribution therefore adding delay between application development and its deployment for end-users.<ref>[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/578045 Upgrading packaged Ubuntu application unreasonably involves upgrading entire OS Bug #578045] on bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu by John King (2010-05-10)</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PmHRSeA2c8&t=581 Linus Torvalds on the problems of distro packaging] [[Linus Torvalds]] on [[DebConf]] 2014</ref>\n\nSnaps themselves have no dependency on any \"[[app store]]\", can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for [[Upstream (software development)|upstream]] software deployment. When snaps are deployed on [[Ubuntu]] and other versions of Linux, the snap store<ref>https://snapcraft.io/store</ref> is used as the back-end.\n\nSnaps introduces channels which define which release of a snap is installed and tracked for updates.<ref>https://snapcraft.io/docs/channels</ref>\n\nDevelopers can use snaps to create command line tools and background services as well as desktop applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/04/20/canonical-unveils-6th-lts-release-of-ubuntu-with-16-04/|title=Canonical unveils 6th LTS release of Ubuntu with 16.04|website=Ubuntu Insights|publisher=[[Canonical (company)|Canonical Ltd.]]|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref> With snap applications, upgrades via [[atomic operation]] or by [[delta encoding|deltas]] are possible.{{r|sw-ann}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Willis|first1=Nathan|title=Ubuntu Core and Snappy|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/630660/|accessdate=7 November 2015|work=[[Linux Weekly News]]|date=28 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ubuntu.com/core|title=Ubuntu Core|website=Ubuntu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-snap-takes-charge-of-linux-desktop-and-iot-software-distribution/|title=Ubuntu Snap takes charge of Linux desktop and IoT software distribution|first=Steven J.|last=Vaughan-Nichols|website=ZDNet}}</ref>\n\nWith the use  of \u2018content snaps\u2019 developers can enable snaps to share programs and data so to reduce library, framework and in general dependency redundancy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://snapcraft.io/docs/content-interface|title=The content interface|website=Snapcraft|language=en|access-date=2020-4-29}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2016, snapd was ported to a wide range of Linux distributions to enable snaps to be used across any Linux distribution, not just the all-snap Ubuntu Core. snapd is also available or in progress for [[Arch Linux]], [[CentOS]], [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Solus (operating system)|Solus]], [[Manjaro Linux]],  [[Linux Mint]], [[OpenEmbedded]], [[Raspbian]], [[OpenWrt]] and [[openSUSE]].\n\nEach distribution is able to interpret the snap metadata to implement the security or other expectations of the snap in a distribution-specific fashion.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Snapcraft===\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = snapcraft\n| logo                   = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| logo alt               = \n| screenshot             = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| screenshot alt         = \n| caption                = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = \n| developer              = [[Canonical (company)|Canonical Ltd.]]\n| released               = {{Start date and age|2015|10|29|df=yes}}{{r|sw-ann}}\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = 3.11<ref name=SNAPCRAFTLATEST>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/releases|title=Releases \u00b7 snapcore/snapcraft|website=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2020|03|18|df=yes}}\n| programming language   = [[Python (programming language)|Python]]\n| operating system       = [[Linux]]\n| platform               = \n| size                   = \n| language               = \n| language count         = <!-- Number only -->\n| language footnote      = \n| license                = [[GNU General Public License#Version 3|GPLv3]]\n| alexa                  = \n| website                = {{URL|https://snapcraft.io}}\n| standard               = \n| AsOf                   = \n}}\n\nSnapcraft is a tool for developers to package their programs in the Snap format for Snappy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brodkin|first1=Jon|title=Adios apt and yum?

In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} to less than {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. In its descent to sea level, the river falls to an altitude of {{convert|305|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} at Yibin, Sichuan, the head of navigation for riverboats, and to {{convert|192|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} at Chongqing (Chungking). Between Chongqing and Yichang (I-ch'ang), at an altitude of {{convert|40|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} and a distance of about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}}, it passes through the spectacular [[Yangtze Gorges]], which are noted for their natural beauty but are dangerous to shipping.\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at [[Yibin]]. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through [[Mount Wushan]] bordering [[Chongqing]] and [[Hubei]] to create the famous [[Three Gorges]]. Eastward of the Three Gorges, [[Yichang]] is the first city on the [[Yangtze Plain]].\n\nAfter entering Hubei, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is [[Dongting Lake]], which is located on the border of [[Hunan]] and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At [[Wuhan]], it receives its biggest tributary, the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], bringing water from its northern basin as far as [[Shaanxi]].\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi, [[Lake Poyang]], the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]], receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the [[East China Sea]] at Shanghai.\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to [[Hukou County]], where [[Lake Poyang]] meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45 million years ago in the [[Eocene]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = N.J. | last2 = Densmore | first2 = A.L. | last3 = Seward | first3 = D.

In the middle Yangtze, the [[state of Jing]] seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to [[state of Chu|Chu]].<ref>Lothar von Falkenhausen, Chinese Society in the Age of Confucius (1000\u2013250 BC): The Archaeological Evidence (Los Angeles: Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, 2006), 262\u201388; Constance A.

They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]] in 506&nbsp;BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473&nbsp;BC, [[King Goujian of Yue]] fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its [[Wu (city)|eponymous capital]] at modern Suzhou. In 333&nbsp;BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the [[Minyue]] kingdom in [[Fujian]]. [[state of Qin|Qin]] was able to unite China by first subduing [[state of Ba|Ba]] and [[state of Shu|Shu]] on the upper Yangtze in modern [[Sichuan]], giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\n\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the [[Xiang River]] to expand China into [[Hunan]], Jiangxi and [[Guangdong]], setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the [[collapse of the Qin Dynasty]], these southern commanderies became the independent [[Nanyue Empire]] under [[Zhao Tuo]] while Chu and Han [[Chu-Han Contention|vied with each other]] for control of the north.\n\nFrom the [[Han dynasty]], the region of the Yangtze River became more and more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System|Dujiangyan]], northwest of Chengdu, built during the [[Warring States]] period) made agriculture very stable and productive. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.<ref>Brian Lander, \"State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.\" T'oung Pao 100.4\u20135 (2014): 325\u2013362.</ref> By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called [[Jiangnan]] (that includes the southern part of [[Jiangsu]], the northern part of [[Zhejiang]], and the southeastern part of [[Anhui]]) provided {{frac|1|3}}\u2013{{frac|1|2}} of the nation's revenues.\n\nThe Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the [[Jiangnan]] region south of the river ([[Wuxi]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]]) and with northern China (all the way from [[Yangzhou]] to Beijing). The less well known ancient [[Lingqu Canal]], connecting the upper [[Xiang River]] with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the [[Pearl River Delta]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ Lingqu Canal (Xiang'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qin Dynasty)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228071501/http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ |date=February 28, 2019 }} (Nomination for the UNESCO Heritage List)</ref>\n\nHistorically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see [[History of China]]) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and the [[Southern Song]]. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the [[Song dynasty]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] during the [[Jin\u2013Song wars]]. In the [[Battle of Caishi]] of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor [[Wanyan Liang]] clashed with the [[Naval history of China|Song fleet]] on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jing-shen|last=Tao|chapter=A Tyrant on the Yangtze: The Battle of T'sai-shih in 1161|title=Excursions in Chinese Culture|year=2002|publisher=Chinese University Press|isbn=978-962-201-915-7|pages=149\u2013155}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Needham|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Military technology: The Gunpowder Epic, Volume 5, Part 7|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30358-3|page=166}}</ref> The [[Battle of Tangdao]] was another Yangtze naval battle from the same year.\n\nPolitically, [[Nanjing]] was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the [[Eastern Wu|Wu kingdom]] in the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]], and during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] periods. Only the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] occupied most parts of China from their capital at [[Nanjing]], though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The [[Republic of China|ROC]] capital was located in [[Nanjing]] in the periods 1911\u201312, 1927\u201337, and 1945\u201349.\n\n{{wide image|Anonymous-Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River.jpg|5000px|''Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River'', a [[Ming dynasty]] landscape painting}}\n\n=== Age of steam ===\n{{Main|Steamboats on the Yangtze River|China Station}}\n\nThe first merchant steamer in China, the ''Jardine'', was built to order for the firm of [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]] in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between [[Lintin Island]], Macau and [[Whampoa Dock|Whampoa]]. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary who personified [[gunboat diplomacy]], decided to wage war on China mainly on the \"suggestions\" of Jardine Matheson{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the ''Royal Saxon'', the British started the [[First Opium War]]. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military was vastly superior during the conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the ''[[Nemesis (1839)|Nemesis]]'') were not only virtually indestructible using contemporary available weapons, but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern rifled muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took [[Guangzhou|Canton]], they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.\n\nIn 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to [[Queen Victoria]]. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.\n[[File:1937 Yangtze Gorges VP8.webm|thumb|left|Yangtze River steam boats filmed in 1937]]\n\n=== U.S. and French conflicts ===\nThe US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the {{USS|Wachusett|1861|6}} six hundred miles up the river to [[Hankou District|Hankow]] sometime in the 1860s, while the {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|6}}, a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to [[Yichang]] in 1874. The first {{USS|Monocacy|1864|6}}, a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first {{USS|Palos|1865|6}}, an armed tug, was on [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic Station]] into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as [[Hankou]], 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Europeans]] put more steamers on the river. The French engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of [[Vietnam]]. The [[Sino-French War]]s of the 1880s emerged with the [[Battle of Shipu]] having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.\n[[File:USSLuzonPG-7.jpg|left|thumb|[[USS Luzon (PG-47)|USS ''Luzon'']]]]\n[[The China Navigation Company]] was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by Japan in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. [[Robert Dollar]] was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.\n\n[[Yichang]], or Ichang, {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to [[Hankow]], a distance of almost {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} from the sea. For about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.\n\nThe Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the [[Nanyang Fleet]], which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet, only to be ravaged by another war with [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan (1895)]], [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution (1911)]] and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.\n\n===Navigation on the upper river===\n[[File:Yangtze kiang 1915.jpg|thumb|Yangtze in 1915]]\n[[File:Cruise boats on yangtze.jpg|thumb|Cruise boats on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A vehicle carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A vehicle carrier on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A container carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A container carrier on Yangtze]]\n\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the [[three gorges]], described as an \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.<ref>Lyman P. Van Slyke, ''Yangtze, ''Nature'', History and the River'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., Massachusetts, 1988, p.18-19 and 121\u2013123.</ref> Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the [[Chefoo Convention]] opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built ''Kuling'' but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes.  ''Kuling'' was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service.  In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts.  In 1895, the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade.  Little took up residence in Chongqing and built ''Leechuan'', to tackle the gorges in 1898.  In March ''Leechuan'' completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers.  ''Leechuan'' was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.<ref>''Ibid.'', p. 170-172.</ref> In 1898, Little persuaded Captain [[Samuel Cornell Plant]] to come out to China to lend his expertise.  Captain Plant had just completed navigation of [[Iran|Persia]]'s Upper [[Karun River]] and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on ''Leechuan'' at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS ''Pioneer'' built with Plant in command.  In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing.  ''Pioneer'' was sold to [[British Royal Navy]] after its first run due to threat from the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and renamed HMS ''Kinsha''.  Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS ''Suixing'' ended in catastrophe.  On ''Suixing's'' maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.  In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing.  Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS ''Shutung'' and SS ''Shuhun''. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too.  Plant was appointed by [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] as First Senior River Inspector in 1915.  In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.  He also wrote ''Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River'', a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction.  Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze.  Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, [[Jardine Matheson]], [[Butterfield and Swire]] and [[Standard Oil]] added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919.  Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shih Brandmeyer | first1 = Polly | year = 2014 | title = Cornell Plant, Lost Girls and Recovered Lives \u2013 Sino-British Relations at the Human Level in Late Qing and Early Republican China | url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch | volume = 54 | pages = 106\u2013110 | access-date = April 13, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180811112513/https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | archive-date = August 11, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> ''Shutung'' was commandeered by warlords and ''Shuhun'' was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.<ref>\"Returns of Trade and Trade Reports 1918,\" ''China \u2013 The Maritime Customs'', published by Order of the Inspector General of Customs.</ref> In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation.  The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots.  In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners.  One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English.  Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.<ref>Peter Simpson, \"Hell and High Water,\" ''South China Morning Post Magazine'', October 2, 2011, p.24-30.</ref><ref>Plant Memorial Brochure, March 20, 1923, ''National Maritime Museum'', Greenwich, Archive Collection, \"Papers of Capt.

In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, a public company under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardine's established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.<ref>Mender, P., Thirty Years A Mariner in the Far East 1907\u20131937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, A Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, p.53, {{ISBN|978-1-60910-498-6}}</ref>\n\n===Navy ships===\n[[File:Japanese cruiser Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[armored cruiser]] ''[[Japanese cruiser Izumo|Izumo]]'' in Shanghai in 1937.

The British, Americans, and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire|German]] navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open warfare with the Chinese over conquest of the Chinese [[Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u20131895, and with Russia over Qing Empire territory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. Incidentally, both the [[French Navy|French]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies were heavily involved in running [[opium]] and [[narcotics]] to Shanghai, where it was refined into [[morphine]]. It was then transhipped by liner back to [[Marseille]] and France (i.e. [[French Connection]]) for processing in [[German Empire|Germany]] and eventual sale in the U.S. or Europe.\n\nIn 1909 the gunboat {{USS|Samar|PG-41|6}} changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to [[Nanking]] and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in [[Changsha]] in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to [[Hankow]] and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, \"American interests in the Orient.\" After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on July 1, 1911.\n\nAfter staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and [[Ichang]] in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial [[warlord]]s in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze River steamer that damaged her bow.\n\nThe Spanish boats were replaced in the 1920s by {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} and {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} were the largest, {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} and {{USS|Panay|PR-5|6}} next in size, and {{USS|Guam|PG-43|6}} and {{USS|Tutuila|PG-44|6}} the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the 20th century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the [[Nanking incident of 1927]] when the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalists]] broke into open war. The [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second {{USS|Palos|PG-16|6}} protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and [[Chongqing|Chungking]] throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] had a series of [[Insect-class gunboat]]s which patrolled between Chungking and Shanghai. Cruisers and destroyers and [[Fly-class gunboat]]s{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when ''Panay'' and {{HMS|Bee|1915|6}} in 1937, were dive-bombed by Japanese aeroplanes during the notorious [[Nanking massacre]]. The Westerners were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. Probably the most curious incident involved {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}} in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]] between [[Kuomintang]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] forces; and led to the award of the [[Dickin Medal]] to the ship's cat [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].\n\n===Contemporary events===\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer [[Ash Dykes]] became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210094552/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek |archive-date=December 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Hydrology==\n\n===Periodic floods===\n{{See also|List of deadliest floods}}\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes.

Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\nThe [[1931 China floods|1931 Central China floods]] or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted).

Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nThe [[1998 Yangtze River floods]] were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.<ref name=\"cnews\">{{cite web |website=Chinanews.com.cn |url=http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130101151742/http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |script-title=zh:98\u5e74\u7279\u5927\u6d2a\u6c34 |accessdate=August 1, 2009}}</ref>\n<!--The event was considered the worst [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]] flood in 40 years.<ref name=\"spig\" />--> \nIn the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the [[Yangtze River]], resulting in 3,704 dead, 15 million homeless and $26&nbsp;billion in economic loss.<ref>Pbs.org. \"[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/greatwall/dam1.html Pbs.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502200427/http://www.pbs.org/itvs/greatwall/dam1.html |date=May 2, 2015 }}.\" ''Great wall across the Yangtze.''

More than a hundred lakes were thus cut off from the main river.<ref name=\"WWF UK\"/> There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ma|first=Jun|title=China's Water Crisis|publisher=International Rivers Network|pages=55\u201356|year=2004|isbn=978-1891936272}}</ref> Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, [[Baidang Lake]] shrunk from {{convert|100|km2|sp=us}} in the 1950s to {{convert|40|km2|sp=us}} in 2005. [[Zhangdu Lake]] dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as [[Poyang Lake]] and [[Dongting Lake]], remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of [[carp]] who thrived in [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]] water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.<ref name=\"WWF UK\" /><ref name=\"Lakes reunited\">{{cite web |last = [[China Daily]] |title = Isolated Yangtze lakes reunited with mother river |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |accessdate = October 25, 2011 |date = July 12, 2005 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140830212154/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |archive-date = August 30, 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref> In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.<ref name=\"Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery\">{{cite web |last = [[ABC News]] |title = Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery |url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |accessdate = October 28, 2012 |date = September 7, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121112170920/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |archive-date = November 12, 2012 |url-status = live }}</ref> The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the [[baiji dolphin]], [[narrow-ridged finless porpoise]] and the [[Yangtze alligator]]. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.<ref>Ellen Wohl.

Together with 9 other rivers, the Yangtze transports 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans.<ref>{{cite web | title=Almost all plastic in the ocean comes from just 10 rivers \u2013 30.11.2017 | website=DW.COM | url=https://www.dw.com/en/almost-all-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-just-10-rivers/a-41581484 | ref={{sfnref | DW.COM}} | access-date=August 22, 2018 | quote=about 90 percent of all the plastic that reaches the world's oceans gets flushed through just 10 rivers: The Yangtze, the Indus, Yellow River, Hai River, the Nile, the Ganges, Pearl River, Amur River, the Niger, and the Mekong (in that order). | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822181401/https://www.dw.com/en/almost-all-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-just-10-rivers/a-41581484 | archive-date=August 22, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Schmidt | first=Christian | last2=Krauth | first2=Tobias | last3=Wagner | first3=Stephan | title=Export of Plastic Debris by Rivers into the Sea | journal=Environmental Science & Technology | volume=51 | issue=21 | date=October 11, 2017 | issn=0013-936X | doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b02368 | pmid=29019247 | pages=12246\u201312253 | ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n=== Reconnecting lakes ===\nIn 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were [[Zhangdu Lake]], [[Honghu Lake]], and [[Tian'e-Zhou]] in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in [[Anhui]] was also reconnected.<ref name=\"Lakes reunited\" />\n\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.<ref>{{cite web |last=WWF China |title=The Yangtze Forum |url=http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091933/http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 }}</ref> In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes.

For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry.  On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the ''[[Zhong\u2019anlun Monument|Zhong\u2019anlun]]'' disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and [[Pukou]], and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from [[Wuchang Railway Station|Wuchang]] or [[Nanjing West Railway Station|Nanjing West]].\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], a dual-use [[list of road-rail bridges|road-rail bridge]], built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in [[Nanjing]].  It was built after the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in [[Zhicheng]] (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\n\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The [[Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge]] was built in 1992 as part of the [[Jingjiu railway|Beijing-Jiujiang Railway]].  A [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|second bridge in Wuhan]] was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.  These include some of the longest [[suspension bridge|suspension]] and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s in the world on the Yangtze Delta: [[Jiangyin Suspension Bridge]] (1,385 m, opened in 1999), [[Runyang Bridge]] (1,490 m, opened 2005), [[Sutong Bridge]] (1,088 m, opened 2008).

In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} to less than {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}.

Between Chongqing and Yichang (I-ch'ang), at an altitude of {{convert|40|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} and a distance of about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}}, it passes through the spectacular [[Yangtze Gorges]], which are noted for their natural beauty but are dangerous to shipping.\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at [[Yibin]]. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through [[Mount Wushan]] bordering [[Chongqing]] and [[Hubei]] to create the famous [[Three Gorges]]. Eastward of the Three Gorges, [[Yichang]] is the first city on the [[Yangtze Plain]].\n\nAfter entering Hubei, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is [[Dongting Lake]], which is located on the border of [[Hunan]] and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At [[Wuhan]], it receives its biggest tributary, the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], bringing water from its northern basin as far as [[Shaanxi]].\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi, [[Lake Poyang]], the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]], receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the [[East China Sea]] at Shanghai.\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River.

They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]] in 506&nbsp;BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473&nbsp;BC, [[King Goujian of Yue]] fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its [[Wu (city)|eponymous capital]] at modern Suzhou. In 333&nbsp;BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the [[Minyue]] kingdom in [[Fujian]]. [[state of Qin|Qin]] was able to unite China by first subduing [[state of Ba|Ba]] and [[state of Shu|Shu]] on the upper Yangtze in modern [[Sichuan]], giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.\n\nThe state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the [[Xiang River]] to expand China into [[Hunan]], Jiangxi and [[Guangdong]], setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the [[collapse of the Qin Dynasty]], these southern commanderies became the independent [[Nanyue Empire]] under [[Zhao Tuo]] while Chu and Han [[Chu-Han Contention|vied with each other]] for control of the north.\n\nFrom the [[Han dynasty]], the region of the Yangtze River became more and more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System|Dujiangyan]], northwest of Chengdu, built during the [[Warring States]] period) made agriculture very stable and productive. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.<ref>Brian Lander, \"State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.\" T'oung Pao 100.4\u20135 (2014): 325\u2013362.</ref> By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river.

The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the [[Jiangnan]] region south of the river ([[Wuxi]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]]) and with northern China (all the way from [[Yangzhou]] to Beijing). The less well known ancient [[Lingqu Canal]], connecting the upper [[Xiang River]] with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the [[Pearl River Delta]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ Lingqu Canal (Xiang'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qin Dynasty)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228071501/http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ |date=February 28, 2019 }} (Nomination for the UNESCO Heritage List)</ref>\n\nHistorically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see [[History of China]]) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and the [[Southern Song]]. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\nThe Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the [[Song dynasty]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] during the [[Jin\u2013Song wars]]. In the [[Battle of Caishi]] of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor [[Wanyan Liang]] clashed with the [[Naval history of China|Song fleet]] on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships.

Only the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] occupied most parts of China from their capital at [[Nanjing]], though it later moved the capital to Beijing.

She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between [[Lintin Island]], Macau and [[Whampoa Dock|Whampoa]]. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary who personified [[gunboat diplomacy]], decided to wage war on China mainly on the \"suggestions\" of Jardine Matheson{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the ''Royal Saxon'', the British started the [[First Opium War]]. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military was vastly superior during the conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the ''[[Nemesis (1839)|Nemesis]]'') were not only virtually indestructible using contemporary available weapons, but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern rifled muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took [[Guangzhou|Canton]], they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.\n\nIn 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to [[Queen Victoria]]. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.\n[[File:1937 Yangtze Gorges VP8.webm|thumb|left|Yangtze River steam boats filmed in 1937]]\n\n=== U.S. and French conflicts ===\nThe US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the {{USS|Wachusett|1861|6}} six hundred miles up the river to [[Hankou District|Hankow]] sometime in the 1860s, while the {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|6}}, a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to [[Yichang]] in 1874. The first {{USS|Monocacy|1864|6}}, a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first {{USS|Palos|1865|6}}, an armed tug, was on [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic Station]] into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as [[Hankou]], 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Europeans]] put more steamers on the river. The French engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of [[Vietnam]]. The [[Sino-French War]]s of the 1880s emerged with the [[Battle of Shipu]] having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.\n[[File:USSLuzonPG-7.jpg|left|thumb|[[USS Luzon (PG-47)|USS ''Luzon'']]]]\n[[The China Navigation Company]] was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by Japan in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. [[Robert Dollar]] was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.\n\n[[Yichang]], or Ichang, {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to [[Hankow]], a distance of almost {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} from the sea. For about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.\n\nThe Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the [[Nanyang Fleet]], which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet, only to be ravaged by another war with [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan (1895)]], [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution (1911)]] and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.\n\n===Navigation on the upper river===\n[[File:Yangtze kiang 1915.jpg|thumb|Yangtze in 1915]]\n[[File:Cruise boats on yangtze.jpg|thumb|Cruise boats on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A vehicle carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A vehicle carrier on Yangtze]]\n[[File:A container carrier on yangtze.jpg|thumb|A container carrier on Yangtze]]\n\nSteamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the [[three gorges]], described as an \"150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,\" posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 \u2013 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70\u201380 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.<ref>Lyman P. Van Slyke, ''Yangtze, ''Nature'', History and the River'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., Massachusetts, 1988, p.18-19 and 121\u2013123.</ref> Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the [[Chefoo Convention]] opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built ''Kuling'' but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes.  ''Kuling'' was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service.  In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts.  In 1895, the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade.  Little took up residence in Chongqing and built ''Leechuan'', to tackle the gorges in 1898.  In March ''Leechuan'' completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers.  ''Leechuan'' was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.<ref>''Ibid.'', p. 170-172.</ref> In 1898, Little persuaded Captain [[Samuel Cornell Plant]] to come out to China to lend his expertise.  Captain Plant had just completed navigation of [[Iran|Persia]]'s Upper [[Karun River]] and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on ''Leechuan'' at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS ''Pioneer'' built with Plant in command.  In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing.  ''Pioneer'' was sold to [[British Royal Navy]] after its first run due to threat from the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and renamed HMS ''Kinsha''.  Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS ''Suixing'' ended in catastrophe.  On ''Suixing's'' maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.  In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing.  Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS ''Shutung'' and SS ''Shuhun''. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too.  Plant was appointed by [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] as First Senior River Inspector in 1915.  In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.  He also wrote ''Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River'', a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction.  Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze.  Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, [[Jardine Matheson]], [[Butterfield and Swire]] and [[Standard Oil]] added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919.  Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Shih Brandmeyer | first1 = Polly | year = 2014 | title = Cornell Plant, Lost Girls and Recovered Lives \u2013 Sino-British Relations at the Human Level in Late Qing and Early Republican China | url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch | volume = 54 | pages = 106\u2013110 | access-date = April 13, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180811112513/https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | archive-date = August 11, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> ''Shutung'' was commandeered by warlords and ''Shuhun'' was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.<ref>\"Returns of Trade and Trade Reports 1918,\" ''China \u2013 The Maritime Customs'', published by Order of the Inspector General of Customs.</ref> In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation.

In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners.  One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English.  Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.<ref>Peter Simpson, \"Hell and High Water,\" ''South China Morning Post Magazine'', October 2, 2011, p.24-30.</ref><ref>Plant Memorial Brochure, March 20, 1923, ''National Maritime Museum'', Greenwich, Archive Collection, \"Papers of Capt.

In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, a public company under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardine's established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.<ref>Mender, P., Thirty Years A Mariner in the Far East 1907\u20131937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, A Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, p.53, {{ISBN|978-1-60910-498-6}}</ref>\n\n===Navy ships===\n[[File:Japanese cruiser Izumo in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] [[armored cruiser]] ''[[Japanese cruiser Izumo|Izumo]]'' in Shanghai in 1937. She sank [[riverboat]]s on the Yangtze in 1941.]]\n{{see also|USS Asheville (PG-21)|Yangtze Patrol|Yangtze Incident}}\nWith the [[Treaty Ports]], the [[Great power|European powers]] and Japan were allowed to sail navy ships into China's waters. The British, Americans, and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire|German]] navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open warfare with the Chinese over conquest of the Chinese [[Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u20131895, and with Russia over Qing Empire territory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905. Incidentally, both the [[French Navy|French]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies were heavily involved in running [[opium]] and [[narcotics]] to Shanghai, where it was refined into [[morphine]]. It was then transhipped by liner back to [[Marseille]] and France (i.e. [[French Connection]]) for processing in [[German Empire|Germany]] and eventual sale in the U.S. or Europe.\n\nIn 1909 the gunboat {{USS|Samar|PG-41|6}} changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to [[Nanking]] and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in [[Changsha]] in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to [[Hankow]] and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, \"American interests in the Orient.\" After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on July 1, 1911.\n\nAfter staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and [[Ichang]] in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial [[warlord]]s in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze River steamer that damaged her bow.\n\nThe Spanish boats were replaced in the 1920s by {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} and {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} were the largest, {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} and {{USS|Panay|PR-5|6}} next in size, and {{USS|Guam|PG-43|6}} and {{USS|Tutuila|PG-44|6}} the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the 20th century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the [[Nanking incident of 1927]] when the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalists]] broke into open war. The [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second {{USS|Palos|PG-16|6}} protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and [[Chongqing|Chungking]] throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.\n\nThe British [[Royal Navy]] had a series of [[Insect-class gunboat]]s which patrolled between Chungking and Shanghai. Cruisers and destroyers and [[Fly-class gunboat]]s{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when ''Panay'' and {{HMS|Bee|1915|6}} in 1937, were dive-bombed by Japanese aeroplanes during the notorious [[Nanking massacre]]. The Westerners were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. Probably the most curious incident involved {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}} in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]] between [[Kuomintang]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] forces; and led to the award of the [[Dickin Medal]] to the ship's cat [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].\n\n===Contemporary events===\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer [[Ash Dykes]] became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210094552/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/12/british-explorer-is-first-person-to-complete-4000-mile-yangtze-trek |archive-date=December 10, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Hydrology==\n\n===Periodic floods===\n{{See also|List of deadliest floods}}\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes.

Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\nThe [[1931 China floods|1931 Central China floods]] or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted).

Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nThe [[1998 Yangtze River floods]] were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.<ref name=\"cnews\">{{cite web |website=Chinanews.com.cn |url=http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130101151742/http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |script-title=zh:98\u5e74\u7279\u5927\u6d2a\u6c34 |accessdate=August 1, 2009}}</ref>\n<!--The event was considered the worst [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]] flood in 40 years.<ref name=\"spig\" />--> \nIn the summer of 1998, China experienced massive flooding of parts of the [[Yangtze River]], resulting in 3,704 dead, 15 million homeless and $26&nbsp;billion in economic loss.<ref>Pbs.org. \"[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/greatwall/dam1.html Pbs.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502200427/http://www.pbs.org/itvs/greatwall/dam1.html |date=May 2, 2015 }}.\" ''Great wall across the Yangtze.''

More than a hundred lakes were thus cut off from the main river.<ref name=\"WWF UK\"/> There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ma|first=Jun|title=China's Water Crisis|publisher=International Rivers Network|pages=55\u201356|year=2004|isbn=978-1891936272}}</ref> Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, [[Baidang Lake]] shrunk from {{convert|100|km2|sp=us}} in the 1950s to {{convert|40|km2|sp=us}} in 2005. [[Zhangdu Lake]] dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as [[Poyang Lake]] and [[Dongting Lake]], remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of [[carp]] who thrived in [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]] water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.<ref name=\"WWF UK\" /><ref name=\"Lakes reunited\">{{cite web |last = [[China Daily]] |title = Isolated Yangtze lakes reunited with mother river |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |accessdate = October 25, 2011 |date = July 12, 2005 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140830212154/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |archive-date = August 30, 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref> In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.<ref name=\"Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery\">{{cite web |last = [[ABC News]] |title = Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery |url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |accessdate = October 28, 2012 |date = September 7, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121112170920/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |archive-date = November 12, 2012 |url-status = live }}</ref> The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable \"iron barrier\" that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the [[baiji dolphin]], [[narrow-ridged finless porpoise]] and the [[Yangtze alligator]]. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.<ref>Ellen Wohl.

The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were [[Zhangdu Lake]], [[Honghu Lake]], and [[Tian'e-Zhou]] in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in [[Anhui]] was also reconnected.<ref name=\"Lakes reunited\" />\n\nReconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.<ref>{{cite web |last=WWF China |title=The Yangtze Forum |url=http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091933/http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 }}</ref> In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes.

For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry.  On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the ''[[Zhong\u2019anlun Monument|Zhong\u2019anlun]]'' disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\nThe river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and [[Pukou]], and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from [[Wuchang Railway Station|Wuchang]] or [[Nanjing West Railway Station|Nanjing West]].\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], a dual-use [[list of road-rail bridges|road-rail bridge]], built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in [[Nanjing]].  It was built after the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in [[Zhicheng]] (1971) and Chongqing (1980).\n\nBridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The [[Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge]] was built in 1992 as part of the [[Jingjiu railway|Beijing-Jiujiang Railway]].  A [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|second bridge in Wuhan]] was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.
