The geographic center of [[Connecticut]] is located in the town.  Berlin is residential and industrial, and is served by the [[Amtrak]] [[railroad station|station]] [[Berlin station (Connecticut)|of the same name]]. Berlin also has two hamlets: [[Kensington, Connecticut|Kensington]] and [[East Berlin, Connecticut|East Berlin]].\n\n==Town seal==\nThe greatest boom to Berlin industry resulted from the decision of the Patterson brothers to start their business on West Street (now called Lower Lane). For twenty years until 1760, they kept their work in the family selling their wares from a basket. When demand increased they took apprentices into the shop and engaged peddlers to travel throughout the colonies selling the shiny, useful articles (the seal of the Town of Berlin shows such a \"Yankee peddler\" in eighteenth-century dress with a basket under his arm, a pack on his back full of tinware).  As others learned the trade, they soon set up shop and hired apprentices.  There were so many that the noise of the [[whitesmith]]s and their hammering could be heard in every part of town.\n\n==History==\nThe town took parts away from Wethersfield (Now Rocky Hill and Newington), Middletown (Now Cromwell), Wallingford (Now Meriden) and Farmington (Now Southington and New Britain). Berlin was one of the birthplaces of [[interchangeable parts]] manufacturing and of the [[industrial revolution]] in the United States, in the workshop of [[Simeon North]]. The town was formerly known as Kensington.\n\nIn 1659, Sergeant Richard Beckley purchased 300 acres from Chief Tarramuggus, built a home for his family and became the first settler in what was to become Berlin. Other families slowly followed, and in 1686, Captain Richard Seymour led a group of families from Farmington to begin the first settlement on Christian Lane.\n\nBy 1705, the first ecclesiastical society was recognized and the area renamed the Great Swamp Society. The first meetinghouse and cemetery were established a few years later, and the first school house built in 1717.\n\n1722 brought reorganization to the Society. Parts of the towns of Farmington, Wethersfield and Middletown were added to increase the land area, and the name changed to Kensington. In 1772, the Society was divided into an eastern half, called Worthington, and the western section, which retained the name of Kensington. 1785 brought incorporation of the town, which was then called Berlin. New Britain remained a part of Berlin until 1850.\n\nAround 1740, Edward and William Pattison, two brothers from Ireland, emigrated to Berlin and set up the first tinware business in the colonies. Wares in baskets were pedaled from house to house, then, as surplus accumulated, by mule and wagon, traveling all over America and to Canada. This was the birth of \"The Yankee Peddler\".\n\nDuring the years from 1700-1750, farms, mills, and blacksmiths sprang up through the Great Swamp. Most residents of this area were skilled in one or more of these trades, which were recognized and allowed by the British government. A blacksmith was crucial for daily living needs such as nails, tools, hinges, latches, hooks, cranes, cooking utensils, and parts for wagons, wheels and sleds. Small ironworks sprang up near local waterpower.\n\nIn addition to tinware, ammunition was made from the local lead mines during the Revolutionary War. East Berlin Milling Co. produced cotton and woolen yarn which was spun into clothing and blankets. Simeon North, manufacturer of pistols, became the first official pistol maker for the United States Government when he developed a system of interchangeable parts for pistols. In the 1800s, business of all sorts thrived in Berlin. Makers of wagons, tableware, hats, clocks, books, combs, woolen clothes and blankets, cabinet and coffin makers, sleighs, muffs, and suits, were all local industries. Berlin was on the direct route from New Haven to Hartford, with taverns and inns, which were regular stagecoach stops for fresh horses, meals and sleeping accommodations.\n\nTwo meetinghouses had been built, one in Kensington Parish, still in use today as the Kensington Congregational Church. The Worthington Meetinghouse was in continuous use as a church, town hall, school and town offices until 1974.\n\nBerlin was proud to have one of the 75 official post offices designated by Benjamin Franklin, first Postmaster General. A historic marker showing that the next post office was in Hartford, 11 miles away, is still located on Worthington Ridge.\n\nBy the late 1700s, a village library had been started, and the town boasted of five school districts. In the mid 1800s, the Worthington Academy was built, which ultimately housed 125 students from neighboring states. The Berlin Railroad Depot opened as a way station on the New York, New Haven and Hartford line. Today, this train station is one of the last places in the U.S. that sells tickets to anywhere in the U.S. or Canada.\n\nThe mid 1800s brought competition from mass-produced products, forcing the peddlers out of business. It also brought the establishment of the brick making industry locally, which eventually produced 90,000 bricks daily until the 1960s.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|69.9|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|68.2|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.7|km2|order=flip}}, or 2.45%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The geographic center of Connecticut is located in Berlin.\n\nThe west side of Berlin is flanked by the [[Metacomet Ridge]], a mountainous [[trap rock]] ridgeline that stretches from [[Long Island Sound]] to nearly the [[Vermont]] border. Notable mountains of the Metacomet ridge in Berlin include the [[Hanging Hills]], [[Lamentation Mountain]], [[Short Mountain (Connecticut)|Short Mountain]], and [[Ragged Mountain (Connecticut)|Ragged Mountain]]. The {{convert|51|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Metacomet Trail]] and the {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Mattabesett Trail]] traverse the ridge.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 2877\n|1840= 3411\n|1850= 1869\n|1860= 2146\n|1870= 2436\n|1880= 2385\n|1890= 2600\n|1900= 3448\n|1910= 3728\n|1920= 4298\n|1930= 4875\n|1940= 5230\n|1950= 7470\n|1960= 11250\n|1970= 14149\n|1980= 15121\n|1990= 16787\n|2000= 18215\n|2010= 19866\n|estyear=2014\n|estimate=20610\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523034651/https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|archive-date=May 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n|1790=2465|1800=2702|1810=2798|1830=3037}}\n{{See also|List of Connecticut locations by per capita income}}\nAs of the 2010 census Berlin had a population of 19,866.

[[Donald J. Trump]], however, put the town back into the GOP column in 2016.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; margin:1em; font-size:95%;\"\n|+ Berlin town vote<br/> by party in presidential elections<ref>https://authoring.ct.gov//SOTS/Election-Services/Statement-Of-Vote-PDFs/General-Elections-Statement-of-Vote-1922</ref>\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

The geographic center of [[Connecticut]] is located in the town.  Berlin is residential and industrial, and is served by the [[Amtrak]] [[railroad station|station]] [[Berlin station (Connecticut)|of the same name]]. Berlin also has two hamlets: [[Kensington, Connecticut|Kensington]] and [[East Berlin, Connecticut|East Berlin]].\n\n==Town seal==\nThe greatest boom to Berlin industry resulted from the decision of the Patterson brothers to start their business on West Street (now called Lower Lane). For twenty years until 1760, they kept their work in the family selling their wares from a basket. When demand increased they took apprentices into the shop and engaged peddlers to travel throughout the colonies selling the shiny, useful articles (the seal of the Town of Berlin shows such a \"Yankee peddler\" in eighteenth-century dress with a basket under his arm, a pack on his back full of tinware).  As others learned the trade, they soon set up shop and hired apprentices.  There were so many that the noise of the [[whitesmith]]s and their hammering could be heard in every part of town.\n\n==History==\nThe town took parts away from Wethersfield (Now Rocky Hill and Newington), Middletown (Now Cromwell), Wallingford (Now Meriden) and Farmington (Now Southington and New Britain). Berlin was one of the birthplaces of [[interchangeable parts]] manufacturing and of the [[industrial revolution]] in the United States, in the workshop of [[Simeon North]]. The town was formerly known as Kensington.\n\nIn 1659, Sergeant Richard Beckley purchased 300 acres from Chief Tarramuggus, built a home for his family and became the first settler in what was to become Berlin. Other families slowly followed, and in 1686, Captain Richard Seymour led a group of families from Farmington to begin the first settlement on Christian Lane.\n\nBy 1705, the first ecclesiastical society was recognized and the area renamed the Great Swamp Society. The first meetinghouse and cemetery were established a few years later, and the first school house built in 1717.\n\n1722 brought reorganization to the Society. Parts of the towns of Farmington, Wethersfield and Middletown were added to increase the land area, and the name changed to Kensington. In 1772, the Society was divided into an eastern half, called Worthington, and the western section, which retained the name of Kensington. 1785 brought incorporation of the town, which was then called Berlin. New Britain remained a part of Berlin until 1850.\n\nAround 1740, Edward and William Pattison, two brothers from Ireland, emigrated to Berlin and set up the first tinware business in the colonies. Wares in baskets were pedaled from house to house, then, as surplus accumulated, by mule and wagon, traveling all over America and to Canada. This was the birth of \"The Yankee Peddler\".\n\nDuring the years from 1700-1750, farms, mills, and blacksmiths sprang up through the Great Swamp. Most residents of this area were skilled in one or more of these trades, which were recognized and allowed by the British government. A blacksmith was crucial for daily living needs such as nails, tools, hinges, latches, hooks, cranes, cooking utensils, and parts for wagons, wheels and sleds. Small ironworks sprang up near local waterpower.\n\nIn addition to tinware, ammunition was made from the local lead mines during the Revolutionary War. East Berlin Milling Co. produced cotton and woolen yarn which was spun into clothing and blankets. Simeon North, manufacturer of pistols, became the first official pistol maker for the United States Government when he developed a system of interchangeable parts for pistols. In the 1800s, business of all sorts thrived in Berlin. Makers of wagons, tableware, hats, clocks, books, combs, woolen clothes and blankets, cabinet and coffin makers, sleighs, muffs, and suits, were all local industries. Berlin was on the direct route from New Haven to Hartford, with taverns and inns, which were regular stagecoach stops for fresh horses, meals and sleeping accommodations.\n\nTwo meetinghouses had been built, one in Kensington Parish, still in use today as the Kensington Congregational Church. The Worthington Meetinghouse was in continuous use as a church, town hall, school and town offices until 1974.\n\nBerlin was proud to have one of the 75 official post offices designated by Benjamin Franklin, first Postmaster General. A historic marker showing that the next post office was in Hartford, 11 miles away, is still located on Worthington Ridge.\n\nBy the late 1700s, a village library had been started, and the town boasted of five school districts. In the mid 1800s, the Worthington Academy was built, which ultimately housed 125 students from neighboring states. The Berlin Railroad Depot opened as a way station on the New York, New Haven and Hartford line. Today, this train station is one of the last places in the U.S. that sells tickets to anywhere in the U.S. or Canada.\n\nThe mid 1800s brought competition from mass-produced products, forcing the peddlers out of business. It also brought the establishment of the brick making industry locally, which eventually produced 90,000 bricks daily until the 1960s.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|69.9|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|68.2|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.7|km2|order=flip}}, or 2.45%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> The geographic center of Connecticut is located in Berlin.\n\nThe west side of Berlin is flanked by the [[Metacomet Ridge]], a mountainous [[trap rock]] ridgeline that stretches from [[Long Island Sound]] to nearly the [[Vermont]] border. Notable mountains of the Metacomet ridge in Berlin include the [[Hanging Hills]], [[Lamentation Mountain]], [[Short Mountain (Connecticut)|Short Mountain]], and [[Ragged Mountain (Connecticut)|Ragged Mountain]]. The {{convert|51|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Metacomet Trail]] and the {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Mattabesett Trail]] traverse the ridge.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1820= 2877\n|1840= 3411\n|1850= 1869\n|1860= 2146\n|1870= 2436\n|1880= 2385\n|1890= 2600\n|1900= 3448\n|1910= 3728\n|1920= 4298\n|1930= 4875\n|1940= 5230\n|1950= 7470\n|1960= 11250\n|1970= 14149\n|1980= 15121\n|1990= 16787\n|2000= 18215\n|2010= 19866\n|estyear=2014\n|estimate=20610\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Incorporated Places: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523034651/https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2014/SUB-EST2014.html|archive-date=May 23, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=Census of Population and Housing |publisher=Census.gov |accessdate=June 4, 2015 }}</ref>\n|1790=2465|1800=2702|1810=2798|1830=3037}}\n{{See also|List of Connecticut locations by per capita income}}\nAs of the 2010 census Berlin had a population of 19,866.

Nevertheless, connectivities do not coincide with spin correlation functions: for example, the three-point connectivity does not vanish, while <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle=0</math>. There are four independent four-point connectivities, and their sum coincides with <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle</math>.<ref name=\"dv11\"/> Other combinations of four-point connectivities are not known analytically. In particular they are not related to correlation functions of the minimal model,<ref name=\"dv10\"/> although they are related to the <math> q\\to 2</math> limit of spin correlators in the <math>q</math>-state Potts model.<ref name=\"dv11\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"dv10\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=On three-point connectivity in two-dimensional percolation | website=arXiv.org | date=2010-09-07 | doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/3/032001 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1314v1 | access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"dv11\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=Potts q-color field theory and scaling random cluster model | website=arXiv.org | date=2011-04-21 | doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2011.06.012 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4323v2 | access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cgl20\">{{cite web | last=Cheng | first=Miranda C.

In this description, the natural observables are connectivities of clusters, i.e. probabilities that a number of points belong to the same cluster. \nThe Ising model can then be viewed as the case <math>q=2</math> of the <math>q</math>-state [[Potts model]], whose parameter <math>q</math> can vary continuously, and is related to the central charge of the [[Virasoro algebra]]. \n\nIn the critical limit, connectivities of clusters have the same behaviour under conformal transformations as correlation functions of the spin operator. Nevertheless, connectivities do not coincide with spin correlation functions: for example, the three-point connectivity does not vanish, while <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle=0</math>. There are four independent four-point connectivities, and their sum coincides with <math>\\langle\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\sigma\\rangle</math>.<ref name=\"dv11\"/> Other combinations of four-point connectivities are not known analytically. In particular they are not related to correlation functions of the minimal model,<ref name=\"dv10\"/> although they are related to the <math> q\\to 2</math> limit of spin correlators in the <math>q</math>-state Potts model.<ref name=\"dv11\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"dv10\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=On three-point connectivity in two-dimensional percolation | website=arXiv.org | date=2010-09-07 | doi=10.1088/1751-8113/44/3/032001 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1314v1 | access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"dv11\">{{cite web | last=Delfino | first=Gesualdo | last2=Viti | first2=Jacopo | title=Potts q-color field theory and scaling random cluster model | website=arXiv.org | date=2011-04-21 | doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysb.2011.06.012 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4323v2 | access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cgl20\">{{cite web | last=Cheng | first=Miranda C.

He was the first to articulate a vision for a \"College in the City of Boston\" that would raise a new generation of leaders to serve both the civic and spiritual needs of his fledgling diocese. In 1827, Bishop Fenwick opened a school in the basement of his [[cathedral]] and took to the personal instruction of the city's youth. His efforts to attract other Jesuits to the faculty were hampered both by Boston's distance from the center of Jesuit activity in Maryland and by suspicion on the part of the city's [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Protestant elite]]. Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the [[College of the Holy Cross]] {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of the city in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy. Meanwhile, the vision for a college in Boston was sustained by [[John McElroy (Jesuit)|John McElroy, S.J.]], who saw an even greater need for such an institution in light of Boston's growing Irish Catholic immigrant population. With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy went about raising funds and in 1857 purchased land for \"The Boston College\" on Harrison Avenue in the Hudson neighborhood of [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts]]. With little fanfare, the college's two buildings\u2014a schoolhouse and a [[Church (building)|church]]\u2014welcomed their first class of scholastics in 1859. Two years later, with as little fanfare, BC closed again. Its short-lived second incarnation was plagued by the outbreak of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and disagreement within the Society over the college's governance and finances. BC's inability to obtain a charter from the anti-Catholic Massachusetts legislature only compounded its troubles.\n[[File:OldBClithograph.jpg|thumb|left|Early BC in [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's South End]]]]\nOn {{Start date|1863|3|31}}, more than three decades after its initial inception, Boston College's charter was formally approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. BC became the second [[Jesuit]] institution of higher learning in [[Massachusetts]] and the first located in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area. [[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., a Swiss Jesuit from French-speaking [[Fribourg]], was selected as BC's first president and immediately reopened the original college buildings on Harrison Avenue. For most of the 19th century, BC offered a singular 7-year program corresponding to both high school and college. Its entering class in the fall of 1864 included 22 students, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://bc.edu/about/history.html |title=History \u2013 Boston College |publisher=Bc.edu |date=1909-06-19 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103122335/http://www.bc.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=January 3, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The curriculum was based on the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'', emphasizing [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]].\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Move to Chestnut Hill===\n[[File:Gasson Tower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]]]]\nBoston College's enrollment reached nearly 500 by the turn of the 20th century. Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though [[Boston College High School]] remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927, when it was separately [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. In 1907, newly installed President [[Thomas I. Gasson]], S.J., determined that BC's cramped, urban quarters in Boston's South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion. Inspired by [[John Winthrop]]'s early vision of Boston as a \"[[city upon a hill]]\", he re-imagined Boston College as world-renowned university and a beacon of [[Jesuit]] scholarship. Less than a year after taking office, he purchased [[Amos Adams Lawrence]]'s farm on [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], six&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) west of downtown. He organized an international competition for the design of a [[campus]] master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the \"new\" university. Construction began in 1909.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy 1913, construction costs had surpassed available funds, and as a result [[Gasson Hall]], \"New BC's\" main building, stood alone on Chestnut Hill for its first three years. Buildings of the former Lawrence farm, including a barn and gatehouse, were temporarily adapted for college use while a massive fundraising effort was underway. While Maginnis's ambitious plans were never fully realized, BC's first \"capital campaign\"\u2014which included a large replica of Gasson Hall's clock tower set up on Boston Common to measure the fundraising progress\u2014ensured that President Gasson's vision survived. By the 1920s BC began to fill out the dimensions of its university charter, establishing the Boston College Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, the [[Boston College Law School]], and the [[Woods College of Advancing Studies]], followed successively by the [[Boston College Graduate School of Social Work]], the [[Carroll School of Management]], the [[Connell School of Nursing]], and the [[Lynch School of Education|Lynch School of Education and Human Development]]. In 1926, Boston College conferred its first degrees on women (though it did not become fully coeducational until 1970). On April 20, 1963, an address by President [[John F. Kennedy]], the nation's first Catholic president who had received an honorary degree in 1956, was the highlight of a week-long centennial celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKWHP/1963/Month%2004/Day%2020/JFKWHP-1963-04-20-D|title=Trip to Boston: President Kennedy's Address at Boston College Centennial Ceremonies.

At the city, state and federal levels, BC graduates dominated Massachusetts politics for much of the 20th century. However, cultural changes in American society and in the church following the [[Second Vatican Council]] forced the university to question its purpose and mission. Meanwhile, poor financial management lead to deteriorating facilities and resources, and rising tuition costs. Student outrage, combined with growing protests over [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and the [[Operation Menu|bombings in Cambodia]], culminated in student strikes, including demonstrations at [[Gasson Hall]] in April 1970.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Gasson Hall in Spring.jpg|Gasson Hall in spring\nFile:Gasson Hall in Summer.jpg|Gasson Hall in summer\nFile:Gasson Hall in Autumn.jpg|Gasson Hall in autumn\nFile:Gasson in Winter.jpg|Gasson Hall in winter\n</gallery>\n\n===The Monan Era===\nBy the time [[J. Donald Monan]], S.J. began his presidency on September 5, 1972, BC was approximately $30 million in debt, its endowment totaled just under $6 million, and faculty and staff salaries had been frozen during the previous year. Rumors about the university's future were rampant, including speculation that BC would be acquired by [[Harvard University]]. After Monan's appointment, the Boston College Board of Trustees was reconfigured.  The board was broadened beyond its historic membership of members of the [[Society of Jesus]], as lay alumni and business leaders were brought in, bringing new business models and an ability to raise funds. A similar restructuring had been accomplished first at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1967 by Fr. [[Theodore Hesburgh]], [[Congregation of the Holy Cross|CSC]], and Edmund Stephan,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html|title=Edmund Stephan, 86, Lawyer Who Reorganized Notre Dame|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=1998-01-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813105624/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> with many other Catholic colleges following suit in the ensuing years. In 1974, [[Newton College of the Sacred Heart]] was merged into BC, allowing expansion of Boston College to the Newton College {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus. {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} Boston College Law School moved to the campus, and its dormitories provided needed housing for a student population that was increasingly residential, for which the school had to lease off-campus apartments and even motel rooms. Monan was credited with turning around the school's financial position, leading to an improved reputation and increasing attention from around the world. In 1996, Monan's 24-year presidency, the longest in the university's history, came to an end when he was named [[Chancellor (education)|University Chancellor]] and succeeded by President [[William P. Leahy]], S.J.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:BC Campus Green.jpg|thumb|right|Gasson Quadrangle]]\nSince assuming the Boston College presidency, Leahy's tenure has been marked with an acceleration of the growth and development initiated by his predecessor, as well as by what some critics see as abandonment of the college's initial mission to provide a college education for residents of Boston.  It has expanded by almost {{convert|150|acres|m2}}, while dramatically reducing the greenery of its middle campus, although portions of the college's legendary \"Dustbowl\" were removed to accommodate additional expansion of its buildings. During this period, undergraduate applications have surpassed 31,000. At the same time, BC students, faculty and athletic teams have seen indicators of success\u2014winning record numbers of [[Fulbright Award|Fulbrights]], [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes]], and other academic awards; setting new marks for research grants; and winning conference and national titles. In 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program to examine issues facing the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] in light of the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal|clergy sexual abuse scandal]].

Combining [[Gothic Revival]] architecture with principles of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a [[cruciform]] plan. Maginnis's design broke from the traditional [[Oxbridge]] models that had inspired it\u2014and that had until then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses. In its unprecedented scale, [[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]] was conceived not as the [[Bell tower|belfry]] of a singular building, but as the crowning [[campanile]] of Maginnis' new \"[[city upon a hill]]\". Although Maginnis' ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now BC's iconic middle campus. Among these, the [[Bapst Library]] has been called the \"finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America\" and [[Devlin Hall]] won the [[Harleston Parker Medal]] for \"most beautiful building in Boston\". The 1895 [[Louis K. Liggett]] Estate was acquired in 1941 and developed into a [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor-style]] upper campus, while an architecturally eclectic lower campus took shape on land acquired by filling in part of the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]]. Modernism had an enormous impact on development after the 1940s, though some of the modernist buildings at BC maintained non-modern rough stone facades in keeping with Maginnis's original designs.\n[[File:Boston College Quadrangle.jpg|thumb|right|Students walk through a campus quadrangle.]]\nBoston College's eight research libraries contain over two million printed volumes.

Freshman housing on Upper Campus includes Kostka, Gonzaga, Fitzpatrick, Medeiros, Cheverus, Claver, Loyola, Xavier, Fenwick, and Shaw House. Additional freshman housing is on the Newton Campus and includes Cushing, Duchesne (East and West), Hardey, and Keyes (North and South).\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Boston College began construction of Stokes Hall, a {{convert|183000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} academic building on what was formerly known as the Dustbowl. Stokes Hall is the first academic building to be constructed on the Middle Campus since 2001. It was completed in December 2012, and opened for use in January 2013. In 2014, the university reconstructed St. Mary's Hall and renovated indoor pieces of Carney Hall. More Hall had been demolished to make way for a new residence hall in July 2014, slated to open sometime in 2016.\n\n===Middle Campus===\n[[File:Burns Library Boston College.jpg|thumb|right|Burns Library]]\n* Carney Faculty Center\nLocated on middle campus, Carney Faculty Center no longer hosts classes and is largely vacant. Rather, the building houses the offices of the Army ROTC program as well as the Student Program Offices. Often known as 'dark and dank', the building is distinct from the quadrangle area located across the campus green, known as the Dustbowl. Built in 1963, Carney has an unusual structure seeming to face away from the rest of the campus. Contrary to popular belief, the building was not built backwards but rather styled to allow more offices to have windows, according to BC Historian, Professor Thomas O'Connor. The Beacon Street side of the building contains a fountain in the middle of the courtyard; the fountain has been dry for decades as the result of the frequent use of powdered soap pranks by undergraduate students. The building additionally contains sets of unused lockers throughout the floors, which added to the fictitious speculation of the building being a former high school although they had been used by the commuter students who formed the vast majority of enrollment for many years. The existing 10-year university plan slates Carney Hall for reconstruction. Sections of the first floor have received new carpets, fresh coats of paint, and new ceiling tiles. The existing university 30\u201350-year plan schedules the reconstructed building to remain part of the quadrangle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/urban-legends-of-boston-college-1.922392|title=Urban Legends of Boston College - Features - The Heights - Boston College|accessdate=April 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192700/http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/urban-legends-of-boston-college-1.922392|archivedate=April 16, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Fulton Hall Atrium.jpg|thumb|right|Fulton Hall atrium]]\n* McElroy Commons\nLocated on the Southwest Corner of middle campus, McElroy is referred to by students as 'Mac', reflecting the common, but incorrect, pronunciation of the building's name.

The term, or one or its derivative forms, such as ALANA (where \"[[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]\" is substituted for \"Hispanic\"), has become common on a number of other American university campuses. Boston College, which has registered the term AHANA as a [[trademark]], has granted official permission for its use to over 50 institutions and organizations in the [[United States]].

Conte Forum]]\n\nBoston College teams are known as the Eagles. They compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports (except men's lacrosse) since the 2005-06 season. The Eagles formerly competed as a charter member of the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] from 1979-80 to 2004-05. Up to that point, Boston College was the only Big East member affiliated with the Catholic Church that played football in the conference. All the football-playing members of the Big East are now secular (usually public) institutions. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), football, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse (non-ACC), sailing (non-ACC), skiing (non-ACC), soccer, swimming, tennis, and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), field hockey, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse, rowing, sailing, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in [[Hockey East]]; while the women's rowing team competes in the [[Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges]] (EAWRC) as well as the ACC; and the co-ed skiing, fencing and sailing teams are non-ACC/NCAA. Boston College is one of only thirteen universities in the country offering NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly, I-A) football, Division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I hockey.\n[[File:Ice Hockey Conte Forum.jpg|right|thumb|An ice hockey game played at \"Kelley Rink,\" Conte Forum.]] \nThe mascot for all Boston College athletic teams is the [[Eagle]], generally referred to in the plural, i.e., \"The Eagles\". The character representing the mascot at football, hockey, and basketball games is an American bald eagle named [[Baldwin the Eagle|Baldwin]], derived from the \"bald\" head of the American bald eagle and the word \"win\". The school colors are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The fight song, ''[[For Boston]]'', was composed by T.J. Hurley, class of 1885.\n[[File:Alumni Stadium Boston College.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Stadium, home of the Boston College Eagles.]]\nIn hockey and (less famously) baseball, Boston College participates in the annual [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] tournaments held at [[TD Banknorth Garden]] and [[Fenway Park]], respectively. Boston College competes in the Beanpot against the three other major sports colleges in Boston: the [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] [[Northeastern Huskies|Huskies]], [[Harvard University]] Crimson, and [[Boston University]] [[Boston University Terriers|Terriers]]. BC has reached the championship game 31 times and has won the Beanpot 16 times, including the 2010, 2011 and 2012 championships. The less renowned baseball tournament, was first played in 1990 and out of seventeen baseball Beanpots, Boston College has won nine, last winning in 2008. The baseball team also plays an exhibition game against the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[jetBlue Park]] after several years at [[City Of Palms Park]] both in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]], [[Florida]] during [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[spring training]]. The men's hockey team won the [[2008 NCAA Hockey Championship|2008 NCAA Championship]] on April 12, 2008 with a 4\u20131 victory over the University of Notre Dame in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]],  the [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2010 NCAA Championship]] with a 5\u20130 victory over Wisconsin on April 10, 2010, and in 2012 in the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]]  with a 4-1 victory over [[Ferris State University]] in Tampa.\n\nPrincipal athletic facilities include [[Alumni Stadium]] (capacity: 44,500), [[Conte Forum]] (8,606), [[Kelley Rink]] (7,884), [[Eddie Pellagrini Diamond at John Shea Field]] (1,000), the Newton Soccer Complex (1,000), and the Flynn Recreation Complex.

He was the first to articulate a vision for a \"College in the City of Boston\" that would raise a new generation of leaders to serve both the civic and spiritual needs of his fledgling diocese. In 1827, Bishop Fenwick opened a school in the basement of his [[cathedral]] and took to the personal instruction of the city's youth. His efforts to attract other Jesuits to the faculty were hampered both by Boston's distance from the center of Jesuit activity in Maryland and by suspicion on the part of the city's [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Protestant elite]]. Relations with Boston's civic leaders worsened such that, when a Jesuit faculty was finally secured in 1843, Fenwick decided to leave the Boston school and instead opened the [[College of the Holy Cross]] {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of the city in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] where he felt the Jesuits could operate with greater autonomy. Meanwhile, the vision for a college in Boston was sustained by [[John McElroy (Jesuit)|John McElroy, S.J.]], who saw an even greater need for such an institution in light of Boston's growing Irish Catholic immigrant population. With the approval of his Jesuit superiors, McElroy went about raising funds and in 1857 purchased land for \"The Boston College\" on Harrison Avenue in the Hudson neighborhood of [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts]]. With little fanfare, the college's two buildings\u2014a schoolhouse and a [[Church (building)|church]]\u2014welcomed their first class of scholastics in 1859. Two years later, with as little fanfare, BC closed again. Its short-lived second incarnation was plagued by the outbreak of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and disagreement within the Society over the college's governance and finances. BC's inability to obtain a charter from the anti-Catholic Massachusetts legislature only compounded its troubles.\n[[File:OldBClithograph.jpg|thumb|left|Old BC in [[South End, Boston, Massachusetts|Boston's South End]]]]\nOn {{Start date|1863|3|31}}, more than three decades after its initial inception, Boston College's charter was formally approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. BC became the second [[Jesuit]] institution of higher learning in [[Massachusetts]] and the first located in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area. [[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., a Swiss Jesuit from French-speaking [[Fribourg]], was selected as BC's first president and immediately reopened the original college buildings on Harrison Avenue. For most of the 19th century, BC offered a singular 7-year program corresponding to both high school and college. Its entering class in the fall of 1864 included 22 students, ranging in age from 11 to 16 years.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://bc.edu/about/history.html |title=History \u2013 Boston College |publisher=Bc.edu |date=1909-06-19 |accessdate=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103122335/http://www.bc.edu/about/history.html |archive-date=January 3, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The curriculum was based on the Jesuit ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'', emphasizing [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[philosophy]], and [[theology]].\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Move to Chestnut Hill===\n[[File:Gasson Tower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]]]]\nBoston College's enrollment reached nearly 500 by the turn of the 20th century. Expansion of the South End buildings onto James Street enabled increased separation between the high school and college divisions, though [[Boston College High School]] remained a constituent part of Boston College until 1927 when it was separately [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]]. In 1907, newly installed President [[Thomas I. Gasson]], S.J., determined that BC's cramped, urban quarters in Boston's South End were inadequate and unsuited for significant expansion. Inspired by [[John Winthrop]]'s early vision of Boston as a \"[[city upon a hill]]\", he re-imagined Boston College as world-renowned university and a beacon of [[Jesuit]] scholarship. Less than a year after taking office, he purchased [[Amos Adams Lawrence]]'s farm on [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], six&nbsp;miles (10&nbsp;km) west of downtown. He organized an international competition for the design of a [[campus]] master plan and set about raising funds for the construction of the \"new\" university. Construction began in 1909.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy 1913, construction costs had surpassed available funds, and as a result [[Gasson Hall]], \"New BC's\" main building, stood alone on Chestnut Hill for its first three years. Buildings of the former Lawrence farm, including a barn and gatehouse, were temporarily adapted for college use while a massive fundraising effort was underway. While Maginnis's ambitious plans were never fully realized, BC's first \"capital campaign\"\u2014which included a large replica of Gasson Hall's clock tower set up on Boston Common to measure the fundraising progress\u2014ensured that President Gasson's vision survived. By the 1920s BC began to fill out the dimensions of its university charter, establishing the Boston College Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, the [[Boston College Law School]], and the [[Woods College of Advancing Studies]], followed successively by the [[Boston College Graduate School of Social Work]], the [[Carroll School of Management]], the [[Connell School of Nursing]], and the [[Lynch School of Education|Lynch School of Education and Human Development]]. In 1926, Boston College conferred its first degrees on women (though it did not become fully coeducational until 1970). On April 20, 1963, an address by President [[John F. Kennedy]], the nation's first Catholic president who had received an honorary degree in 1956, was the highlight of a week-long centennial celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/JFKWHP/1963/Month%2004/Day%2020/JFKWHP-1963-04-20-D|title=Trip to Boston: President Kennedy's Address at Boston College Centennial Ceremonies.

At the city, state and federal levels, BC graduates dominated Massachusetts politics for much of the 20th century. However, cultural changes in American society and in the church following the [[Second Vatican Council]] forced the university to question its purpose and mission. Meanwhile, poor financial management lead to deteriorating facilities and resources, and rising tuition costs. Student outrage, combined with growing protests over [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and the [[Operation Menu|bombings in Cambodia]], culminated in student strikes, including demonstrations at [[Gasson Hall]] in April 1970.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Gasson Hall in Spring.jpg|Gasson Hall in spring\nFile:Gasson Hall in Summer.jpg|Gasson Hall in summer\nFile:Gasson Hall in Autumn.jpg|Gasson Hall in autumn\nFile:Gasson in Winter.jpg|Gasson Hall in winter\n</gallery>\n\n===The Monan Era===\nBy the time [[J. Donald Monan]], S.J. began his presidency on September 5, 1972, BC was approximately $30 million in debt, its endowment totaled just under $6 million, and faculty and staff salaries had been frozen during the previous year. Rumors about the university's future were rampant, including speculation that BC would be acquired by [[Harvard University]]. After Monan's appointment, the Boston College Board of Trustees was reconfigured.  The board was broadened beyond its historic membership of members of the [[Society of Jesus]], as lay alumni and business leaders were brought in, bringing new business models and an ability to raise funds. A similar restructuring had been accomplished first at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1967 by Fr. [[Theodore Hesburgh]], [[Congregation of the Holy Cross|CSC]], and Edmund Stephan,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html|title=Edmund Stephan, 86, Lawyer Who Reorganized Notre Dame|last=Saxon|first=Wolfgang|date=1998-01-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813105624/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/us/edmund-stephan-86-lawyer-who-reorganized-notre-dame.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> with many other Catholic colleges following suit in the ensuing years. In 1974, [[Newton College of the Sacred Heart]] was merged into BC, allowing expansion of Boston College to the Newton College {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus. {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} Boston College Law School moved to the campus, and its dormitories provided needed housing for a student population that was increasingly residential, for which the school had to lease off-campus apartments and even motel rooms. Monan was credited with turning around the school's financial position, leading to an improved reputation and increasing attention from around the world. In 1996, Monan's 24-year presidency, the longest in the university's history, came to an end when he was named [[Chancellor (education)|University Chancellor]] and succeeded by President [[William P. Leahy]], S.J.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:BC Campus Green.jpg|thumb|right|Gasson Quadrangle]]\nSince assuming the Boston College presidency, Leahy's tenure has been marked with an acceleration of the growth and development initiated by his predecessor, as well as by what some critics see as abandonment of the college's initial mission to provide a college education for residents of Boston.  It has expanded by almost {{convert|150|acres|m2}}, while dramatically reducing the greenery of its middle campus, although portions of the college's legendary \"Dustbowl\" were removed to accommodate additional expansion of its buildings. During this period, undergraduate applications have surpassed 31,000. At the same time, BC students, faculty and athletic teams have seen indicators of success\u2014winning record numbers of [[Fulbright Award|Fulbrights]], [[Rhodes scholarship|Rhodes]], and other academic awards; setting new marks for research grants; and winning conference and national titles. In 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program to examine issues facing the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] in light of the [[Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal|clergy sexual abuse scandal]].

Combining [[Gothic Revival]] architecture with principles of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a [[cruciform]] plan. Maginnis's design broke from the traditional [[Oxbridge]] models that had inspired it\u2014and that had until then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses. In its unprecedented scale, [[Gasson Hall|Gasson Tower]] was conceived not as the [[Bell tower|belfry]] of a singular building, but as the crowning [[campanile]] of Maginnis' new \"[[city upon a hill]]\". Although Maginnis' ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now BC's iconic middle campus. Among these, the [[Bapst Library]] has been called the \"finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America\" and [[Devlin Hall]] won the [[Harleston Parker Medal]] for \"most beautiful building in Boston\". The 1895 [[Louis K. Liggett]] Estate was acquired in 1941 and developed into a [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor-style]] upper campus, while an architecturally eclectic lower campus took shape on land acquired by filling in part of the [[Chestnut Hill Reservoir]]. Modernism had an enormous impact on development after the 1940s, though some of the modernist buildings at BC maintained non-modern rough stone facades in keeping with Maginnis's original designs.\n[[File:Boston College Quadrangle.jpg|thumb|right|Students walk through a campus quadrangle.]]\nBoston College's eight research libraries contain over two million printed volumes. Including manuscripts, journals, government documents and microform items, ranging from ancient papyrus scrolls to digital databases, the collections have some twelve million items. Together with the university's museums, they include original manuscripts and prints by [[Galileo]], [[Ignatius of Loyola]], and [[Francis Xavier]] as well as world-renowned collections in [[Jesuit]]ana, [[Ireland|Irish]] literature, sixteenth-century [[Flanders|Flemish]] tapestries, ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] pottery, [[Caribbean]] folk art and literature, [[Japanese art|Japanese prints]], [[United States federal government|U.S. government]] documents, [[United States Congress|Congressional]] Archives, and paintings that span the history of art from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and the [[Americas]]. Opened in 1928, [[Bapst Library]] was named for the first president of Boston College ([[Johannes Bapst]], S.J., 1815 to 1887) and it was one of the few structures built according to Charles Donagh Maginnis' original \"Oxford in America\" master plan.

Rather, the building houses the offices of the Army ROTC program as well as the Student Program Offices. Often known as 'dark and dank', the building is distinct from the quadrangle area located across the campus green, known as the Dustbowl. Built in 1963, Carney has an unusual structure seeming to face away from the rest of the campus. Contrary to popular belief, the building was not built backwards but rather styled to allow more offices to have windows, according to BC Historian, Professor Thomas O'Connor. The Beacon Street side of the building contains a fountain in the middle of the courtyard; the fountain has been dry for decades as the result of the frequent use of powdered soap pranks by undergraduate students. The building additionally contains sets of unused lockers throughout the floors, which added to the fictitious speculation of the building being a former high school although they had been used by the commuter students who formed the vast majority of enrollment for many years. The existing 10-year university plan slates Carney Hall for reconstruction. Sections of the first floor have received new carpets, fresh coats of paint, and new ceiling tiles. The existing university 30\u201350-year plan schedules the reconstructed building to remain part of the quadrangle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/urban-legends-of-boston-college-1.922392|title=Urban Legends of Boston College - Features - The Heights - Boston College|accessdate=April 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192700/http://www.bcheights.com/2.6178/urban-legends-of-boston-college-1.922392|archivedate=April 16, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Fulton Hall Atrium.jpg|thumb|right|Fulton Hall atrium]]\n* McElroy Commons\nLocated on the Southwest Corner of middle campus, McElroy is referred to by students as 'Mac', reflecting the common, but incorrect, pronunciation of the building's name.

The Department today still has a large proportion of experts in continental philosophy including European philosophy and literature expert [[Richard Kearney]], expert in phenomenology [[John Sallis]], expert in Christian philosophy and apologetics [[Peter Kreeft]], and experts in social and political philosophy [[David M.

After receiving overwhelming approval from the university's board of [[trustees]], and UGBC president Dan Cotter, the Office of Minority Student Programs became the Office of AHANA Student Programs. The term, or one or its derivative forms, such as ALANA (where \"[[Latino (demonym)|Latino]]\" is substituted for \"Hispanic\"), has become common on a number of other American university campuses. Boston College, which has registered the term AHANA as a [[trademark]], has granted official permission for its use to over 50 institutions and organizations in the [[United States]].

They compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level (Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports (except men's lacrosse) since the 2005-06 season. The Eagles formerly competed as a charter member of the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] from 1979-80 to 2004-05. Up to that point, Boston College was the only Big East member affiliated with the Catholic Church that played football in the conference. All the football-playing members of the Big East are now secular (usually public) institutions. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), football, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse (non-ACC), sailing (non-ACC), skiing (non-ACC), soccer, swimming, tennis, and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, fencing (non-ACC), field hockey, golf, ice hockey (non-ACC), lacrosse, rowing, sailing, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball. The men's and women's ice hockey teams compete in [[Hockey East]]; while the women's rowing team competes in the [[Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges]] (EAWRC) as well as the ACC; and the co-ed skiing, fencing and sailing teams are non-ACC/NCAA. Boston College is one of only thirteen universities in the country offering NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly, I-A) football, Division I men's and women's basketball, and Division I hockey.\n[[File:Ice Hockey Conte Forum.jpg|right|thumb|An ice hockey game played at \"Kelley Rink,\" Conte Forum.]] \nThe mascot for all Boston College athletic teams is the [[Eagle]], generally referred to in the plural, i.e., \"The Eagles\". The character representing the mascot at football, hockey, and basketball games is an American bald eagle named [[Baldwin the Eagle|Baldwin]], derived from the \"bald\" head of the American bald eagle and the word \"win\". The school colors are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[gold (color)|gold]]. The fight song, ''[[For Boston]]'', was composed by T.J. Hurley, class of 1885.\n[[File:Alumni Stadium Boston College.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Stadium, home of the Boston College Eagles.]]\nIn hockey and (less famously) baseball, Boston College participates in the annual [[Beanpot (ice hockey)|Beanpot]] tournaments held at [[TD Banknorth Garden]] and [[Fenway Park]], respectively. Boston College competes in the Beanpot against the three other major sports colleges in Boston: the [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] [[Northeastern Huskies|Huskies]], [[Harvard University]] Crimson, and [[Boston University]] [[Boston University Terriers|Terriers]]. BC has reached the championship game 31 times and has won the Beanpot 16 times, including the 2010, 2011 and 2012 championships. The less renowned baseball tournament, was first played in 1990 and out of seventeen baseball Beanpots, Boston College has won nine, last winning in 2008. The baseball team also plays an exhibition game against the [[Boston Red Sox]] at [[jetBlue Park]] after several years at [[City Of Palms Park]] both in [[Fort Myers, Florida|Ft. Myers]], [[Florida]] during [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[spring training]]. The men's hockey team won the [[2008 NCAA Hockey Championship|2008 NCAA Championship]] on April 12, 2008 with a 4\u20131 victory over the University of Notre Dame in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]],  the [[2010 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament|2010 NCAA Championship]] with a 5\u20130 victory over Wisconsin on April 10, 2010, and in 2012 in the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament]]  with a 4-1 victory over [[Ferris State University]] in Tampa.\n\nPrincipal athletic facilities include [[Alumni Stadium]] (capacity: 44,500), [[Conte Forum]] (8,606), [[Kelley Rink]] (7,884), [[Eddie Pellagrini Diamond at John Shea Field]] (1,000), the Newton Soccer Complex (1,000), and the Flynn Recreation Complex.

The Eagles tied [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] for the highest total of any Division I-A university. Other schools having ten or more sports honored included [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] (12), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] (11), and [[Duke University|Duke]] (11). Teams honored were football, men's fencing, men's outdoor track, men's skiing, women's rowing, women's cross country, women's fencing, women's field hockey, women's indoor track, women's outdoor track, women's skiing, women's swimming, women's soccer, women's tennis, and women's volleyball. Boston College's football program was one of only five Division I-A teams that were so honored. The other four were [[Auburn University|Auburn]], Navy, Stanford, and Duke.\n\n===Football===\n{{Main|Boston College Eagles football}}\n[[File:Boston Eagles footb 1893.gif|thumb|right|Boston College's first football team in 1893.]]\nThe Boston College Eagles have achieved occasional success in college football. On November 16, 1940, BC's [[Frank Leahy]]-coached championship team took a win from two-season undefeated Georgetown University in the final seconds, in a game that renowned sportswriter [[Grantland Rice]] called the greatest ever played.\n\nTwo of Boston College's most famous football victories came in dramatic fashion, on the final play of the game. On November 23, 1984, before a national audience on [[CBS]], [[Doug Flutie]] threw a {{convert|48|yd|adj=on}} [[Hail Mary pass|Hail Mary]] to Gerard Phelan for a 47\u201345 victory over the University of Miami at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]].

Changes have been made to the song, including reworking the phrase \"for here men are men\" into \"for here all are one\" in the first verse.\n\n==Notable persons==\n{{Main|List of Boston College people}}\nBC students were universally called \"'''Heightsmen'''\" until 1925 when Caitlin Beckman became the first \"'''Heightswoman'''\" to receive a BC degree. \"'''Heightsonian'''\" was originally conceived as a way to gender neutralize the original term \"Heightsmen\", though \"'''Eagles'''\", once exclusively used for members of the university's athletics teams, is more commonly used.<ref name=disamBCM /> The term \"Golden Eagles\" refers strictly to BC graduates who have celebrated their 50th anniversary reunion. \"Double Eagles\" refer to alumni who attended [[Boston College High School]] and graduated from the college and \"Triple Eagles\" are those alumni who are also graduates of a graduate program.\n\nThere are over 179,000 alumni in over 120 countries around the world.<ref name=Factbook/> Boston College students have enjoyed success in winning prestigious post-graduate fellowships and awards, including recent [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]], [[Marshall scholarship|Marshall]], [[Andrew W.
