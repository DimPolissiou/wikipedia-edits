The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions.<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963}}</ref> Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was also similar to the [[Soviet]] [[Almaz]] space station, which had a very similar purpose and design. Unlike the MOL, however, Almaz was flown several times throughout the 1970s and did end up being used for military reconnaissance. \n\nMOL was canceled in 1969, during the height of the [[Apollo program]], when it was shown that uncrewed [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Background ==\n==Modules==\n===Specifications===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Crew: 2\n*Maximum duration: 40 days\n*Orbit: Sun synchronous or polar\n*Length: {{convert|21.92|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|3.05|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Habitable volume: {{convert|11.3|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}\n*Gross mass: {{convert|14476|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Payload: {{convert|2700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Power: [[fuel cell]]s or [[solar cell]]s\n*[[Reaction control system|RCS]] system: [[dinitrogen tetroxide|{{chem2|N2O4}}]]/[[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]\n*Reference:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/m/mol.html |title=MOL |website=Astronautix.com |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:MOL 01.jpg|MOL main features\nImage:Proposed USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory - GPN-2003-00094.jpg|Early 1960s MOL conceptual drawing that did not use the Gemini spacecraft\nImage:Dorian 21.jpg|Integral launch dual compartment laboratory\nImage:Dorian_25.jpg|MOL variations\nImage:MOL spacesuit.jpg|MOL spacesuit\nFile:USAF_Astronaut_Maneuvering_Unit.jpg|Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), developed for MOL\n</gallery>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe Gemini capsule was redesigned for MOL and named Gemini B.

After about one month of space station operations, the crew would return to the Gemini B capsule, separate from the station and perform reentry.

A hatch installed in the Gemini's [[heat shield]]\u2014intended to provide access to the MOL during crewed operations\u2014was tested during the capsule's reentry.

This camera system was codenamed ''Dorian'' and given the designation [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]]. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before any operational flights occurred.\n\nThe KH-10 intended for the MOL program was succeeded by the uncrewed [[KH-11 Kennan]], which launched in 1976 as the Soviet Union was winding down its [[Almaz|crewed space reconnaissance program]].  The KH-11 is said to have achieved the goal of {{convert|3|in|mm|0|adj=on}} imaging [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and introduced video transmission of images back to Earth.\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. MOL program director [[Bernard Schriever]] commissioned a report in May 1966 examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.<ref name=\"day20190319\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3456/1 |title=The Space Review: The measure of a man: Evaluating the role of astronauts in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program (part 1) |last=Day |first=Dwayne A. |date=2018-03-19 |website=The Space Review |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMOL was canceled on 10 June 1969 with the first projected flight three years away. Between 1965 and 1969, MOL's projected cost rose from $1.5 billion to $3 billion while the Vietnam War took larger portions of the defense budget. While Defense Secretary [[Melvin R. Laird]] and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] strongly supported the station, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] head [[Richard Helms]] did not support the project because he feared that the death of a MOL astronaut might ground launches and thus damage the nation's satellite reconnaissance program. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] agreed to the [[Bureau of the Budget]]'s proposal to cancel MOL,{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}} as it was determined the capabilities of uncrewed spy satellites met or exceeded the capabilities of crewed MOL missions.\n\nAl Crews said in 2015 that when he saw high-resolution photographs from [[KH-8 Gambit 3]], first launched a few months after the 1966 report, he knew that manned MOL would be canceled. NASA offered those MOL astronauts 35 years of age and under the opportunity to transfer to its astronaut program. Seven of the 14 astronauts were 35 or younger and took the offer, becoming [[NASA Astronaut Group 7]]: Future [[NASA Administrator]] [[Richard H. Truly]], [[Karol J. Bobko]], [[Robert Crippen]], [[C.

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions.<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963}}</ref> Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was also similar to the [[Russian]] [[Almaz]] space station, which had a very similar purpose and design. Unlike the MOL, however, Almaz was flown several times throughout the 1970s and did end up being used for military reconnaissance. \n\nMOL was canceled in 1969, during the height of the [[Apollo program]], when it was shown that uncrewed [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Background ==\n==Modules==\n===Specifications===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Crew: 2\n*Maximum duration: 40 days\n*Orbit: Sun synchronous or polar\n*Length: {{convert|21.92|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|3.05|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Habitable volume: {{convert|11.3|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}\n*Gross mass: {{convert|14476|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Payload: {{convert|2700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Power: [[fuel cell]]s or [[solar cell]]s\n*[[Reaction control system|RCS]] system: [[dinitrogen tetroxide|{{chem2|N2O4}}]]/[[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]\n*Reference:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/m/mol.html |title=MOL |website=Astronautix.com |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:MOL 01.jpg|MOL main features\nImage:Proposed USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory - GPN-2003-00094.jpg|Early 1960s MOL conceptual drawing that did not use the Gemini spacecraft\nImage:Dorian 21.jpg|Integral launch dual compartment laboratory\nImage:Dorian_25.jpg|MOL variations\nImage:MOL spacesuit.jpg|MOL spacesuit\nFile:USAF_Astronaut_Maneuvering_Unit.jpg|Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), developed for MOL\n</gallery>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe Gemini capsule was redesigned for MOL and named Gemini B.

The flight consisted of a MOL [[mockup]] built from a [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] propellant tank, and the [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|refurbished capsule]] from the [[Gemini 2]] mission as a [[prototype]] {{nowrap|Gemini B}} spacecraft.\n\nAfter the [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|Gemini B prototype]] separated for a sub-orbital [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]], the MOL mockup continued into [[orbit]] and released three satellites. A hatch installed in the Gemini's [[heat shield]]\u2014intended to provide access to the MOL during crewed operations\u2014was tested during the capsule's reentry. The Gemini capsule was recovered near [[Ascension Island]] in the South Atlantic by the {{USS|La Salle|AGF-3|6}} after a flight of 33 minutes.\n\n===Proposed===\n* 1970 December 1 -  MOL 1 - First uncrewed Gemini-B/[[Titan IIIM]] qualification flight (Gemini-B flown alone, without an active MOL)\n* 1971 June 1 -  MOL 2 - Second uncrewed Gemini-B/Titan 3M qualification flight (Gemini-B flown alone, without an active MOL)\n* 1972 February 1 -  MOL 3 - A crew of two ([[James M.

This camera system was codenamed ''Dorian'' and given the designation [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]]. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before any operational flights occurred.\n\nThe KH-10 intended for the MOL program was succeeded by the uncrewed [[KH-11 Kennan]], which launched in 1976 as the Soviet Union was winding down its [[Almaz|crewed space reconnaissance program]].  The KH-11 is said to have achieved the goal of {{convert|3|in|mm|0|adj=on}} imaging [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and introduced video transmission of images back to Earth.\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. MOL program director [[Bernard Schriever]] commissioned a report in May 1966 examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.<ref name=\"day20190319\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3456/1 |title=The Space Review: The measure of a man: Evaluating the role of astronauts in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program (part 1) |last=Day |first=Dwayne A. |date=2018-03-19 |website=The Space Review |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMOL was canceled on 10 June 1969 with the first projected flight three years away. Between 1965 and 1969, MOL's projected cost rose from $1.5 billion to $3 billion while the Vietnam War took larger portions of the defense budget. While Defense Secretary [[Melvin R. Laird]] and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] strongly supported the station, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] head [[Richard Helms]] did not support the project because he feared that the death of a MOL astronaut might ground launches and thus damage the nation's satellite reconnaissance program. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] agreed to the [[Bureau of the Budget]]'s proposal to cancel MOL,{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}} as it was determined the capabilities of uncrewed spy satellites met or exceeded the capabilities of crewed MOL missions.\n\nAl Crews said in 2015 that when he saw high-resolution photographs from [[KH-8 Gambit 3]], first launched a few months after the 1966 report, he knew that manned MOL would be canceled. NASA offered those MOL astronauts 35 years of age and under the opportunity to transfer to its astronaut program. Seven of the 14 astronauts were 35 or younger and took the offer, becoming [[NASA Astronaut Group 7]]: Future [[NASA Administrator]] [[Richard H. Truly]], [[Karol J. Bobko]], [[Robert Crippen]], [[C. Gordon Fullerton]], [[Henry W. Hartsfield]], [[Robert F. Overmyer]], and [[Donald H. Peterson]].

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow.

Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it.

After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

We ask them to stop killing us in the name of honor and give us the right to say no because we have the right to say no to anything that we don't feel comfortable with. We must have the right to say that we can't tolerate sexual harassment and to say no to decisions regarding our marriages by other [family members]. Our religion gives us the right to choose our life partner, so why not society?\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://gandhara.rferl.org/a/pakistani-women-s-rights-activist-sees-victory/30472538.html|title=Pakistani Women's Rights Activist Sees Victory|website=RFE/RL|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n== Attacks ==\nIn 2012<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Journalist-couple-shot-at-in-Pakistan-both-unhurt/Article1-954047.aspx|title=Journalist couple shot at in Pakistan, both unhurt|date=2 November 2012|newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]]|accessdate=19 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523092551/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Journalist-couple-shot-at-in-Pakistan-both-unhurt/Article1-954047.aspx|archivedate=23 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/well-known-pakistani-journalist-marvi-sirmed-shot-at-287824|title=Well-known Pakistani journalist Marvi Sirmed shot  at|date=2 November 2012|accessdate=2 November 2012|publisher=NDTV}}</ref> and again in 2018,<ref name=\"th1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/626255-columnist-marvi-sarmad-escapes-attempt-on-life|title=Columnist Marvi Sarmad escapes attempt on life|accessdate=3 November 2018|publisher=The News|language=en}}</ref> she was shot at by unidentified gunmen and escaped unhurt.

The Huskers entered their first season of Big Ten baseball after 15 seasons in the Big 12 Conference that included three regular-season titles and four tournament crowns.\n\n==2011==\nIn their last season in the [[Big 12 Conference]], the Huskers went 30\u201325 overall and had a ninth-place 9\u201317 record in conference play, missing out in the Big 12 tournament for the third consecutive season. [[Cody Asche]] became a second-team all-American and a first-team all-conference player while Casey Hauptman won second-team all conference honors. They were both drafted in the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. At the conclusion of the season, Mike Anderson and the entire coaching staff were terminated on May 22, 2011, and the University of Nebraska hired former Husker and Major League All-Star Darin Erstad on June 2, 2011, as head coach after one season as a volunteer assistant coach. A few days later, Ted Silva was hired as well as former Cornhuskers Will Bolt and Jeff Christy.\n\n==Preview==\n\n===Key losses===\n* [[Cody Asche]] \u2013 Drafted in the fourth round by Philadelphia Phillies in 2011 MLB Draft\n* Khiry Cooper \u2013 Would be senior out with a foot injury\n* Logan Ehlers \u2013 Quit team in fall 2011 and transferred to Howard Junior College in Big Spring, Texas\n* Matt Freeman \u2013 Senior in 2011\n* Casey Hauptman \u2013 Senior in 2011, drafted in 26th round by N.Y.

Three Husker juniors were also named to the \u2018Players to Watch List\u2019, including right-handed pitcher Travis Huber, right-handed pitcher Tom Lemke and first baseman-designated hitter Kash Kalkowski.\n\n===Schedule summary===\nThe Huskers played 31 home games at Hawks Field and had 13 contests against 2011 NCAA Tournament teams, including a four-game home stand against 2011 College World Series qualifier California. The 56-game schedule started with 10 games on the road before the Huskers hosted their home opener against former Big 12 foe Kansas State on Tuesday, March 6. The Huskers played eight Big Ten Conference series, with three conference schools not on the schedule, including Penn State and Michigan State, as well as Wisconsin, which doesn't have a baseball program.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=100&atclid=205367109 | title = Huskers Begin New Era in 2012 |last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = Huskers.com | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n==Coaching staff==\nA 14-year MLB veteran and World Series champion, Erstad took over at his alma mater, where he was one of the most successful players in program history. Prior to becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 1995 amateur draft, Erstad was a first-team All-American and the Big Eight Co-Player of the Year as a junior in 1995.\n\n\"It is a great honor to be the head coach of the Nebraska baseball program\", Erstad said. \"My family and I believe strongly in what the University stands for, and I am excited to have this opportunity to help influence kids\u2019 lives in a positive way and help them turn into young men.

A four-year starter and team captain on Nebraska's 2001 and 2002 College World Series teams, Bolt was a volunteer assistant on the Huskers\u2019 2005 squad that set a school record with 57 wins and produced the program's first win at the College World Series. Christy was a junior on the 2005 team and caught a school-record 64 games that season.\n\n\"It is an incredible opportunity to come back to a place where I had so many fond memories as a player and coach\", Bolt said. \"I am humbled and excited to work at my alma mater, and looking forward to making an impact in a coaching role and helping this program reach its goals. It is an honor to be included on a staff put together by a Husker legend and long-time big leaguer in Coach Erstad.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nFor his pitching coach, Erstad plucked Ted Silva away from California where he had coached at UC Irvine and Loyola Marymount over the previous four seasons. As a player, Silva was a first-team All-American at Cal State Fullerton and earned the win in the Titans\u2019 1995 national championship game against USC in the College World Series.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=100&atclid=205367109 | title = Huskers Begin New Era in 2012 |last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = Huskers.com | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n==Schedule==\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=95% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Nebraska Cornhuskers}}\" | 2012 Nebraska Cornhuskers Baseball Game Log<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPSID=103&SPID=33&DB_OEM_ID=100&Q_SEASON=2011 | title = 2012 Schedule/Results |last = | first =  | date =  | publisher = Huskers.com | accessdate = 2009-12-31}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|<div class=\"NavFrame collapsed\">\n<div class=\"NavHead\" style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Nebraska Cornhuskers}};\">Regular Season</div>\n<div class=\"NavContent\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#FFFDD0\" | Date\n! bgcolor=\"#FFFDD0\" | Location\n! bgcolor=\"#FFFDD0\" | NU rank\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Opponent\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Winning pitcher\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Losing pitcher\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Save by\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Result\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Record (Big Ten)\n|-\n| Feb. 17 || [[Peoria, Arizona]] || NR || {{cbsb link|year=2012|team=Gonzaga Bulldogs|school=Gonzaga University|title=Gonzaga}} || Peterson, D.

featured a new coaching staff and a roster that included 12 new players. The Huskers entered their first season of Big Ten baseball after 15 seasons in the Big 12 Conference that included three regular-season titles and four tournament crowns.\n\n==2011==\nIn their last season in the [[Big 12 Conference]], the Huskers went 30\u201325 overall and had a ninth-place 9\u201317 record in conference play, missing out in the Big 12 tournament for the third consecutive season. [[Cody Asche]] became a second-team all-American and a first-team all-conference player while Casey Hauptman won second-team all conference honors. They were both drafted in the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. At the conclusion of the season, Mike Anderson and the entire coaching staff were terminated on May 22, 2011, and the University of Nebraska hired former Husker and Major League All-Star Darin Erstad on June 2, 2011, as head coach after one season as a volunteer assistant coach. A few days later, Ted Silva was hired as well as former Cornhuskers Will Bolt and Jeff Christy.\n\n==Preview==\n\n===Key losses===\n* [[Cody Asche]] \u2013 Drafted in the fourth round by Philadelphia Phillies in 2011 MLB Draft\n* Khiry Cooper \u2013 Would be senior out with a foot injury\n* Logan Ehlers \u2013 Quit team in fall 2011 and transferred to Howard Junior College in Big Spring, Texas\n* Matt Freeman \u2013 Senior in 2011\n* Casey Hauptman \u2013 Senior in 2011, drafted in 26th round by N.Y. Mets\n* Patric Tolentino \u2013 Senior in 2011\n* Sean Yost \u2013 Would-be senior with injury\n\n===Preseason picks===\nThe Big Ten coaches picked Nebraska to finish fourth out of the league's 11 teams in 2012. Three Husker juniors were also named to the \u2018Players to Watch List\u2019, including right-handed pitcher Travis Huber, right-handed pitcher Tom Lemke and first baseman-designated hitter Kash Kalkowski.\n\n===Schedule summary===\nThe Huskers played 31 home games at Hawks Field and had 13 contests against 2011 NCAA Tournament teams, including a four-game home stand against 2011 College World Series qualifier California. The 56-game schedule started with 10 games on the road before the Huskers hosted their home opener against former Big 12 foe Kansas State on Tuesday, March 6. The Huskers played eight Big Ten Conference series, with three conference schools not on the schedule, including Penn State and Michigan State, as well as Wisconsin, which doesn't have a baseball program.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=100&atclid=205367109 | title = Huskers Begin New Era in 2012 |last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = Huskers.com | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n==Coaching staff==\nA 14-year MLB veteran and World Series champion, Erstad took over at his alma mater, where he was one of the most successful players in program history. Prior to becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 1995 amateur draft, Erstad was a first-team All-American and the Big Eight Co-Player of the Year as a junior in 1995.\n\n\"It is a great honor to be the head coach of the Nebraska baseball program\", Erstad said. \"My family and I believe strongly in what the University stands for, and I am excited to have this opportunity to help influence kids\u2019 lives in a positive way and help them turn into young men. I am committed to helping them grow as people.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"right\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Nebraska Cornhuskers}}; text-align:center;\" | '''2012 Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball coaching staff'''\n|-\n|'''Head Coach''' || [[Darin Erstad]]\n|-\n|'''Associate Head Coach''' || Will Bolt\n|-\n|'''Assistant Coach''' || Ted Silva\n|-\n|'''Volunteer Assistant Coach''' || Jeff Christy\n|-\n|'''Director of Operations''' || Curtis Ledbetter\n|-\n|'''Graduate Assistant''' || Brad Smith\n|-\n|}\n\nErstad is not the only former Husker on his coaching staff, as he brought on Will Bolt as his associate head coach and Jeff Christy as the team's volunteer assistant. A four-year starter and team captain on Nebraska's 2001 and 2002 College World Series teams, Bolt was a volunteer assistant on the Huskers\u2019 2005 squad that set a school record with 57 wins and produced the program's first win at the College World Series. Christy was a junior on the 2005 team and caught a school-record 64 games that season.\n\n\"It is an incredible opportunity to come back to a place where I had so many fond memories as a player and coach\", Bolt said. \"I am humbled and excited to work at my alma mater, and looking forward to making an impact in a coaching role and helping this program reach its goals. It is an honor to be included on a staff put together by a Husker legend and long-time big leaguer in Coach Erstad.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nFor his pitching coach, Erstad plucked Ted Silva away from California where he had coached at UC Irvine and Loyola Marymount over the previous four seasons. As a player, Silva was a first-team All-American at Cal State Fullerton and earned the win in the Titans\u2019 1995 national championship game against USC in the College World Series.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=101&SPID=33&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=100&atclid=205367109 | title = Huskers Begin New Era in 2012 |last =  | first =  | date =  | publisher = Huskers.com | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n==Schedule==\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=95% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Nebraska Cornhuskers}}\" | 2012 Nebraska Cornhuskers Baseball Game Log<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPSID=103&SPID=33&DB_OEM_ID=100&Q_SEASON=2011 | title = 2012 Schedule/Results |last = | first =  | date =  | publisher = Huskers.com | accessdate = 2009-12-31}}</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|<div class=\"NavFrame collapsed\">\n<div class=\"NavHead\" style=\"{{CollegePrimaryStyle|Nebraska Cornhuskers}};\">Regular Season</div>\n<div class=\"NavContent\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#FFFDD0\" | Date\n! bgcolor=\"#FFFDD0\" | Location\n! bgcolor=\"#FFFDD0\" | NU rank\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Opponent\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Winning pitcher\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Losing pitcher\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Save by\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Result\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Record (Big Ten)\n|-\n| Feb. 17 || [[Peoria, Arizona]] || NR || {{cbsb link|year=2012|team=Gonzaga Bulldogs|school=Gonzaga University|title=Gonzaga}} || Peterson, D.
