{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}}\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |page=57}}</ref> Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.<ref>{{cite book|author=Y.

Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Imam Shafi'i: Scholar and Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNvUehSxcesC&pg=PT76|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-004-1|pages=76\u2013}}</ref> If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William Gervase Clarence-Smith|author2=W.

However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saron |first1=Mose |title=Studies in Islamic History and Civilization: In Honour of Professor David Ayalon |date=1986 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789652640147 |page=266}}</ref> He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin.

Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines. [[Circassians|Circassian]] and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernard Lewis|title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East: An Historical Enquiry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdjvedBeMHYC&pg=PA74|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-505326-5|pages=74\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls.

Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread. Except for the Sultans, there is no evidence that the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] nobility or merchants kept slaves.{{sfn|Hasan|2005|p=244}} In medieval [[Punjab]] the Muslim peasants, artisans, small tradesmen, shopkeepers, clerks and minor officials could not afford concubines or slaves.{{sfn|Gandhi|2007|p=19}} But the Muslim nobility of medieval Punjab, such as the [[Khan]]s and Maliks, kept concubines and slaves.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=11}} Female slaves were used for concubinage in many wealthy Muslim households of Punjab.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=12}}\n\nColonial court cases from 19th century Punjab show that the courts recognised the legitimate status of children born to Muslim [[zamindar]]s (landlords) from their concubines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Punjab (India)|title=The Punjab Civil Code (part I) and Selected Acts, with a Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZVeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA244|year=1869|publisher=Punjab Print.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims.

The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]].

This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}}\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |page=57}}</ref> Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.<ref>{{cite book|author=Y.

Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Imam Shafi'i: Scholar and Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNvUehSxcesC&pg=PT76|date=1 November 2011|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-004-1|pages=76\u2013}}</ref> If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished.

The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.<ref>{{cite book|author1=William Gervase Clarence-Smith|author2=W.

However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth.

The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family.

However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired concubines in the Muslim world were not African women but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin.

Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.

This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted.

One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |page=53}}</ref> The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n==Modern manifestations==\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

The female captives are used sexually. Their Muslim captors state that Islamic law allows them. In [[Afghanistan]] the [[Taliban]] has committed atrocities against the Shia population. One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The Taliban either takes beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly marries them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}}\n\nAsifa Quraishi-Landes also observes that most Muslims believe that sex is only permissible within marriage and they ignore the permission for keeping concubines in Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} Furthermore, the majority of modern Muslims are not aware that Islamic jurists had made an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} and many modern Muslims would be offended by the idea that a [[husband]] owns his wife's private parts under Islamic law.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}}\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam.

The interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a [[display device]] such as a [[computer monitor]], and it can also carry [[Audio signal|audio]], [[USB]], and other forms of data.<ref name=\"ICCE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ICCE-Presentation-on-VESA-DisplayPort.pdf |title=DisplayPort Technical Overview |date=10 January 2011 |publisher=VESA.org |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nDisplayPort was designed to replace [[VGA connector|VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], and [[FPD-Link]]. The interface is [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with other interfaces, such as [[HDMI]] and DVI, through the use of either active or passive adapters.\n\n== Overview ==\nDisplayPort is the first display interface to rely on packetized [[data transmission]], a form of digital communication found in technologies such as [[Ethernet]], USB, and [[PCI Express]]. It permits the use of internal and external display connections, and unlike legacy standards that transmit a [[clock signal]] with each output, the DisplayPort protocol is based on small [[data packet]]s known as ''micro packets'', which can embed the clock signal within the data stream. This allows for higher resolution using fewer pins.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ati-eyefinity,2567-6.html |title=AMD's Eyefinity Technology Explained |date= 28 February 2010 |publisher= Tom's Hardware |accessdate= 23 January 2012}}</ref> The use of data packets also makes DisplayPort extensible, meaning additional features can be added over time without significant changes to the physical interface.<ref name=\"extremetech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/84094-an-inside-look-at-displayport-v12 |title= An Inside Look at DisplayPort v1.2 |date=4 February 2011 |publisher=ExtremeTech |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDisplayPort can be used to transmit audio and video simultaneously, although each is optional and can be transmitted without the other. The video signal path can range from six to sixteen bits per [[channel (digital image)|color channel]], and the audio path can have up to eight channels of 24-bit, 192{{nbsp}}kHz [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio that is uncompressed.<ref name=\"ICCE\" /> A bi-directional, half-duplex auxiliary channel carries device management and device control data for the Main Link, such as VESA [[Extended display identification data|EDID]], [[Monitor Control Command Set|MCCS]], and [[VESA Display Power Management Signaling|DPMS]] standards. In addition, the interface is capable of carrying bi-directional USB signals.<ref name=\"tomshardware\">{{cite web |url= http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-eyefinity-6-displayport,2596-5.html |title= The Case For DisplayPort, Continued, And Bezels |date =15 April 2010 |publisher=Tom's Hardware |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe DisplayPort uses an [[LVDS]] signal protocol that is not compatible with DVI or HDMI. However, [[#Dual-mode DisplayPort|dual-mode]] DisplayPorts are designed to transmit a [[Digital Visual Interface#Single-link DVI|single-link]] DVI or HDMI protocol ([[TMDS]]) across the interface through the use of an external ''passive'' adapter. This adapter enables compatibility mode and converts the signal from 3.3 volts to 5 volts. For analog [[VGA]]/[[YPbPr]] and [[dual-link DVI]], a powered ''active'' adapter is required for compatibility and does not rely on dual mode. Active VGA adapters are powered by the DisplayPort connector directly, while active dual-link DVI adapters typically rely on an external power source such as USB.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.hopeindustrial.com/2011/transition-to-displayport-connectors |title= DisplayPort\u2026 the End of an Era, but Beginning of a New Age |date=27 April 2011 |publisher=Hope Industrial Systems |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Versions ==\n\n=== 1.0 to 1.1 ===\nThe first version, 1.0, was approved by VESA on 3 May 2006.<ref name=\"launch\">{{cite web |title=New DisplayPort(TM) Interface Standard for PCs, Monitors, TV Displays and Projectors Released by the Video Electronics Standards Association |date=3 May 2006 |publisher=Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214160316/http://www.vesa.org/press/VESA_dportlaunchpr_Final.htm |url=http://www.vesa.org/press/VESA_dportlaunchpr_Final.htm |archivedate=14 February 2009}}</ref> Version 1.1 was ratified on 2 April 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/articles/gadgets/displayport-the-new-video-interconnect-standard-20070730/ |title=DisplayPort: The new video interconnect standard |last=Hodgin |first=Rick |date=30 July 2007 |publisher=geek.com |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref> and version 1.1a was ratified on 11 January 2008.<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\">{{cite web|title=VESA DisplayPort Standard, Version 1, Revision 1a|url=http://file.yizimg.com/383992/2014090921252964.pdf|publisher=Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) |date=11 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408072820/http://file.yizimg.com/383992/2014090921252964.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nDisplayPort 1.0\u20131.1a allow a maximum bandwidth of 10.8{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (8.64{{nbsp}}Gbit/s data rate) over a standard 4-lane main link.

The main link consists of a number of unidirectional serial data channels which operate concurrently,  called ''lanes''. A standard DisplayPort connection has 4 lanes, though some applications of DisplayPort implement more, such as the [[Thunderbolt 3]] interface which implements up to 8 lanes of DisplayPort.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thunderbolt 3 Technology Brief |url=https://thunderbolttechnology.net/sites/default/files/Thunderbolt3_TechBrief_FINAL.pdf |date=2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018 |publisher=Intel Corporation}}</ref>{{rp|page=4}}\n\nIn a standard DisplayPort connection, each lane has a dedicated set of twisted-pair wires, and transmits data across it using [[differential signaling]]. This is a self-clocking system, so no dedicated clock signal channel is necessary.<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a71.7.1}} Unlike DVI and HDMI, which vary their transmission speed to the exact rate required for the specific video format, DisplayPort only operates at a few specific speeds; any excess bits in the transmission are filled with \"stuffing symbols\".<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.2.1.4}}\n\nIn DisplayPort versions 1.0{{ndash}}1.4a, the data is encoded using ANSI [[8b/10b encoding]] prior to transmission. With this scheme, only 8 out of every 10 transmitted bits represent data; the extra bits are used for DC balancing (ensuring a roughly equal number of 1s and 0s). As a result, the rate at which data can be transmitted is only 80% of the physical bitrate. The transmission speeds are also sometimes expressed in terms of the \"Link Symbol Rate\", which is the rate at which these 8b/10b-encoded symbols are transmitted (i.e. the rate at which groups of 10 bits are transmitted, 8 of which represent data). The following transmission modes are defined in version 1.0{{ndash}}1.4a:\n* '''RBR''' (Reduced Bit Rate): 1.62{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane (162{{nbsp}}MHz link symbol rate)\n* '''HBR''' (High Bit Rate): 2.70{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane (270{{nbsp}}MHz link symbol rate)\n* '''HBR2''' (High Bit Rate 2): 5.40{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane (540{{nbsp}}MHz link symbol rate), introduced in DP{{nbsp}}1.2\n* '''HBR3''' (High Bit Rate 3): 8.10{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane (810{{nbsp}}MHz link symbol rate), introduced in DP{{nbsp}}1.3\n\nDisplayPort 2.0 uses 128b/132b encoding; each group of 132 transmitted bits represents 128 bits of data. This scheme has an efficiency of 96.{{overline|96}}%. In addition, forward error correction (FEC) consumes a small amount of the link bandwidth, resulting in an overall efficiency of \u224896.7%.<ref name=\"DP 2.0 Anandtech\">{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/14590/vesa-announces-displayport-20-standard-bandwidth-for-8k-monitors-beyond |title=VESA Announces DisplayPort 2.0 Standard: Bandwidth For 8K Monitors & Beyond |date=26 June 2019 |first=Ryan |last=Smith |publisher=Anandtech}}</ref> The following transmission modes are added in DP 2.0:\n* '''UHBR 10''' (Ultra High Bit Rate 10): 10.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane\n* '''UHBR 13.5''' (Ultra High Bit Rate 13.5): 13.5{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane\n* '''UHBR 20''' (Ultra High Bit Rate 20): 20.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane\n\nThe '''total bandwidth''' of the main link in a standard 4-lane connection is the aggregate of all lanes:\n* '''RBR''': {{0}}4 &times; 1.62{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; {{0}}6.48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 5.184{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 648{{nbsp}}MB/s with 8b/10b encoding)\n* '''HBR''': {{0}}4 &times; 2.70{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 10.80{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 8.64{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 1.08{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n* '''HBR2''': 4 &times; 5.40{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 21.60{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 17.28{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 2.16{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n* '''HBR3''': 4 &times; 8.10{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 32.40{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 25.92{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 3.24{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n* '''UHBR 10''': 4 &times; 10.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 40.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 38.6<!-- Do not use 38.78 Gbit/s; see Talk page -->9{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 4.84{{nbsp}}GB/s with 128b/132b encoding and FEC)\n* '''UHBR 13.5''': 4 &times; 13.5{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 54.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 52.2<!-- Do not use 52.36 Gbit/s; see Talk page -->2{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 6.52{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n* '''UHBR 20''': 4 &times; 20.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 80.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 77.3<!-- Do not use 77.57 Gbit/s; see Talk page -->7{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 9.69{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n\nThe transmission mode used by the DisplayPort main link is negotiated by the source and sink device when a connection is made, through a process called ''Link Training''. This process determines the maximum possible speed of the connection. If the quality of the DisplayPort cable is insufficient to reliably handle HBR2 speeds for example, the DisplayPort devices will detect this and switch down to a lower mode to maintain a stable connection.<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.1.1}} The link can be re-negotiated at any time if a loss of synchronization is detected.<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a71.7.3}}\n\nAudio data is transmitted across the main link during the video blanking intervals (short pauses between each line and frame of video data).<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.2.5.3}}\n\n==== Auxiliary channel ====\n\nThe DisplayPort AUX channel is a [[half-duplex]] bidirectional data channel used for miscellaneous additional data beyond video and audio (such as [[I2C|I<sup>2</sup>C]] or CEC commands)<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.4}} at the device manufacturer's discretion.

DisplayPort does not have multiple cable designs; all DP cables have the same basic layout and wiring, and will support any feature including audio, daisy-chaining, [[G-Sync]]/[[FreeSync]], HDR, and DSC.\n\nDisplayPort cables differ in their transmission speed support. DisplayPort specifies four different transmission modes (RBR, HBR, HBR2, and HBR3) which support progressively higher bandwidths. Not all DisplayPort cables are capable of all four transmission modes. VESA offers certifications for each level of bandwidth. These certifications are optional, and not all DisplayPort cables are certified by VESA.\n\nCables with limited transmission speed are still compatible with all DisplayPort devices, but may place limits on the maximum resolution or refresh rate available.\n\nDisplayPort cables are not classified by \"version\". Although cables are commonly labeled with version numbers, with HBR2 cables advertised as \"DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2 cables\" for example, this notation is not permitted by VESA.<ref name=\"VESA DP cable article\" /> The use of version numbers with cables can seem to imply that a DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4 display requires a \"DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4 cable\", or that features introduced in DP{{nbsp}}1.4 such as HDR or DSC will not function with older \"DP{{nbsp}}1.2 cables\", when in reality neither of these are true. DisplayPort cables are classified only by their bandwidth certification level (RBR, HBR, HBR2, HBR3), if they have been certified at all.\n\n==== Cable bandwidth and certifications ====\n\nNot all DisplayPort cables are capable of functioning at the highest levels of bandwidth. Cables may be submitted to VESA for an optional certification at various bandwidth levels. VESA offers three levels of cable certification: RBR, Standard, and DP8K. These certify DisplayPort cables for proper operation at the following speeds:\n\n{| {{table}}\n|+ DisplayPort Cable Certifications\n|-\n! Transmission Mode !! Transmission<br />Bit Rate !!

No new certifications were announced for the UHBR 13.5 and UHBR 20 modes. VESA is encouraging displays to use tethered cables for these speeds, rather than releasing standalone cables onto the market.<ref name=\"DP 2.0 Anandtech\" />\n\nIt should also be noted that the use of Display Stream Compression (DSC), introduced in DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4, greatly reduces the bandwidth requirements for the cable. Formats which would normally be beyond the limits of DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4, such as 4K (3840{{resx}}2160) at 144{{nbsp}}Hz 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB/4:4:4 (31.4{{nbsp}}Gbit/s data rate when uncompressed), can only be implemented by using DSC. This would reduce the physical bandwidth requirements by 2\u20133x, placing it well within the capabilities of an HBR2-rated cable.\n\nThis exemplifies why DisplayPort cables are not classified by \"version\"; although DSC was introduced in version 1.4, this does not mean it needs a so-called \"DP{{nbsp}}1.4 cable\" (an HBR3-rated cable) to function. HBR3 cables are only required for applications which exceed HBR2-level bandwidth, not simply any application involving DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4. If DSC is used to reduce the bandwidth requirements to HBR2 levels, then an HBR2-rated cable will be sufficient.\n\n==== Cable length ====\n\nThe DisplayPort standard does not specify any maximum length for cables, though the DisplayPort 1.2 standard does set a minimum requirement that all cables up to 2 meters in length must support HBR2 speeds (21.6{{nbsp}}Gbit/s), and all cables of any length must support RBR speeds (6.48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s).<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a75.7.1, \u00a74.1}} Cables longer than 2 meters may or may not support HBR/HBR2 speeds, and cables of any length may or may not support HBR3 speeds.\n\n=== Connectors and pin configuration ===\n\nDisplayPort cables and ports may have either a \"full-size\" connector or a \"mini\" connector. These connectors differ only in physical shape\u2014the capabilities of DisplayPort are the same regardless of which connector is used. Using a Mini DisplayPort connector does not affect performance or feature support of the connection.\n\n==== Full-size DisplayPort connector ====\n\n<!-- Image to be added... soon\u2122 -->\nThe standard DisplayPort connector (now referred to as a \"full-size\" connector to distinguish it from the mini connector)<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a74.1.1|quote=\"4.1.1 Cable-Connector Assembly Definition \u2014 A DisplayPort Cable Assembly consists of two plug-type connectors terminating both ends of a bulk cable.

It was first announced in October 2008 for use in the new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Cinema Display. In 2009, VESA adopted it as an official standard, and in 2010 the specification was merged into the main DisplayPort standard with the release of DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2. Apple freely licenses the specification to VESA.\n\nThe Mini DisplayPort (mDP) connector is a 20-pin single-orientation connector with a friction lock. Unlike the full-size connector, it does not have an option for a mechanical latch. The mDP receptacle has dimensions of 7.50{{nbsp}}mm (width) &times; 4.60{{nbsp}}mm (height) &times; 4.99{{nbsp}}mm (depth).<ref name=\"mDP 1.0\">{{cite web |title=Mini DisplayPort Connector Standard, Version 1.0 |url=https://archive.org/details/MiniDisplayPortConnectorSpecificationV1.0 |publisher=Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>{{rp|at=\u00a72.1.3.6, pp27\u201331}} The mDP pin assignments are the same as the full-size DisplayPort connector.<ref name=\"mDP 1.0\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.1.3}}\n\n==== DP_PWR Pin ====\n\nPin 20 on the DisplayPort connector, called DP_PWR, provides 3.3{{nbsp}}V (\u00b110%) DC power at up to 500{{nbsp}}mA (minimum power delivery of 1.5{{nbsp}}W).<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a73.2}} This power is available from all DisplayPort receptacles, on both source and display devices. DP_PWR is intended to provide power for adapters, amplified cables, and similar devices, so that a separate power cable is not necessary.\n\nStandard DisplayPort cable connections do not use the DP_PWR pin. Connecting the DP_PWR pins of two devices directly together through a cable can create a [[short circuit]] which can potentially damage devices, since the DP_PWR pins on two devices are unlikely to have exactly the same voltage (especially with a \u00b110% tolerance).<ref>{{cite web |title=The DisplayPort Pin 20 Problem |url=http://monitorinsider.com/displayport/dp_pin20_controversy.html |publisher=Monitor Insider |accessdate=14 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514112410/http://monitorinsider.com/displayport/dp_pin20_controversy.html |archive-date=14 May 2018}}</ref> For this reason, the DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.1 and later standards specify that passive DisplayPort-to-DisplayPort cables must leave pin 20 unconnected.<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a73.2.2|quote=A standard DisplayPort cable must have no wire for the DP_PWR pin.}}\n\nHowever, in 2013 VESA announced that after investigating reports of malfunctioning DisplayPort devices, it had discovered that a large number of non-certified vendors were manufacturing their DisplayPort cables with the DP_PWR pin connected:\n{{quote\n|''Recently VESA has experienced quite a few complaints regarding troublesome DisplayPort operation that ended up being caused by improperly made DisplayPort cables.  These \"bad\" DisplayPort cables are generally limited to non-DisplayPort certified cables, or off-brand cables.  To further investigate this trend in the DisplayPort cable market, VESA purchased a number of non-certified, off-brand cables and found that an alarmingly high number of these were configured improperly and would likely not support all system configurations.  None of these cables would have passed the DisplayPort certification test, moreover some of these cables could potentially damage a PC, laptop, or monitor.''\n}}\n\nThe stipulation that the DP_PWR wire be omitted from standard DisplayPort cables was not present in the DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.0 standard. However, DisplayPort products (and cables) did not begin to appear on the market until 2008, long after version 1.0 had been replaced by version 1.1. The DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.0 standard was never implemented in commercial products.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Dell UltraSharp 3008WFP 30-Inch LCD Monitor |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010301753.html |date=3 January 2008 |accessdate=14 May 2018 |author=Roy Santos |magazine=PC World |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323030630/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010301753.html |archive-date=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Resolution and refresh frequency limits ==\n\nThe tables below describe the refresh frequencies that can be achieved with each transmission mode. In general, maximum refresh frequency is determined by the transmission mode (RBR, HBR, HBR2, HBR3, UHBR 10, UHBR 13.5, or UHBR 20). These transmission modes were introduced to the DisplayPort standard as follows:\n* '''RBR''' and '''HBR''' were defined in the initial release of the DisplayPort standard, version 1.0\n* '''HBR2''' was introduced in version 1.2\n* '''HBR3''' was introduced in version 1.3\n* '''UHBR 10''', '''UHBR 13.5''', and '''UHBR 20''' were introduced in version 2.0\nHowever, transmission mode support is not necessarily dictated by a device's claimed \"DisplayPort version number\". For example, older versions of the DisplayPort Marketing Guidelines allowed a device to be labeled as \"DisplayPort 1.2\" if it supported the MST feature, even if it didn't support the HBR2 transmission mode.<ref>{{citation|title=VESA DisplayPort Marketing Guidelines version 1.1|url=https://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DisplayPort-Marketing-Guidelines-v1_1.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|page=9}} Newer versions of the guidelines have removed this clause, and currently (as of the June 2018 revision) there are no guidelines on the usage of DisplayPort version numbers in products.<ref>{{cite web |title=DisplayPort Marketing Guidelines R14 |url=http://www.displayport.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DP_Marketing_Guidelines_R14.pdf |date=8 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325043317/http://www.displayport.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DP_Marketing_Guidelines_R14.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2019 |access-date=25 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> DisplayPort \"version numbers\" are therefore not a reliable indication of what transmission speeds a device can support.\n\nIn addition, individual devices may have their own arbitrary limitations beyond transmission speed. For example, [[NVIDIA]] [[Kepler (microarchitecture)|Kepler GK104]] GPUs (such as the GeForce GTX 680 and 770) support \"DisplayPort 1.2\" with the HBR2 transmission mode, but are limited to 540{{nbsp}}Mpx/s, only {{3/4}} of the maximum possible with HBR2.<ref>{{cite web|title=GTX 770 4gb Unable to select 144hz on dell S2716DG.|url=https://www.dell.com/community/Monitors/GTX-770-4gb-Unable-to-select-144hz-on-dell-S2716DG/td-p/4710119}}</ref> Consequently, certain devices may have limitations that differ from those listed in the following tables.\n\nTo support a particular format, the '''source''' and '''display''' devices must both support the required transmission mode, and the DisplayPort cable must also be capable of handling the required bandwidth of that transmission mode. (See: [[DisplayPort#Cables and connectors|Cables and connectors]])\n\n=== Refresh frequency limits for standard video ===\n\nColor depth of 8{{nbsp}}bpc (24{{nbsp}}bit/px or 16.7 million colors) is assumed for all formats in these tables. This is the standard color depth used on most computer displays. Note that some operating systems refer to this as \"32-bit\" color depth\u2014this is the same as 24-bit color depth. The 8 extra bits are for alpha channel information, which is only present in software. At the transmission stage, this information has already been incorporated into the primary color channels, so the actual video data transmitted across the cable only contains 24 bits per pixel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-expanded\"\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"height:2.5em;\" | Limits for uncompressed RGB / {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 video only\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Video Format\n! colspan=7 | Transmission Mode / Maximum Data Rate{{efn|Only a portion of DisplayPort's bandwidth is used for carrying video data.

This color depth is a requirement for various common HDR standards, such as [[HDR10]]. It requires 25% more bandwidth than standard 8{{nbsp}}bpc video.\n\nHDR extensions were defined in version 1.4 of the DisplayPort standard. Some displays support these HDR extensions, but may only implement HBR2 transmission mode if the extra bandwidth of HBR3 is unnecessary (for example, on 4K 60{{nbsp}}Hz HDR displays). Since there is no definition of what constitutes a \"DisplayPort 1.4\" device, some manufacturers may choose to label these as \"DP 1.2\" devices despite their support for DP 1.4 HDR extensions.<ref>{{cite web |title=LG 27UK650-W 4K UHD LED Monitor |url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UK650-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118183112/https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UK650-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor |archive-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> As a result, DisplayPort \"version numbers\" should not be used as an indicator of HDR support.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"height:2.5em;\" | Limits for uncompressed RGB / {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 video only\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Video Format\n! colspan=7 | Transmission Mode / Maximum Data Rate{{efn|Only a portion of DisplayPort's bandwidth is used for carrying video data.

Dual-mode is an optional feature, so not all DisplayPort sources necessarily support DVI/HDMI passive adapters, though in practice nearly all devices do. Officially, the \"DP++\" logo should be used to indicate a DP port that supports dual-mode, but most modern devices do not use the logo.\n\nDevices which implement dual-mode will detect that a DVI or HDMI adapter is attached, and send DVI/HDMI TMDS signals instead of DisplayPort signals. The original DisplayPort Dual-Mode standard (version 1.0), used in DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.1 devices, only supported TMDS clock speeds of up to 165{{nbsp}}MHz (4.95{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth). This is equivalent to HDMI{{nbsp}}1.2, and is sufficient for up to 1920{{resx}}1200 at 60{{nbsp}}Hz.\n\nIn 2013, VESA released the Dual-Mode 1.1 standard, which added support for up to a 300{{nbsp}}MHz TMDS clock (9.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth), and is used in newer DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2 devices.

Older adapters, which were only capable of the 165{{nbsp}}MHz speed, were retroactively termed \"Type{{nbsp}}1\" adapters, with the new 300{{nbsp}}MHz adapters being called \"Type{{nbsp}}2\".<ref>{{cite web |title=VESA Introduces Updated Dual-Mode Standard for Higher Resolution Interoperability with HDMI Displays |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510051652/https://www.vesa.org/news/vesa-introduces-updated-dual-mode-standard-for-higher-resolution-interoperability-with-hdmi-displays/ |archive-date=10 May 2018 |url=http://www.vesa.org/featured-articles/vesa-introduces-updated-dual-mode-standard-for-higher-resolution-interoperability-with-hdmi-displays/ |publisher=VESA |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of the DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.3 standard, VESA added dual-mode support for up to a 600{{nbsp}}MHz TMDS clock (18.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth), the full bandwidth of HDMI{{nbsp}}2.0. This is sufficient for 1920{{resx}}1080 at 240{{nbsp}}Hz, 2560{{resx}}1440 at 144{{nbsp}}Hz, or 3840{{resx}}2160 at 60{{nbsp}}Hz. However, no passive adapters capable of the 600{{nbsp}}MHz dual-mode speed have been produced as of 2018.\n\n==== Dual-mode limitations ====\n\n[[File:DP to DVI converter unmounted.jpg|thumb|Picture of a DisplayPort to DVI adapter after removing its enclosure. The chip on the board converts the voltage levels generated by the dual-mode DisplayPort device to be compatible with a DVI monitor.]]\n\n* Limited adapter speed{{Snd}} Although the pinout and digital signal values transmitted by the DP port are identical to a native DVI/HDMI source, the signals are transmitted at DisplayPort's native voltage (3.3{{nbsp}}V) instead of the 5{{nbsp}}V used by DVI and HDMI. As a result, dual-mode adapters must contain a level-shifter circuit which changes the voltage. The presence of this circuit places a limit on how quickly the adapter can operate, and therefore newer adapters are required for each higher speed added to the standard.\n* Unidirectional{{Snd}} Although the dual-mode standard specifies a method for DisplayPort ''sources'' to output DVI/HDMI signals using simple passive adapters, there is no counterpart standard to give DisplayPort displays the ability to ''receive'' DVI/HDMI input signals through passive adapters. As a result, DisplayPort displays can only receive native DisplayPort signals; any DVI or HDMI input signals must be converted to the DisplayPort format with an active conversion device. DVI and HDMI sources cannot be connected to DisplayPort displays using passive adapters.\n* Single-link DVI only{{Snd}} Since DisplayPort dual-mode operates by using the pins of the DisplayPort connector to send DVI/HDMI signals, the 20-pin DisplayPort connector can only produce a ''single-link'' DVI signal (which uses 19 pins). A ''dual-link DVI'' signal uses 25 pins, and is therefore impossible to transmit natively from a DisplayPort connector through a passive adapter. Dual-link DVI signals can only be produced by converting from native DisplayPort output signals with an active conversion device.\n* Unavailable on USB-C{{Snd}} The ''DisplayPort Alternate Mode'' specification for sending DisplayPort signals over a [[USB-C]] cable does not include support for the dual-mode protocol. As a result, DP-to-DVI and DP-to-HDMI passive adapters do not function when chained from a USB-C to DP adapter.\n\n=== Multi-Stream Transport (MST) {{Anchor|Multi-Stream Transport|MST|Multiple displays on single DisplayPort connector}} ===\n\n'''Multi-Stream Transport''' is a feature first introduced in the DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2 standard. It allows multiple independent displays to be driven from a single DP port on the source devices by [[multiplexing]] several video streams into a single stream and sending it to a ''branch device'', which demultiplexes the signal into the original streams. Branch devices are commonly found in the form of an MST hub, which plugs into a single DP input port and provides multiple outputs, but it can also be implemented on a display internally to provide a DP output port for daisy-chaining, effectively embedding a 2-port MST hub inside the display.<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=Fig. 2-59}}<ref>{{cite web|title=DisplayPortTM Ver.1.2 Overview |url=http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DisplayPort-DevCon-Presentation-DP-1.2-Dec-2010-rev-2b.pdf|accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> Theoretically, up to 63 displays can be supported,<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|page=20}} but the combined data rate requirements of all the displays cannot exceed the limits of a single DP port (17.28{{nbsp}}Gbit/s for a DP{{nbsp}}1.2 port, or 25.92{{nbsp}}Gbit/s for a DP 1.3/1.4 port). In addition, the maximum number of links between the source and any device (i.e. the maximum length of a daisy-chain) is 7,<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.5.2}} and the maximum number of physical output ports on each branch device (such as a hub) is 7.<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.5.1}} With the release of MST, standard single-display operation has been retroactively named \"SST\" mode (Single-Stream Transport).\n\nDaisy-chaining is a feature that must be specifically supported by each intermediary display; not all DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2 devices support it. Daisy-chaining requires a dedicated DisplayPort ''output'' port on the display. Standard DisplayPort ''input'' ports found on most displays cannot be used as a daisy-chain output. Only the last display in the daisy-chain does not need to support the feature specifically or have a DP output port. DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.1 displays can also be connected to MST hubs, and can be part of a DisplayPort daisy-chain if it is the last display in the chain.<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.5.1}}\n\nThe host system's software also needs to support MST for hubs or daisy-chains to work. While [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environments have full support for it, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] operating systems currently do not support MST hubs or DisplayPort daisy-chaining as of macOS 10.13 (\"High Sierra\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Display Daisy-Chaining with High Sierra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513010057/https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/300020/display-daisy-chaining-with-high-sierra |archive-date=13 May 2018 |url=https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/300020/display-daisy-chaining-with-high-sierra |date=27 September 2017 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=MBPr 2015, 2.5GHz i7 \u2013 Daisychaining 2 Dell U2414H 61 Screens |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207155822/https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/189542/mbpr-2015-2-5ghz-i7-daisychaining-2-dell-u2414h-61-screens |archive-date=7 December 2016 |url=https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/189542/mbpr-2015-2-5ghz-i7-daisychaining-2-dell-u2414h-61-screens |date=31 May 2015 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisplayPort-to-DVI and DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapters/cables may or may not function from an MST output port; support for this depends on the specific device.{{Citation needed|reason=Needs a non-OR source (see talk page)|date=July 2018}}\n\nMST is supported by USB Type-C DisplayPort Alternate Mode, so standard DisplayPort daisy-chains and MST hubs do function from Type-C sources with a simple Type-C to DisplayPort adapter.<ref>{{cite web | title=Google's USB Type-C to DP Adapter \"DingDong\" | url= https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/dingdong | accessdate = August 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== High dynamic range (HDR) ===\n\n{{main|High-dynamic-range video}}\n\nSupport for HDR video was introduced in DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4.

It is a visually lossless low-latency algorithm based on [[delta modulation|delta PCM]] coding and [[YCoCg|YCoCg-R]] color space; it allows increased resolutions and color depths and reduced power consumption.<ref name=DSC>{{cite press |url=https://www.vesa.org/news/vesa-finalizes-requirements-for-display-stream-compression-standard/ |title=VESA Finalizes Requirements for Display Stream Compression Standard |publisher=VESA |date=24 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=vesa-etp200>http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VESA_DSC-ETP200.pdf</ref>\n\nDSC has been tested to meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 29170-2 ''Evaluation procedure for nearly lossless coding'' using various test patterns, noise, subpixel-rendered text ([[ClearType]]), UI captures, and photo and video images.<ref name=vesa-etp200/>\n\nDSC version 1.0 was released on 10 March 2014, but was soon deprecated by DSC version 1.1 released on 1 August 2014. The DSC standard supports up to 3:1 compression ratio with constant or variable bit rate, 4:4:4 [[chroma subsampling]], optional 4:2:2 conversion and 6/8/10/12 bits per color component.\n\nDSC version 1.2 was released on 27 January 2016 and is included with DisplayPort 1.4; version 1.2a was released on 18 January 2017. The update includes native encoding of 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 formats in pixel containers, 14/16 bits per color, and minor modifications to the encoding algorithm.\n\nDSC compression works on a horizontal line of pixels encoded using groups of three consecutive pixels for native 4:4:4 and simple 4:2:2 formats, or six pixels (three compressed containers) for native 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 formats. If RGB encoding is used, it is first converted to reversible YCgCo. Simple conversion from 4:2:2 to 4:4:4 can add missing chroma samples by interpolating neighboring pixels. Each luma component is coded separately using three independent substreams (four substreams in native 4:2:2 mode). Prediction step is performed using one of the three modes: modified median adaptive coding (MMAP) algorithm similar to the one used by [[JPEG-LS]], block prediction (optional for decoders due to high computational complexity, negotiated at DSC handshake), and midpoint prediction. Bit rate control algorithm tracks color flatness and buffer fullness to adjust the quantization bit depth for a pixel group in a way that minimizes compression artifacts while staying within the bitrate limits. Repeating recent pixels can be stored in 32-entry Indexed Color History (ICH) buffer, which can be referenced directly by each group in a slice; this improves compression quality of computer-generated images. Alternatively, prediction residuals are computed and encoded with [[entropy coding]] algorithm based on delta size unit-variable length coding (DSU-VLC). Encoded pixel groups are then combined into slices of various height and width; common combinations include 100% or 25% picture width, and 8-, 32-, or 108-line height.\n\nOn 4 January 2017, [[HDMI 2.1]] was announced which supports up to [[10K resolution]] and uses DSC 1.2 for video that is higher than 8K resolution with 4:2:0 [[chroma subsampling]].<ref name=HDMI21PressRelease>{{cite news |url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=145 |title=HDMI Forum announces version 2.1 of the HDMI specification |publisher=HDMI.org |date=2017-01-04 |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref><ref name=HDMI21Introduction>{{cite news |url=http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/hdmi_2_1/index.aspx |title=Introducing HDMI 2.1 |publisher=HDMI.org |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref><ref name=HDMI21January2017Anandtech>{{cite news |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11003/hdmi-21-announced-8kp60-48gbps-cable |title=HDMI 2.1 Announced|author=Anton Shilov |publisher=Anandtech |date=2017-01-05 |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref>\n\n=== eDP ===\n''Embedded DisplayPort'' (eDP) is a display panel interface standard for portable and embedded devices. It defines the signaling interface between graphics cards and integrated displays. The various revisions of eDP are based on existing DisplayPort standards. However, version numbers between the two standards are not interchangeable. For instance, eDP version 1.4 is based on DisplayPort 1.2, while eDP version 1.4a is based on DisplayPort 1.3.

One, two or all four of the differential pairs that USB uses for the SuperSpeed bus can be configured dynamically to be used for DisplayPort lanes. In the first two cases, the connector still can carry a full SuperSpeed signal; in the latter case, at least a non-SuperSpeed signal is available. The DisplayPort AUX channel is also supported over the two sideband signals over the same connection; furthermore, [[USB Power Delivery]] according to the newly expanded USB-PD 2.0 specification is possible at the same time. This makes the Type-C connector a strict superset of the use-cases envisioned for DockPort, SlimPort, Mini and Micro DisplayPort.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8558/displayport-alternate-mode-for-usb-typec-announced | title=DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C Announced{{Snd}} Video, Power, & Data All Over Type-D | accessdate = 14 October 2014 | publisher = anandtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== VirtualLink ===\n{{main|VirtualLink}}\nVirtualLink uses USB-C connectors and DisplayPort to transmit video signals.\n\n== Products ==\n[[File:Lenovo x220 dp crop.jpg|thumb|A [[#Dual-mode|Dual-mode]] DisplayPort connector]]\nSince its introduction in 2006, DisplayPort has gained popularity within the computer industry and is featured on many graphic cards, displays, and notebook computers.

The interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a [[display device]] such as a [[computer monitor]], and it can also carry [[Audio signal|audio]], [[USB]], and other forms of data.<ref name=\"ICCE\">{{cite web |url=http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ICCE-Presentation-on-VESA-DisplayPort.pdf |title=DisplayPort Technical Overview |date=10 January 2011 |publisher=VESA.org |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nDisplayPort was designed to replace [[VGA connector|VGA]], [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]], and [[FPD-Link]]. The interface is [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with other interfaces, such as [[HDMI]] and DVI, through the use of either active or passive adapters.\n\n== Overview ==\nDisplayPort is the first display interface to rely on packetized [[data transmission]], a form of digital communication found in technologies such as [[Ethernet]], USB, and [[PCI Express]]. It permits the use of internal and external display connections, and unlike legacy standards that transmit a clock signal with each output, the DisplayPort protocol is based on small [[data packet]]s known as ''micro packets'', which can embed the clock signal within the data stream. This allows for higher resolution using fewer pins.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-ati-eyefinity,2567-6.html |title=AMD's Eyefinity Technology Explained |date= 28 February 2010 |publisher= Tom's Hardware |accessdate= 23 January 2012}}</ref> The use of data packets also makes DisplayPort extensible, meaning additional features can be added over time without significant changes to the physical interface.<ref name=\"extremetech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/84094-an-inside-look-at-displayport-v12 |title= An Inside Look at DisplayPort v1.2 |date=4 February 2011 |publisher=ExtremeTech |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDisplayPort can be used to transmit audio and video simultaneously, although each is optional and can be transmitted without the other. The video signal path can range from six to sixteen bits per [[channel (digital image)|color channel]], and the audio path can have up to eight channels of 24-bit, 192{{nbsp}}kHz [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] audio that is uncompressed.<ref name=\"ICCE\" /> A bi-directional, half-duplex auxiliary channel carries device management and device control data for the Main Link, such as VESA [[Extended display identification data|EDID]], [[Monitor Control Command Set|MCCS]], and [[VESA Display Power Management Signaling|DPMS]] standards. In addition, the interface is capable of carrying bi-directional USB signals.<ref name=\"tomshardware\">{{cite web |url= http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/amd-eyefinity-6-displayport,2596-5.html |title= The Case For DisplayPort, Continued, And Bezels |date =15 April 2010 |publisher=Tom's Hardware |accessdate=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe DisplayPort uses an [[LVDS]] signal protocol that is not compatible with DVI or HDMI. However, [[#Dual-mode DisplayPort|dual-mode]] DisplayPorts are designed to transmit a [[Digital Visual Interface#Single-link DVI|single-link]] DVI or HDMI protocol ([[TMDS]]) across the interface through the use of an external ''passive'' adapter. This adapter enables compatibility mode and converts the signal from 3.3 volts to 5 volts. For analog [[VGA]]/[[YPbPr]] and [[dual-link DVI]], a powered ''active'' adapter is required for compatibility and does not rely on dual mode. Active VGA adapters are powered by the DisplayPort connector directly, while active dual-link DVI adapters typically rely on an external power source such as USB.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.hopeindustrial.com/2011/transition-to-displayport-connectors |title= DisplayPort\u2026 the End of an Era, but Beginning of a New Age |date=27 April 2011 |publisher=Hope Industrial Systems |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Versions ==\n\n=== 1.0 to 1.1 ===\nThe first version, 1.0, was approved by VESA on 3 May 2006.<ref name=\"launch\">{{cite web |title=New DisplayPort(TM) Interface Standard for PCs, Monitors, TV Displays and Projectors Released by the Video Electronics Standards Association |date=3 May 2006 |publisher=Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214160316/http://www.vesa.org/press/VESA_dportlaunchpr_Final.htm |url=http://www.vesa.org/press/VESA_dportlaunchpr_Final.htm |archivedate=14 February 2009}}</ref> Version 1.1 was ratified on 2 April 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/articles/gadgets/displayport-the-new-video-interconnect-standard-20070730/ |title=DisplayPort: The new video interconnect standard |last=Hodgin |first=Rick |date=30 July 2007 |publisher=geek.com |accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref> and version 1.1a was ratified on 11 January 2008.<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\">{{cite web|title=VESA DisplayPort Standard, Version 1, Revision 1a|url=http://file.yizimg.com/383992/2014090921252964.pdf|publisher=Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) |date=11 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408072820/http://file.yizimg.com/383992/2014090921252964.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nDisplayPort 1.0\u20131.1a allow a maximum bandwidth of 10.8{{nbsp}}Gbit/s (8.64{{nbsp}}Gbit/s data rate) over a standard 4-lane main link.

The main link consists of a number of unidirectional serial data channels which operate concurrently,  called ''lanes''. A standard DisplayPort connection has 4 lanes, though some applications of DisplayPort implement more, such as the [[Thunderbolt 3]] interface which implements up to 8 lanes of DisplayPort.<ref>{{cite web |title=Thunderbolt 3 Technology Brief |url=https://thunderbolttechnology.net/sites/default/files/Thunderbolt3_TechBrief_FINAL.pdf |date=2016 |accessdate=14 May 2018 |publisher=Intel Corporation}}</ref>{{rp|page=4}}\n\nIn a standard DisplayPort connection, each lane has a dedicated set of twisted-pair wires, and transmits data across it using [[differential signaling]]. This is a self-clocking system, so no dedicated clock signal channel is necessary.<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a71.7.1}} Unlike DVI and HDMI, which vary their transmission speed to the exact rate required for the specific video format, DisplayPort only operates at a few specific speeds; any excess bits in the transmission are filled with \"stuffing symbols\".<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.2.1.4}}\n\nIn DisplayPort versions 1.0{{ndash}}1.4a, the data is encoded using ANSI [[8b/10b encoding]] prior to transmission. With this scheme, only 8 out of every 10 transmitted bits represent data; the extra bits are used for DC balancing (ensuring a roughly equal number of 1s and 0s). As a result, the rate at which data can be transmitted is only 80% of the physical bitrate. The transmission speeds are also sometimes expressed in terms of the \"Link Symbol Rate\", which is the rate at which these 8b/10b-encoded symbols are transmitted (i.e. the rate at which groups of 10 bits are transmitted, 8 of which represent data). The following transmission modes are defined in version 1.0{{ndash}}1.4a:\n* '''RBR''' (Reduced Bit Rate): 1.62{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane (162{{nbsp}}MHz link symbol rate)\n* '''HBR''' (High Bit Rate): 2.70{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane (270{{nbsp}}MHz link symbol rate)\n* '''HBR2''' (High Bit Rate 2): 5.40{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane (540{{nbsp}}MHz link symbol rate), introduced in DP{{nbsp}}1.2\n* '''HBR3''' (High Bit Rate 3): 8.10{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane (810{{nbsp}}MHz link symbol rate), introduced in DP{{nbsp}}1.3\n\nDisplayPort 2.0 uses 128b/132b encoding; each group of 132 transmitted bits represents 128 bits of data. This scheme has an efficiency of 96.{{overline|96}}%. In addition, forward error correction (FEC) consumes a small amount of the link bandwidth, resulting in an overall efficiency of \u224896.7%.<ref name=\"DP 2.0 Anandtech\">{{cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/14590/vesa-announces-displayport-20-standard-bandwidth-for-8k-monitors-beyond |title=VESA Announces DisplayPort 2.0 Standard: Bandwidth For 8K Monitors & Beyond |date=26 June 2019 |first=Ryan |last=Smith |publisher=Anandtech}}</ref> The following transmission modes are added in DP 2.0:\n* '''UHBR 10''' (Ultra High Bit Rate 10): 10.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane\n* '''UHBR 13.5''' (Ultra High Bit Rate 13.5): 13.5{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane\n* '''UHBR 20''' (Ultra High Bit Rate 20): 20.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth per lane\n\nThe '''total bandwidth''' of the main link in a standard 4-lane connection is the aggregate of all lanes:\n* '''RBR''': {{0}}4 &times; 1.62{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; {{0}}6.48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 5.184{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 648{{nbsp}}MB/s with 8b/10b encoding)\n* '''HBR''': {{0}}4 &times; 2.70{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 10.80{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 8.64{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 1.08{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n* '''HBR2''': 4 &times; 5.40{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 21.60{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 17.28{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 2.16{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n* '''HBR3''': 4 &times; 8.10{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 32.40{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 25.92{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 3.24{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n* '''UHBR 10''': 4 &times; 10.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 40.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 38.6<!-- Do not use 38.78 Gbit/s; see Talk page -->9{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 4.84{{nbsp}}GB/s with 128b/132b encoding and FEC)\n* '''UHBR 13.5''': 4 &times; 13.5{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 54.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 52.2<!-- Do not use 52.36 Gbit/s; see Talk page -->2{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 6.52{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n* '''UHBR 20''': 4 &times; 20.0{{nbsp}}Gbit/s &#61; 80.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth (data rate of 77.3<!-- Do not use 77.57 Gbit/s; see Talk page -->7{{nbsp}}Gbit/s or 9.69{{nbsp}}GB/s)\n\nThe transmission mode used by the DisplayPort main link is negotiated by the source and sink device when a connection is made, through a process called ''Link Training''.

DisplayPort does not have multiple cable designs; all DP cables have the same basic layout and wiring, and will support any feature including audio, daisy-chaining, [[G-Sync]]/[[FreeSync]], HDR, and DSC.\n\nDisplayPort cables differ in their transmission speed support. DisplayPort specifies four different transmission modes (RBR, HBR, HBR2, and HBR3) which support progressively higher bandwidths. Not all DisplayPort cables are capable of all four transmission modes. VESA offers certifications for each level of bandwidth. These certifications are optional, and not all DisplayPort cables are certified by VESA.\n\nCables with limited transmission speed are still compatible with all DisplayPort devices, but may place limits on the maximum resolution or refresh rate available.\n\nDisplayPort cables are not classified by \"version\". Although cables are commonly labeled with version numbers, with HBR2 cables advertised as \"DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2 cables\" for example, this notation is not permitted by VESA.<ref name=\"VESA DP cable article\" /> The use of version numbers with cables can seem to imply that a DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4 display requires a \"DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4 cable\", or that features introduced in DP{{nbsp}}1.4 such as HDR or DSC will not function with older \"DP{{nbsp}}1.2 cables\", when in reality neither of these are true. DisplayPort cables are classified only by their bandwidth certification level (RBR, HBR, HBR2, HBR3), if they have been certified at all.\n\n==== Cable bandwidth and certifications ====\n\nNot all DisplayPort cables are capable of functioning at the highest levels of bandwidth. Cables may be submitted to VESA for an optional certification at various bandwidth levels. VESA offers three levels of cable certification: RBR, Standard, and DP8K. These certify DisplayPort cables for proper operation at the following speeds:\n\n{| {{table}}\n|+ DisplayPort Cable Certifications\n|-\n! Transmission Mode !! Transmission<br />Bit Rate !!

No new certifications were announced for the UHBR 13.5 and UHBR 20 modes. VESA is encouraging displays to use tethered cables for these speeds, rather than releasing standalone cables onto the market.<ref name=\"DP 2.0 Anandtech\" />\n\nIt should also be noted that the use of Display Stream Compression (DSC), introduced in DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4, greatly reduces the bandwidth requirements for the cable. Formats which would normally be beyond the limits of DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4, such as 4K (3840{{resx}}2160) at 144{{nbsp}}Hz 8{{nbsp}}bpc RGB/4:4:4 (31.4{{nbsp}}Gbit/s data rate when uncompressed), can only be implemented by using DSC. This would reduce the physical bandwidth requirements by 2\u20133x, placing it well within the capabilities of an HBR2-rated cable.\n\nThis exemplifies why DisplayPort cables are not classified by \"version\"; although DSC was introduced in version 1.4, this does not mean it needs a so-called \"DP{{nbsp}}1.4 cable\" (an HBR3-rated cable) to function. HBR3 cables are only required for applications which exceed HBR2-level bandwidth, not simply any application involving DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4. If DSC is used to reduce the bandwidth requirements to HBR2 levels, then an HBR2-rated cable will be sufficient.\n\n==== Cable length ====\n\nThe DisplayPort standard does not specify any maximum length for cables, though the DisplayPort 1.2 standard does set a minimum requirement that all cables up to 2 meters in length must support HBR2 speeds (21.6{{nbsp}}Gbit/s), and all cables of any length must support RBR speeds (6.48{{nbsp}}Gbit/s).<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a75.7.1, \u00a74.1}} Cables longer than 2 meters may or may not support HBR/HBR2 speeds, and cables of any length may or may not support HBR3 speeds.\n\n=== Connectors and pin configuration ===\n\nDisplayPort cables and ports may have either a \"full-size\" connector or a \"mini\" connector. These connectors differ only in physical shape\u2014the capabilities of DisplayPort are the same regardless of which connector is used. Using a Mini DisplayPort connector does not affect performance or feature support of the connection.\n\n==== Full-size DisplayPort connector ====\n\n<!-- Image to be added... soon\u2122 -->\nThe standard DisplayPort connector (now referred to as a \"full-size\" connector to distinguish it from the mini connector)<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a74.1.1|quote=\"4.1.1 Cable-Connector Assembly Definition \u2014 A DisplayPort Cable Assembly consists of two plug-type connectors terminating both ends of a bulk cable.

It was first announced in October 2008 for use in the new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and Cinema Display. In 2009, VESA adopted it as an official standard, and in 2010 the specification was merged into the main DisplayPort standard with the release of DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2. Apple freely licenses the specification to VESA.\n\nThe Mini DisplayPort (mDP) connector is a 20-pin single-orientation connector with a friction lock. Unlike the full-size connector, it does not have an option for a mechanical latch. The mDP receptacle has dimensions of 7.50{{nbsp}}mm (width) &times; 4.60{{nbsp}}mm (height) &times; 4.99{{nbsp}}mm (depth).<ref name=\"mDP 1.0\">{{cite web |title=Mini DisplayPort Connector Standard, Version 1.0 |url=https://archive.org/details/MiniDisplayPortConnectorSpecificationV1.0 |publisher=Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>{{rp|at=\u00a72.1.3.6, pp27\u201331}} The mDP pin assignments are the same as the full-size DisplayPort connector.<ref name=\"mDP 1.0\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.1.3}}\n\n==== DP_PWR Pin ====\n\nPin 20 on the DisplayPort connector, called DP_PWR, provides 3.3{{nbsp}}V (\u00b110%) DC power at up to 500{{nbsp}}mA (minimum power delivery of 1.5{{nbsp}}W).<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a73.2}} This power is available from all DisplayPort receptacles, on both source and display devices. DP_PWR is intended to provide power for adapters, amplified cables, and similar devices, so that a separate power cable is not necessary.\n\nStandard DisplayPort cable connections do not use the DP_PWR pin. Connecting the DP_PWR pins of two devices directly together through a cable can create a [[short circuit]] which can potentially damage devices, since the DP_PWR pins on two devices are unlikely to have exactly the same voltage (especially with a \u00b110% tolerance).<ref>{{cite web |title=The DisplayPort Pin 20 Problem |url=http://monitorinsider.com/displayport/dp_pin20_controversy.html |publisher=Monitor Insider |accessdate=14 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514112410/http://monitorinsider.com/displayport/dp_pin20_controversy.html |archive-date=14 May 2018}}</ref> For this reason, the DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.1 and later standards specify that passive DisplayPort-to-DisplayPort cables must leave pin 20 unconnected.<ref name=\"DP 1.1a\" />{{rp|at=\u00a73.2.2|quote=A standard DisplayPort cable must have no wire for the DP_PWR pin.}}\n\nHowever, in 2013 VESA announced that after investigating reports of malfunctioning DisplayPort devices, it had discovered that a large number of non-certified vendors were manufacturing their DisplayPort cables with the DP_PWR pin connected:\n{{quote\n|''Recently VESA has experienced quite a few complaints regarding troublesome DisplayPort operation that ended up being caused by improperly made DisplayPort cables.  These \"bad\" DisplayPort cables are generally limited to non-DisplayPort certified cables, or off-brand cables.  To further investigate this trend in the DisplayPort cable market, VESA purchased a number of non-certified, off-brand cables and found that an alarmingly high number of these were configured improperly and would likely not support all system configurations.  None of these cables would have passed the DisplayPort certification test, moreover some of these cables could potentially damage a PC, laptop, or monitor.''\n}}\n\nThe stipulation that the DP_PWR wire be omitted from standard DisplayPort cables was not present in the DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.0 standard. However, DisplayPort products (and cables) did not begin to appear on the market until 2008, long after version 1.0 had been replaced by version 1.1. The DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.0 standard was never implemented in commercial products.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Dell UltraSharp 3008WFP 30-Inch LCD Monitor |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010301753.html |date=3 January 2008 |accessdate=14 May 2018 |author=Roy Santos |magazine=PC World |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323030630/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010301753.html |archive-date=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Resolution and refresh frequency limits ==\n\nThe tables below describe the refresh frequencies that can be achieved with each transmission mode. In general, maximum refresh frequency is determined by the transmission mode (RBR, HBR, HBR2, HBR3, UHBR 10, UHBR 13.5, or UHBR 20). These transmission modes were introduced to the DisplayPort standard as follows:\n* '''RBR''' and '''HBR''' were defined in the initial release of the DisplayPort standard, version 1.0\n* '''HBR2''' was introduced in version 1.2\n* '''HBR3''' was introduced in version 1.3\n* '''UHBR 10''', '''UHBR 13.5''', and '''UHBR 20''' were introduced in version 2.0\nHowever, transmission mode support is not necessarily dictated by a device's claimed \"DisplayPort version number\". For example, older versions of the DisplayPort Marketing Guidelines allowed a device to be labeled as \"DisplayPort 1.2\" if it supported the MST feature, even if it didn't support the HBR2 transmission mode.<ref>{{citation|title=VESA DisplayPort Marketing Guidelines version 1.1|url=https://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/DisplayPort-Marketing-Guidelines-v1_1.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|page=9}} Newer versions of the guidelines have removed this clause, and currently (as of the June 2018 revision) there are no guidelines on the usage of DisplayPort version numbers in products.<ref>{{cite web |title=DisplayPort Marketing Guidelines R14 |url=http://www.displayport.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DP_Marketing_Guidelines_R14.pdf |date=8 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325043317/http://www.displayport.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DP_Marketing_Guidelines_R14.pdf |archive-date=25 March 2019 |access-date=25 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> DisplayPort \"version numbers\" are therefore not a reliable indication of what transmission speeds a device can support.\n\nIn addition, individual devices may have their own arbitrary limitations beyond transmission speed. For example, [[NVIDIA]] [[Kepler (microarchitecture)|Kepler GK104]] GPUs (such as the GeForce GTX 680 and 770) support \"DisplayPort 1.2\" with the HBR2 transmission mode, but are limited to 540{{nbsp}}Mpx/s, only {{3/4}} of the maximum possible with HBR2.<ref>{{cite web|title=GTX 770 4gb Unable to select 144hz on dell S2716DG.|url=https://www.dell.com/community/Monitors/GTX-770-4gb-Unable-to-select-144hz-on-dell-S2716DG/td-p/4710119}}</ref> Consequently, certain devices may have limitations that differ from those listed in the following tables.\n\nTo support a particular format, the '''source''' and '''display''' devices must both support the required transmission mode, and the DisplayPort cable must also be capable of handling the required bandwidth of that transmission mode. (See: [[DisplayPort#Cables and connectors|Cables and connectors]])\n\n=== Refresh frequency limits for standard video ===\n\nColor depth of 8{{nbsp}}bpc (24{{nbsp}}bit/px or 16.7 million colors) is assumed for all formats in these tables. This is the standard color depth used on most computer displays. Note that some operating systems refer to this as \"32-bit\" color depth\u2014this is the same as 24-bit color depth. The 8 extra bits are for alpha channel information, which is only present in software. At the transmission stage, this information has already been incorporated into the primary color channels, so the actual video data transmitted across the cable only contains 24 bits per pixel.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-expanded\"\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"height:2.5em;\" | Limits for uncompressed RGB / {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 video only\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Video Format\n! colspan=7 | Transmission Mode / Maximum Data Rate{{efn|Only a portion of DisplayPort's bandwidth is used for carrying video data.

Since there is no definition of what constitutes a \"DisplayPort 1.4\" device, some manufacturers may choose to label these as \"DP 1.2\" devices despite their support for DP 1.4 HDR extensions.<ref>{{cite web |title=LG 27UK650-W 4K UHD LED Monitor |url=https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UK650-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118183112/https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UK650-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor |archive-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> As a result, DisplayPort \"version numbers\" should not be used as an indicator of HDR support.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"height:2.5em;\" | Limits for uncompressed RGB / {{YCbCr}} 4:4:4 video only\n|-\n! colspan=4 | Video Format\n! colspan=7 | Transmission Mode / Maximum Data Rate{{efn|Only a portion of DisplayPort's bandwidth is used for carrying video data.

Dual-mode is an optional feature, so not all DisplayPort sources necessarily support DVI/HDMI passive adapters, though in practice nearly all devices do. Officially, the \"DP++\" logo should be used to indicate a DP port that supports dual-mode, but most modern devices do not use the logo.\n\nDevices which implement dual-mode will detect that a DVI or HDMI adapter is attached, and send DVI/HDMI TMDS signals instead of DisplayPort signals. The original DisplayPort Dual-Mode standard (version 1.0), used in DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.1 devices, only supported TMDS clock speeds of up to 165{{nbsp}}MHz (4.95{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth). This is equivalent to HDMI{{nbsp}}1.2, and is sufficient for up to 1920{{resx}}1200 at 60{{nbsp}}Hz.\n\nIn 2013, VESA released the Dual-Mode 1.1 standard, which added support for up to a 300{{nbsp}}MHz TMDS clock (9.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth), and is used in newer DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2 devices. This is slightly less than the 340{{nbsp}}MHz maximum of HDMI{{nbsp}}1.4, and is sufficient for up to 1920{{resx}}1080 at 120{{nbsp}}Hz, 2560{{resx}}1440 at 60{{nbsp}}Hz, or 3840{{resx}}2160 at 30{{nbsp}}Hz. Older adapters, which were only capable of the 165{{nbsp}}MHz speed, were retroactively termed \"Type{{nbsp}}1\" adapters, with the new 300{{nbsp}}MHz adapters being called \"Type{{nbsp}}2\".<ref>{{cite web |title=VESA Introduces Updated Dual-Mode Standard for Higher Resolution Interoperability with HDMI Displays |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510051652/https://www.vesa.org/news/vesa-introduces-updated-dual-mode-standard-for-higher-resolution-interoperability-with-hdmi-displays/ |archive-date=10 May 2018 |url=http://www.vesa.org/featured-articles/vesa-introduces-updated-dual-mode-standard-for-higher-resolution-interoperability-with-hdmi-displays/ |publisher=VESA |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of the DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.3 standard, VESA added dual-mode support for up to a 600{{nbsp}}MHz TMDS clock (18.00{{nbsp}}Gbit/s bandwidth), the full bandwidth of HDMI{{nbsp}}2.0. This is sufficient for 1920{{resx}}1080 at 240{{nbsp}}Hz, 2560{{resx}}1440 at 144{{nbsp}}Hz, or 3840{{resx}}2160 at 60{{nbsp}}Hz. However, no passive adapters capable of the 600{{nbsp}}MHz dual-mode speed have been produced as of 2018.\n\n==== Dual-mode limitations ====\n\n[[File:DP to DVI converter unmounted.jpg|thumb|Picture of a DisplayPort to DVI adapter after removing its enclosure. The chip on the board converts the voltage levels generated by the dual-mode DisplayPort device to be compatible with a DVI monitor.]]\n\n* Limited adapter speed{{Snd}} Although the pinout and digital signal values transmitted by the DP port are identical to a native DVI/HDMI source, the signals are transmitted at DisplayPort's native voltage (3.3{{nbsp}}V) instead of the 5{{nbsp}}V used by DVI and HDMI. As a result, dual-mode adapters must contain a level-shifter circuit which changes the voltage. The presence of this circuit places a limit on how quickly the adapter can operate, and therefore newer adapters are required for each higher speed added to the standard.\n* Unidirectional{{Snd}} Although the dual-mode standard specifies a method for DisplayPort ''sources'' to output DVI/HDMI signals using simple passive adapters, there is no counterpart standard to give DisplayPort displays the ability to ''receive'' DVI/HDMI input signals through passive adapters. As a result, DisplayPort displays can only receive native DisplayPort signals; any DVI or HDMI input signals must be converted to the DisplayPort format with an active conversion device. DVI and HDMI sources cannot be connected to DisplayPort displays using passive adapters.\n* Single-link DVI only{{Snd}} Since DisplayPort dual-mode operates by using the pins of the DisplayPort connector to send DVI/HDMI signals, the 20-pin DisplayPort connector can only produce a ''single-link'' DVI signal (which uses 19 pins). A ''dual-link DVI'' signal uses 25 pins, and is therefore impossible to transmit natively from a DisplayPort connector through a passive adapter. Dual-link DVI signals can only be produced by converting from native DisplayPort output signals with an active conversion device.\n* Unavailable on USB-C{{Snd}} The ''DisplayPort Alternate Mode'' specification for sending DisplayPort signals over a [[USB-C]] cable does not include support for the dual-mode protocol. As a result, DP-to-DVI and DP-to-HDMI passive adapters do not function when chained from a USB-C to DP adapter.\n\n=== Multi-Stream Transport (MST) {{Anchor|Multi-Stream Transport|MST|Multiple displays on single DisplayPort connector}} ===\n\n'''Multi-Stream Transport''' is a feature first introduced in the DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2 standard. It allows multiple independent displays to be driven from a single DP port on the source devices by [[multiplexing]] several video streams into a single stream and sending it to a ''branch device'', which demultiplexes the signal into the original streams. Branch devices are commonly found in the form of an MST hub, which plugs into a single DP input port and provides multiple outputs, but it can also be implemented on a display internally to provide a DP output port for daisy-chaining, effectively embedding a 2-port MST hub inside the display.<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=Fig. 2-59}}<ref>{{cite web|title=DisplayPortTM Ver.1.2 Overview |url=http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DisplayPort-DevCon-Presentation-DP-1.2-Dec-2010-rev-2b.pdf|accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> Theoretically, up to 63 displays can be supported,<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|page=20}} but the combined data rate requirements of all the displays cannot exceed the limits of a single DP port (17.28{{nbsp}}Gbit/s for a DP{{nbsp}}1.2 port, or 25.92{{nbsp}}Gbit/s for a DP 1.3/1.4 port). In addition, the maximum number of links between the source and any device (i.e. the maximum length of a daisy-chain) is 7,<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.5.2}} and the maximum number of physical output ports on each branch device (such as a hub) is 7.<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.5.1}} With the release of MST, standard single-display operation has been retroactively named \"SST\" mode (Single-Stream Transport).\n\nDaisy-chaining is a feature that must be specifically supported by each intermediary display; not all DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.2 devices support it. Daisy-chaining requires a dedicated DisplayPort ''output'' port on the display. Standard DisplayPort ''input'' ports found on most displays cannot be used as a daisy-chain output. Only the last display in the daisy-chain does not need to support the feature specifically or have a DP output port. DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.1 displays can also be connected to MST hubs, and can be part of a DisplayPort daisy-chain if it is the last display in the chain.<ref name=\"DP 1.2\" />{{rp|at=\u00a72.5.1}}\n\nThe host system's software also needs to support MST for hubs or daisy-chains to work. While [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] environments have full support for it, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] operating systems currently do not support MST hubs or DisplayPort daisy-chaining as of macOS 10.13 (\"High Sierra\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Display Daisy-Chaining with High Sierra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513010057/https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/300020/display-daisy-chaining-with-high-sierra |archive-date=13 May 2018 |url=https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/300020/display-daisy-chaining-with-high-sierra |date=27 September 2017 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=MBPr 2015, 2.5GHz i7 \u2013 Daisychaining 2 Dell U2414H 61 Screens |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207155822/https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/189542/mbpr-2015-2-5ghz-i7-daisychaining-2-dell-u2414h-61-screens |archive-date=7 December 2016 |url=https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/189542/mbpr-2015-2-5ghz-i7-daisychaining-2-dell-u2414h-61-screens |date=31 May 2015 |accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nDisplayPort-to-DVI and DisplayPort-to-HDMI adapters/cables may or may not function from an MST output port; support for this depends on the specific device.{{Citation needed|reason=Needs a non-OR source (see talk page)|date=July 2018}}\n\nMST is supported by USB Type-C DisplayPort Alternate Mode, so standard DisplayPort daisy-chains and MST hubs do function from Type-C sources with a simple Type-C to DisplayPort adapter.<ref>{{cite web | title=Google's USB Type-C to DP Adapter \"DingDong\" | url= https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/dingdong | accessdate = August 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== High dynamic range (HDR) ===\n\n{{main|High-dynamic-range video}}\n\nSupport for HDR video was introduced in DisplayPort{{nbsp}}1.4.

Shortly after announcing Mini DisplayPort, Apple announced that it would license the connector technology with no fee. The following year, in early 2009, VESA announced that Mini DisplayPort would be included in the upcoming DisplayPort 1.2 specification.\nOn 24 February 2011, Apple and Intel announced [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]], a successor to Mini DisplayPort which adds support for [[PCI Express]] data connections while maintaining backwards compatibility with Mini DisplayPort based peripherals.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://newsroom.intel.com/community/intel_newsroom/blog/2011/02/24/thunderbolt-technology-the-fastest-data-connection-to-your-pc-just-arrived |title=Thunderbolt Technology: The Fastest Data Connection to Your PC Just Arrived |publisher=Intel |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Micro DisplayPort ===\n''Micro DisplayPort'' would have targeted systems that need ultra-compact connectors, such as phones, tablets and ultra-portable notebook computers. This standard would have been physically smaller than the currently available Mini DisplayPort connectors. The standard was expected to be released by Q2 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.displayport.org/pr/vesa-begins-development-of-micro-displayport-connector-standard/ |title=VESA Begins Development of micro-DisplayPort Connector Standard |publisher=DisplayPort |date=23 October 2013 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\nThis project seems aborted to be replaced by '''DisplayPort Alt Mode for [[USB-C|USB Type-C]] Standard.'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=VESA|first1=displayport|title=FAQ|url=https://www.displayport.org/faq/#DisplayPort|website=displayport.org|publisher=VESA|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== DDM ===\n''Direct Drive Monitor'' (DDM) 1.0 standard was approved in December 2008. It allows for controller-less monitors where the display panel is directly driven by the DisplayPort signal, although the available resolutions and color depth are limited to two-lane operation.\n\n=== Display Stream Compression ===\n''Display Stream Compression'' (DSC) is a [[Video Electronics Standards Association|VESA]]-developed low-latency compression algorithm to overcome the limitations posed by sending high-resolution video over physical media of limited bandwidth. It is a visually lossless low-latency algorithm based on [[delta modulation|delta PCM]] coding and [[YCoCg|YCoCg-R]] color space; it allows increased resolutions and color depths and reduced power consumption.<ref name=DSC>{{cite press |url=https://www.vesa.org/news/vesa-finalizes-requirements-for-display-stream-compression-standard/ |title=VESA Finalizes Requirements for Display Stream Compression Standard |publisher=VESA |date=24 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=vesa-etp200>http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/VESA_DSC-ETP200.pdf</ref>\n\nDSC has been tested to meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 29170-2 ''Evaluation procedure for nearly lossless coding'' using various test patterns, noise, subpixel-rendered text ([[ClearType]]), UI captures, and photo and video images.<ref name=vesa-etp200/>\n\nDSC version 1.0 was released on 10 March 2014, but was soon deprecated by DSC version 1.1 released on 1 August 2014. The DSC standard supports up to 3:1 compression ratio with constant or variable bit rate, 4:4:4 [[chroma subsampling]], optional 4:2:2 conversion and 6/8/10/12 bits per color component.\n\nDSC version 1.2 was released on 27 January 2016 and is included with DisplayPort 1.4; version 1.2a was released on 18 January 2017. The update includes native encoding of 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 formats in pixel containers, 14/16 bits per color, and minor modifications to the encoding algorithm.\n\nDSC compression works on a horizontal line of pixels encoded using groups of three consecutive pixels for native 4:4:4 and simple 4:2:2 formats, or six pixels (three compressed containers) for native 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 formats. If RGB encoding is used, it is first converted to reversible YCgCo. Simple conversion from 4:2:2 to 4:4:4 can add missing chroma samples by interpolating neighboring pixels. Each luma component is coded separately using three independent substreams (four substreams in native 4:2:2 mode). Prediction step is performed using one of the three modes: modified median adaptive coding (MMAP) algorithm similar to the one used by [[JPEG-LS]], block prediction (optional for decoders due to high computational complexity, negotiated at DSC handshake), and midpoint prediction. Bit rate control algorithm tracks color flatness and buffer fullness to adjust the quantization bit depth for a pixel group in a way that minimizes compression artifacts while staying within the bitrate limits. Repeating recent pixels can be stored in 32-entry Indexed Color History (ICH) buffer, which can be referenced directly by each group in a slice; this improves compression quality of computer-generated images. Alternatively, prediction residuals are computed and encoded with [[entropy coding]] algorithm based on delta size unit-variable length coding (DSU-VLC). Encoded pixel groups are then combined into slices of various height and width; common combinations include 100% or 25% picture width, and 8-, 32-, or 108-line height.\n\nOn 4 January 2017, [[HDMI 2.1]] was announced which supports up to [[10K resolution]] and uses DSC 1.2 for video that is higher than 8K resolution with 4:2:0 [[chroma subsampling]].<ref name=HDMI21PressRelease>{{cite news |url=http://www.hdmi.org/press/press_release.aspx?prid=145 |title=HDMI Forum announces version 2.1 of the HDMI specification |publisher=HDMI.org |date=2017-01-04 |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref><ref name=HDMI21Introduction>{{cite news |url=http://www.hdmi.org/manufacturer/hdmi_2_1/index.aspx |title=Introducing HDMI 2.1 |publisher=HDMI.org |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref><ref name=HDMI21January2017Anandtech>{{cite news |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/11003/hdmi-21-announced-8kp60-48gbps-cable |title=HDMI 2.1 Announced|author=Anton Shilov |publisher=Anandtech |date=2017-01-05 |accessdate=2017-01-10}}</ref>\n\n=== eDP ===\n''Embedded DisplayPort'' (eDP) is a display panel interface standard for portable and embedded devices. It defines the signaling interface between graphics cards and integrated displays. The various revisions of eDP are based on existing DisplayPort standards. However, version numbers between the two standards are not interchangeable. For instance, eDP version 1.4 is based on DisplayPort 1.2, while eDP version 1.4a is based on DisplayPort 1.3.

Originally developed by AMD and Texas Instruments, it has been announced as a VESA specification in 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7649/dockport-adopted-as-official-extension-to-displayport-standard | title=MD/TI's DockPort Adopted As Official Extension to DisplayPort Standard | accessdate = 12 January 2014 | publisher = anandtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== USB-C ===\n{{main|USB-C}}\nOn 22 September 2014, VESA published the ''DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C Connector Standard'', a specification on how to send DisplayPort signals over the newly released [[USB-C]] connector. One, two or all four of the differential pairs that USB uses for the SuperSpeed bus can be configured dynamically to be used for DisplayPort lanes. In the first two cases, the connector still can carry a full SuperSpeed signal; in the latter case, at least a non-SuperSpeed signal is available. The DisplayPort AUX channel is also supported over the two sideband signals over the same connection; furthermore, [[USB Power Delivery]] according to the newly expanded USB-PD 2.0 specification is possible at the same time. This makes the Type-C connector a strict superset of the use-cases envisioned for DockPort, SlimPort, Mini and Micro DisplayPort.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8558/displayport-alternate-mode-for-usb-typec-announced | title=DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C Announced{{Snd}} Video, Power, & Data All Over Type-D | accessdate = 14 October 2014 | publisher = anandtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== VirtualLink ===\n{{main|VirtualLink}}\nVirtualLink uses USB-C connectors and DisplayPort to transmit video signals.\n\n== Products ==\n[[File:Lenovo x220 dp crop.jpg|thumb|A [[#Dual-mode|Dual-mode]] DisplayPort connector]]\nSince its introduction in 2006, DisplayPort has gained popularity within the computer industry and is featured on many graphic cards, displays, and notebook computers.
