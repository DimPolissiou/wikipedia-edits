These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], [[Vaishno Devi]] etc. The pre-Columbian residents of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]] in [[Mexico]] erected huge [[pyramid]]s featuring staircases leading to heaven.

Wise religious teachers are typically depicted in literature and art as bringing their revelations at world centers: mountains, trees, temples.\n\nBecause the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as \"the center of the world\".

Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has the [[Ka'aba]], said to be the first building on earth, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]).  In [[Hinduism]], [[Mount Kailash]] is identified with the mythical [[Mount Meru]] and regarded as the home of [[Shiva]]; in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the [[Ley line|dragon currents]] converge and is regarded as the gateway to [[Shambhala]].  In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  In addition to the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountains]], where it is believed the [[peach tree of immortality]] is located, the [[Chinese folk religion]] recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.\n\nSacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. \"Every temple or palace\u2014and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence\u2014is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre.\"<ref name=\"Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12\">Mircea Eliade (tr.

[[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven.

It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches.  The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which [[Gautama Siddhartha]], the historical [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], sat on the night he attained [[Bodhi|enlightenment]].

[[Astrology]] in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient [[Colossus of Rhodes]] combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the [[Vitruvian Man]] represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Homes===\nHomes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains.<ref name=\"Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12\"/> The hearth participates in the symbolism of the [[altar]] and a central [[garden]] participates in the symbolism of primordial [[Garden of Eden|paradise]]. In Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional Asian home was oriented toward the sky through [[feng shui]], a system of [[geomancy]], just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that \"the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the ''axis mundi''. In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky.\"<ref>Mircea Eliade.

A [[skyscraper]], as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do [[spire]] structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as \"centers\" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998/2008. p.137</ref> The first skyscraper of modern times, the [[Eiffel Tower]], exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to serve as the centerpiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.'

Just one example of these is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]].

Structures that have a spiritual meaning, that inspire and create a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world, that are erected as monuments to commemorate are achievements can be considered to be inspired by the axis mundi. The pyramids that have been erected throughout human history serve as perfect examples of axis mundi.  A [[skyscraper]], as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do [[spire]] structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as \"centers\" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998/2008. p.137</ref> The first skyscraper of modern times, the [[Eiffel Tower]], exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to serve as the centerpiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998/2008. p. 19</ref> Landmark skyscrapers often take names that clearly identify them as centers.<ref>Judith Dupr\u00e9.

Black Dog & Leventhal, 1998/2008. pp. 45, 69, 81, 91, 97,135, 136, 143</ref>\n\nArtistic representations of the axis mundi are plentiful. Just one example of these is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. The column takes the form of a \"sky pillar\" ({{lang|ro|{{vanchor|columna cerului}}}}) upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.<ref>Mircea Eliade. 'Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p.99-100</ref>\n\nVisual representation of the axis mundi in contemporary art is currently being achieved by photographer Jennifer Westjohn.  By the process of mirror symmetry of a single photograph the artist exposes an entirely new image: the 5th point.  The viewer is then introduced to a coalescing of nature and the universe which lends new perspective to the original image.  This artistic representation of axis mundi opens the mind up to a new visual dimension both energistic and shamanic.<ref>Jennifer Westjohn.

Megiddo is also the first recorded use of the [[composite bow]] and the first [[body count]].<ref>Trevor N. Dupuy, ''Evolution of Weapons and Warfare''.</ref> All details of the battle come from Egyptian sources\u2014primarily the [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyph]]ic writings on the [[Hall of Annals]] in the Temple of Amun-Re at [[Karnak]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (now [[Luxor]]), by the military scribe Tjaneni.\n\nThe ancient Egyptian account gives the date of the battle as the 21st day of the first month of the third season, of Year 23 of the reign of Thutmose III. It has been claimed that this was April 16, 1457 BC, according to the [[Middle Chronology]], although other publications place the battle in 1482 BC or 1479 BC. The Egyptians routed the Canaanite forces, which fled to safety in the city of [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]]. Their action resulted in the lengthy '''Siege of Megiddo'''.\n\nBy re-establishing Egyptian dominance in the [[Levant]], Thutmose III began a reign in which the [[Egyptian Empire]] reached its greatest expanse.\n\n==Annals of Thutmose III==\nDuring [[Thutmose III]]'s first campaign in the [[Levant]], his personal scribe, Tjaneni, kept a daily journal on parchment. In approximately his 42nd regnal year, many years after his campaigns in the [[Levant]] had ended, [[Thutmose III]] instructed his artisans to inscribe his military exploits into the walls of Amun-Re's temple at [[Karnak]]. The annals describe in lavish detail 14 campaigns led by Thutmose III in the Levant, the booty gained through his campaigning, tribute received from conquered regions, and, lastly, offerings to Amun-Re. The sequence of depictions indicate the New Kingdom's belief on the interactions of the gods with warfare: praise and offerings to the deities in exchange for their divine help in war.<ref name=Annals>''[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/annals-thutmosis-iii Annals of Thutmosis III]''  from the [[Louvre]] web site.

Retrieved December 8, 2017.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the annals show the long-lasting effects of the battle of Megiddo. After Thutmose III's victory at Megiddo and his successful campaigns in the Levant over the next 20 years, Egypt's rise to power in the international community and its evolution into an empire is evident in the annals. Depictions show international diplomacy through the giving of gifts from Babylon, the [[Hittite Empire]], and other prominent and powerful regions during this time period.<ref name=Annals/><ref name=Britannica/>\n\n==Campaign against the kingdoms of Canaan==\nPharaoh [[Thutmose III]] began a reign in which the Egyptian Empire reached its greatest expanse by reinforcing the long-standing Egyptian presence in the [[Levant]]. After waiting impatiently for the end of his regency by the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], he immediately responded to a revolt of local rulers near Kadesh in the vicinity of modern-day [[Syria]]. As Egyptian buffer provinces in the land of the Amurru along the border with the Hittites attempted to change their vassalage, Thutmose III dealt with the threat personally. The Canaanites are thought to have been allied with the [[Mitanni]] and Amurru from the region of the two rivers between the headwaters of the Orontes and the Jordan. The driving and main force behind this revolt was the King of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. The powerful fortress of Kadesh offered protection to him and the city. The King of Megiddo, with an equally strong fortress, joined the alliance. The importance of Megiddo was its geographical location along the southwestern edge of the [[Jezreel Valley]] just beyond the [[Mount Carmel, Israel|Mount Carmel]] ridge and the Mediterranean. From this location, Megiddo controlled the [[Via Maris]], the main trade route between Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]]. \n\nThe Egyptian inscriptions of the campaign on the Temple of Karnak come from a daily journal kept by the scribe Tjaneni during the campaign. In the Egyptian account [[Thutmose III]] gathered an army of [[chariot]]s and [[infantry]] that numbered between ten and twenty thousand men.<ref name=\"Cline17\"/> As the Egyptians mustered their forces the king of Kadesh gathered many tribal chieftains from Syria, Aram and Canaan around him, estimated at between ten and fifteen thousand,<ref name=\"Cline17\"/> entered Megiddo and set his forces at the waters of Taanach. He expected that his enemy would come by way of Dothaim - Taanach, the main route from the Mediterranean lowlands into the Valley of Kishon, and from Egypt to Mesopotamia.<ref name=\"Tomac Petar 1959. p.21\">Tomac Petar, Vojna Istorija, 1959. p.21</ref> The Egyptian army assembled at the border fortress [[Zarw|Tjaru]] (called ''[[Sile]]'' in Greek) and arrived ten days later at the loyal city of [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. After one day's rest, it left for the city of Yehem, which was reached after 11 days. Here, Thutmose sent out [[Reconnaissance|scouts]]. To continue north, they had to pass the [[Mount Carmel]] ridge. Behind it lay the city and fortress of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], where the revolting forces had gathered. There were three possible routes from Yehem to Megiddo. Both the northern route, via Zefti and [[Tel Yokneam]], and the southern route, by way of Taanach, gave safe access to the [[Jezreel Valley]]. The middle route, via Aruna (modern [[Wadi Ara]]), was more direct but risky; it followed a narrow ravine, and the troops could only travel single-file. If the enemy waited at the end of the ravine, the Egyptians would risk being cut down piecemeal. The army leaders pleaded with him not to take the difficult road but to take either of the two easier roads. Instead, with information from the scouts, Thutmose III decided to take the direct path to Megiddo. He believed that if his generals advised him to take the easy route, then his enemy would assume he would do so, so he decided to do the unexpected.<ref>Cline 2000 p. 18</ref>\n\nThe King of Kadesh had left large infantry detachments guarding the two more likely paths, and virtually ignored Aruna, the narrow mountain pass coming in from the south. Ignoring the danger of spreading out his army in the mountains where leading elements might be subject to enemy ambush in narrow mountain passes, and his main force still far behind in Aruna, unable to come to their aid, Thutmose took the direct route through [[Wadi Ara]]. To reduce the risk, Thutmose himself led his men through Aruna. With his infantry and the light cavalry of mounted bowmen, known as haibrw or the horsemen going by the side of the mountains, to take out any scouts that might be posted and leaving the road to the main force of chariots, he moved in quickly. With the city lightly guarded by the enemy, Thutmose led a quick assault, scattered the rebels and entered the valley unopposed. Now, the Egyptian army had a clear path to Megiddo, with large parts of the rebel army far away to the north and south.<ref name=\"Tomac Petar 1959. p.21\" />\n\n== Battle and siege ==\nThutmose seized the opportunity. He set up camp at the end of the day, but during the night arrayed his forces close to the enemy; the next morning, they attacked. It cannot be established if the surprised King of Kadesh had managed to fully prepare for battle. Even if he did, it did not do him much good. Though his forces were on high ground adjacent to the fortress, the Egyptian line was arranged in a concave formation, consisting of three wings, that threatened both [[Canaan|Canaanite]] flanks. Both the Egyptians and the Canaanites are estimated to have had around 1,000 chariots and 10,000 infantry. The Pharaoh led the attack from the center. The combination of position and numbers, superior maneuverability of their left wing along with an early, bold attack, broke the enemy's will; their line immediately collapsed. Those near the city fled into it, closing the gates behind them.\n\nThe Egyptian soldiers fell to plundering the enemy camp. During the plunder they captured 924 chariots and 200 suits of armor.

Megiddo is also the first recorded use of the [[composite bow]] and the first [[body count]].<ref>Trevor N. Dupuy, ''Evolution of Weapons and Warfare''.</ref> All details of the battle come from Egyptian sources\u2014primarily the [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyph]]ic writings on the [[Hall of Annals]] in the Temple of Amun-Re at [[Karnak]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (now [[Luxor]]), by the military scribe Tjaneni.\n\nThe ancient Egyptian account gives the date of the battle as the 21st day of the first month of the third season, of Year 23 of the reign of Thutmose III. It has been claimed that this was April 16, 1457 BC, according to the [[Middle Chronology]], although other publications place the battle in 1482 BC or 1479 BC. The Egyptians routed the Canaanite forces, which fled to safety in the city of [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]]. Their action resulted in the lengthy '''Siege of Megiddo'''.\n\nBy re-establishing Egyptian dominance in the [[Levant]], Thutmose III began a reign in which the [[Egyptian Empire]] reached its greatest expanse.\n\n==Annals of Thutmose III==\nDuring [[Thutmose III]]'s first campaign in the [[Levant]], his personal scribe, Tjaneni, kept a daily journal on parchment. In approximately his 42nd regnal year, many years after his campaigns in the [[Levant]] had ended, [[Thutmose III]] instructed his artisans to inscribe his military exploits into the walls of Amun-Re's temple at [[Karnak]]. The annals describe in lavish detail 14 campaigns led by Thutmose III in the Levant, the booty gained through his campaigning, tribute received from conquered regions, and, lastly, offerings to Amun-Re. The sequence of depictions indicate the New Kingdom's belief on the interactions of the gods with warfare: praise and offerings to the deities in exchange for their divine help in war.<ref name=Annals>''[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/annals-thutmosis-iii Annals of Thutmosis III]''  from the [[Louvre]] web site.

Retrieved December 8, 2017.</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the annals show the long-lasting effects of the battle of Megiddo. After Thutmose III's victory at Megiddo and his successful campaigns in the Levant over the next 20 years, Egypt's rise to power in the international community and its evolution into an empire is evident in the annals. Depictions show international diplomacy through the giving of gifts from Babylon, the [[Hittite Empire]], and other prominent and powerful regions during this time period.<ref name=Annals/><ref name=Britannica/>\n\n==Campaign against the kingdoms of Canaan==\nPharaoh [[Thutmose III]] began a reign in which the Egyptian Empire reached its greatest expanse by reinforcing the long-standing Egyptian presence in the [[Levant]]. After waiting impatiently for the end of his regency by the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]], he immediately responded to a revolt of local rulers near Kadesh in the vicinity of modern-day [[Syria]]. As Egyptian buffer provinces in the land of the Amurru along the border with the Hittites attempted to change their vassalage, Thutmose III dealt with the threat personally. The Canaanites are thought to have been allied with the [[Mitanni]] and Amurru from the region of the two rivers between the headwaters of the Orontes and the Jordan. The driving and main force behind this revolt was the King of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. The powerful fortress of Kadesh offered protection to him and the city. The King of Megiddo, with an equally strong fortress, joined the alliance. The importance of Megiddo was its geographical location along the southwestern edge of the [[Jezreel Valley]] just beyond the [[Mount Carmel, Israel|Mount Carmel]] ridge and the Mediterranean. From this location, Megiddo controlled the [[Via Maris]], the main trade route between Egypt and [[Mesopotamia]]. \n\nThe Egyptian inscriptions of the campaign on the Temple of Karnak come from a daily journal kept by the scribe Tjaneni during the campaign. In the Egyptian account [[Thutmose III]] gathered an army of [[chariot]]s and [[infantry]] that numbered between ten and twenty thousand men.<ref name=\"Cline17\"/> As the Egyptians mustered their forces the king of Kadesh gathered many tribal chieftains from Syria, Aram and Canaan around him, estimated at between ten and fifteen thousand,<ref name=\"Cline17\"/> entered Megiddo and set his forces at the waters of Taanach. He expected that his enemy would come by way of Dothaim - Taanach, the main route from the Mediterranean lowlands into the Valley of Kishon, and from Egypt to Mesopotamia.<ref name=\"Tomac Petar 1959. p.21\">Tomac Petar, Vojna Istorija, 1959. p.21</ref> The Egyptian army assembled at the border fortress [[Zarw|Tjaru]] (called ''[[Sile]]'' in Greek) and arrived ten days later at the loyal city of [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. After one day's rest, it left for the city of Yehem, which was reached after 11 days. Here, Thutmose sent out [[Reconnaissance|scouts]]. To continue north, they had to pass the [[Mount Carmel]] ridge. Behind it lay the city and fortress of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], where the revolting forces had gathered. There were three possible routes from Yehem to Megiddo. Both the northern route, via Zefti and [[Tel Yokneam]], and the southern route, by way of Taanach, gave safe access to the [[Jezreel Valley]]. The middle route, via Aruna (modern [[Wadi Ara]]), was more direct but risky; it followed a narrow ravine, and the troops could only travel single-file. If the enemy waited at the end of the ravine, the Egyptians would risk being cut down piecemeal. The army leaders pleaded with him not to take the difficult road but to take either of the two easier roads. Instead, with information from the scouts, Thutmose III decided to take the direct path to Megiddo. He believed that if his generals advised him to take the easy route, then his enemy would assume he would do so, so he decided to do the unexpected.<ref>Cline 2000 p. 18</ref>\n\nThe King of Kadesh had left large infantry detachments guarding the two more likely paths, and virtually ignored Aruna, the narrow mountain pass coming in from the south. Ignoring the danger of spreading out his army in the mountains where leading elements might be subject to enemy ambush in narrow mountain passes, and his main force still far behind in Aruna, unable to come to their aid, Thutmose took the direct route through [[Wadi Ara]]. To reduce the risk, Thutmose himself led his men through Aruna. With his infantry and the light cavalry of mounted bowmen, known as haibrw or the horsemen going by the side of the mountains, to take out any scouts that might be posted and leaving the road to the main force of chariots, he moved in quickly. With the city lightly guarded by the enemy, Thutmose led a quick assault, scattered the rebels and entered the valley unopposed. Now, the Egyptian army had a clear path to Megiddo, with large parts of the rebel army far away to the north and south.<ref name=\"Tomac Petar 1959. p.21\" />\n\n== Battle and siege ==\nThutmose seized the opportunity. He set up camp at the end of the day, but during the night arrayed his forces close to the enemy; the next morning, they attacked. It cannot be established if the surprised King of Kadesh had managed to fully prepare for battle. Even if he did, it did not do him much good. Though his forces were on high ground adjacent to the fortress, the Egyptian line was arranged in a concave formation, consisting of three wings, that threatened both [[Canaanite]] flanks. Both the Egyptians and the Canaanites are estimated to have had around 1,000 chariots and 10,000 infantry. The Pharaoh led the attack from the center. The combination of position and numbers, superior maneuverability of their left wing along with an early, bold attack, broke the enemy's will; their line immediately collapsed. Those near the city fled into it, closing the gates behind them.\n\nThe Egyptian soldiers fell to plundering the enemy camp. During the plunder they captured 924 chariots and 200 suits of armor. Unfortunately for the Egyptians, during this confusion, the scattered Canaanite forces, including the kings of Kadesh and Megiddo, were able to rejoin the defenders inside the city. Those inside lowered tied-together clothing to the men and chariots and pulled them up over the walls. Thus, the opportunity of a quick capture of the city following the battle was lost.\n\nThe city was besieged for seven months and the King of Kadesh escaped.<ref>Cline 2000 p. 21</ref> Thutmose built a moat and a wooden palisade, eventually forcing its occupants to surrender.

He played an active role in two Russian revolutions, in [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917]]. During [[World War I]], he was among the founders of the [[Jewish Legion]] and of the [[American Jewish Congress]]. Later, through his connections in Palestine, he managed to obtain a concession for production and distribution of electric power and founded the Palestine Electric Company, currently the [[Israel Electric Corporation]]. \nA vocal and committed Zionist, Rutenberg also participated in establishing the [[Haganah]], the main Jewish militia in pre-war Palestine, and founded [[Palestine Airways]]. He subsequently served as a President of the [[Vaad Leumi|Jewish National Council]].\n\n== Socialist and revolutionary ==\nPinhas Rutenberg was born in the town of [[Romny]], north of [[Poltava]], [[Russian Empire]] (now in [[Ukraine]]). After graduating from a practical high school, he enrolled to the [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology|Technology Institute]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and joined the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (also known as the S.R. or Eser party). He worked as a workshop manager at the [[Putilov plant]], the largest Petersburg industry. The plant was a center of the [[Assembly of Russian Factory and Plant Workers]], founded in 1903 by a popular [[working class]] leader, Father [[George Gapon]]. Gapon collaborated in secret with the Police Department (the [[Okhrana]]), which believed this to be the way to control the workers' movement. Rutenberg became Gapon\u2019s friend, which made him a noticeable figure in the S.R. party.\n\nOn Sunday 9 January 1905 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]] date) Gapon organized a \"peaceful workers\u2019 procession\" to the [[Winter Palace]] in order to present a petition to the [[Tzar]]. Rutenberg participated, by his party's approval. In a tragic turn of events, army pickets fired directly into the crowd, and hundreds were killed. Amid the panic, Rutenberg retained self-control and actually saved Gapon\u2019s life, taking him away from gun fire. This incident, known as the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)]], sparked the first [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].\n\nGapon and Rutenberg fled abroad, being welcomed in Europe both by prominent Russian emigrants [[Georgy Plekhanov]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and French socialist leaders [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]]. Before the end of 1905, Rutenberg returned to Russia, and Gapon followed him.\n \nGapon soon revealed to Rutenberg his contacts with the police and tried to recruit him, too, reasoning that double loyalty is helpful to the workers\u2019 cause. However, Rutenberg betrayed his trust and reported  this provocation to his party leaders, [[Yevno Azef]] and [[Boris Savinkov]]. Azef demanded that the traitor be put to death. Ironically, he was in fact an [[agent provocateur]] himself, exposed by [[Vladimir Burtsev]] in 1908.  \n \nOn 26 March 1906 Gapon arrived to meet Rutenberg in a rented cottage out of St. Petersburg, and after a month he was found there hanged. Rutenberg asserted later that Gapon was condemned by a comrades\u2019 court and that three S.R. party combatants overheard their conversation from the next room. After Gapon had repeated his collaboration proposal, Rutenberg called the comrades into the room and he left. When he returned, Gapon was dead.\n\nHowever, the S.R. party leadership refused to assume responsibility, announcing that the execution was undertaken by Rutenberg individually and the cause was a personal one, denying ever having sent their comrades to the meeting on 26 March. Rutenberg was then condemned and expelled from the party.\n\n== Turn to Zionism ==\n\n[[Image:Pinhas Rutenberg.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Pinhas Rutenberg c. 1942.]]\nForced to emigrate, Rutenberg settled in Italy. Away from politics, he concentrated on hydraulic engineering. Pondering on specific [[Jew]]ish problems, he became convinced that the solution was to establish a national home for the Jewish people.\n\nAfter [[World War I]] broke out, the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] mainly supported the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. Rutenberg set the goal to create a Jewish armed force to fight for the [[Land of Israel]]. He visited European capitals, met prominent politicians and Zionist leaders, and finally joined the efforts of [[Jabotinsky]] and [[Joseph Trumpeldor|Trumpeldor]] to set up the [[Jewish Legion]]. In May 1915, on Jabotinsky\u2019s approval, Rutenberg travelled to the [[United States]] to promote this idea among the American Jewry.\n\nHe found strong support among Jewish organizations in [[New York City]]. Rutenberg endorsed the labour party ([[Poale Zion|Poalei Zion]]) and cooperated with [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Itzhak Ben-Zvi]], and [[Ber Borochov]]. Together with [[Chaim Zhitlowsky]], he founded the American Jewish Congress. At the same time, Rutenberg published his book ''The National Revival of the Jewish People'' under the [[pseudonym]] Pinhas Ben-Ami (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: my people\u2019s son).\n\nWhile in the US, Rutenberg managed to complete a detailed design for utilizing the Land of Israel's hydraulic resources for [[irrigation]] and electrical power production, which was his long-time dream.\n\n== Anti-Bolshevik ==\n[[File:Pinhas Rutenberg 1919 passport.jpg|thumb|Passport used by Pinhas Rutenberg in 1919 to escape from Odessa.]]\nRutenberg greeted the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917, and in July 1917 he returned to Petrograd, welcomed by the prime minister of the [[Russian Provisional Government]], [[Alexander Kerensky]], also an S.R party member. Despite 12 years of absence in Russia, Rutenberg was soon named vice-president of the Petrograd municipality, the local [[Duma]].\n\nIn a couple of months, [[Petrograd Soviet]], headed by [[Leon Trotsky]], became an alternative power in the capital, hostile towards the Duma. It was clear that the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] were planning to overthrow the government. On 3 November Rutenberg became a member of the emergency Supreme Council, created by Kerensky to preserve order and justice. During an assault on the [[Winter Palace]] on 7 November, the night of the [[October Revolution]], Rutenberg defended the government residence after Kerensky had escaped. When the [[Bolshevik]]s prevailed, he was arrested and put in jail, together with the \"capitalist ministers\".\n\nIn March 1918, when German troops approached Petrograd, the Bolsheviks released Rutenberg, among many others. He moved to Moscow, the new capital, and took a position in the [[cooperative]] movement. However, after the unsuccessful attempt upon Lenin's life by [[Fanny Kaplan]] in August 1918, the \"[[Red Terror]]\" campaign against \"[[Esers]]\" was launched. Rutenberg escaped from Moscow. His last location in Russia was in the port city of Odessa, where he was a member of the defense committee. The city was governed by White Russians who were supported by the French Allied army. On 17 March 1919 he managed to obtain a Russian passport and with an exit visa boarded an American vessel that took him to the Allied-controlled city of Constantinople. From there he sailed to Marseille, later going on to the UK before departing to British Palestine.\n\n== In Palestine ==\n\n[[File:Rutenberg Palestine Electric Company Ltd.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Palestine Electric Company Ltd in the early 1920s.]]\n[[File:Rutenbergh power station 001.jpg|thumb|right|The Naharayim power station. 1935]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 5245 island of peace.JPG|thumb|right|Ruins of the Naharayim power station. 2009]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Rutenberg Hydroelectric Plant in Naharayim and Tel Or in 1937.jpg|thumb|Naharayim. 1937]]\nIn 1919, Rutenberg appeared in [[Paris]] and joined other Zionist leaders, preparing propositions for the [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Treaty of Versailles]]. Promoting the electrification plan, he received financial support from Baron [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] and his son [[James Armand de Rothschild|James A. de Rothschild]] and, finally, settled in Palestine to realize it.\n\nHowever, his first contribution after arrival was establishing, together with Jabotinsky, the Jewish self-defense militia, the [[Haganah]]. Rutenberg was the chief officer of these troops in Tel Aviv during the [[Jaffa riots|Arab hostilities in 1921]].\n\nHe participated in the demarcation of Mandatory Palestine's northern border, defining British and French areas of interest.\n\nIn 1921 \u2013 over fierce Arab-Palestinian protests against giving the [[Yishuv]] an economic stranglehold of the country \u2013 the British granted Rutenberg the Jaffa and (later) the Jordan electricity concessions. The Jaffa concession had been the first to have been executed.

He played an active role in two Russian revolutions, in [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917]]. During [[World War I]], he was among the founders of the [[Jewish Legion]] and of the [[American Jewish Congress]]. Later, through his connections in Palestine, he managed to obtain a concession for production and distribution of electric power and founded the Palestine Electric Company, currently the [[Israel Electric Corporation]]. \nA vocal and committed Zionist, Rutenberg also participated in establishing the [[Haganah]], the main Jewish militia in pre-war Palestine, and founded [[Palestine Airways]]. He subsequently served as a President of the [[Vaad Leumi|Jewish National Council]].\n\n== Socialist and revolutionary ==\nPinhas Rutenberg was born in the town of [[Romny]], north of [[Poltava]], [[Russian Empire]] (now in [[Ukraine]]). After graduating from a practical high school, he enrolled to the [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology|Technology Institute]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and joined the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (also known as the S.R. or Eser party). He worked as a workshop manager at the [[Putilov plant]], the largest Petersburg industry. The plant was a center of the [[Assembly of Russian Factory and Plant Workers]], founded in 1903 by a popular [[working class]] leader, Father [[George Gapon]]. Gapon collaborated in secret with the Police Department (the [[Okhrana]]), which believed this to be the way to control the workers' movement. Rutenberg became Gapon\u2019s friend, which made him a noticeable figure in the S.R. party.\n\nOn Sunday 9 January 1905 ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]] date) Gapon organized a \"peaceful workers\u2019 procession\" to the [[Winter Palace]] in order to present a petition to the [[Tzar]]. Rutenberg participated, by his party's approval. In a tragic turn of events, army pickets fired directly into the crowd, and hundreds were killed. Amid the panic, Rutenberg retained self-control and actually saved Gapon\u2019s life, taking him away from gun fire. This incident, known as the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)]], sparked the first [[Russian Revolution of 1905]].\n\nGapon and Rutenberg fled abroad, being welcomed in Europe both by prominent Russian emigrants [[Georgy Plekhanov]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and French socialist leaders [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]]. Before the end of 1905, Rutenberg returned to Russia, and Gapon followed him.\n \nGapon soon revealed to Rutenberg his contacts with the police and tried to recruit him, too, reasoning that double loyalty is helpful to the workers\u2019 cause. However, Rutenberg betrayed his trust and reported  this provocation to his party leaders, [[Yevno Azef]] and [[Boris Savinkov]]. Azef demanded that the traitor be put to death. Ironically, he was in fact an [[agent provocateur]] himself, exposed by [[Vladimir Burtsev]] in 1908.  \n \nOn 26 March 1906 Gapon arrived to meet Rutenberg in a rented cottage out of St. Petersburg, and after a month he was found there hanged. Rutenberg asserted later that Gapon was condemned by a comrades\u2019 court and that three S.R. party combatants overheard their conversation from the next room. After Gapon had repeated his collaboration proposal, Rutenberg called the comrades into the room and he left. When he returned, Gapon was dead.\n\nHowever, the S.R. party leadership refused to assume responsibility, announcing that the execution was undertaken by Rutenberg individually and the cause was a personal one, denying ever having sent their comrades to the meeting on 26 March. Rutenberg was then condemned and expelled from the party.\n\n== Turn to Zionism ==\n\n[[Image:Pinhas Rutenberg.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Pinhas Rutenberg c. 1942.]]\nForced to emigrate, Rutenberg settled in Italy. Away from politics, he concentrated on hydraulic engineering. Pondering on specific [[Jew]]ish problems, he became convinced that the solution was to establish a national home for the Jewish people.\n\nAfter [[World War I]] broke out, the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] mainly supported the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. Rutenberg set the goal to create a Jewish armed force to fight for the [[Land of Israel]]. He visited European capitals, met prominent politicians and Zionist leaders, and finally joined the efforts of [[Jabotinsky]] and [[Joseph Trumpeldor|Trumpeldor]] to set up the [[Jewish Legion]]. In May 1915, on Jabotinsky\u2019s approval, Rutenberg travelled to the [[United States]] to promote this idea among the American Jewry.\n\nHe found strong support among Jewish organizations in [[New York City]]. Rutenberg endorsed the labour party ([[Poale Zion|Poalei Zion]]) and cooperated with [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Itzhak Ben-Zvi]], and [[Ber Borochov]]. Together with [[Chaim Zhitlowsky]], he founded the American Jewish Congress. At the same time, Rutenberg published his book ''The National Revival of the Jewish People'' under the [[pseudonym]] Pinhas Ben-Ami (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: my people\u2019s son).\n\nWhile in the US, Rutenberg managed to complete a detailed design for utilizing the Land of Israel's hydraulic resources for [[irrigation]] and electrical power production, which was his long-time dream.\n\n== Anti-Bolshevik ==\n[[File:Pinhas Rutenberg 1919 passport.jpg|thumb|Passport used by Pinhas Rutenberg in 1919 to escape from Odessa.]]\nRutenberg greeted the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917, and in July 1917 he returned to Petrograd, welcomed by the prime minister of the [[Russian Provisional Government]], [[Alexander Kerensky]], also an S.R party member. Despite 12 years of absence in Russia, Rutenberg was soon named vice-president of the Petrograd municipality, the local [[Duma]].\n\nIn a couple of months, [[Petrograd Soviet]], headed by [[Leon Trotsky]], became an alternative power in the capital, hostile towards the Duma. It was clear that the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] were planning to overthrow the government. On 3 November Rutenberg became a member of the emergency Supreme Council, created by Kerensky to preserve order and justice. During an assault on the [[Winter Palace]] on 7 November, the night of the [[October Revolution]], Rutenberg defended the government residence after Kerensky had escaped. When the [[Bolshevik]]s prevailed, he was arrested and put in jail, together with the \"capitalist ministers\".\n\nIn March 1918, when German troops approached Petrograd, the Bolsheviks released Rutenberg, among many others. He moved to Moscow, the new capital, and took a position in the [[cooperative]] movement. However, after the unsuccessful attempt upon Lenin's life by [[Fanny Kaplan]] in August 1918, the \"[[Red Terror]]\" campaign against \"[[Esers]]\" was launched. Rutenberg escaped from Moscow. His last location in Russia was in the port city of Odessa, where he was a member of the defense committee. The city was governed by White Russians who were supported by the French Allied army. On 17 March 1919 he managed to obtain a Russian passport and with an exit visa boarded an American vessel that took him to the Allied-controlled city of Constantinople. From there he sailed to Marseille, later going on to the UK before departing to British Palestine.\n\n== In Palestine ==\n\n[[File:Rutenberg Palestine Electric Company Ltd.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Palestine Electric Company Ltd in the early 1920s.]]\n[[File:Rutenbergh power station 001.jpg|thumb|right|The Naharayim power station. 1935]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 5245 island of peace.JPG|thumb|right|Ruins of the Naharayim power station. 2009]]\n[[File:Aerial view of Rutenberg Hydroelectric Plant in Naharayim and Tel Or in 1937.jpg|thumb|Naharayim. 1937]]\nIn 1919, Rutenberg appeared in [[Paris]] and joined other Zionist leaders, preparing propositions for the [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Treaty of Versailles]]. Promoting the electrification plan, he received financial support from Baron [[Edmond James de Rothschild]] and his son [[James Armand de Rothschild|James A. de Rothschild]] and, finally, settled in Palestine to realize it.\n\nHowever, his first contribution after arrival was establishing, together with Jabotinsky, the Jewish self-defense militia, the [[Haganah]]. Rutenberg was the chief officer of these troops in Tel Aviv during the [[Jaffa riots|Arab hostilities in 1921]].\n\nHe participated in the demarcation of Mandatory Palestine's northern border, defining British and French areas of interest.\n\nIn 1921 \u2013 over fierce Arab-Palestinian protests against giving the [[Yishuv]] an economic stranglehold of the country \u2013 the British granted Rutenberg the Jaffa and (later) the Jordan electricity concessions. The Jaffa concession had been the first to have been executed.  Operating under the name of the Jaffa Electric Company, Rutenberg in 1923 built a grid that gradually covered Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, neighboring (mainly Jewish) settlements, and the British military installations in Sarafend.

According to this account, the young [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] was dedicated by his mother [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]] there, to be raised at the shrine by the high priest, and his own prophetic ministry is presented as having begun there. Hophni and Phinehas are noted as malicious in their dealings with those who came to the shrine to offer [[Korban|sacrifices]] ({{bibleverse|1|Samuel|2:12\u201317|NKJV}}).  It was under Eli and his sons that the Ark was lost to Israel in a battle with the Philistines at [[Aphek (biblical) |Aphek]]. [[W.F. Albright]], hypothesized that the Philistines also destroyed Shiloh at this time; this conclusion is disputed,<ref>Schley, 1989, 2009, pp. 184\u201399.</ref> but supported by traditional commentary.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15838/jewish/Chapter-9.htm#v=13&showrashi=true  Rashi on 1 Samuel 9:13]</ref>  The place may have been destroyed later as well, and the biblical text records no such claimed destruction.

Schley has claimed that the capture of the Ark and the death of Saul occurred in the same battle and that the later Davidic editors redacted the texts to make it appear as if Saul had ruled without either Tent Shrine or Ark, and thus without sacral legitimacy.<ref>Schley, 1989, 2009, pp. 191\u201397.</ref> This claim is disputed.{{cn|date= February 2018}}\n\nWhat is certain is that during the prophetic ministry of Jeremiah ({{Bibleref2|Jeremiah 7:12\u201315; 26:5\u20139, 41:5}}) over three hundred years later, Shiloh had been reduced to ruins. Jeremiah used the example of Shiloh to warn the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem what [[Yahweh]] [[Elohim]] will do to the \"place where I caused my name to dwell,\" warning them that their holy city, Jerusalem, like Shiloh, could fall under divine judgment.\n\n[[File:Shilo, Palestine (13056127775).jpg|250px|thumbnail|The Byzantine Basilica, with excavations to the right.]]\n===Byzantine period===\n[[Jerome]], in his letter to [[Paula of Rome|Paula]] and [[Eustochium]], dated about 392\u2013393, writes: \"With Christ at our side we shall pass through Shiloh and Bethel \" (Ep.46,13, PL 22, 492). The official church of Jerusalem did not schedule an annual pilgrimage to Shiloh, unlike Bethel. On the contrary, Samuel's feast was held on August 20 in the village of Masephta ([[Mizpah in Benjamin|Mizpah]]). Even the pilgrims seemingly did not visit Shiloh, for the only one that mentions its name\u2014the sixth-century pilgrim Theodosius in ''[[De Situ Terrae Sanctae]]'' (ch. 4, CCSL 175, 116)\u2014wrongly locates it midway between Jerusalem and [[Emmaus Nicopolis]]. The mistaken identification lasted for centuries, as appears, for example, on the Florentine map of 1300, which places Shiloh at [[Nabi Samwil]], where the [[Tomb of Samuel]] is found. The sixth-century mosaic [[Madaba Map]] wrongly locates Shiloh east of [[Shechem]], omitting the depiction of the church.\n\n===Early Muslim and Crusader periods===\nIn 638 the [[Muslim]]s conquered the area of [[Palestine (region)#Middle Ages|Palestine]]. Muslim pilgrims to Shiloh mention a mosque called es-Sekineh where the memory of Jacob's and Joseph's deeds was revered. The earliest source is el-Harawi, who visited the country in 1173 when it was occupied by the [[Crusaders]] and wrote: \"Seilun is the village of the mosque es-Sekineh where the stone of the Table is found\". Yaqut (1225) and el-Quarwini (1308, Marmardji, 94\u201395), write similarly.\n\n==Archaeology==\n{{further information|Shilo, Mateh Binyamin#Tel Shilo}}\n===Overview===\nArchaeological excavations have shown that the place was already settled from about 1750 BCE (Middle Bronze II or MB II, otherwise known as MB IIB according to the Albright school); however, it is not mentioned in any pre-biblical source. A tell and many impressive remains have been unearthed from the [[Canaan|Canaanite]] and [[Israelite]] eras, with habitation lasting until the 8th century BCE. During the following 12 centuries Shiloh is solely noted as a station on sojourners' routes, usually having only its religious-historical significance to offer. Archaeological excavations have revealed remains from the Roman and Persian as well as Early and Late Muslim periods.\n\nAn impressive [[glacis]] has been located and pottery, animal remains, weapons and other objects have been recovered.{{dubious|this last sentence MAKES NO SENSE here if not connected to a historical period! The glacis: is it the one mentioned below, from Middle Bronze III? What about the pottery, animal bones, weapons?|date=June 2016}}\n\n===History of excavations===\nSoundings were first made in 1922 by Aage Schmidt. A Danish team led by Hans Kj\u00e6r (overseen by W.F. Albright) excavated for three seasons between the years 1926\u201332. A probe was done by Sven Holm-Nielson and Marie-Louise Buhl in 1963. An extensive excavation was done by [[Israel Finkelstein]] during the years 1981\u201384. Since 2006 further excavations took place there.\n\n===Finkelstein excavations===\nFinkelstein's work established eight strata, ranging from Middle Bronze II to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period.\n\n====Bronze Age====\nA massive wall is attributed to the Middle Bronze III (MB IIC) stage, preserved at a height of {{convert|24|ft|m|order=flip}} and width up to {{convert|18|ft|m|order=flip}}, with an extensive [[glacis]].\n\n====Iron Age====\nThe [[Iron Age|Iron]] I (Israelite) remains yielded a pillared two-storey public building near the top of the tell, the earliest attributed to Israelites. Collared rim storage jars and some cultic items were found in these buildings, pointing to usage as part of a cultic complex. More than 20 silos were uncovered from this era, included one with carbonized wheat. The destruction layer evident throughout the tell may have occurred in the wake of the Philistine victory at [[Eben-Ezer]].\n\nAccording to [[radiocarbon dating]] by Finkelstein, the site was abandoned [[:he:\u05e9\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea)#cite note-2|around 1050 BCE]], and then sparsely repopulated during the Iron II period. [[Jeremiah]]'s admonition in the course of his temple [[sermon]], \"Go now to my place that was in Shiloh\" ({{Bibleref2|Jeremiah 7:12}}), would have occurred during this era.\n\n====Cultic site====\nOne of the more intriguing finds was that of a heap of pottery outside the city wall before the advent of the Israelite culture (c. 1000 BCE).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This pile of pottery was the remnant of a number of animal sacrifices, which were tossed over the wall after completion of the ritual and then buried. This find points to a sacral status of Shiloh during the Canaanite period, a status adopted by the Israelites. The top of the tell, where Finkelstein supposes that the tabernacle would have been placed, is now exposed bedrock, offering no clues concerning Israelite worship (aside from the adjacent storage complex).\n\n====Roman and Byzantine periods====\nMore substantive villages emerged in the Roman and Byzantine periods.\n\n[[File:By Ovedc Elef-Milim in Tel Shilo 38.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Mosaics under the Jami' al-Yatim]]\n===Byzantine churches===\nExcavations from 2006 to 2007, carried out adjacent to and just south of Tel Shiloh, exposed elaborate mosaic floors as well as several Greek inscriptions, one explicitly referring to the site as the \"village of Shiloh\".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} During August\u2013September 2006 archaeological excavations were carried out adjacent to the tell of Shiloh. A team led by the Archaeological Staff Officer for [[Judea and Samaria]] in [[Israel Antiquities Authority|Israel's Civilian Administration Antiquities Unit]], performing a clean-up operation at Shiloh this summer, a belated continuation to a previous 1998 dig, discovered the [[mosaic]] floor of a large Byzantine church which was probably constructed between 380 and 420 [[AD]].\n\nThree Byzantine [[basilica]]s have now been uncovered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/034discuss.htm |title=Mount Ephraim and Benjamin: 34.

It seems to have suffered problems of water drainage in its western section despite the installation of run-off pipes and troughs. It appears that the solution was to raise the level of the church{{dubious|Church all of a sudden? So far only a \"weli\" was mentioned! What church?

The earliest source is el-Harawi, who visited the country in 1173 when it was occupied by the [[Crusaders]] and wrote: \"Seilun is the village of the mosque es-Sekineh where the stone of the Table is found\". Yaqut (1225) and el-Quarwini (1308, Marmardji, 94\u201395), write similarly.\n\n==Archaeology==\n{{further information|Shilo, Mateh Binyamin#Tel Shilo}}\n===Overview===\nArchaeological excavations have shown that the place was already settled from about 1750 BCE (Middle Bronze II or MB II, otherwise known as MB IIB according to the Albright school); however, it is not mentioned in any pre-biblical source. A tell and many impressive remains have been unearthed from the [[Canaanite]] and [[Israelite]] eras, with habitation lasting until the 8th century BCE. During the following 12 centuries Shiloh is solely noted as a station on sojourners' routes, usually having only its religious-historical significance to offer. Archaeological excavations have revealed remains from the Roman and Persian as well as Early and Late Muslim periods.\n\nAn impressive [[glacis]] has been located and pottery, animal remains, weapons and other objects have been recovered.{{dubious|this last sentence MAKES NO SENSE here if not connected to a historical period! The glacis: is it the one mentioned below, from Middle Bronze III? What about the pottery, animal bones, weapons?|date=June 2016}}\n\n===History of excavations===\nSoundings were first made in 1922 by Aage Schmidt. A Danish team led by Hans Kj\u00e6r (overseen by W.F. Albright) excavated for three seasons between the years 1926\u201332. A probe was done by Sven Holm-Nielson and Marie-Louise Buhl in 1963. An extensive excavation was done by [[Israel Finkelstein]] during the years 1981\u201384. Since 2006 further excavations took place there.\n\n===Finkelstein excavations===\nFinkelstein's work established eight strata, ranging from Middle Bronze II to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period.\n\n====Bronze Age====\nA massive wall is attributed to the Middle Bronze III (MB IIC) stage, preserved at a height of {{convert|24|ft|m|order=flip}} and width up to {{convert|18|ft|m|order=flip}}, with an extensive [[glacis]].\n\n====Iron Age====\nThe [[Iron Age|Iron]] I (Israelite) remains yielded a pillared two-storey public building near the top of the tell, the earliest attributed to Israelites. Collared rim storage jars and some cultic items were found in these buildings, pointing to usage as part of a cultic complex. More than 20 silos were uncovered from this era, included one with carbonized wheat. The destruction layer evident throughout the tell may have occurred in the wake of the Philistine victory at [[Eben-Ezer]].\n\nAccording to [[radiocarbon dating]] by Finkelstein, the site was abandoned [[:he:\u05e9\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8 \u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9\u05ea)#cite note-2|around 1050 BCE]], and then sparsely repopulated during the Iron II period. [[Jeremiah]]'s admonition in the course of his temple [[sermon]], \"Go now to my place that was in Shiloh\" ({{Bibleref2|Jeremiah 7:12}}), would have occurred during this era.\n\n====Cultic site====\nOne of the more intriguing finds was that of a heap of pottery outside the city wall before the advent of the Israelite culture (c. 1000 BCE).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This pile of pottery was the remnant of a number of animal sacrifices, which were tossed over the wall after completion of the ritual and then buried. This find points to a sacral status of Shiloh during the Canaanite period, a status adopted by the Israelites. The top of the tell, where Finkelstein supposes that the tabernacle would have been placed, is now exposed bedrock, offering no clues concerning Israelite worship (aside from the adjacent storage complex).\n\n====Roman and Byzantine periods====\nMore substantive villages emerged in the Roman and Byzantine periods.\n\n[[File:By Ovedc Elef-Milim in Tel Shilo 38.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Mosaics under the Jami' al-Yatim]]\n===Byzantine churches===\nExcavations from 2006 to 2007, carried out adjacent to and just south of Tel Shiloh, exposed elaborate mosaic floors as well as several Greek inscriptions, one explicitly referring to the site as the \"village of Shiloh\".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} During August\u2013September 2006 archaeological excavations were carried out adjacent to the tell of Shiloh. A team led by the Archaeological Staff Officer for [[Judea and Samaria]] in [[Israel Antiquities Authority|Israel's Civilian Administration Antiquities Unit]], performing a clean-up operation at Shiloh this summer, a belated continuation to a previous 1998 dig, discovered the [[mosaic]] floor of a large Byzantine church which was probably constructed between 380 and 420 [[AD]].\n\nThree Byzantine [[basilica]]s have now been uncovered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/034discuss.htm |title=Mount Ephraim and Benjamin: 34.

Their appearance recalls the well-known fourth-century style, with separate leaves revealing the ribbing of the back leaves, and a smooth leaf under the corner.\n\nA structure discovered in 2006 lies under a Muslim free-standing structure known as [[Mazar (mausoleum)|Weli]] Yetaim. It seems to have suffered problems of water drainage in its western section despite the installation of run-off pipes and troughs. It appears that the solution was to raise the level of the church{{dubious|Church all of a sudden? So far only a \"weli\" was mentioned! What church? Date?|date=June 2016}} and the laying of a new mosaic floor. It was the older, original floor at the lower level that was revealed during the summer of 2006.
