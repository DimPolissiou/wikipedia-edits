The party's 2000 presidential candidate would be entitled to $12.5 million in matching funds. Several high-profile candidates vied for the nomination, including [[Donald Trump]], [[Pat Buchanan]], and physicist [[John Hagelin]]. For a brief time, Congressman [[John B. Anderson]] and Congressman [[Ron Paul]] were considered potential candidates, but both ultimately declined to seek the nomination.\n\nThe party's 2000 candidates received a great deal of media attention, particularly after a dispute at the party's national convention in [[Long Beach, California]] led to a schism and the formation of a rebel faction. Supporters of physicist [[John Hagelin]] refused to accept Pat Buchanan as the party's chairman, and staged a walk-out, which was broadcast live on television.\n\nUltimately, a court decided Buchanan was the party's nominee, however, the drama surrounding the convention is often credited with leading to the downfall of the Reform Party.\n\n==The campaign==\n\n===Buchanan enters race===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buchanan 2000 ad.jpg|thumb|left|A Television commercial for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan]]  -->During the 1992 Republican Presidential Primaries, television commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] fared extremely well and received 22.96% of the total vote. During his 1996 bid, Buchanan spent a brief time as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] front-runner; his campaign carried four states, including New Hampshire, Alaska, Missouri, and Louisiana. Buchanan re-entered the presidential race in 2000, hoping to be the primary \"Stop Bush\" candidate. He was, however, viewed much less favorably by his fellow Republicans, and he struggled to place fifth during an Iowa [[Straw Poll]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.politics1.com/buchanan2k.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715102518/http://www.politics1.com/buchanan2k.htm |archive-date=2011-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nReform Party member [[William von Raab]] launched a \"Draft Buchanan\" movement, and in October 1999 Buchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a \"[[beltway]] party.\" He announced that he would seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party, and immediately sought to align himself with the \"[[Russ Verney]] faction\" of the party. Some in the Reform Party voiced concerns that Buchanan, ardently [[pro-life]] and anti-[[gay rights]], would inadvertently move the party too far to the right. During a meeting with Reform Party leadership at [[Pat Choate]]'s [[Washington, D.C.]] home, Buchanan assured the party elite that his campaign would not address social issues, instead focusing on economic policy.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Perot Legacy: A New Political Path|first=Pat |last=Benjamin| publisher=iUniverse, Inc.

Buchanan's campaign immediately aligned itself with diverse factions within the party, including [[Russ Verney]] and [[Marxist]] [[Lenora Fulani]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.socialism.com/drupal-6.8/?q=node/1167 | title=Freedom Socialist Party - Revolutionary feminism in action}}</ref>\n\nOn November 12, 1999 Fulani formally endorsed Buchanan, saying: \"We are going to integrate that peasant army of his.

In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed U.S. withdrawal from the [[United Nations]] and expelling the U.N. from New York, abolishing the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and [[affirmative action]] programs.\n\nAs his running mate, Buchanan chose [[African-American]] activist and retired teacher from [[Los Angeles]], [[Ezola B.

Buchanan was supported in this election run by future [[Socialist Party USA]] presidential candidate [[Brian Moore (political activist)|Brian Moore]], who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because \"he was for fair trade over [[free trade]].

Many longtime members departed, the party's funds were depleted, and its reputation severely tarnished. On [[Election Day]], Pat Buchanan only received 448,895 votes, thus losing the Reform Party's ballot access in most states. Buchanan returned to the Republican Party in 2001. During the 2004 election cycle, the Reform Party nominated [[Ralph Nader]] in hopes of relinquishing themselves of the \"pro-life\" label Buchanan had bestowed upon them. In 2008, [[Ted Weill]], who had been a critic of Buchanan, was the party's presidential candidate. Donald Trump joined the Democratic Party in 2001, left in 2009 and remained an independent until 2012 when he returned to the Republican Party, seeking that party's [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|nomination for president]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] and became the 45th President of the United States.\n\n==Candidates==\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|[[Television personality]] '''[[Pat Buchanan]]''' of [[Virginia]]<br>([[Pat Buchanan presidential campaign, 2000|Campaign]])\nFile:John S.

The party's 2000 presidential candidate would be entitled to $12.5 million in matching funds. Several high-profile candidates vied for the nomination, including [[Donald Trump]], [[Pat Buchanan]], and physicist [[John Hagelin]]. For a brief time, Congressman [[John B. Anderson]] and Congressman [[Ron Paul]] were considered potential candidates, but both ultimately declined to seek the nomination.\n\nThe party's 2000 candidates received a great deal of media attention, particularly after a dispute at the party's national convention in [[Long Beach, California]] led to a schism and the formation of a rebel faction. Supporters of physicist [[John Hagelin]] refused to accept Pat Buchanan as the party's chairman, and staged a walk-out, which was broadcast live on television.\n\nUltimately, a court decided Buchanan was the party's nominee, however, the drama surrounding the convention is often credited with leading to the downfall of the Reform Party.\n\n==The campaign==\n\n===Buchanan enters race===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Buchanan 2000 ad.jpg|thumb|left|A Television commercial for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan]]  -->During the 1992 Republican Presidential Primaries, television commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] fared extremely well and received 22.96% of the total vote. During his 1996 bid, Buchanan spent a brief time as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] front-runner; his campaign carried four states, including New Hampshire, Alaska, Missouri, and Louisiana. Buchanan re-entered the presidential race in 2000, hoping to be the primary \"Stop Bush\" candidate.

Some in the Reform Party voiced concerns that Buchanan, ardently [[pro-life]] and anti-[[gay rights]], would inadvertently move the party too far to the right. During a meeting with Reform Party leadership at [[Pat Choate]]'s [[Washington, D.C.]] home, Buchanan assured the party elite that his campaign would not address social issues, instead focusing on economic policy.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Perot Legacy: A New Political Path|first=Pat |last=Benjamin| publisher=iUniverse, Inc.

Buchanan's campaign immediately aligned itself with diverse factions within the party, including [[Russ Verney]] and [[Marxist]] [[Lenora Fulani]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.socialism.com/drupal-6.8/?q=node/1167 | title=Freedom Socialist Party - Revolutionary feminism in action}}</ref>\n\nOn November 12, 1999 Fulani formally endorsed Buchanan, saying: \"We are going to integrate that peasant army of his.

In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed U.S. withdrawal from the [[United Nations]] and expelling the U.N. from New York, abolishing the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and [[affirmative action]] programs.\n\nAs his running mate, Buchanan chose [[African-American]] activist and retired teacher from [[Los Angeles]], [[Ezola B. Foster]]. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future [[Socialist Party USA]] presidential candidate [[Brian Moore (political activist)|Brian Moore]], who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because \"he was for fair trade over [[free trade]]. He had some [[Progressivism|progressive]] positions that I thought would be helpful to the common man.\"<ref name=\"indy weekly\">{{cite news |date=2008-10-08 |work=[[Independent Weekly]] |title=Q&A with Socialist Party presidential candidate Brian Moore |url=http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A266409 |access-date=2011-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104184456/http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A266409 |archive-date=2016-01-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On August 19, the [[New York Right to Life Party]], in convention, chose Buchanan as their nominee, with 90% of the districts voting for him.<ref>(2000-08-01) [https://web.archive.org/web/20020820004727/http://ballot-access.org/2000/0901.html#16 Right To Life Party Picks Buchanan], Ballot Access News.</ref>\n\nOn November 2, party founder Ross Perot endorsed Republican [[George W.

Many longtime members departed, the party's funds were depleted, and its reputation severely tarnished. On [[Election Day]], Pat Buchanan only received 448,895 votes, thus losing the Reform Party's ballot access in most states. Buchanan returned to the Republican Party in 2001. During the 2004 election cycle, the Reform Party nominated [[Ralph Nader]] in hopes of relinquishing themselves of the \"pro-life\" label Buchanan had bestowed upon them. In 2008, [[Ted Weill]], who had been a critic of Buchanan, was the party's presidential candidate. Donald Trump joined the Democratic Party in 2001, left in 2009 and remained an independent until 2012 when he returned to the Republican Party, seeking that party's [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|nomination for president]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] and became the 45th President of the United States.\n\n==Candidates==\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|[[Television personality]] '''[[Pat Buchanan]]''' of [[Virginia]]<br>([[Pat Buchanan presidential campaign, 2000|Campaign]])\nFile:John S.

He retired as a captain from [[United States Navy Reserve]] in 1983.\n\n\n==Legal career and government service==\nHe was a Marion County prosecuting attorney from 1950 to 1954.\n\nChappell was elected to [[Florida House of Representatives]] from 1954 to 1964, speaker from 1961 to 1963.\nHe did not seek reelection in 1964 but was elected again in 1966.\nHe served as member of the law firm of Chappell and Rowland, [[Ocala, Florida]].\n\nChappell was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[91st United States Congress|Ninety-first]] and to the nine succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1969 \u2013 January 3, 1989). He married the former Jeane Brown on September 28, 1985.\n\nChappell was a moderate to conservative Democrat and served on the [[United States House Appropriations Committee]].

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.
