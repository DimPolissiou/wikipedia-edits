The Temple is dedicated to Lord [[Venkateswara]], an incarnation of [[Vishnu]], who is believed to be appeared here to save mankind from trials and troubles of [[Kali Yuga]]. The temple is situated at a height of 853 metres on Tirumala Hills which are part of Seshachalam Hills and is constructed in Dravidian Architectural Style.\n\n==Maha dwaram==\n\n[[File:Tirumala Venkateswara temple entrance 09062015.JPG|thumb|Maha Dwaram of Sri Venkateswara Temple with Five storied [[Gopuram]] over it encircled by Mahaprakaram]]\n<ref name=arch>{{cite web|title= Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams-Temple History|url=http://www.tirumala.org/TTDTempleHistory.aspx|publisher=Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref> Maha Dwaram is the main entrance of the Temple. It provides access from outside of temple to Sampangi Pradakshinam which are separated by outer compound wall(Maha Prakaram).  A five storied  gopuram(Temple Tower) of 50 feet was built on this entrance with seven [[Kalasam]]s at its apex.  It is also known as \u2018Padikavali\u2019 or \u2018SimhaDwaram\u2019. On either side of this entrance there are two panchaloha(metal) statues dedicated for Sankanidhi and Padmanidhi who are believed to be guardians of navanidhi(Treasures of Lord Venkateswara).\n\n==Sampangi pradakshina==\n\n<ref name=arch /> The area which circumambulates the outer and inner compound walls is called Sampangi Pradakshinam. In olden days [[Magnolia champaca]] Flowers (Telugu:Sampangi) were grown in this area hence it got the name Sampangi Pradakshinam. Sampangi Pradakshinam includes Krishnadevarayala Mandapam(Pratima Mandapam), Addala Mandapam, Ranganayaka Mandapam, Tirumalaraya Mandapam, Dwajasthambha Mandapam, Kalyanotsava Mandapam, Ugranam (Store house), Balipetam(Altar), Kshetra palaka sila, Tulabharam. It also includes idols of Vijayanagara Kings Sri Krishnadevarayalu and his two consorts, Tirumala Devi and Chinnadevi, Venkatapatirayalu,  Lala khemaramu, Lala\u2019s mother Mata Mohana Devi and Lala\u2019s wife Pita Bibi. Dwajastambam- the golden flagstaff  is found in between Maha dwaram and Vendi vakili in Dwajastambha mandapam. While entering or leavingInner sanctorum one has to encircumbulate Dwajastambam including Lord Venkateswara. During Sri Venkateswara Brahmotsavams the imprint of garuda is hoisted on this flagstaff inviting all Gods and Goddesses to the festival. During the invasion of [[Srirangam]] by [[Malik Kafur]] in 1310\u201311 AD, the Ranganayaka Mandapam of the temple served as the shelter for the presiding deity of Srirangam, [[Sri Rangam|Ranganatha Swamy]].\n\n==Vendi Vakili==\nVendi Vakili (Silver Entrance in [[Telugu language|Telugu]])<ref name=arch /> is the second entrance of the temple which is provided through inner compound wall and leads to Vimana Pradakhinam. This entrance is also known as 'Nadimipadikavali'.  The inner compound wall separates Sampangi Pradakshinam and Vimana Pradakshinam.  The doors of this entrance are plated with Silver and hence the name.  A three storied Gopuram was built over this entrance with seven kalisams during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\n\n==Vimana pradakshina==\n\n<ref name=arch /> Vendivakili leads to Vimana Pradakshinam. Vimana Pradakshinam is the area which circumambulates Ananda Nilayam Vimana Gopuram or Sanctum sanctorum or Main Shrine. Angapradakshina Seva will be performed in this area and hence this path is also called Anga pradakshina Margam. Just after entering the Vimana pradakshinam opposite to Vendivakili and behind the Garuda Mandapam there are small idols of Sri Varadaraja Swamy, Sri Ranganatha Swamu in sleeping posture over Adisesha and Sri Venkateswara Swamy plated in gold. Vimana Pradakshina includes small shrines dedicated to Varadaraja Swamy Temple to the right of Vendi vakili facing towards west and Yoga Narasimha Swamy Temple to the left of Vendi vakili also facing west. Other Rooms include Potu(main kitchen), Bangaru Bavi(golden well), Ankurarpana Mandapam, Yagasala, Nanala (coins) and Notla (Paper notes) Parkamani, Almyrah of Sandal paste (Chandanapu ara), cell of records, Sannidhi Bhashyakarulu - the seat of Sri Ramanuja, Lords\u2019s hundi and the seat of Vishvaksena. Devotees will have darshan of \u2018Vimana Venkateswara Swamy\u2019 residing on Ananda Nilayam from Sampangi Pradakshinam. All the small temples in this path way are called \u2018Chutttu Gullu\u2019(Sub-shrines encircling the main shrine).\n\n==Ananda Nilayam Vimanam==\n{{main|Ananda Nilayam}}\n[[File:Tirumala overview.jpg|thumb|upright|Tirumala Temple and [[Vaikuntam Queue Complex]] (semicircular building in the foreground) as seen from Srivari Padalu on Narayanagiri hill]]\nThe [[Ananda Nilayam]] is a monumental tower with a golden roof. Its inner temple or ''[[Vimana (shrine)|vimanam]]'' houses the main deity, Lord Sri Venkateswara. The deity stands directly beneath a gilt dome called the Ananda Nilaya Divya Vimana. This exquisitely wrought deity, called the ''Mulaberam'', is believed to be self-manifested, and no human being is known to have installed it in the shrine. The Lord wears a gold crown with a large emerald embedded in the front. On special occasions, he is adorned with a diamond crown. The Lord has a thick double [[tilaka]] drawn on his forehead, which screens his eyes. His ears are decorated with golden earrings. The right hand is pointing to his lotus feet. His left hand is akimbo. His body is dressed with yellow clothing tied with gold string and a gold belt with gold bells. He has a [[yajnopavita]] (sacred thread) flowing down crosswise from his left shoulder. He bears [[Lakshmi Devi]] on his right chest and [[Alamelu|Padmavathi Devi]] on his left chest. His feet are covered with gold frames and decked with gold anklets. A curved gold belt encompasses his legs. The Ananda Nilaya Divya Vimana was covered with gilt copper plates and surmounted with a golden vase in the 13th century, during the reign of the Vijayanagara king Yadava Raya.The ancient and sacred temple of Sri Venkateswara is located on the seventh peak, Venkatachala (Venkata Hill) of the Tirupati Hill, and lies on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini. It is by the Lord's presidency over Venkatachala, that He has received the appellation, Venkateswara (Lord of the Venkata Hill). He is also called the Lord of the Seven Hills.\n\n==Bangaru vakili==\nTirumamani Mandapam is the mandapam in front of bangaru vakili and is constructed in the year 1417 AD by madhavadasar.<ref>{{cite book|title=Temples in and Around Tirupati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rt3VAAAAMAAJ&q=krishnadevaraya+and+tirupati&dq=krishnadevaraya+and+tirupati&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPzLK-wrDfAhUOOisKHWsaCUo4ChDoAQg-MAQ}}</ref> From the Tirumamani Mandapam, one can enter the Bangaru vakili (translates to ''Golden Entrance'') to reach the inner sanctum sanctorum.

At 11:15 members of the Bund buttoned up their overcoats, conveniently hiding their uniforms, and were escorted through police lines along Fifty-Second amid the crowds of protesters waiting outside. Ralliers were greeted with a roar of catcalls, jeers, and even a few punches, but by midnight, all was quiet, or as quiet as it could be in downtown New York.<ref>   \u201c22,000 Nazis Hold Rally in Garden; Police Check Foes\u201d New York Times, Tuesday, February 21, 1939.</ref>\n\nIsadore Greenbaum never intended to run onto the stage. A former deck engineer and chief petty officer, Greenbaum snuck into the rally, but his anger quickly took hold of him as he listened to Kuhn speak. Speaking years later in 1989, Greenbaum characterized his actions as \u201cI went down to the Garden without any intention of interrupting, but being that they talked so much against my religion and there was so much persecution I lost my head and I felt it was my duty to talk\u201d<ref> Bump Philip, \u201cWhen Nazis rallied in Manhattan, one Working-Class Jewish Man From Brooklyn Took Them on\u201d The Washington Post, February 20, 2019.</ref>When asked about the cause of his actions, Greenbaum quickly rebutted with \u201cGee, what would you have done if you were in my place listening to that s.o.b. hollering against the government and publicly kissing [Adolf] Hitler\u2019s behind - while thousands cheered?

Two months after the rally, the film ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]]'' was released by [[Warner Brothers]], ridiculing the Nazis and their American sympathizers. The Bund also came under investigation. After its financial records were seized in a raid on the group's [[Yorkville, Manhattan]] headquarters, authorities discovered that $14,000 (about $250,000 in 2018 dollars) raised by the Bund in the rally was unaccounted for, having been spent by Kuhn on his mistress and various personal expenses. Kuhn was convicted of [[embezzlement]] in December 1939 and sent to [[Sing Sing prison]].<ref name=\"Hart\"/> Kuhn's successor as Bund leader was Gerhard Wilhelm Kunze, a spy for German military intelligence who fled the United States in November 1941. The final Bund national leader was George Froboese, who was in charge of the organization when [[German declaration of war against the United States|Germany declared war on the United States]].

Alongside allied groups, such as the [[Christian Front (United States)|Christian Front]], these organizations were virulently [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]].<ref name=\"Lederhendler\"/>\n\nThe pro-Nazi organizations in the U.S. were actively countered by anti-Nazi organizations led by [[American Jews]], [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]], and others who opposed Hitlerism and supported a [[Anti-Nazi boycott of 1933|boycott of German goods]]. The Joint Boycott Committee held a rally at Madison Square Garden in 1937.<ref name=\"Lederhendler\"/>\n\n\n==Preparation for rally==\n\nMayor LaGuardia realized the dangers posed by this rally and dispatched the highest amount of police to a single event in the city's history.<ref>\u201c22,000 Nazis Hold Rally in Garden; Police Check Foes\u201d New York Times, Tuesday, February 21, 1939.</ref>1,700 uniformed police officers patrolled outside the venue as well as 600 undercover detectives and non-uniformed officers scattered throughout the hall, and even 35 firefighters, armed with a heavy-duty fire hose in preparation of a riot.
