He is suspected of having murdered three individuals in different states: Kathleen McCormack Durst, his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; [[Susan Berman]], his longtime friend, who was killed in [[California]] in 2000; and his neighbor, Morris Black, who was killed in [[Texas]] in 2001. Durst was the subject of a multi-state manhunt after Black's body parts were found floating in [[Galveston Bay]], but although he admitted to the dismembering of Black (which he was not charged with), he was ultimately acquitted of his murder on the grounds of self defense.  \n\nOn March 14, 2015, Durst was arrested in [[New Orleans]] on a [[first-degree murder]] warrant in relation to the Berman killing. On November 4, 2016, he was transferred to California and soon after was [[Arraignment|arraigned]] in [[Los Angeles]] on first-degree murder charges. In October 2018, Los Angeles County Superior Judge Mark Windham ruled there was sufficient evidence for Durst to be tried for the death of Berman.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thejewishvoice.com/2018/10/31/judge-rules-that-ny-real-estate-heir-durst-stand-trial-for-murder/|title=Judge Rules that NY Real Estate Heir Durst Stand Trial for Murder|first=Andrew|last=Schiff|newspaper=[[The Jewish Voice]]|date=October 31, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref> His trial began on 2 March 2020<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/truecrime/robert-dursts-fate-will-rest-with-12-jurors-the-only-audience-that-matters-now/ar-BB10E1Dx?ocid=spartanntp|title=Robert Durst's fate will rest with 12 jurors, the only audience that matters now|first=Matt|last=Hamilton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 2, 2020}}</ref> but was postponed when Superior court judge Mark E Windham announced that the trial, which had been under way for six days, will stand adjourned until 6 April due to the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-15/robert-durst-murder-trial-postponed-due-to-coronavirus|title=Robert Durst murder trial postponed because of coronavirus as court announces new safety measures|first=Matt|last=Hamilton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 15, 2020|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nOne of four children, Robert Durst was born on April 12, 1943<ref name=WOTrace>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Marion|title=Without a Trace|date=November 18, 2002|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0-312-98502-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNadyEUsW98C&pg=PA13}}</ref> and grew up in [[Scarsdale, New York]], in a Jewish family.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chilewich |first1=Aron |title=Robert Durst\u2019s Jewish background |url=https://jewishjournal.com/culture/religion/164809/ |website=Jewish Journal |publisher=Tribe Media Corp |accessdate=7 September 2019}}</ref> He is the son of real estate investor [[Seymour Durst]] and his wife [[Bernice Herstein]].

Prosecutors will try to connect Berman's death with McCormack's disappearance, which they want to show as the foundation for the motive for Berman's slaying. In his ruling that prosecutors could use evidence from the Texas case, Judge Windham said the killings of Black and Berman seemed \u201cto be intertwined.\u201d The murder charge against Durst includes the special circumstance allegations of lying in wait and killing a witness to a crime. There is also an allegation that he used a handgun to carry out the murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/610d2db4b03541538d1c12dd516e2cfe|title=Robert Durst defense: Evidence could be 'game over' for heir|first=Brian|last=Melley|date=January 17, 2019|website=AP NEWS|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, a motion filed by Durst's attorneys claimed two handwriting samples (the anonymous \u201ccadaver note\u201d from 2000 informing Beverly Hills Police that a body could be found at her house, and a letter in 1999 from Durst to Berman), along with other evidence from his 2015 arrest at his hotel in New Orleans, were illegally obtained.
