It was located in [[Ephesus]] (near the modern town of [[Sel\u00e7uk]] in present-day [[Turkey]]). It was completely rebuilt twice, once after a devastating flood and three hundred years later after an act of arson, and in its final form was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. By 401 AD it had been ruined or destroyed.<ref>John Freely, ''The Western Shores of Turkey: Discovering the Aegean and Mediterranean Coasts'' 2004, p. 148; Clive Foss, ''Ephesus after antiquity: a late antique, Byzantine, and Turkish city'', Cambridge University Press, 1979, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i6Q8AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PR7&ots=cz_UVafPvu&dq=Artemis%20Ephesus%20John%20Chrysostom%20mob&lr=lang_en&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 86\u201389 & footnote 83.]</ref> Only foundations and fragments of the last temple remain at the site.\n\nThe earliest version of the temple (a ''[[temenos]]'') antedated the [[Ionic immigration]] by many years, and dates to the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'', attributed it to the [[Amazons]]. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under [[Chersiphron]], the Cretan [[architect]], and his son [[Metagenes]]. The project was funded by [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by [[Herostratus]] in an act of [[arson]].\n\nThe next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in [[Antipater of Sidon]]'s list of the world's Seven Wonders:\n<blockquote>I have set eyes on the wall of lofty [[Babylon]] on which is a road for chariots, and the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus by the Alpheus]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|hanging gardens]], and the [[Colossus of Rhodes|colossus of the Sun]], and the huge labour of the [[Egyptian pyramids|high pyramids]], and the vast [[Mausoleum of Mausolus|tomb of Mausolus]]; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, \"Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand\".<ref>Antipater, ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' IX.58.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Location and history==\n[[File:Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|alt=imaginary Temple of Artemis 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck|The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the [[Renaissance]], as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by [[Martin Heemskerck]].]]\n\nThe Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about {{convert|75|km}} south from the modern port city of [[\u0130zmir]], in Turkey. Today the site lies on the edge of the modern town of [[Sel\u00e7uk]].\n\nThe sacred site (''[[temenos]]'') at Ephesus was far older than the ''Artemision'' itself. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was certain that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of Apollo at [[Didyma]].<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 7.7\u20138.</ref>  He said that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were [[Leleges]] and [[Lydia]]ns.  [[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'' attributed the earliest ''temenos'' at Ephesus to the [[Amazons]], whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (''bretas'') of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that [[Pindar]] believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. [[Tacitus]] also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria | last2=Chesler | first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title=Wonder Woman | publisher=Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn=0-03-005376-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars }}</ref>\n\n[[Modern archaeology]] cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded.

Among the flood debris were the remains of a carved ivory plaque of a [[griffin]] and the [[Tree of Life]], apparently North Syrian, and some drilled tear-shaped amber drops of elliptical cross-section. These probably once dressed a wooden effigy (''[[xoanon]]'') of the Lady of Ephesus, which must have been destroyed or recovered from the flood. Bammer notes that though the site was prone to flooding, and raised by silt deposits about two metres between the 8th and 6th centuries, and a further 2.4&nbsp;m between the sixth and the fourth, its continued use \"indicates that maintaining the identity of the actual location played an important role in the sacred organization\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|pp=144,153}}.</ref>\n\n[[Heraclitus]] deposited his book \"On Nature\" as a dedication to Artemis in the great temple.\n\n==Second phase==\nThe new temple was sponsored at least in part by [[Croesus]],<ref>see Kevin Leloux, \"The Campaign Of Croesus Against Ephesus: Historical & Archaeological Considerations\", in Polemos 21-2, 2018, p. 47-63 [https://www.academia.edu/38848219/The_Campaign_Of_Croesus_Against_Ephesus_Historical_and_Archaeological_Considerations_Polemos_21-2_2018_p._47-63].</ref> who founded [[Lydia]]'s empire and was overlord of Ephesus,<ref>Herodotus' statement to this effect is confirmed by the conjectural reading of a fragmentary dedicatory inscription, conserved in the British Museum (''A Guide to the Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the British Museum'' 84).</ref> and was designed and constructed from around 550 BC by the Cretan [[architect]] [[Chersiphron]] and his son [[Metagenes]]. It was 115&nbsp;m (377&nbsp;ft) long and 46&nbsp;m (151&nbsp;ft) wide, supposedly the first Greek temple built of marble. Its [[peripteral]] columns stood some 13&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the ''[[cella]]'' that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood [[Cult image|cult statue]] was sculpted by Endoios,<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], 16.79.213-16; Pliny's source was the Roman [[Mucianus]], who thought that the cult image by an \"Endoios\" was extremely ancient, however. Endoios' name appears in late 7th-century Attic inscriptions, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] notes works attributed to him. Most importantly, the Ephesians of Mucianus' time maintained the tradition that a particular sculptor had created the remade image {{Harv|LiDonnici|1992|p=398}}.</ref> and a ''[[naiskos]]'' to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.\n\n===Foundation deposit===\n[[File:Triti, Phanes, 625-600 BC, Ionia - 301224.jpg|thumb|The earliest known inscribed [[coin]]age, from the foundation deposit of the Temple of Athena: [[electrum]] coin of [[Phanes (coin issuer)|Phanes]] from [[Ephesus#Archaic period|Ephesus]], 625-600 BC.

[[Pliny the Elder]], seemingly unaware of the ancient continuity of the sacred site, claims that the new temple's architects chose to build it on marshy ground as a precaution against earthquakes.\n\nThe temple became an important attraction, visited by merchants, kings, and sightseers, many of whom paid homage to Artemis in the form of [[jewelry]] and various goods. It also offered sanctuary to those fleeing persecution or punishment, a tradition linked in myth to the Amazons who twice fled there seeking the goddess's protection from punishment, firstly by [[Dionysus]] and later, by [[Heracles]].\n\n===Destruction===\nIn 356 BC, the temple was destroyed in a vainglorious act of arson by a man, [[Herostratus]], who set fire to the wooden roof-beams, seeking fame at any cost; thus the term ''[[Herostratus#In language|herostratic fame]]''.<ref>Valerius Maximus, Memorable deeds and sayings, 8. 14. 5: \"A man was found to plan the burning of the temple of Ephesian Diana so that through the destruction of this most beautiful building his name might be spread through the whole world.\"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/8*.html#14.ext.5 Valerius Maximus, VIII.14.ext.5]</ref> For this outrage, the Ephesians sentenced the perpetrator to death and [[damnatio memoriae|forbade anyone from mentioning his name]]; but [[Theopompus]] later noted it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=William|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology|year=1849|pages=439|url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1547.html|accessdate=July 21, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202193125/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1547.html|archivedate=February 2, 2007}}</ref> In Greek and Roman historical tradition, the temple's destruction coincided with the birth of [[Alexander the Great]] (around 20/21 July 356 BC).

Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of [[Apelles]]' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', 35\u201393.</ref> In the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], the emperor [[Commodus]] lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1972|p=18}}, citing Xenophon for marriage-broking at the Ephesian ''Artemesia''.</ref>\n\n==Ephesian Artemis==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =  \n | image1    = Artemis Efes Museum.JPG\n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = The Lady of Ephesus, 1st century AD, [[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]]\n | image2    = ArtemisEphesus.jpg\n | width2    = 190\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = An 18th-century [[engraving]] of a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period ''[[xoanon]]''\n }}\nFrom the Greek point of view, the Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess [[Artemis]].

It was located in [[Ephesus]] (near the modern town of [[Sel\u00e7uk]] in present-day [[Turkey]]). It was completely rebuilt twice, once after a devastating flood and three hundred years later after an act of arson, and in its final form was one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

[[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'', attributed it to the [[Amazons]]. In the 7th century BC, it was destroyed by a flood. Its reconstruction, in more grandiose form, began around 550 BC, under [[Chersiphron]], the Cretan [[architect]], and his son [[Metagenes]]. The project was funded by [[Croesus]] of [[Lydia]], and took 10 years to complete. This version of the temple was destroyed in 356 BC by [[Herostratus]] in an act of [[arson]].\n\nThe next, greatest and last form of the temple, funded by the Ephesians themselves, is described in [[Antipater of Sidon]]'s list of the world's Seven Wonders:\n<blockquote>I have set eyes on the wall of lofty [[Babylon]] on which is a road for chariots, and the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus by the Alpheus]], and the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon|hanging gardens]], and the [[Colossus of Rhodes|colossus of the Sun]], and the huge labour of the [[Egyptian pyramids|high pyramids]], and the vast [[Mausoleum of Mausolus|tomb of Mausolus]]; but when I saw the house of Artemis that mounted to the clouds, those other marvels lost their brilliancy, and I said, \"Lo, apart from Olympus, the Sun never looked on aught so grand\".<ref>Antipater, ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' IX.58.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Location and history==\n[[File:Temple of Artemis.jpg|thumb|alt=imaginary Temple of Artemis 16th-century hand-colored engraving by Martin Heemskerck|The fame of the Temple of Artemis was known in the [[Renaissance]], as demonstrated in this imagined portrayal of the temple in a 16th-century hand-colored engraving by [[Martin Heemskerck]].]]\n\nThe Temple of Artemis was located near the ancient city of Ephesus, about {{convert|75|km}} south from the modern port city of [[\u0130zmir]], in Turkey.

[[Callimachus]], in his ''Hymn to Artemis'' attributed the earliest ''temenos'' at Ephesus to the [[Amazons]], whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image (''bretas'') of Artemis, their matron goddess. Pausanias says that [[Pindar]] believed the temple's founding Amazons to have been involved with the siege at Athens. [[Tacitus]] also believed in the Amazon foundation, however Pausanias believed the temple predated the Amazons.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria | last2=Chesler | first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title=Wonder Woman | publisher=Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn=0-03-005376-5 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wonderwoman00mars }}</ref>\n\n[[Modern archaeology]] cannot confirm Callimachus's Amazons, but Pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded.

Its [[peripteral]] columns stood some 13&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) high, in double rows that formed a wide ceremonial passage around the ''[[cella]]'' that housed the goddess's cult image. Thirty-six of these columns were, according to Pliny, decorated by carvings in relief. A new ebony or blackened grapewood [[Cult image|cult statue]] was sculpted by Endoios,<ref>[[Pliny's Natural History]], 16.79.213-16; Pliny's source was the Roman [[Mucianus]], who thought that the cult image by an \"Endoios\" was extremely ancient, however. Endoios' name appears in late 7th-century Attic inscriptions, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] notes works attributed to him. Most importantly, the Ephesians of Mucianus' time maintained the tradition that a particular sculptor had created the remade image {{Harv|LiDonnici|1992|p=398}}.</ref> and a ''[[naiskos]]'' to house it was erected east of the open-air altar.\n\n===Foundation deposit===\n[[File:Triti, Phanes, 625-600 BC, Ionia - 301224.jpg|thumb|The earliest known inscribed [[coin]]age, from the foundation deposit of the Temple of Athena: [[electrum]] coin of [[Phanes (coin issuer)|Phanes]] from [[Ephesus#Archaic period|Ephesus]], 625-600 BC.

The Ephesians considered her theirs, and resented any foreign claims to her protection. Once Persia ousted and replaced their Lydian overlord [[Croesus]], the Ephesians played down his contribution to the Temple's restoration. On the whole, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] dealt fairly with Ephesus, but removed some religious artifacts from Artemis' Temple to [[Sardis]] and brought Persian priests into her Ephesian cult; this was not forgiven.<ref>{{Harvnb|LiDonnici|1992|p=401}}.</ref> When Alexander conquered the Persians, his offer to finance the Temple's second rebuilding was politely but firmly refused.<ref>The intended offering might have included a divine statue of Alexander himself, or simply an inscription commemorating his subsidy as a gift to the Goddess, with himself as her particular protege.

It was part of a definitively Greek political and cultural identity, essential to the economic life of the region, and an excellent opportunity for young, unmarried Greeks of both sexes to seek out marriage partners. Games, contests and theatrical performances were held in the goddess's name, and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes her procession as a magnificent crowd-puller; it was shown in one of [[Apelles]]' best paintings, which depicted the goddess's image carried through the streets and surrounded by maidens.<ref>Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', 35\u201393.</ref> In the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], the emperor [[Commodus]] lent his name to the festival games, and might have sponsored them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1972|p=18}}, citing Xenophon for marriage-broking at the Ephesian ''Artemesia''.</ref>\n\n==Ephesian Artemis==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =  \n | image1    = Artemis Efes Museum.JPG\n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = The Lady of Ephesus, 1st century AD, [[Ephesus Archaeological Museum]]\n | image2    = ArtemisEphesus.jpg\n | width2    = 190\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = An 18th-century [[engraving]] of a Roman marble copy of a Greek replica of a lost Geometric period ''[[xoanon]]''\n }}\nFrom the Greek point of view, the Ephesian Artemis is a distinctive form of their goddess [[Artemis]]. In Greek cult and myth, Artemis is the twin of [[Apollo]], a virgin huntress who supplanted the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Selene]] as goddess of the [[Moon]]. At Ephesus, a goddess whom the Greeks associated with Artemis was venerated in an archaic, pre-Hellenic [[cult image]]<ref name=\"auto1\">The iconic images have been most thoroughly assembled by Robert Fleischer, ''Artemis von Ephesos und der erwandte Kultstatue von Anatolien und Syrien'' EPRO '''35''' (Leiden: Brill) 1973.</ref> that was carved of wood (a ''[[xoanon]]'') and kept decorated with jewelry. The features are most similar to Near-Eastern and Egyptian deities, and least similar to Greek ones. The body and legs are enclosed within a tapering pillar-like [[Term (architecture)|term]], from which the goddess' feet protrude. On the coins minted at Ephesus, the goddess wears a [[mural crown]] (like a city's walls), an attribute of [[Cybele]] as a protector of cities (see ''[[polos]]'').<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n[[File:Fontana di Diana Efesina-Tivoli, Villa d'Este.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', at Villa d'Este, Tivoli, Lazio, Italy|Traditional many-breasted interpretation in a 16th-century fountain of ''Diana Efesina'', [[Villa d'Este]], [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], [[Italy]]]]\nThe traditional interpretation of the oval objects covering the upper part of the Ephesian Artemis is that they represent multiple breasts, symbolizing her fertility. This interpretation began in late antiquity and resulted in designations of the Ephesian goddess as ''Diana Efesia Multimammia'' and other related descriptions.<ref name=Nielsen/> This interpretation was rooted in [[Minucius Felix]] and [[Jerome]]'s Christian attacks on pagan popular religion, and modern scholarship has cast doubt on the traditional interpretation that the statue depicts a many-breasted goddess. Evidence suggests that the oval objects were not intended to depict part of the goddess' anatomy at all. In some versions of the statue, the goddess' skin has been painted black (likely to emulate the aged wood of the original), while her clothes and regalia, including the so-called \"breasts\", were left unpainted or cast in different colors.<ref name=Nielsen/> Robert Fleischer suggested that instead of breasts, the oval objects were decorations that would have been hung ceremonially on the original wood statue (possibly eggs or the scrotal sacs of sacrificed bulls<ref>{{cite journal |last=Seiterle |title=Artemis: die Grosse G\u00f6ttin von Ephesos |journal=Antike Welt |volume=10 |year=1979 |pages=3\u201316 }} accepted in the 1980s by [[Walter Burkert]] and Brita Alroth, among others, criticised and rejected by Robert Fleischer, but widely popularized.</ref>), and which were incorporated as carved features on later copies.<ref name=Nielsen/> The \"breasts\" of the Lady of Ephesus, it now appears, were likely based on [[amber]] gourd-shaped drops, elliptical in cross-section and drilled for hanging, that were rediscovered in the archaeological excavations of 1987\u20131988. These objects remained in place where the ancient wooden statue of the goddess had been caught by an 8th-century flood. This form of jewelry, then, had already been developed by the [[Geometric Period]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fleischer |title=Neues zur kleinasiatischen Kultstatue |journal=Arch\u00e4ologischer Anzeiger |volume=98 |year=1983 |pages=81\u201393 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bammer|1990|p=153}}.</ref>\n\nOn the coins she rests either arm on a staff formed of entwined [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] or of a stack of ''[[Ouroboros|ouroboroi]]'', the eternal serpent with its tail in its mouth. In some accounts, the Lady of Ephesus was attended by eunuch priests called \"Megabyzoi\"; this could have been a proper name or a title. The practise of ritual self-emasculation as qualification to serve a deity is usually identified with Cybele's eunuch mendicant priests, the [[Galli]]. The Megabyzoi of Ephesian Artemis were assisted by young, virgin girls ([[kore (sculpture)|korai]]).<ref>[[Strabo]], ''Geographica'', 14.1.23; sometimes the existence of a college is disputed and rather, a succession of priests given the title of \"Megabyzos\" is preferred.

[[Kaley Cuoco]], [[Amy Davidson]], and [[Martin Spanjers]] co-starred as their teenage kids: Bridget, Kerry, and Rory Hennessy, respectively. The series ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 17, 2002 to April 15, 2005. The first season focused on Paul being left in charge of the children after Cate takes a full-time job as a nurse, with comedic emphasis on his often strict rules concerning his daughters and dating. The series' name and premise were derived from the book ''8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter'' by [[W. Bruce Cameron]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/2300-500150_162-572886.html \"John Ritter\"]. [[CBS News]]. Page 1 of 17. Retrieved October 4, 2012.</ref>\n\nWhile ''8 Simple Rules'' was renewed for a second season and production had begun, [[John Ritter#Death|Ritter's sudden death]] in September 2003 left the series in an uncertain position. After a hiatus, the series returned and continued without Ritter, with the producers having decided that his character Paul would also die. [[James Garner]] and [[David Spade]] later joined the main cast as, respectively, Cate's father Jim Egan and her nephew C.J. Barnes. After three seasons, ABC cancelled ''8 Simple Rules'' in May 2005 due to low ratings.\n\n==Premise==\nThe rules are:\n# Use your hands on my daughter and you'll lose them after.\n# You make her cry, I make you cry.\n# Safe sex is a myth. Anything you try will be hazardous to your health.\n# Bring her home late, there's no next date.\n# If you pull into my driveway and honk, you better be dropping off a package because you're sure not picking anything up (Alternative rule #5: Only delivery men honk. Dates ring the doorbell. Once.)\n# No complaining while you're waiting for her. If you're bored, change my oil.\n# If your pants hang off your hips, I'll gladly secure them with my staple gun.\n# Dates must be in crowded public places. You want romance? Read a book.\n\nThe third season (after Ritter's death) took a creative turn, revolving more around cousin C.J. ([[David Spade]]) and grandfather Jim ([[James Garner]]), than the immediate Hennessy family, more specifically not revolving around the raising of the Hennessy children. After the novelty of newly added ensemble characters wore off, the series returned to its original format.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of 8 Simple Rules episodes}}\n{{:List of 8 Simple Rules episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* {{anchor|Paul Hennessy}}Paul Hennessy, portrayed by [[John Ritter]] (2002\u20132003), is a former sports writer who worked from home as a Lifestyle columnist described as being \"the master of the [[double standard]]\" and a \"Psycho-Dad\", as well as a perceived hypocrite who often embarrasses his children, even if he wants what is best for them.

Cate starts dating her kids' high-school principal, Ed Gibb (portrayed by [[Adam Arkin]]), towards the end of season three. During her teens, she was more or less just as popular, scheming, and rebellious as Bridget, thus she is usually the first to notice when Bridget is up to something. She received her middle name \"Stinky\" as a result of her father promising his best friend he would name one of his children after him after accidentally stabbing him with a bayonet while they were drunk in [[Korea]]; to hide this, she claims that the S stands for \"Stacy.\"\n* {{anchor|Bridget Hennessy}}Bridget Erin \"Beach\" Hennessy, portrayed by [[Kaley Cuoco]], is the beautiful, ditzy oldest child.

Kerry is negative about most things and sarcastic, often making snide remarks about essentially everybody, though less to her mother. She is also a passionate activist who cares about [[animal rights]]. She lost her [[virginity]] to Bruno (her boyfriend in Europe) later in the third season. She is often annoyed at her sister and is easily upset, yet frequently the two girls team up against their parents' authority or at the expense of their younger rascal brother. Kerry is also very artistic and keeps a sketchbook. She is the smart child, but often shows naivet\u00e9. After she starts dating Bridget's popular ex-boyfriend Kyle, her own popularity increases, and she begins to act a little more like her older sister.\n* {{anchor|Rory Hennessy}}Rory Joseph Hennessy, portrayed by [[Martin Spanjers]], is Cate and Paul's son and their youngest child. He constantly tattles{{huh|date=September 2019}} on his sisters, getting twisted pleasure out of it, as per his remark when he had stirred the pot to his liking: \"This is just like my birthday!\" Usually he waits until his sisters already commit an infraction, then he tattles to see his father explode. Rory is his father's favorite, being the boy. He becomes involved in money-making schemes with C.J. He is commonly seen playing in the living room and mentions wanting a monkey, which he once had by trading some of his father's baseball cards; the monkey was later traded for a guitar, which was short-lived, as Rory annoyed the family with it. He also delights in showing his friends the private aspects of his sister Bridget's life, mentioning once that his friends looted Bridget's underwear drawer. Rory was hit hard by Paul's death and ended up punching a hole in his wall out of anger, cutting his hand. He covered for it saying he burnt it taking a casserole out of the oven. After he enters high school, Rory matures, leaving C.J. to be the [[wikt:wisecrack|wisecrack]]er of the family. However, Rory still had his moments.\n* {{anchor|Jim Egan}}Jim Egan, portrayed by [[James Garner]] (2003\u20132005), is Cate's father. Jim served in the [[Korean War]] and is proud of his service (he angers whenever it is mentioned as a \"police action\"). He is very protective of the family. He often sneaks away to smoke tobacco. He is divorced, having formerly resided in Florida before moving into Cate's basement, and often used to try to beat C.J. with his cane. He takes pride in C.J.'s success as a teacher. When C.J.'s biological father comes to visit his son, Jim feels out of place and angry because he prepared a car for C.J. after he becomes a full-fledged teacher, but then Mr. Barnes gives C.J. a sports car.\n* {{anchor|C.J. Barnes}}C.J. Barnes, portrayed by [[David Spade]] (2004\u20132005), is Cate's nephew. He was once in the Army and claims to have studied aerial photography during the [[Gulf War]], and to have received a [[Purple Heart]] in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is a teacher at the school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he was ashamed that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have touched it in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).\n\n===Recurring===\n* Kyle, portrayed by [[Billy Aaron Brown]], is Bridget's \u2013 and later Kerry's \u2013 boyfriend. He is often seen spending time with Rory when not with either Kerry or Bridget. His father, Tommy, used to work with Paul.\n* Ed Gibb, portrayed by [[Adam Arkin]], is the principal of the local high school.  He and Cate knew each other in high school, and even dated. When discussing it, their account of their first romantic encounter varied, with either believing they had more self-control and admitting to the other that they liked the other as just friends. Despite this, they have had some very intimate moments.\n* Coach Scott, portrayed by [[Dan Cortese]], is a high-school coach on whom Bridget had a [[Puppy love|crush]]. He likes Cate, and Cate initially likes him, but then discovers Bridget's crush, which causes her to deny Scott's romantic advances towards her.\n* Jenna Sharpe, portrayed by [[Nikki Danielle Moore]] (2003\u20132005), is Paul's boss Nick's daughter, and one of Bridget's rivals, who later becomes her friend. She has a younger sister, Rachael (Nicole Mansour), who is a friend of Kerry.\n* Missy Kleinfeld, portrayed by [[Daniella Monet]] (2003\u20132004), is Rory's love interest in season two. She has a sister, Sissy (Elena Lyons), who likes C.J.\n* Jeremy, portrayed by [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] (2004), is Bridget's tutor and eventual boyfriend. He is considered a [[nerd]] at school, and because of this, Bridget at first denies her interest in him by saying it was only because he was her tutor.\n* Anthony W., portrayed by [[Cole Williams]] (2002\u20132003), is a student in Bridget's class. He was a white boy who spoke like a black [[rapping|rapper]], often resulting in confusion. In \"Cool Parent\",  he is shown to play [[lacrosse]].\n* Maggie Barnes (n\u00e9e Egan), portrayed by [[Cybill Shepherd]], is Cate's sister and C.J.'s mother. Maggie shares the same sensitive, moody nature as Kerry. However, it appears (from a conversation between Ed Gibb and Cate) that Cate was the smarter one, as well as being more popular.\n* Fred Doyle, portrayed by [[John Ratzenberger]], is a persistent and over-friendly neighbor of the Hennessys, and husband of Mary Ellen (portrayed originally by [[Shelley Long]] and then by [[Cindy Williams]]). He is the father of Donald \"Donny\" Doyle, who has dated Bridget for some time. Fred was the head of the [[neighborhood watch]], and  his family is revealed as religious when Bridget claims she is going over for Bible study in an episode in season two.\n* Mrs. Crupp, portrayed by [[Suzy Nakamura]], is a math teacher from school.\n* Damian, portrayed by [[Paul Wesley]], is Bridget's ex-boyfriend. He appeared in two episodes.\n* Lacey/Lacy, portrayed by [[Kala Savage]] (2003\u20132004),  a sometimes friend of Bridget, appeared in three episodes.\n* Laura, portrayed by [[Suzanne Pleshette]], is Cate's mother.\n\n== Production ==\n\n===Ritter's death===\nThe first three episodes of the series' second season had been completed when Ritter experienced discomfort during a rehearsal on the afternoon of September 11, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-ritter-legacy-lives-in-ritter-rules/|title=John Ritter Legacy Lives in \"Ritter Rules\"|date=March 17, 2010|publisher=cbsnews.com}}</ref>  Crew members took him to a nearby hospital, [[Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center]], where he was misdiagnosed as having a [[heart attack]] and as a result, his condition had worsened when physicians later diagnosed him with an [[aortic dissection]], and he passed away that evening at the age of 54.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/22989512#.UpxHNOI8rIU|title=John Ritter's widow talks about wrongful death suit|last=Considine|first=Bob|date=February 4, 2008|publisher=today.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,628262_2,00.html|title=John Ritter: 1948\u20132003|date=September 18, 2003|publisher=people.com|page=2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/actor/john-ritter|title=John Ritter|website=Biography}}</ref> Following Ritter's death, ABC announced that ''8 Simple Rules'' would continue after a hiatus, and would incorporate the death of his character. The three new episodes that Ritter completed were aired with Sagal introducing them.\n\n''8 Simple Rules'' returned two months after Ritter's death with a one-hour episode, \"Goodbye\", which was turned into a tribute to Ritter's character. Subsequent episodes dealt with the family's reaction to his death and how they moved on from it. The first four post-Ritter episodes were shot without a live audience with [[James Garner]] and [[Suzanne Pleshette]] guest-starring as Cate's strict parents and [[David Spade]] guest-starring as Cate's wayward nephew, C.J. Barnes. Garner and Spade later received starring roles in order to fill the void left by Ritter for the remainder of the series' run.\n\n===Third season and cancellation===\nBefore Ritter's death, ''8 Simple Rules'' ranked 42nd in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. After Ritter's death, it had slipped to 50th, but was renewed for a third season, in which ABC moved the series to Friday at 8:00&nbsp;pm as part of its ''[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]'' comedy line-up. The series' creator and showrunner, Tracy Gamble, left the series for a time over creative differences prior to the third season, but he later returned as a consulting producer midway through the third season. Gamble was replaced by Judd Pillot and John Peaslee, who had performed the same role in the final season of Spade's sitcom, ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Show Must Go On: How the Deaths of Lead Actors Have Affected Television Series|last=Snauffer|first=Douglas|publisher=McFarland|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7864-3295-0|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=17}}</ref>  The series plunged to 94th in the ratings. Even before the third-season finale's airing, rumors began circulating that ''8 Simple Rules'' was facing cancellation due to Ritter's death and poor ratings. The Friday night \"death slot\" ratings took their toll on ''8 Simple Rules''. The third-season finale was not aired for May [[sweeps]]. The finale received a 3.9/8 rating share which gave ABC a third-place finish behind [[NBC]]'s ''[[Dateline NBC|Dateline]]'' (5.8/11) and [[CBS]]'s ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'' (4.9/10), which starred Ritter's son, [[Jason Ritter|Jason]].

[[Kaley Cuoco]], [[Amy Davidson]], and [[Martin Spanjers]] co-starred as their teenage kids; Bridget, Kerry, and Rory Hennessy. The series ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 17, 2002 to April 15, 2005. The first season focused on Paul being left in charge of the children after Cate takes a full-time job as a nurse, with comedic emphasis on his often strict rules concerning his daughters and dating. The series' name and premise were derived from the book ''8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter'' by [[W. Bruce Cameron]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/2300-500150_162-572886.html \"John Ritter\"]. [[CBS News]]. Page 1 of 17. Retrieved October 4, 2012.</ref>\n\nWhile ''8 Simple Rules'' was renewed for a second season and production had begun, [[John Ritter#Death|Ritter's sudden death]] in September 2003 left the series in an uncertain position. After a hiatus, the series returned and continued without Ritter, with the producers having decided that his character Paul would also die. [[James Garner]] and [[David Spade]] later joined the main cast as, respectively, Cate's father Jim Egan and her nephew C.J. Barnes. After three seasons, ABC cancelled ''8 Simple Rules'' in May 2005 due to low ratings.\n\n==Premise==\nThe rules are:\n# Use your hands on my daughter and you'll lose them after.\n# You make her cry, I make you cry.\n# Safe sex is a myth. Anything you try will be hazardous to your health.\n# Bring her home late, there's no next date.\n# If you pull into my driveway and honk, you better be dropping off a package because you're sure not picking anything up (Alternative rule #5: Only delivery men honk. Dates ring the doorbell. Once.)\n# No complaining while you're waiting for her. If you're bored, change my oil.\n# If your pants hang off your hips, I'll gladly secure them with my staple gun.\n# Dates must be in crowded public places. You want romance? Read a book.\n\nThe third season (after Ritter's death) took a creative turn, revolving more around cousin C.J. ([[David Spade]]) and grandfather Jim ([[James Garner]]), than the immediate Hennessy family, more specifically not revolving around the raising of the Hennessy children. After the novelty of newly added ensemble characters wore off, the series returned to its original format.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of 8 Simple Rules episodes}}\n{{:List of 8 Simple Rules episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* {{anchor|Paul Hennessy}}Paul Hennessy, portrayed by [[John Ritter]] (2002\u20132003), is a former sports writer who worked from home as a Lifestyle columnist described as being \"the master of the [[double standard]]\" and a \"Psycho-Dad\", as well as a perceived hypocrite who often embarrasses his children, even if he wants what is best for them. Nonetheless, he loves his children, and wants them to have happy futures. Paul dies in the second season because of [[aortic dissection]] (the same ailment that claimed Ritter's life). He died in a store while buying milk.\n* {{anchor|Cate S. Hennessy}}Cate S. Hennessy (n\u00e9e Egan), portrayed by [[Katey Sagal]], is the wife, mother, nurse, and easily the most sane and composed person in the family. She takes a nursing job at the kids' school so she can work standard hours and spend more time with the kids. Cate starts dating her kids' high-school principal, Ed Gibb (portrayed by [[Adam Arkin]]), towards the end of season three. During her teens, she was more or less just as popular, scheming, and rebellious as Bridget, thus she is usually the first to notice when Bridget is up to something. She received her middle name \"Stinky\" as a result of her father promising his best friend he would name one of his children after him after accidentally stabbing him with a bayonet while they were drunk in [[Korea]]; to hide this, she claims that the S stands for \"Stacy.\"\n* {{anchor|Bridget Hennessy}}Bridget Erin \"Beach\" Hennessy, portrayed by [[Kaley Cuoco]], is the beautiful, ditzy oldest child. She is depicted as a [[Blonde stereotype|stereotypical blonde]], a popular bombshell who is preoccupied with her looks, teenaged boys, and little else. She sometimes displays intelligence or profundity, but these are initially few and far between, yet often poignant. Her favorite book is [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''.<ref>{{cite episode| title=Drummer Boy (part 2)| series=8 Simple Rules|network=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|airdate= 2003-02-11| season=1| number=18}}</ref> After her father dies, she begins to steadily mature. Bridget initially felt guilty about Paul's death because the last words she ever spoke to him were \"I hate you\" after arguing with him earlier that morning, because he said no to her using the car. In season two, Bridget was revealed to have been conceived on a beach.<ref>{{cite episode| title=Sex Ed| series=8 Simple Rules|network=ABC| airdate=2003-09-30| season=2| number=2}}</ref>\n* {{anchor|Kerry Hennessy}}Kerry \"Care Bear\" Hennessy, portrayed by [[Amy Davidson]], is the middle child, but is not very happy about it. She is often seen as unattractive when compared to her beautiful older sister, Bridget. She was accused by Bridget of stealing her (ex-) boyfriend, Kyle, though clearly Bridget's actions drove Kyle away. Kerry is negative about most things and sarcastic, often making snide remarks about essentially everybody, though less to her mother. She is also a passionate activist who cares about [[animal rights]]. She lost her [[virginity]] to Bruno (her boyfriend in Europe) later in the third season. She is often annoyed at her sister and is easily upset, yet frequently the two girls team up against their parents' authority or at the expense of their younger rascal brother. Kerry is also very artistic and keeps a sketchbook. She is the smart child, but often shows naivet\u00e9. After she starts dating Bridget's popular ex-boyfriend Kyle, her own popularity increases, and she begins to act a little more like her older sister.\n* {{anchor|Rory Hennessy}}Rory Joseph Hennessy, portrayed by [[Martin Spanjers]], is Cate and Paul's son and their youngest child. He constantly tattles{{huh|date=September 2019}} on his sisters, getting twisted pleasure out of it, as per his remark when he had stirred the pot to his liking: \"This is just like my birthday!\" Usually he waits until his sisters already commit an infraction, then he tattles to see his father explode. Rory is his father's favorite, being the boy. He becomes involved in money-making schemes with C.J. He is commonly seen playing in the living room and mentions wanting a monkey, which he once had by trading some of his father's baseball cards; the monkey was later traded for a guitar, which was short-lived, as Rory annoyed the family with it. He also delights in showing his friends the private aspects of his sister Bridget's life, mentioning once that his friends looted Bridget's underwear drawer. Rory was hit hard by Paul's death and ended up punching a hole in his wall out of anger, cutting his hand. He covered for it saying he burnt it taking a casserole out of the oven. After he enters high school, Rory matures, leaving C.J. to be the [[wikt:wisecrack|wisecrack]]er of the family. However, Rory still had his moments.\n* {{anchor|Jim Egan}}Jim Egan, portrayed by [[James Garner]] (2003\u20132005), is Cate's father. Jim served in the [[Korean War]] and is proud of his service (he angers whenever it is mentioned as a \"police action\"). He is very protective of the family. He often sneaks away to smoke tobacco. He is divorced, having formerly resided in Florida before moving into Cate's basement, and often used to try to beat C.J. with his cane. He takes pride in C.J.'s success as a teacher. When C.J.'s biological father comes to visit his son, Jim feels out of place and angry because he prepared a car for C.J. after he becomes a full-fledged teacher, but then Mr. Barnes gives C.J. a sports car.\n* {{anchor|C.J. Barnes}}C.J. Barnes, portrayed by [[David Spade]] (2004\u20132005), is Cate's nephew. He was once in the Army and claims to have studied aerial photography during the [[Gulf War]], and to have received a [[Purple Heart]] in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is a teacher at the school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he was ashamed that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have touched it in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).\n\n===Recurring===\n* Kyle, portrayed by [[Billy Aaron Brown]], is Bridget's \u2013 and later Kerry's \u2013 boyfriend. He is often seen spending time with Rory when not with either Kerry or Bridget. His father, Tommy, used to work with Paul.\n* Ed Gibb, portrayed by [[Adam Arkin]], is the principal of the local high school.  He and Cate knew each other in high school, and even dated. When discussing it, their account of their first romantic encounter varied, with either believing they had more self-control and admitting to the other that they liked the other as just friends. Despite this, they have had some very intimate moments.\n* Coach Scott, portrayed by [[Dan Cortese]], is a high-school coach on whom Bridget had a [[Puppy love|crush]]. He likes Cate, and Cate initially likes him, but then discovers Bridget's crush, which causes her to deny Scott's romantic advances towards her.\n* Jenna Sharpe, portrayed by [[Nikki Danielle Moore]] (2003\u20132005), is Paul's boss Nick's daughter, and one of Bridget's rivals, who later becomes her friend. She has a younger sister, Rachael (Nicole Mansour), who is a friend of Kerry.\n* Missy Kleinfeld, portrayed by [[Daniella Monet]] (2003\u20132004), is Rory's love interest in season two. She has a sister, Sissy (Elena Lyons), who likes C.J.\n* Jeremy, portrayed by [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]] (2004), is Bridget's tutor and eventual boyfriend. He is considered a [[nerd]] at school, and because of this, Bridget at first denies her interest in him by saying it was only because he was her tutor.\n* Anthony W., portrayed by [[Cole Williams]] (2002\u20132003), is a student in Bridget's class. He was a white boy who spoke like a black [[rapping|rapper]], often resulting in confusion. In \"Cool Parent\",  he is shown to play [[lacrosse]].\n* Maggie Barnes (n\u00e9e Egan), portrayed by [[Cybill Shepherd]], is Cate's sister and C.J.'s mother. Maggie shares the same sensitive, moody nature as Kerry. However, it appears (from a conversation between Ed Gibb and Cate) that Cate was the smarter one, as well as being more popular.\n* Fred Doyle, portrayed by [[John Ratzenberger]], is a persistent and over-friendly neighbor of the Hennessys, and husband of Mary Ellen (portrayed originally by [[Shelley Long]] and then by [[Cindy Williams]]). He is the father of Donald \"Donny\" Doyle, who has dated Bridget for some time. Fred was the head of the [[neighborhood watch]], and  his family is revealed as religious when Bridget claims she is going over for Bible study in an episode in season two.\n* Mrs. Crupp, portrayed by [[Suzy Nakamura]], is a math teacher from school.\n* Damian, portrayed by [[Paul Wesley]], is Bridget's ex-boyfriend. He appeared in two episodes.\n* Lacey/Lacy, portrayed by [[Kala Savage]] (2003\u20132004),  a sometimes friend of Bridget, appeared in three episodes.\n* Laura, portrayed by [[Suzanne Pleshette]], is Cate's mother.\n\n== Production ==\n\n===Ritter's death===\nThe first three episodes of the series' second season had been completed when Ritter experienced discomfort during a rehearsal on the afternoon of September 11, 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-ritter-legacy-lives-in-ritter-rules/|title=John Ritter Legacy Lives in \"Ritter Rules\"|date=March 17, 2010|publisher=cbsnews.com}}</ref>  Crew members took him to a nearby hospital, [[Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center]], where he was misdiagnosed as having a [[heart attack]] and as a result, his condition had worsened when physicians later diagnosed him with an [[aortic dissection]], and he passed away that evening at the age of 54.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/22989512#.UpxHNOI8rIU|title=John Ritter's widow talks about wrongful death suit|last=Considine|first=Bob|date=February 4, 2008|publisher=today.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,628262_2,00.html|title=John Ritter: 1948\u20132003|date=September 18, 2003|publisher=people.com|page=2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/actor/john-ritter|title=John Ritter|website=Biography}}</ref> Following Ritter's death, ABC announced that ''8 Simple Rules'' would continue after a hiatus, and would incorporate the death of his character. The three new episodes that Ritter completed were aired with Sagal introducing them.\n\n''8 Simple Rules'' returned two months after Ritter's death with a one-hour episode, \"Goodbye\", which was turned into a tribute to Ritter's character. Subsequent episodes dealt with the family's reaction to his death and how they moved on from it. The first four post-Ritter episodes were shot without a live audience with [[James Garner]] and [[Suzanne Pleshette]] guest-starring as Cate's strict parents and [[David Spade]] guest-starring as Cate's wayward nephew, C.J. Barnes. Garner and Spade later received starring roles in order to fill the void left by Ritter for the remainder of the series' run.\n\n===Third season and cancellation===\nBefore Ritter's death, ''8 Simple Rules'' ranked 42nd in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. After Ritter's death, it had slipped to 50th, but was renewed for a third season, in which ABC moved the series to Friday at 8:00&nbsp;pm as part of its ''[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]'' comedy line-up. The series' creator and showrunner, Tracy Gamble, left the series for a time over creative differences prior to the third season, but he later returned as a consulting producer midway through the third season. Gamble was replaced by Judd Pillot and John Peaslee, who had performed the same role in the final season of Spade's sitcom, ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Show Must Go On: How the Deaths of Lead Actors Have Affected Television Series|last=Snauffer|first=Douglas|publisher=McFarland|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7864-3295-0|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=17}}</ref>  The series plunged to 94th in the ratings. Even before the third-season finale's airing, rumors began circulating that ''8 Simple Rules'' was facing cancellation due to Ritter's death and poor ratings. The Friday night \"death slot\" ratings took their toll on ''8 Simple Rules''. The third-season finale was not aired for May [[sweeps]]. The finale received a 3.9/8 rating share which gave ABC a third-place finish behind [[NBC]]'s ''[[Dateline NBC|Dateline]]'' (5.8/11) and [[CBS]]'s ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'' (4.9/10), which starred Ritter's son, [[Jason Ritter|Jason]]. Shortly afterwards, ABC officially cancelled ''8 Simple Rules'' in May 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/8-simple-rules-for-dating-my-teenage-daughter-last-episode/|title=8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter last episode|date=August 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Syndication ==\nWhile ''8 Simple Rules'' ratings were well above those of the surrounding [[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]] shows during its third season, ABC cancelled it due to the perceived inability to sell [[rerun]]s of the show into [[Television syndication|syndication]] (a fourth season would have given the show the [[100 episodes]] necessary to enter daily syndication).{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOn July 11, 2005 (less than two months after ABC officially cancelled it), [[The WB]] network announced it would air back-to-back repeats of all 76 episodes of ''8 Simple Rules'' from 4\u20135 p.m. as part of the replacement of [[Kids' WB]] with the more broad-audience [[The CW Daytime|Daytime WB]] block.

On February 8, 2010, the series was added back to ABC Family's weekday lineup, airing from 6-7PM/ET, replacing ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. After a few months of being absent on the channel, ''8 Simple Rules'' resumed airings on ABC Family at 7/6 c on select weekend mornings, beginning July 18, 2010. In mid-December 2012, ''8 Simple Rules''  was removed from ABC Family's weekday line-up, only to be added back in September 2013. The series was removed from the network's lineup in 2014.\n\nIn 2003, the show began airing in the UK on the [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel]], which was edited for children's viewing.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.disney.co.uk/disneychannel/showinfo/programmes/eight_rules| title=8 Simple Rules... for dating my teenage daughter| publisher=disney.co.uk| accessdate=August 22, 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315090041/http://www.disney.co.uk/DisneyChannel/showinfo/programmes/eight_rules/| archivedate=March 15, 2012| df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was picked up by [[ABC1 (UK)|ABC1]] which aired the show until the channel's closure in 2007.

The series was shown on both these channels full uncut, despite the fact it was shown pre-watershed (9.00 pm), although, the show was issued an age rating. On RT\u00c9 Two it was issued a '[[RT\u00c9 programme classifications#PS: Perental supervision|PS]]' rating and on TG4, a '12' rating.\n\nComedy Central UK obtained the rights to the show and started airing it in the UK on 12 June 2017.\n\n[[Israel]]i satellite provider [[yes (Israel)|yes]] has also carried the show, using its shortened title ''8 Simple Rules'' in [[Hebrew]] (\"8 \u05db\u05dc\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd\").\n\n==Home media==\nOn August 7, 2007, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] released Season 1 of ''8 Simple Rules'' on DVD in Region 1.

It is often expressed as a percentage, and is defined as the ratio of the [[standard deviation]]  <math>\\ \\sigma </math> to the [[mean]]  <math>\\ \\mu </math> (or its [[absolute value]], <math>| \\mu |</math>).  The CV or RSD is widely used in [[analytical chemistry]] to express the precision and repeatability of an [[assay]]. It is also commonly used in fields such as [[engineering]] or [[physics]] when doing quality assurance studies and [[ANOVA gauge R&R]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In addition, CV is utilized by economists and investors in [[economic model]]s.\n\n==Definition==\nThe coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation <math>\\ \\sigma </math> to the mean <math>\\ \\mu </math>, <math>c_{\\rm v} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}.</math><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgediction00ever_0|title=The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics|last=Everitt|first=Brian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0521593465|location=Cambridge, UK New York|url-access=registration}}</ref>\nIt shows the extent of variability in relation to the mean of the population.\nThe coefficient of variation should be computed only for data measured on a [[ratio scale]], that is, scales that have a meaningful zero and hence allow relative comparison of two measurements (ie division of one measurement by the other). The coefficient of variation may not have any meaning for data on an [[interval scale]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.graphpad.com/faq/viewfaq.cfm?faq=1089 | title=What is the difference between ordinal, interval and ratio variables?

On the other hand,  [[Kelvin]] temperature has a meaningful zero, the complete absence of thermal energy, and thus is a ratio scale. In plain language, it is meaningful to say that 20 Kelvin is twice as hot as 10 Kelvin, but only in this scale with a true absolute zero. While a standard deviation (SD) can be measured in Kelvin, Celsius, or Fahrenheit, the value computed is only applicable to that scale. Only the Kelvin scale can be used to compute a valid coefficient of variability.\n\nMeasurements that are [[log-normal]]ly distributed exhibit stationary CV; in contrast, SD varies depending upon the expected value of measurements.\n\nA more robust possibility is the [[quartile coefficient of dispersion]], half the [[interquartile range]] <math> {(Q_3 - Q_1)/2} </math> divided by the average of the quartiles (the [[midhinge]]), <math> {(Q_1 + Q_3)/2} </math>.\n\nIn most cases, a CV is computed for a single independent variable (e.g., a single factory product) with numerous, repeated measures of a dependent variable (e.g., error in the production process). However, data that are linear or even logarithmically non-linear and include a continuous range for the independent variable with sparse measurements across each value (e.g., scatter-plot) may be amenable to single CV calculation using a [[Maximum likelihood estimation|maximum-likelihood estimation]] approach.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Odic|first=Darko|last2=Im|first2=Hee Yeon|last3=Eisinger|first3=Robert|last4=Ly|first4=Ryan|last5=Halberda|first5=Justin|date=June 2016|title=PsiMLE: A maximum-likelihood estimation approach to estimating psychophysical scaling and variability more reliably, efficiently, and flexibly|journal=Behavior Research Methods|volume=48|issue=2|pages=445\u2013462|doi=10.3758/s13428-015-0600-5|issn=1554-3528|pmid=25987306}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\nA data set of [100, 100, 100] has constant values.  Its standard deviation is 0 and average is 100, giving the coefficient of variation as\n: 0 / 100 = 0\n\nA data set of [90, 100, 110] has more variability.  Its standard deviation is 10 and its average is 100, giving the coefficient of variation as\n: 10 / 100 = 0.1\n\nA data set of [1, 5, 6, 8, 10, 40, 65, 88] has still more variability. Its standard deviation is 32.9 and its average is 27.9, giving a coefficient of variation of\n: 32.9 / 27.9 = 1.18\n\n== Examples of misuse ==\nComparing coefficients of variation between parameters using relative units can result in differences that may not be real. If we compare the same set of temperatures in [[Celsius]] and [[Fahrenheit]] (both relative units, where [[kelvin]] and [[Rankine scale]] are their associated absolute values):\n\nCelsius: [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]\n\nFahrenheit: [32, 50, 68, 86, 104]\n\nThe [[Standard deviation#Sample standard deviation|sample standard deviations]] are 15.81 and 28.46, respectively. The CV of the first set is 15.81/20 = 79%. For the second set (which are the same temperatures) it is 28.46/68 = 42%.\n\nIf, for example, the data sets are temperature readings from two different sensors (a Celsius sensor and a Fahrenheit sensor) and you want to know which sensor is better by picking the one with the least variance, then you will be misled if you use CV. The problem here is that you have divided by a relative value rather than an absolute.\n\nComparing the same data set, now in absolute units:\n\nKelvin: [273.15, 283.15, 293.15, 303.15, 313.15]\n\nRankine: [491.67, 509.67, 527.67, 545.67, 563.67]\n\nThe [[Standard deviation#Sample standard deviation|sample standard deviations]] are still 15.81 and 28.46, respectively, because the standard deviation is not affected by a constant offset. The coefficients of variation, however, are now both equal to 5.39%.\n\nMathematically speaking, the coefficient of variation is not entirely linear.  That is, for a random variable <math>X</math>, the coefficient of variation of <math>aX+b</math> is equal to the coefficient of variation of <math>X</math> only when <math>b = 0</math>.  In the above example, Celsius can only be converted to Fahrenheit through a linear transformation of the form <math>ax+b</math> with <math>b \\neq 0</math>, whereas Kelvins can be converted to Rankines through a transformation of the form <math>ax</math>.\n\n==Estimation==\nWhen only a sample of data from a population is available, the population CV can be estimated using the ratio of the [[Standard deviation#Estimation|sample standard deviation]] <math>s \\,</math> to the sample mean <math>\\bar{x}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\widehat{c_{\\rm v}} = \\frac{s}{\\bar{x}}</math>\n\nBut this estimator, when applied to a small or moderately sized sample, tends to be too low: it is a [[biased estimator]].

This is often the case if the values do not originate from a ratio scale. \n* Unlike the standard deviation, it cannot be used directly to construct [[confidence interval]]s for the mean.\n* CVs are not an ideal index of the certainty of measurement when the number of replicates varies across samples because CV is invariant to the number of replicates while the certainty of the mean improves with increasing replicates. In this case, standard error in percent is suggested to be superior.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Dan|title=Improving qPCR telomere length assays: Controlling for well position effects increases statistical power|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2015|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22690|pmid=25757675|volume=27|issue=4|pages=570\u20135|pmc=4478151}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe coefficient of variation is also common in applied probability fields such as [[renewal theory]], [[queueing theory]], and [[reliability theory]].

Some formulas in these fields are expressed using the '''squared coefficient of variation''', often abbreviated SCV. In modeling, a variation of the CV is the CV(RMSD).  Essentially the CV(RMSD) replaces the standard deviation term with the [[RMSD|Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)]]. While many natural processes indeed show a correlation between the average value and the amount of variation around it, accurate sensor devices need to be designed in such a way that the coefficient of variation is close to zero, i.e., yielding a constant [[absolute error]] over their working range.\n\nIn [[actuarial science]], the CV is known as '''unitized risk'''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Broverman|first1=Samuel A.|title=Actex study manual, Course 1, Examination of the Society of Actuaries, Exam 1 of the Casualty Actuarial Society|date=2001|publisher=Actex Publications|location=Winsted, CT|isbn=9781566983969|page=104|edition=2001|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qd4PAQAAMAAJ&q=%22unitized+risk%22|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Industrial Solids Processing, CV is particularly important to measure the degree of homogeneity of a powder mixture.

On the other hand,  [[Kelvin]] temperature has a meaningful zero, the complete absence of thermal energy, and thus is a ratio scale. In plain language, it is meaningful to say that 20 Kelvin is twice as hot as 10 Kelvin, but only in this scale with a true absolute zero. While a standard deviation (SD) can be measured in Kelvin, Celsius, or Fahrenheit, the value computed is only applicable to that scale. Only the Kelvin scale can be used to compute a valid coefficient of variability.\n\nMeasurements that are [[log-normal]]ly distributed exhibit stationary CV; in contrast, SD varies depending upon the expected value of measurements.\n\nA more robust possibility is the [[quartile coefficient of dispersion]], half the [[interquartile range]] <math> {(Q_3 - Q_1)/2} </math> divided by the average of the quartiles (the [[midhinge]]), <math> {(Q_1 + Q_3)/2} </math>.\n\nIn most cases, a CV is computed for a single independent variable (e.g., a single factory product) with numerous, repeated measures of a dependent variable (e.g., error in the production process).

For the second set (which are the same temperatures) it is 28.46/68 = 42%.\n\nIf, for example, the data sets are temperature readings from two different sensors (a Celsius sensor and a Fahrenheit sensor) and you want to know which sensor is better by picking the one with the least variance, then you will be misled if you use CV. The problem here is that you have divided by a relative value rather than an absolute.\n\nComparing the same data set, now in absolute units:\n\nKelvin: [273.15, 283.15, 293.15, 303.15, 313.15]\n\nRankine: [491.67, 509.67, 527.67, 545.67, 563.67]\n\nThe [[Standard deviation#Sample standard deviation|sample standard deviations]] are still 15.81 and 28.46, respectively, because the standard deviation is not affected by a constant offset. The coefficients of variation, however, are now both equal to 5.39%.\n\nMathematically speaking, the coefficient of variation is not entirely linear.

If necessary, this can be derived from an estimate of <math>c_{\\rm v} \\,</math> or GCV by inverting the corresponding formula.\n\n==Comparison to standard deviation==\n\n===Advantages===\nThe coefficient of variation is useful because the standard deviation of data must always be understood in the context of the mean of the data. \nIn contrast, the actual value of the CV is independent of the unit in which the measurement has been taken, so it is a [[dimensionless number]]. \nFor comparison between data sets with different units or widely different means, one should use the coefficient of variation instead of the standard deviation.\n\n===Disadvantages===\n* When the mean value is close to zero, the coefficient of variation will approach infinity and is therefore sensitive to small changes in the mean. This is often the case if the values do not originate from a ratio scale. \n* Unlike the standard deviation, it cannot be used directly to construct [[confidence interval]]s for the mean.\n* CVs are not an ideal index of the certainty of measurement when the number of replicates varies across samples because CV is invariant to the number of replicates while the certainty of the mean improves with increasing replicates. In this case, standard error in percent is suggested to be superior.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Dan|title=Improving qPCR telomere length assays: Controlling for well position effects increases statistical power|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2015|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22690|pmid=25757675|volume=27|issue=4|pages=570\u20135|pmc=4478151}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe coefficient of variation is also common in applied probability fields such as [[renewal theory]], [[queueing theory]], and [[reliability theory]].  In these fields, the [[exponential distribution]] is often more important than the [[normal distribution]].\nThe standard deviation of an [[exponential distribution]] is equal to its mean, so its coefficient of variation is equal to 1.  Distributions with CV < 1 (such as an [[Erlang distribution]]) are considered low-variance, while those with CV > 1 (such as a [[hyper-exponential distribution]]) are considered high-variance{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}.  Some formulas in these fields are expressed using the '''squared coefficient of variation''', often abbreviated SCV. In modeling, a variation of the CV is the CV(RMSD).  Essentially the CV(RMSD) replaces the standard deviation term with the [[RMSD|Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)]]. While many natural processes indeed show a correlation between the average value and the amount of variation around it, accurate sensor devices need to be designed in such a way that the coefficient of variation is close to zero, i.e., yielding a constant [[absolute error]] over their working range.\n\nIn [[actuarial science]], the CV is known as '''unitized risk'''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Broverman|first1=Samuel A.|title=Actex study manual, Course 1, Examination of the Society of Actuaries, Exam 1 of the Casualty Actuarial Society|date=2001|publisher=Actex Publications|location=Winsted, CT|isbn=9781566983969|page=104|edition=2001|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qd4PAQAAMAAJ&q=%22unitized+risk%22|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Industrial Solids Processing, CV is particularly important to measure the degree of homogeneity of a powder mixture.

He also wrote the comic strips ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' (in the years 1937\u201345) and ''[[Long Sam]]'' (1954). He won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year, and their 1979 [[E. C. Segar|Elzie Segar Award]], posthumously for his \"unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning\". Comic strips dealt with northern urban experiences until the year Capp introduced \"Li'l Abner\", the first strip based in the South. Although Capp was from Connecticut, he spent 43 years teaching the world about Dogpatch, reaching an estimated 60 million readers in more than 900 American newspapers and 100 foreign papers in 28 countries. [[M. Thomas Inge]] says Capp made a large personal fortune through the strip and \"had a profound influence on the way the world viewed the American South\".<ref>M.

Capp's parents were both natives of [[Latvia]] whose families had migrated to New Haven in the 1880s. \"My mother and father had been brought to this country from Russia when they were infants\", wrote Capp in 1978. \"Their fathers had found that the great promise of America was true&nbsp;\u2014 it was no crime to be a Jew.\" The Caplins were dirt-poor, and Capp later recalled stories of his mother going out in the night to sift through ash barrels for reusable bits of coal.\n\nIn August 1919, at the age of nine, Capp was run down by a [[Tram|trolley car]] and had to have his left leg amputated, well above the knee.<ref>See [http://lil-abner.com/al-capp/ Li'l Abner Official Site: Al Capp biography]</ref> According to his father Otto's unpublished autobiography, young Capp was not prepared for the amputation beforehand; having been in a coma for days, he suddenly awoke to discover that his leg was removed.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) p. 4</ref> He was eventually given a prosthetic leg, but only learned to use it by adopting a slow way of walking which became increasingly painful as he grew older.<ref>See [http://www.tcj.com/reviews/al-capp-a-life-to-the-contrary/ Review: \"Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary,\" by R.C. Harvey, published March 14, 2013]</ref> The childhood tragedy of losing a leg likely helped shape Capp's cynical worldview, which was darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist.<ref>see [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811832,00.html \"Inhuman Man,\" ''Time'', February 6, 1950]</ref> \"I was indignant as hell about that leg\", he would reveal in a November 1950 interview in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.\n\n\"The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else\", Capp philosophically wrote (in ''[[Life magazine]]'' on May 23, 1960), \"was to be indifferent to that difference.\"<ref>see [https://books.google.com/books?id=3k4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA129&dq=Al+Capp&as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&q=Al%20Capp&f=false ''Life'', 23 May 1960, pp. 129\u2013140]</ref> The prevailing opinion among his friends was that Capp's [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.\n[[File:Al Capp Self-portrait April 1951.JPG|right|450px|thumb|\"I do ''Li'l Abner!!'',\" a self-portrait by Al Capp, excerpted from the<br />April 16\u201317, 1951 ''Li'l Abner'' strips; note the reference to [[Milton Caniff]]]]\nCapp's father, a failed businessman and an amateur cartoonist, introduced him to drawing as a form of therapy. He became quite proficient, advancing mostly on his own. Among his earliest influences were ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoonist\u2013illustrator [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], and American comic strip cartoonists [[Thomas Aloysius Dorgan|Tad Dorgan]], [[Cliff Sterrett]], [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Rudolph Dirks]], [[Frederick Burr Opper|Fred Opper]], [[Billy DeBeck]], [[George McManus]], and [[Milt Gross]]. At about this same time, Capp became a voracious reader. According to Capp's brother Elliot, Alfred had finished all of Shakespeare and [[George Bernard Shaw]] by the time he turned 13. Among his childhood favorites were [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Booth Tarkington]], and later, [[Robert Benchley]] and [[S. J. Perelman]].\n\nCapp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], without receiving a diploma. He liked to joke about how he failed geometry for nine straight terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 |title=Web page at Bridgeport Central High School devoted to Al Capp |access-date=2006-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185724/http://bridgeport.ct.schoolwebpages.com/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=5111 |archive-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His formal training came from a series of art schools in the [[New England]] area. Attending three of them in rapid succession, the impoverished Capp was thrown out of each for nonpayment of tuition&mdash;the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum School of Fine Arts]], the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]], and Designers Art School in Boston&mdash;the last before launching his career. Capp already had decided to become a cartoonist. \"I heard that [[Bud Fisher]] (creator of ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'') got $3,000 a week and was constantly marrying French countesses\", Capp said. \"I decided that was for me.\"\n\nIn early 1932, Capp hitchhiked to [[New York City]]. He lived in \"airless rat holes\" in [[Greenwich Village]] and turned out advertising strips at $2-apiece while scouring the city hunting for jobs. He eventually found work at the [[Associated Press]] when he was 23 years old. By March 1932, Capp was drawing ''Colonel Gilfeather'', a single-panel, AP-owned property created in 1930 by [[Richard Dorgan|Dick Dorgan]]. Capp changed the focus and title to ''Mister Gilfeather'', but soon grew to hate the feature. He left the Associated Press in September 1932. Before leaving, he met [[Milton Caniff]] and the two became lifelong friends. Capp moved to [[Boston]] and married Catherine Wingate Cameron, whom he had met earlier in art class. She died in 2006 at the age of 96.\n\nLeaving his new wife with her parents in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], he subsequently returned to New York in 1933, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. \"I was 23, I carried a mass of drawings, and I had nearly five dollars in my pocket. People were sleeping in alleys then, willing to work at anything.\" There he met [[Ham Fisher]], who hired him to ghost on ''[[Joe Palooka]]''. During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's ''Joe Palooka'' [[story arc]] introduced a stupid, coarse, oafish mountaineer named \"Big Leviticus,\" a crude [[prototype]]. (Leviticus was much closer to Capp's later villains Lem and Luke Scragg, than to the much more appealing and innocent Li'l Abner.)\n\nAlso during this period, Capp was working at night on samples for the strip that would eventually become ''[[Li'l Abner]]''. He based his cast of characters on the authentic mountain-dwellers he met while hitchhiking through rural [[West Virginia]] and the [[Cumberland Valley]] as a teenager. (This was years before the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act brought basic utilities such as electricity and running water to the region.) Leaving ''Joe Palooka'', Capp sold ''Li'l Abner'' to [[United Feature Syndicate]] (later known as [[United Media]]). The feature was launched on Monday, August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers&mdash;including the ''[[New York Mirror]]''&mdash;and was an immediate success. Alfred G. Caplin eventually became \"Al Capp\" because the syndicate felt the original would not fit in a cartoon frame.<ref>A review of the 1934 strips reveals that the earliest strips were signed \"Al G. Cap\", which became \"Al G. Capp\" and, finally, \"Al Capp\". However, the middle initial (\"Al G.

Elliot also authored several off-Broadway plays, including ''A Nickel for Picasso'' (1981), which was based on and dedicated to his mother and his famous brother.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/nyregion/theater-a-new-play-explores-fantasies-of-a-man-at-60.html ''New York Times'' theater column by Alvin Klein, November 8, 1987]</ref>\n\n==''Li'l Abner''==\n{{Main|Li'l Abner}}\nWhat began as a [[hillbilly]] [[burlesque]] soon evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular, and well-drawn strips of the twentieth century. Featuring vividly outlandish characters, bizarre situations, and equal parts [[suspense]], [[slapstick]], [[irony]], [[satire]], [[black humor]], and biting [[social commentary]], ''Li'l Abner'' is considered a classic of the genre. The comic strip stars Li'l Abner Yokum\u2014the simple-minded, loutish but good-natured, and eternally innocent hayseed who lives with his parents\u2014scrawny but superhuman Mammy Yokum, and shiftless, childlike Pappy Yokum.\n\n\"Yokum\" was a combination of ''yokel'' and ''hokum'', although Capp established a deeper meaning for the name during a series of visits around 1965\u20131970 with comics historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price. \"It's phonetic [[Hebrew]]\u2014that's what it is, all right\u2014and that's what I was getting at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound ''hickish''\", said Capp. \"That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it's a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name\u2014''[[Joachim]]'' means 'God's determination', something like that\u2014that also happens to have a rustic ring to it.\"<ref>[http://www.comicmix.com/news/2007/11/11/li-l-abner-lost-in-hollywood-shuffle-by-michael-h-price/ \"Li'l Abner Lost In Hollywood\" by Michael H. Price]</ref>\n\nThe Yokums live in the backwater hamlet of [[Dogpatch]], [[Kentucky]]. Described by its creator as \"an average stone-age community\", Dogpatch mostly consists of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, pine trees, \"tarnip\" fields, and \"hawg\" wallows. Whatever energy Abner had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae Scragg, his sexy, well-endowed (but virtuous) girlfriend\u2014until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This newsworthy event made the cover of ''Life'' on March 31, 1952.\n\nCapp peopled his comic strip with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Hairless Joe, Lonesome Polecat, Evil-Eye Fleegle, General Bullmoose, Lena the Hyena, Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Capp's caricature of the anti-[[New Deal]] [[Dixiecrats]]), the ''(shudder!)'' Scraggs, Available Jones, Nightmare Alice, Earthquake McGoon, and a host of others. Most notably, certainly from a [[GI (military)|G.I.]] point of view, are the beautiful, full-figured women such as Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Stupefyin' Jones, and Moonbeam McSwine (a caricature of his wife Catherine, aside from the dirt)\u2014all of whom found their way onto the [[nose art|painted noses]] of [[bomber aircraft|bomber planes]] during World War II and the Korean War. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the [[Shmoo]]s, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was [[Joe Btfsplk]], who wants to be a loving friend, but is \"the world's worst jinx\", bringing bad luck to all those nearby. Btfsplk (his name is \"pronounced\" by simply blowing a \"raspberry\" or [[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]) always has an iconic dark cloud over his head.\n\nDogpatch residents regularly combat the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials, and intellectuals with their homespun simplicity. Situations often take the characters to other destinations, including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, and some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's invention. The last includes El Passionato, Kigmyland, The Republic of Crumbumbo, Skunk Hollow, The Valley of the Shmoon, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, and a miserable frozen wasteland known as [[Lower Slobbovia]], a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy that remains a contemporary reference.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Russell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia - '&#39;NY Times'&#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-01-13 |access-date=2009-08-29}}</ref> \"Indeed, ''Li'l Abner'' incorporates such a panoply of characters and ideas that it defies summary\", according to cultural historian Anthony Harkins. \"Yet though Capp's storylines often wandered far afield, his hillbilly setting remained a central touchstone, serving both as a microcosm and a distorting carnival mirror of broader American society.\"<ref>''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon'' by Anthony Harkins (2004, Oxford Univ. Press) pp. 124\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe strip's popularity grew from an original eight papers, to ultimately more than 900. At its peak, ''Li'l Abner'' was estimated to have been read daily in the United States by 60 to 70 million people (the U.S. population at the time was only 180 million), with adult readers far outnumbering children. Many communities, high schools and colleges staged [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]s, patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.\n\nLi'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question \"Which side does Abner part his hair on?\", Capp would answer, \"Both.\" Capp said he finally found the right \"look\" for Li'l Abner with [[Henry Fonda]]'s character Dave Tolliver, in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=U99JAAAAMAAJ&q=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&dq=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=0 Steen, Mike ''Hollywood Speaks: An Oral History'' Putnam, 1974]</ref> In later years, Capp always claimed to have effectively created the [[miniskirt]], when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.\n\n==Parodies, toppers, and alternate strips==\n''Li'l Abner'' also features a comic strip-within-the-strip: ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' is a parody of [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently during the next 35 years. Gould was parodied personally in the series as cartoonist \"Lester Gooch\"\u2014the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged \"creator\" of Fosdick. The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely mimicks ''Tracy'', including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping [[mortality rate]], the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style. In 1952, Fosdick was the star of his own short-lived [[puppet show]] on [[NBC]], featuring the Mary Chase [[marionette]]s.\n\nBesides ''Dick Tracy'', Capp parodied many other comic strips in ''Li'l Abner''\u2014including ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]]'' (at least twice; first as \"Jack Jawbreaker\" in 1947, and again in 1966 as \"Chickensouperman\"), ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\", ''[[Peanuts]]'' {with \"Peewee\" a parody of Charlie Brown with \"Croopy\" parody of [[Snoopy]]\" {1968} drawn by Bedley Damp a parody of [[Charles Schulz]]}, ''[[Rex Morgan, M.D.]]'', ''[[Little Annie Rooney]]'', and ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' (in which Punjab became \"Punjbag,\" an oleaginous slob). ''Fearless Fosdick''\u2014and Capp's other spoofs such as \"Little Fanny Gooney\" (1952) and \"Jack Jawbreaker\"\u2014were almost certainly an early inspiration for [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', which began in 1952 as a [[comic book]] that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.\n\nCapp also lampooned popular recording idols of the day, such as [[Elvis Presley]] (\"Hawg McCall\", 1957), [[Liberace]] (\"Loverboynik\", 1956), [[the Beatles]] (\"the Beasties\", 1964)\u2014and in 1944, [[Frank Sinatra]]. \"Sinatra was the first great public figure I ever wrote about,\" Capp once said. \"I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, and we were all surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always made it a point to send me a spent condom whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant{{nbsp}}...\" (from ''Frank Sinatra, My Father'' by [[Nancy Sinatra]], 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was \"cut to the quick\" over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action\u2014as would [[Joan Baez]] later, over \"Joanie Phoanie\" in 1967.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Capp/ UPI Photo/Files Al Capp Jan. 11, 1967]</ref>\n\nCapp was just as likely to parody himself; his self-caricature made frequent, tongue-in-cheek appearances in ''Li'l Abner''.<ref>''Anything Can Happen in a Comic Strip: Centennial Reflections on an American Art Form'' by [[M. Thomas Inge]] (1995) University Press of Mississippi, pp. 18\u201319</ref> The gag was often at his own expense, as in the above 1951 sequence showing Capp's interaction with \"fans\" (see excerpt), or in his 1955 [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] parody, \"Hal Yappland\". Just about anything could be a target for Capp's satire\u2014in one storyline Li'l Abner is revealed to be the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] between ape and man. In another, the search is on in Dogpatch for a pair of missing socks knitted by the first president of the United States.\n \nIn addition to creating ''Li'l Abner'', Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' with magazine illustrator [[Raeburn van Buren]] in 1937, and ''[[Long Sam]]'' with cartoonist [[Bob Lubbers]] in 1954, as well as the Sunday \"[[topper (comic strip)|topper]]\" strips ''Washable Jones'', ''Small Fry'' (a.k.a. ''Small Change''), and ''Advice fo' Chillun''.\n\n==Critical recognition==\nAccording to comics historian [[Coulton Waugh]], a 1947 poll of newspaper readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed to making a single exception: ''Li'l Abner''. \"When ''Li'l Abner'' made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into ''Li'l Abner''. The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines having nothing to do with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique\u2014as invigorating as it was unorthodox\u2014was later adopted by cartoonists such as [[Walt Kelly]] [''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''] and [[Garry Trudeau]] [''[[Doonesbury]]'']\", wrote comic strip historian [[Rick Marschall]]. According to Marschall, ''Li'l Abner'' gradually evolved into a broad satire of [[human nature]]. In his book ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] subtext.\n\nOver the years, ''Li'l Abner'' has been adapted to radio, [[Character animation|animated cartoons]], stage production, [[motion pictures]], and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to Mark Twain, [[Dostoevski]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], and [[Rabelais]].<ref>Brown, Rodger, \"Dogpatch USA: The Road to Hokum\" article, ''Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 18-26</ref> Fans of the strip ranged from novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who called Capp \"possibly the best writer in the world today\" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature\u2014to media critic and theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who considered Capp \"the only robust satirical force in American life\". [[John Updike]], comparing Abner to a \"hillbilly [[Candide]]\", added that the strip's \"richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the [[Voltairean]]\".<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, ''City Journal,'' Spring 2010]</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William F.

''Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire'' by [[Arthur Asa Berger]] (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature, and grotesquerie, the place of ''Li'l Abner'' in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. \"One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,\" wrote Professor Berger, \"''Li'l Abner'' is worth studying ... because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.\" It was reprinted by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in 1994.\n\n==The 1940s and 1950s==\n[[File:Cappbio46.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Al Capp drew his own autobiography, the 34-page ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'' (1946), that was distributed to returning World War II amputee veterans.]]\nDuring World War II and for many years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to [[hospital]]s to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his [[prosthetic]] leg his whole life. In 1946, Capp created a special full-color comic book, ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'', to be distributed by the [[Red Cross]] to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp also was involved with the [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Foundation]], which pioneered new treatments for [[polio]] in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fundraising appeals, and entertained crippled and [[paraplegic]] children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories, and sketches.<ref>[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/05/dont-keep-remembering-what-youve-lost.html Letters of Note: Dear Chip... (Columbus Hospital, 28 May 1964)]</ref>\n\nIn 1940, an [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] [[Li'l Abner (1940 film)|movie adaptation]] starred Granville Owen (later known as [[Jeff York]]) as Li'l Abner, with [[Buster Keaton]] taking the role of Lonesome Polecat, and featuring a title song with lyrics by [[Milton Berle]]. A successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the St. James Theater on November 15, 1956, and had a long run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. The [[Li'l Abner (musical)|stage musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Gene de Paul]] and [[Johnny Mercer]], was adapted into a [[Technicolor]] [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|motion picture]] at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1959 by producer [[Norman Panama]] and director [[Melvin Frank]], with a score by [[Nelson Riddle]]. Several performers repeated their Broadway roles in the film, most memorably [[Julie Newmar]] as Stupefyin' Jones and [[Stubby Kaye]] as Marryin' Sam.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F04E3D9103CE63BBC4A52DFB4678382649EDE The Screen 'Li'l Abner' - New York Times Review]</ref>\n\nOther highlights of that decade included the 1942 debut of Fearless Fosdick as Abner's \"ideel\" (hero); the 1946 Lena the Hyena Contest, in which a hideous Lower Slobbovian gal was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, [[Boris Karloff]], and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]) drawn by noted cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]]; and an ill-fated Sunday parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' that aroused anger and legal threats from author [[Margaret Mitchell]], and led to a printed apology within the strip. In October 1947, Li'l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Comic Strip Syndicate. The resulting sequence, \"Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!\", was a devastating satire of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s notorious exploitation by [[DC Comics]] over ''[[Superman]]''. It was later reprinted in ''The World of Li'l Abner'' (1953). (Siegel and Shuster had earlier poked fun at Capp in a ''Superman'' story in ''[[Action Comics]] #55'', December 1942, in which a cartoonist named \"Al Hatt\" invents a comic strip featuring the hillbilly \"Tiny Rufe\".)\n\nIn 1947, Capp earned a ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story. That same year the ''[[New Yorker magazine|New Yorker's]]'' profile on him was so long that it ran in consecutive issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak with the introduction of the [[Shmoo]]s, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was [[metaphor]]ically interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]].\n\nFollowing his close friend Milton Caniff's lead (with ''[[Steve Canyon]]''), Capp had recently fought a successful battle with the syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950\u2014including a ''Time'' cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, ''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'', became a bestseller for [[Simon & Schuster]]. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, [[Halloween]] masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other Shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of Shmoo apparel, including \"Shmooveralls\". The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, ''The Return of the Shmoo'', have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated television series.\n\nCapp followed this success with other [[allegory|allegorical]] fantasy critters, including the aboriginal and [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] \"Kigmies\", who craved abuse (a story that began as a veiled comment on racial and religious oppression), the dreaded \"Nogoodniks\" (or ''bad'' shmoos), and the irresistible \"Bald Iggle\", a guileless creature whose sad-eyed countenance compelled involuntary truthfulness\u2014with predictably disastrous results.\n\n''Li'l Abner'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by [[Scripps-Howard]]. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[United States Senate]]. Edward Leech of Scripps said, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks&nbsp;... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html Tain't Funny - TIME]</ref> Capp criticized [[Senator Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, calling him a \"poet\". \"He uses [[poetic license]] to try to create the beautifully ordered world of good guys and bad guys that he wants,\" said Capp. \"He seems at his best when terrifying the helpless and na\u00efve.\"<ref>\"Poet: Cartoonist Al Capp said in New York{{nbsp}}...\" quoted in ''The Argus'', 10 May 1954</ref>\n\nCapp received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Billy DeBeck Memorial Award|Billy DeBeck Memorial Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year. (When the award name was changed in 1954, Capp also retroactively received a [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben]] statuette.) He was an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the NCS by admitting women cartoonists. Originally, the Society had disallowed female members. Capp briefly resigned his membership in 1949 to protest their refusal of admission to [[Hilda Terry]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Teena]]''. According to Tom Roberts, author of ''[[Alex Raymond]]: His Life and Art'' (2007), Capp delivered a stirring speech that was instrumental in changing those rules. The NCS finally accepted female members the following year. In December 1952, Capp published an article in ''Real'' magazine entitled \"The REAL Powers in America\" that further challenged the conventional attitudes of the day: \"The real powers in America are ''women''\u2014the wives and sweethearts behind the masculine dummies&nbsp;...\"\n\nHighlights of the 1950s included the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, the birth of their son \"Honest Abe\" Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long-lost kid brother Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both ''Life'' and ''[[TV Guide]]''. 1956 saw the debut of Bald Iggle, considered by some ''Abner'' enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the \"Square Eyes\" Family\u2014Capp's thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This [[fable]]-like story was collected into an educational comic book called ''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!'', and distributed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] later that year.) Two years later, Capp's studio issued ''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]'', a biographical comic book distributed by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].<ref name=Grio>Love, David A.

Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when [[General Motors]] president [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]], nominated for a cabinet post, told [[United States Congress|Congress]] \"...&nbsp;what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa\", he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires\u2014the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying \"What's good for General Bullmoose is good for ''everybody!''\" Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of \"haves\" versus \"have-nots\". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.\n\n==Feud with Ham Fisher==\nAfter Capp quit his ghosting job on [[Ham Fisher]]'s ''Joe Palooka'' in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had \"stolen\" his idea. For years, Fisher would bring the characters back to his strip, billing them as \"The ORIGINAL Hillbilly Characters\" and advising readers not to be \"fooled by imitations\". (In fact, Fisher's brutish hillbilly character\u2014Big Leviticus, created by Capp in Fisher's absence\u2014bore little resemblance to Li'l Abner.) According to a November 1950 ''Time'' article, \"Capp parted from Fisher with a definite impression, (to put it mildly) that he had been underpaid and unappreciated. Fisher, a man of Roman self esteem, considered Capp an ingrate and a whippersnapper, and watched his rise to fame with unfeigned horror.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813720-7,00.html Die Monstersinger - TIME]</ref>\n\n\"Fisher repeatedly brought Leviticus and his clan back, claiming their primacy as comics' first hillbilly family&nbsp;\u2014 but he was missing the point. It wasn't the setting that made Capp's strip such a huge success. It was Capp's finely tuned sense of the absurd, his ability to milk an outrageous situation for every laugh in it and then, impossibly, to squeeze even more laughs from it, that found such favor with the public,\" (from [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]'').<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/abner.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia / Li'l Abner]</ref>\n\nThe Capp-Fisher feud was well known in cartooning circles, and it grew more personal as Capp's strip eclipsed ''Joe Palooka'' in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, [[Moe Leff]]. After Fisher underwent [[plastic surgery]], Capp included a racehorse in ''Li'l Abner'' named \"Ham's Nose-Bob\". In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named \"Happy Vermin\"\u2014a caricature of Fisher\u2014who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet (after sacking his previous \"temporary\" assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: \"I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do&nbsp;\u2014 I'll get ''you'' a new light bulb!!\"\n\nTraveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in 1998: \"They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city's gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks.\"<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html Maeder, Jay. \u201cSpitting on Pictures Funny Papers, 1955\u201d, ''Daily News'', September 18, 1998.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008035428/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html |date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref> In 1950, Capp wrote a nasty article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', entitled \"I Remember Monster\". The article recounted Capp's days working for an unnamed \"benefactor\" with a miserly, swinish personality, who Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip. The thinly-veiled boss was understood to be Ham Fisher.\n\nFisher retaliated, doctoring photostats of ''Li'l Abner'' and falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Fisher submitted examples of ''Li'l Abner'' to Capp's syndicate and to the New York courts, in which Fisher had identified pornographic images that were hidden in the background art. However, the X-rated material had been drawn there by Fisher. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original artwork.\n\nIn 1954, when Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) received an anonymous packet of pornographic ''Li'l Abner'' drawings. The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled for the forgery from the same organization that he had helped found; Fisher's scheme had backfired in spectacular fashion. Around the same time, his mansion in Wisconsin was destroyed by a storm. On December 27, 1955, Fisher committed suicide in his studio. The feud and Fisher's suicide were used as the basis for a lurid, highly fictionalized murder mystery, ''Strip for Murder'' by [[Max Allan Collins]].\n\nAnother \"feud\" seemed to be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\". The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. [[Allen Saunders]], the creator of the ''Mary Worth'' strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character \"Hal Rapp\", a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a [[teetotaler]]{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}). Later, the \"feud\" was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders \"feud\" fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips\u2014and Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893653,00.html Rap for Capp - TIME]</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nCapp is often associated with two other giants of the medium: [[Milton Caniff]] (''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', ''Steve Canyon'') and [[Walt Kelly]] (''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]''). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally, referenced each other in their strips. According to one [[anecdote]] (from ''Al Capp Remembered'', 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home\u2014leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's [[baby grand piano]]. According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between [[Argentina]] and the United States, and b. \"Because you can't play the piano, anyway!\" (''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' creator [[Mort Walker]] confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, ''Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook'', 2001.)\n\nMilton Caniff offered another anecdote (from ''Phi Beta Pogo'', 1989) involving Capp and Walt Kelly, \"two boys from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], nose to nose,\" onstage at a meeting of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. \"Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing ''his'' version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them&nbsp;...\"\n\nAlthough he was often considered a difficult person,<ref name=\"printmag.com\">http://www.printmag.com/interviews/lil-abner-al-capp-monster-cartoonist/</ref> some acquaintances of Capp have stressed that the cartoonist also had a sensitive side. In 1973, when learning that the son of his political rival, [[Ted Kennedy]], had his right leg amputated, Capp wrote the boy a letter of encouragement, giving candid advice as to how to deal with the loss of a limb,<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.243</ref> which he had experienced as a boy. One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, tears were streaming down the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the [[Jonestown]] massacre.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.244</ref> Also, it is reported that Capp gave money anonymously to charities and \"people in need\" at various points in his life.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/>\n\n==Sexual misconduct claims==\nIn her autobiography, American actress [[Goldie Hawn]] stated that Capp sexually propositioned her on a [[casting couch]] and exposed himself to her when she was nineteen years old. When she refused his advances, Capp became angry and told her that she was \"never gonna make anything in your life\" and that she should \"go and marry a Jewish dentist. You'll never get anywhere in this business.\"<ref name=couch>[http://people.com/movies/goldie-hawn-remembers-casting-couch-sexual-predator-who-left-her-in-tears-at-19/ Goldie Hawn Remembers the Casting-Couch Sexual Predator Who Left Her in Tears]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LrI-86BHE0QC&pg=PT113&lpg=PT113&dq=a+lotus+grows+in+the+mud+al+capp#v=onepage&q=a%20lotus%20grows%20in%20the%20mud%20al%20capp&f=false |title=A Lotus Grows in the Mud |last=Hawn |first=Goldie |date=2006-02-28 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9781101205327 |language=en}}</ref>\nTwo biographies, one about Goldie Hawn and the other about [[Grace Kelly]], describe Capp as trying to force Kelly into having sex with him, and he later tried to do the same with Hawn.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/</ref>\n\nIn 1971, investigative journalist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] wrote that Capp had exposed his genitals to four female students at the University of Alabama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/|title=Cartoonist Al Capp exposed in \u2018Life to the Contrary\u2019|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> Then, after an incident at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire, Capp was arrested.

During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics, and other specialty work\u2014in addition to the regular six dailies and one [[Sunday strip]] per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for [[Cream of Wheat]] using the ''Abner'' characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic in a series of daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks\u2014including a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, [[Kickapoo Joy Juice]]\u2014and [[General Electric]] and [[Procter & Gamble]] products, all requiring special artwork.\n\nNo matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on his drawing and inking the characters' faces and hands\u2014especially of Abner and Daisy Mae\u2014and his distinctive touch is often discernible. \"He had ''the touch,''\" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. \"He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it ''pop''. I'll never knock his talent.\"\n\nAs is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited\u2014 although, sensitive to his own experience working on ''Joe Palooka'', Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in ''Time'' even included photographs of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy (along with the subsequent fame of Frank Frazetta) has led to the misconception that his strip was \"ghosted\" by other hands. The production of ''Li'l Abner'' has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the hands and faces of the characters. Frazetta authority David Winiewicz described the everyday working mode of operation in ''Li'l Abner Dailies: 1954 Volume 20'' (Kitchen Sink, 1994):\n\n{{quote|text=By the time Frazetta began working on the strip, the work of producing ''Li'l Abner'' was too much for one person. Capp had a group of assistants who he taught to reproduce his distinctive individual style, working under his direct supervision. Actual production of the strip began with a rough layout in pencil done by Al Capp, from Capp's script or a co-authored script, and the page would pass to Andy Amato and Walter Johnson. Amato would ink the figures, then Johnson added backgrounds and any mechanical objects. Harvey Curtis was responsible for the lettering and also shared inking duties with Amato&nbsp;... In order to make sure that the work stayed true to his style, the final touches would be added by Capp himself. He enjoyed adding a distinctive glint to an eye or an idiosyncratic contortion to a character's face. The finished strip was truly an ensemble effort, a skillful blending of talents.}}\n\nThere was also a separate line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned [[Toby Press]], including ''Shmoo Comics'' featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist [[Mell Lazarus]], creator of ''[[Miss Peach]]'' and ''[[Momma]]'', wrote a comic novel in 1963 entitled ''The Boss Is Crazy, Too'' which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the [[Charles Schulz Museum]] on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby \"the five funniest years of my life\". Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the \"four essentials\" in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, [[Charles Schulz]], and [[Milton Caniff]].\n\nCapp detailed his approach to writing and drawing the stories in an instructional course book for the [[Famous Artists School]], beginning in 1956. In 1959, Capp recorded and released an album for [[Folkways Records]] (now owned by the [[Smithsonian]]) on which he identified and described \"The Mechanics of the Comic Strip\".<ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1284 An Interview with Al Capp - Smithsonian Folkways]</ref>\n\nFrazetta, later famous as a [[fantasy art]]ist, assisted on the strip from 1954 to December, 1961. Fascinated by Frazetta's abilities, Capp initially gave him a free hand in an extended daily sequence (about a biker named \"Frankie,\" a caricature of Frazetta) to experiment with the basic look of the strip by adding a bit more realism and detail (particularly to the inking). After editors complained about the stylistic changes, the strip's previous look was restored. During most of his tenure with Capp, Frazetta's primary responsibility\u2014along with various specialty art, such as a series of ''Li'l Abner'' greeting cards\u2014was tight-penciling the Sunday pages from studio roughs. This work was collected by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in a four-volume hardcover series entitled ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Frazetta Years''. In 1961, Capp, complaining of declining revenue, wanted to have Frazetta continue with a 50% pay cut. \"[Capp] said he would cut the salary in half. Goodbye. That was that. ''I'' said goodbye,\" (from ''Frazetta: Painting with Fire''). However, Frazetta returned briefly a few years later to draw a public service comic book called ''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space'', distributed by the [[Job Corps]] in 1965.\n\n==Public service works==\nCapp provided specialty artwork for civic groups, government agencies, and charitable or nonprofit organizations, spanning several decades.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708021015/http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/ |date=8 July 2012 }}</ref> The following titles are all single-issue, educational comic books and pamphlets produced for various [[public services]]:\n\n*''Al Capp by Li'l Abner''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] (1946)\n*''Yo' Bets Yo' Life!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Army]] (circa 1950)\n*''Li'l Abner Joins the Navy''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Navy|Dept. of the Navy]] (1950)\n*''Fearless Fosdick and the Case of the Red Feather''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by Red Feather Services, a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1951)\n*''The Youth You Supervise''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (1956)\n*''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] (1956)\n*''Operation: Survival!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Civil Defense|Dept. of Civil Defense]] (1957)\n*''Natural Disasters!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the Department of Civil Defense (1957)\n*''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by [[The Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (1958)<ref name=Grio />\n*''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Job Corps]] (1965)\n\nIn addition, Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the [[U.S. Treasury]], the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the Sister Kenny Foundation, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]], the National Reading Council, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, [[Christmas Seal & Charity Stamp Society|Christmas Seals]], the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]],<ref name=\"news.google.com\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19500511&id=DZZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4AkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4808,2345975 \"Al Capp Replies to Critic of Newspaper Comic Strips;\" ''The News and Courier'', 11 May 1950]</ref> among others.\n\n==Public figure==\nIn the Golden Age of the American comic strip, successful cartoonists received a great deal of attention; their professional and private lives were reported in the press, and their celebrity was often nearly sufficient to rival their creations. As ''Li'l Abner'' reached its peak years, and following the success of the Shmoos and other high moments in his work, Al Capp achieved a public profile that is still unparalleled in his profession, and arguably exceeded the fame of his strip. \"Capp was the best known, most influential and most controversial cartoonist of his era,\" writes publisher (and leading Shmoo collector) [[Denis Kitchen]]. \"His personal celebrity transcended comics, reaching the public and influencing the culture in a variety of media. For many years he simultaneously produced the daily strip, a weekly syndicated [[newspaper column]], and a 500-station [[radio program]]{{nbsp}}...\" He ran the Boston Summer Theatre with ''[[The Phantom (comics)|The Phantom]]'' cartoonist [[Lee Falk]], bringing in Hollywood actors such as [[Mae West]], [[Melvyn Douglas]], and [[Claude Rains]] to star in their live productions. He even briefly considered running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] urged Capp to run in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Massachusetts]] primary in 1970 against [[Ted Kennedy]], but Capp ultimately declined. (He did, however, donate his services as a speaker at a $100-a-plate fundraiser for Republican Congressman [[Jack Kemp]].)\n[[File:Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida.jpg|thumb|Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida]]\nBesides his use of the comic strip to voice his opinions and display his humor, Capp was a popular guest speaker at universities, and on radio<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779734,00.html The Press: Bane of the Bassinet, ''Time'', 15 March 1948]</ref> and [[television]]. He remains the only cartoonist to be embraced by television; no other comic artist to date has come close to Capp's televised exposure.<ref>[http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=102060 Al Capp Views the Networks (April 1952) ''Nieman Reports'']</ref> Capp appeared as a regular on ''[[The Author Meets the Critics]]'' (1948\u2013'54) and made regular, weekly appearances on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' in 1953. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC's ''[[Who Said That?]]'' (1948\u2013'55), and co-hosted DuMont's ''[[What's the Story|What's the Story?]]'' (1953). Between 1952 and 1972, he hosted at least ''five'' television shows\u2013three different [[talk show]]s called ''The Al Capp Show'' (1952 and 1968) and ''Al Capp'' (1971\u2013'72), ''Al Capp's America'' (a live \"chalk talk,\" with Capp providing a barbed commentary while sketching cartoons, 1954), and a CBS game show called ''Anyone Can Win'' (1953). He also hosted similar vehicles on the radio\u2014and was a familiar celebrity guest on various other broadcast programs, including [[NBC Radio]]'s long-running ''[[Monitor (NBC radio)|Monitor]]'' with its famous ''Monitor'' Beacon audio signature, as a commentator dubbed \"An expert of nothing with opinions on everything.\"\n\nHis frequent appearances on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' spanned three emcees ([[Steve Allen]], [[Jack Paar]], and [[Johnny Carson]]), from the 1950s to the 1970s. One memorable story, as recounted to Johnny Carson, was about his meeting with then-President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. As Capp was ushered into the [[Oval Office]], his [[Prosthesis|prosthetic leg]] suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, \"Call [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed]] (Hospital), or maybe [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda]],\" to which Capp replied, \"Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!\" (Capp also spoofed Carson in his strip, in a 1970 episode called \"The Tommy Wholesome Show\".)\n\nCapp portrayed himself in a cameo role in the [[Bob Hope]] film ''That Certain Feeling'', for which he also provided promotional art. He was interviewed live on ''[[Person to Person]]'' on November 27, 1959, by host [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]]. He also appeared as himself on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and guested on [[Ralph Edwards]]' ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, in a wide variety of publications including ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''Show'', ''Pageant'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''Coronet'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Capp was impersonated by comedians [[Rich Little]] and [[David Frye]]. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends [[Milton Caniff]] and Walt Kelly), and\u2014with an irony that would become apparent later\u2014a brand of cigarettes ([[Chesterfield cigarettes|Chesterfield]]).\n\nCapp resumed visiting war amputees during the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]]. He toured Vietnam with the [[USO]], entertaining troops along with [[Art Buchwald]] and [[George Plimpton]]. He served as chairman of the Cartoonists' Committee in President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s People-to-People program in 1954 (although Capp had supported [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] for president in 1952 and 1956),<ref>[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/memorium/capp.jpg Al Capp's biography card from the National Cartoonists Society]</ref> which was organized to promote [[Savings bond]]s for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]. Capp had earlier provided the Shmoo for a special Children's Savings Bond in 1949, accompanying President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012]</ref> During the [[Soviet Union]]'s blockade of [[West Berlin]] in 1948, the commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting inflatable shmoos as part of \"Operation: Little Vittles\". Candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron during the [[humanitarian]] effort. \"When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted,\" (reported in ''[[Newsweek]]''\u2014October 11, 1948).\n\nIn addition to his public service work for charitable organizations for the handicapped, Capp also served on the National Reading Council, which was organized to combat illiteracy. He published a column (\"Wrong Turn Onto Sesame Street\") challenging federally funded [[public television]] endowments in favor of educational comics\u2014which, according to Capp, \"didn't cost a dime in taxes and never had. I pointed out that a kid could enjoy ''[[Sesame Street]]'' ''without'' learning how to read, but he couldn't enjoy comic strips ''unless'' he could read; and that a smaller investment in getting kids to read by supplying them with educational matter in such ''reading'' form might make better sense.\"\n\nCapp's academic interests included being one of nineteen original \"Trustees and Advisors\" for \"Endicott, Junior College for Young Woman\", located in Pride's Crossing (Beverly), Massachusetts, which was founded in 1939. Al Capp is listed in the 1942 Mingotide Yearbook, representing the first graduating class from Endicott Junior College. The yearbook entry includes his credential as a \"Cartoonist for United Feature Syndicate\" and a resident of New York City.\n\n\"Comics,\" wrote Capp in 1970, \"can be a combination of the highest quality of art and text, and many of them are.\" Capp would produce many giveaway educational comic books and [[public services]] pamphlets, spanning several decades, for the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]], the [[United States civil defense|Department of Civil Defense]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], the [[U.S. Army]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]] (a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]]), and the [[Job Corps]]. Capp's studio provided special artwork for various civic groups and [[nonprofit organizations]] as well. Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]], among others.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/> They were also used to help sell [[Christmas Seals]].\n\nIn the early 1960s, Capp regularly wrote a column entitled ''Al Capp's Column'' for the newspaper ''The Schenectady Gazette'' (currently ''[[The Daily Gazette]]''). He was the ''[[Playboy]]'' interview subject in December 1965, in a conversation conducted by [[Alvin Toffler]]. In August 1967, Capp was the narrator and host of an ABC network special called ''Do Blondes Have More Fun?'' In 1970, he was the subject of a provocative NBC documentary called ''This Is Al Capp''.\n\n==The 1960s and 1970s==\nCapp and his family lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], near [[Harvard]] during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were watching on their television sets was happening live\u2014right in his own neighborhood. Campus [[Far left|radicals]] and \"[[hippies]]\" inevitably became one of Capp's favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing [[counterculture]] icons such as [[Joan Baez]] (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of \"protest songs\").<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html Which One Is the Phoanie? - Time]</ref> The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a [[limousine liberal]], a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, ''And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir''. Another target was Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], parodied as \"Senator O. Noble McGesture\", resident of \"Hyideelsport\". The town name is a play on [[Hyannisport, Massachusetts]], where a number of the Kennedy clan have lived.\n\nCapp became a popular public speaker on college campuses, where he reportedly relished hecklers. He attacked militant antiwar demonstrators, both in his personal appearances and in his strip. He also satirized student political groups. The [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) emerged in ''Li'l Abner'' as \"Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!\" (SWINE). In an April 1969 letter to ''Time'', Capp insisted, \"The students I blast are not the dissenters, but the destroyers\u2014the less than 4% who lock up deans in washrooms, who burn manuscripts of unpublished books, who make combination pigpens and playpens of their universities. The remaining 96% detest them as heartily as I do.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844734-3,00.html Letters page April 18, 1969 - TIME]</ref>\n\nCapp's increasingly controversial remarks at his campus speeches and during television appearances cost him his semi-regular spot on the ''Tonight Show''. His contentious public persona during this period was captured on a late sixties comedy LP called ''Al Capp On Campus''. The album features his interaction with students at Fresno State College (now [[California State University, Fresno]]) on such topics as \"sensitivity training,\" \"humanitarianism,\" \"abstract art\" (Capp hated it), and \"student protest\". The cover features a cartoon drawing by Capp of wildly dressed, angry hippies carrying protest signs with slogans like \"End Capp Brutality\", \"Abner and Daisy Mae Smoke Pot\", \"Capp Is Over [30, 40, 50\u2014all crossed out] the Hill!!\", and \"If You Like Crap, You'll Like Capp!\"\n\nHighlights of the strip's final decades include \"Boomchik\" (1961), in which America's international prestige is saved by Mammy Yokum, \"Daisy Mae Steps Out\" (1966), a female-empowering tale of Daisy's brazenly audacious \"homewrecker gland\", \"The Lips of Marcia Perkins\" (1967), a satirical, thinly-veiled commentary on [[venereal disease]] and public health warnings, \"Ignoble Savages\" (1968), in which [[Mafia|the Mob]] takes over Harvard, and \"Corporal Crock\" (1973), in which Bullmoose reveals his reactionary cartoon role model, in a tale of obsession and the fanatical world of comic book collecting.\n\nThe cartoonist visited [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] at their 1969 [[Bed-In for Peace]] in [[Montreal]], and their testy exchange later appeared in the documentary film ''[[Imagine: John Lennon]]'' (1988). Introducing himself with the words \"I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?,\" Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Two Virgins]]'' nude album cover: \"I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it.\" Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono (\"Good God, you've gotta live with that?\"), and was asked to \"get out\" by [[Derek Taylor]]. Lennon allowed him to stay, however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his ''[[Ballad of John and Yoko]]'' song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: \"Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify ''Capp!'' \"<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/i/imagine-john-lennon-script-transcript.html Imagine: John Lennon Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or documentary movie about John Lennon]</ref>\n\nDespite his political conservatism in the last decade of his life, Capp is reported to have been liberal in some particular causes; he supported [[gay rights]], and did not tolerate any attempts at homophobic jokes.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/> He is also said to have supported [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the fight for racial equality in American society, although he was very sceptical of the tactics of the [[Black Panthers]] and [[Malcolm X]].<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary (2013) Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 196</ref>\n\nIn 1968, a [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at Marble Falls, [[Arkansas]], based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties. By 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch \"founder\" General Jubilation T. Cornpone) had been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and was slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.\n\nOn April 22, 1971, syndicated [[columnist]] Jack Anderson reported allegations that Capp made indecent advances to four female students when he was invited to speak at the [[University of Alabama]] in February 1968. Anderson and an associate confirmed that Capp was shown out of town by university police, but that the incident had been hushed up by the university to avoid negative publicity.<ref>[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Anderson, Jack]], \"Washington Merry-Go-Round,\" April 22, 1971</ref>\n\nThe following month, Capp was charged in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in connection with another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire|University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire]].<ref>\"Al Capp Accused on Moral Counts at Eau Claire U.\"; ''[[The Capital Times]]'', May 7, 1971</ref> Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included [[Sodomy laws in the United States|\"sodomy\"]]. As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty to the charge of \"attempted adultery\" (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |title= Adultery is a crime in Wisconsin {{!}} Law Offices of criminal defense attorneys Christopher Van Wagner and Tracey Wood, Madison WI |access-date= 2008-06-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516092007/http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |archive-date= 2008-05-16 |url-status= dead }}</ref>) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs.<ref>\"Al Capp Admits One Morals Count; Pays $500 Fine\"; ''[[The Capital Times]],'' February 12, 1972</ref> In a December 1992 article for ''[[The New Yorker]],'' [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Charles Colson]] had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against [[Ted Kennedy]] for the U.S. Senate. \"Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public\", Hersh wrote. \"The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the president by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the president was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors.\" Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge.<ref>[[Seymour Hersh|Hersh, Seymour]], \"Nixon's Last Cover-Up: The Tapes He Wants the Archives to Suppress\"; ''[[The New Yorker]]'', December 14, 1992, pp. 80\u201381</ref> In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe resulting publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip,<ref name=\"salon\">[http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= Dogpatch confidential - Salon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304230031/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= |date=2008-03-04}}</ref> and Capp, already in failing health, withdrew from public speaking. [[Celebrity biographer]] James Spada has claimed that similar allegations were made by actress [[Grace Kelly]]. However, no firsthand allegation has ever surfaced.<ref>Spada, James, ''Grace: The Secret Lives of a Princess''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Company, 1987, p.37</ref>\n\n\"From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in ''Abner'' waned, and this showed in the strip itself,\" according to [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]''. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to declining health. \"If you have any sense of humor about your strip\u2014and I had a sense of humor about mine\u2014you knew that for three or four years ''Abner'' was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,\" he admitted,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948819,00.html Mr. Dogpatch - 1979 TIME obituary]</ref> adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. \"When he retired ''Li'l Abner'', newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. ''[[People magazine]]'' ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' devoted nearly a full page to the event\", wrote publisher [[Denis Kitchen]].\n\nCapp's final years were marked by advancing illness and by family tragedy. In October 1977, one of his two daughters died; a few weeks later, a beloved granddaughter was killed in a car accident. A lifelong chain smoker, Capp died in 1979 from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]].<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x546276190/Al-Capp-was-here Al Capp Was Here ''Newburyport Daily News'' Sept. 27, 2009]</ref> Capp is buried in Mount Prospect Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Engraved on his headstone is a stanza from [[Thomas Gray]]: ''The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me'' (from ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'', 1751).\n\n==Legacy==\n\"Neither the strip's shifting political leanings nor the slide of its final few years had any bearing on its status as a classic; and in 1995, it was recognized as such by the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]]\", according to ''Toonopedia''. ''Li'l Abner'' was one of 20 American comic strips included in the [[Comic Strip Classics]] series of USPS [[commemorative stamp]]s. Al Capp, an inductee into the [[National Cartoon Museum]] (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art), is one of only 31 artists selected to their [[Hall of Fame]]. Capp was also inducted into the [[Will Eisner Award]] Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n[[Sadie Hawkins Day]] and [[:wikt:double whammy|double whammy]] are two terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the English language. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include [[skunk works]] and [[Lower Slobbovia]]. The term [[shmoo]] also has entered the [[lexicon]], defining highly technical concepts in no fewer than ''four'' separate fields of science, including the variations [[Mating of yeast|shmooing]] (a [[microbiological]] term for the \"budding\" process in yeast reproduction), and [[shmoo plot]] (a technical term in the field of [[electrical engineering]]). In [[socioeconomics]], a \"shmoo\" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to \"[[widget (economics)|widget]]s\" which require resources and active production). In the field of [[particle physics]], \"shmoo\" refers to a high energy survey instrument, as used at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to capture subatomic [[cosmic ray]] particles emitted from the [[Cygnus X-3]] [[constellation]]. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|druthers]], [[schmooze]], and [[-nik|nogoodnik, neatnik, etc.]] In his book ''[[The American Language]]'', [[H.L. Mencken]] credits the postwar mania for adding \"-nik\" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning\u2014not with [[beatnik]] or [[Sputnik]]\u2014but earlier, in the pages of ''Li'l Abner''.\n\nAl Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized [[mural]] commemorating the 100th anniversary of his birth. Created by resident artist [[Jon P. Mooers]], the mural was unveiled in downtown [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]] on May 15, 2010.<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1612544031/Town-to-honor-famous-cartoonist-who-lived-worked-in-Amesbury#comment-45683673 Town to Honor Famous Cartoonist Who Lived, Worked in Amesbury ''Newburyport Daily News'' April 20, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/15/amesbury_gives_lil_abner_his_due/?page=full Amesbury Gives Li'l Abner His Due ''Boston Globe'' May 15, 2010]</ref> According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum. Capp is also the subject of an upcoming [[WNET-TV]] ''[[American Masters]]'' [[documentary]], ''The Life and Times of Al Capp'', produced by his granddaughter, independent filmmaker Caitlin Manning.\n\nSince his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. [[Underground comix|Underground cartoonist]] and ''Li'l Abner'' expert [[Denis Kitchen]] has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as consultant on nearly all of them. Kitchen is currently compiling a biographical [[monograph]] on Al Capp.\n\nAt the [[San Diego Comic Con]] in July 2009, [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] announced the upcoming publication of ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Complete Dailies and Color Sundays'' as part of their ongoing [[The Library of American Comics]] series. The comprehensive series, a reprinting of the entire 43-year history of ''Li'l Abner'' spanning a projected 20 volumes, began on April 7, 2010.<ref>[http://www.libraryofamericancomics.com/catalog/series/1101/ IDW Library of American Comics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511032402/http://www.libraryofamericancomics.com/catalog/series/1101/ |date=2010-05-11 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category-inline|Al Capp}}\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner in New York'' (1936) [[Whitman Publishing]]\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner Among the Millionaires'' (1939) Whitman Publishing\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner and Sadie Hawkins Day'' (1940) [[Saalfield Publishing]]\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner and the Ratfields'' (1940) Saalfield Publishing\n*Sheridan, Martin, ''Comics and Their Creators'' (1942) R.T.

He also wrote the comic strips ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' (in the years 1937\u201345) and ''[[Long Sam]]'' (1954). He won the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year, and their 1979 [[E. C. Segar|Elzie Segar Award]], posthumously for his \"unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning\". Comic strips dealt with northern urban experiences until the year Capp introduced \"Li'l Abner\", the first strip based in the South. Although Capp was from Connecticut, he spent 43 years teaching the world about Dogpatch, reaching an estimated 60 million readers in more than 900 American newspapers and 100 foreign papers in 28 countries. [[M. Thomas Inge]] says Capp made a large personal fortune through the strip and \"had a profound influence on the way the world viewed the American South\".<ref>M.

Capp's parents were both natives of [[Latvia]] whose families had migrated to New Haven in the 1880s. \"My mother and father had been brought to this country from Russia when they were infants\", wrote Capp in 1978. \"Their fathers had found that the great promise of America was true&nbsp;\u2014 it was no crime to be a Jew.\" The Caplins were dirt-poor, and Capp later recalled stories of his mother going out in the night to sift through ash barrels for reusable bits of coal.\n\nIn August 1919, at the age of nine, Capp was run down by a [[Tram|trolley car]] and had to have his left leg amputated, well above the knee.<ref>See [http://lil-abner.com/al-capp/ Li'l Abner Official Site: Al Capp biography]</ref> According to his father Otto's unpublished autobiography, young Capp was not prepared for the amputation beforehand; having been in a coma for days, he suddenly awoke to discover that his leg was removed.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) p. 4</ref> He was eventually given a prosthetic leg, but only learned to use it by adopting a slow way of walking which became increasingly painful as he grew older.<ref>See [http://www.tcj.com/reviews/al-capp-a-life-to-the-contrary/ Review: \"Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary,\" by R.C. Harvey, published March 14, 2013]</ref> The childhood tragedy of losing a leg likely helped shape Capp's cynical worldview, which was darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist.<ref>see [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811832,00.html \"Inhuman Man,\" ''Time'', February 6, 1950]</ref> \"I was indignant as hell about that leg\", he would reveal in a November 1950 interview in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.\n\n\"The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else\", Capp philosophically wrote (in ''[[Life magazine]]'' on May 23, 1960), \"was to be indifferent to that difference.\"<ref>see [https://books.google.com/books?id=3k4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA129&dq=Al+Capp&as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&q=Al%20Capp&f=false ''Life'', 23 May 1960, pp. 129\u2013140]</ref> The prevailing opinion among his friends was that Capp's [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.\n[[File:Al Capp Self-portrait April 1951.JPG|right|450px|thumb|\"I do ''Li'l Abner!!'',\" a self-portrait by Al Capp, excerpted from the<br />April 16\u201317, 1951 ''Li'l Abner'' strips; note the reference to [[Milton Caniff]]]]\nCapp's father, a failed businessman and an amateur cartoonist, introduced him to drawing as a form of therapy. He became quite proficient, advancing mostly on his own. Among his earliest influences were ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoonist\u2013illustrator [[Phil May (caricaturist)|Phil May]], and American comic strip cartoonists [[Thomas Aloysius Dorgan|Tad Dorgan]], [[Cliff Sterrett]], [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Rudolph Dirks]], [[Frederick Burr Opper|Fred Opper]], [[Billy DeBeck]], [[George McManus]], and [[Milt Gross]]. At about this same time, Capp became a voracious reader. According to Capp's brother Elliot, Alfred had finished all of Shakespeare and [[George Bernard Shaw]] by the time he turned 13. Among his childhood favorites were [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Booth Tarkington]], and later, [[Robert Benchley]] and [[S. J. Perelman]].\n\nCapp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], without receiving a diploma.

Capp already had decided to become a cartoonist. \"I heard that [[Bud Fisher]] (creator of ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'') got $3,000 a week and was constantly marrying French countesses\", Capp said. \"I decided that was for me.\"\n\nIn early 1932, Capp hitchhiked to [[New York City]]. He lived in \"airless rat holes\" in [[Greenwich Village]] and turned out advertising strips at $2-apiece while scouring the city hunting for jobs. He eventually found work at the [[Associated Press]] when he was 23 years old. By March 1932, Capp was drawing ''Colonel Gilfeather'', a single-panel, AP-owned property created in 1930 by [[Richard Dorgan|Dick Dorgan]]. Capp changed the focus and title to ''Mister Gilfeather'', but soon grew to hate the feature. He left the Associated Press in September 1932. Before leaving, he met [[Milton Caniff]] and the two became lifelong friends. Capp moved to [[Boston]] and married Catherine Wingate Cameron, whom he had met earlier in art class. She died in 2006 at the age of 96.\n\nLeaving his new wife with her parents in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], he subsequently returned to New York in 1933, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]]. \"I was 23, I carried a mass of drawings, and I had nearly five dollars in my pocket. People were sleeping in alleys then, willing to work at anything.\" There he met [[Ham Fisher]], who hired him to ghost on ''[[Joe Palooka]]''. During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's ''Joe Palooka'' [[story arc]] introduced a stupid, coarse, oafish mountaineer named \"Big Leviticus,\" a crude [[prototype]]. (Leviticus was much closer to Capp's later villains Lem and Luke Scragg, than to the much more appealing and innocent Li'l Abner.)\n\nAlso during this period, Capp was working at night on samples for the strip that would eventually become ''[[Li'l Abner]]''. He based his cast of characters on the authentic mountain-dwellers he met while hitchhiking through rural [[West Virginia]] and the [[Cumberland Valley]] as a teenager. (This was years before the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Act brought basic utilities such as electricity and running water to the region.) Leaving ''Joe Palooka'', Capp sold ''Li'l Abner'' to [[United Feature Syndicate]] (later known as [[United Media]]). The feature was launched on Monday, August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers&mdash;including the ''[[New York Mirror]]''&mdash;and was an immediate success. Alfred G. Caplin eventually became \"Al Capp\" because the syndicate felt the original would not fit in a cartoon frame.<ref>A review of the 1934 strips reveals that the earliest strips were signed \"Al G. Cap\", which became \"Al G. Capp\" and, finally, \"Al Capp\". However, the middle initial (\"Al G. Capp\") appeared from time to time during the first year.</ref> Capp had his name changed legally in 1949.\n\nHis younger brother [[Elliot Caplin]] also became a comic strip writer, best known for co-creating the [[soap opera]] strip ''[[The Heart of Juliet Jones]]'' with artist [[Stan Drake]] and conceiving the comic strip character ''[[Broom-Hilda]]'' with cartoonist [[Russell Myers]]. Elliot also authored several off-Broadway plays, including ''A Nickel for Picasso'' (1981), which was based on and dedicated to his mother and his famous brother.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/nyregion/theater-a-new-play-explores-fantasies-of-a-man-at-60.html ''New York Times'' theater column by Alvin Klein, November 8, 1987]</ref>\n\n==''Li'l Abner''==\n{{Main|Li'l Abner}}\nWhat began as a [[hillbilly]] [[burlesque]] soon evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular, and well-drawn strips of the twentieth century. Featuring vividly outlandish characters, bizarre situations, and equal parts [[suspense]], [[slapstick]], [[irony]], [[satire]], [[black humor]], and biting [[social commentary]], ''Li'l Abner'' is considered a classic of the genre. The comic strip stars Li'l Abner Yokum\u2014the simple-minded, loutish but good-natured, and eternally innocent hayseed who lives with his parents\u2014scrawny but superhuman Mammy Yokum, and shiftless, childlike Pappy Yokum.\n\n\"Yokum\" was a combination of ''yokel'' and ''hokum'', although Capp established a deeper meaning for the name during a series of visits around 1965\u20131970 with comics historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price. \"It's phonetic [[Hebrew]]\u2014that's what it is, all right\u2014and that's what I was getting at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound ''hickish''\", said Capp. \"That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it's a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name\u2014''[[Joachim]]'' means 'God's determination', something like that\u2014that also happens to have a rustic ring to it.\"<ref>[http://www.comicmix.com/news/2007/11/11/li-l-abner-lost-in-hollywood-shuffle-by-michael-h-price/ \"Li'l Abner Lost In Hollywood\" by Michael H. Price]</ref>\n\nThe Yokums live in the backwater hamlet of [[Dogpatch]], [[Kentucky]]. Described by its creator as \"an average stone-age community\", Dogpatch mostly consists of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, pine trees, \"tarnip\" fields, and \"hawg\" wallows. Whatever energy Abner had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae Scragg, his sexy, well-endowed (but virtuous) girlfriend\u2014until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This newsworthy event made the cover of ''Life'' on March 31, 1952.\n\nCapp peopled his comic strip with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Hairless Joe, Lonesome Polecat, Evil-Eye Fleegle, General Bullmoose, Lena the Hyena, Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Capp's caricature of the anti-[[New Deal]] [[Dixiecrats]]), the ''(shudder!)'' Scraggs, Available Jones, Nightmare Alice, Earthquake McGoon, and a host of others. Most notably, certainly from a [[GI (military)|G.I.]] point of view, are the beautiful, full-figured women such as Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Stupefyin' Jones, and Moonbeam McSwine (a caricature of his wife Catherine, aside from the dirt)\u2014all of whom found their way onto the [[nose art|painted noses]] of [[bomber aircraft|bomber planes]] during World War II and the Korean War. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the [[Shmoo]]s, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was [[Joe Btfsplk]], who wants to be a loving friend, but is \"the world's worst jinx\", bringing bad luck to all those nearby. Btfsplk (his name is \"pronounced\" by simply blowing a \"raspberry\" or [[Bronx cheer (gesture)|Bronx cheer]]) always has an iconic dark cloud over his head.\n\nDogpatch residents regularly combat the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials, and intellectuals with their homespun simplicity. Situations often take the characters to other destinations, including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, and some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's invention. The last includes El Passionato, Kigmyland, The Republic of Crumbumbo, Skunk Hollow, The Valley of the Shmoon, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, and a miserable frozen wasteland known as [[Lower Slobbovia]], a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy that remains a contemporary reference.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Russell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/13/opinion/observer-hillary-in-lower-slobbovia.html |title=Hillary in Lower Slobbovia - '&#39;NY Times'&#39; Jan. 13, 1996 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-01-13 |access-date=2009-08-29}}</ref> \"Indeed, ''Li'l Abner'' incorporates such a panoply of characters and ideas that it defies summary\", according to cultural historian Anthony Harkins. \"Yet though Capp's storylines often wandered far afield, his hillbilly setting remained a central touchstone, serving both as a microcosm and a distorting carnival mirror of broader American society.\"<ref>''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon'' by Anthony Harkins (2004, Oxford Univ. Press) pp. 124\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe strip's popularity grew from an original eight papers, to ultimately more than 900. At its peak, ''Li'l Abner'' was estimated to have been read daily in the United States by 60 to 70 million people (the U.S. population at the time was only 180 million), with adult readers far outnumbering children. Many communities, high schools and colleges staged [[Sadie Hawkins dance]]s, patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.\n\nLi'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question \"Which side does Abner part his hair on?\", Capp would answer, \"Both.\" Capp said he finally found the right \"look\" for Li'l Abner with [[Henry Fonda]]'s character Dave Tolliver, in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=U99JAAAAMAAJ&q=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&dq=fonda+%22li%27l+abner%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=0 Steen, Mike ''Hollywood Speaks: An Oral History'' Putnam, 1974]</ref> In later years, Capp always claimed to have effectively created the [[miniskirt]], when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.\n\n==Parodies, toppers, and alternate strips==\n''Li'l Abner'' also features a comic strip-within-the-strip: ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'' is a parody of [[Chester Gould]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy]]''. It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently during the next 35 years. Gould was parodied personally in the series as cartoonist \"Lester Gooch\"\u2014the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged \"creator\" of Fosdick. The style of the ''Fosdick'' sequences closely mimicks ''Tracy'', including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping [[mortality rate]], the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style. In 1952, Fosdick was the star of his own short-lived [[puppet show]] on [[NBC]], featuring the Mary Chase [[marionette]]s.\n\nBesides ''Dick Tracy'', Capp parodied many other comic strips in ''Li'l Abner''\u2014including ''[[Steve Canyon]]'', ''[[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]]'' (at least twice; first as \"Jack Jawbreaker\" in 1947, and again in 1966 as \"Chickensouperman\"), ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\", ''[[Peanuts]]'' {with \"Peewee\" a parody of Charlie Brown with \"Croopy\" parody of [[Snoopy]]\" {1968} drawn by Bedley Damp a parody of [[Charles Schulz]]}, ''[[Rex Morgan, M.D.]]'', ''[[Little Annie Rooney]]'', and ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' (in which Punjab became \"Punjbag,\" an oleaginous slob). ''Fearless Fosdick''\u2014and Capp's other spoofs such as \"Little Fanny Gooney\" (1952) and \"Jack Jawbreaker\"\u2014were almost certainly an early inspiration for [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s ''[[Mad Magazine]]'', which began in 1952 as a [[comic book]] that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.\n\nCapp also lampooned popular recording idols of the day, such as [[Elvis Presley]] (\"Hawg McCall\", 1957), [[Liberace]] (\"Loverboynik\", 1956), [[the Beatles]] (\"the Beasties\", 1964)\u2014and in 1944, [[Frank Sinatra]]. \"Sinatra was the first great public figure I ever wrote about,\" Capp once said. \"I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, and we were all surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always made it a point to send me a spent condom whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant{{nbsp}}...\" (from ''Frank Sinatra, My Father'' by [[Nancy Sinatra]], 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was \"cut to the quick\" over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action\u2014as would [[Joan Baez]] later, over \"Joanie Phoanie\" in 1967.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Capp/ UPI Photo/Files Al Capp Jan. 11, 1967]</ref>\n\nCapp was just as likely to parody himself; his self-caricature made frequent, tongue-in-cheek appearances in ''Li'l Abner''.<ref>''Anything Can Happen in a Comic Strip: Centennial Reflections on an American Art Form'' by [[M. Thomas Inge]] (1995) University Press of Mississippi, pp. 18\u201319</ref> The gag was often at his own expense, as in the above 1951 sequence showing Capp's interaction with \"fans\" (see excerpt), or in his 1955 [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] parody, \"Hal Yappland\". Just about anything could be a target for Capp's satire\u2014in one storyline Li'l Abner is revealed to be the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] between ape and man. In another, the search is on in Dogpatch for a pair of missing socks knitted by the first president of the United States.\n \nIn addition to creating ''Li'l Abner'', Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: ''[[Abbie an' Slats]]'' with magazine illustrator [[Raeburn van Buren]] in 1937, and ''[[Long Sam]]'' with cartoonist [[Bob Lubbers]] in 1954, as well as the Sunday \"[[topper (comic strip)|topper]]\" strips ''Washable Jones'', ''Small Fry'' (a.k.a. ''Small Change''), and ''Advice fo' Chillun''.\n\n==Critical recognition==\nAccording to comics historian [[Coulton Waugh]], a 1947 poll of newspaper readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed to making a single exception: ''Li'l Abner''. \"When ''Li'l Abner'' made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into ''Li'l Abner''. The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines having nothing to do with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique\u2014as invigorating as it was unorthodox\u2014was later adopted by cartoonists such as [[Walt Kelly]] [''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]''] and [[Garry Trudeau]] [''[[Doonesbury]]'']\", wrote comic strip historian [[Rick Marschall]]. According to Marschall, ''Li'l Abner'' gradually evolved into a broad satire of [[human nature]]. In his book ''America's Great Comic Strip Artists'' (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] subtext.\n\nOver the years, ''Li'l Abner'' has been adapted to radio, [[Character animation|animated cartoons]], stage production, [[motion pictures]], and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to Mark Twain, [[Dostoevski]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], and [[Rabelais]].<ref>Brown, Rodger, \"Dogpatch USA: The Road to Hokum\" article, ''Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council'', Vol. 15, No. 3, 1993, pp. 18-26</ref> Fans of the strip ranged from novelist [[John Steinbeck]], who called Capp \"possibly the best writer in the world today\" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature\u2014to media critic and theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]], who considered Capp \"the only robust satirical force in American life\". [[John Updike]], comparing Abner to a \"hillbilly [[Candide]]\", added that the strip's \"richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the [[Voltairean]]\".<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, ''City Journal,'' Spring 2010]</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[William F.

''Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire'' by [[Arthur Asa Berger]] (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature, and grotesquerie, the place of ''Li'l Abner'' in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. \"One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,\" wrote Professor Berger, \"''Li'l Abner'' is worth studying ... because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.\" It was reprinted by the [[University Press of Mississippi]] in 1994.\n\n==The 1940s and 1950s==\n[[File:Cappbio46.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Al Capp drew his own autobiography, the 34-page ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'' (1946), that was distributed to returning World War II amputee veterans.]]\nDuring World War II and for many years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to [[hospital]]s to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his [[prosthetic]] leg his whole life. In 1946, Capp created a special full-color comic book, ''Al Capp by Li'l Abner'', to be distributed by the [[Red Cross]] to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp also was involved with the [[Elizabeth Kenny|Sister Kenny Foundation]], which pioneered new treatments for [[polio]] in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fundraising appeals, and entertained crippled and [[paraplegic]] children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories, and sketches.<ref>[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/05/dont-keep-remembering-what-youve-lost.html Letters of Note: Dear Chip... (Columbus Hospital, 28 May 1964)]</ref>\n\nIn 1940, an [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] [[Li'l Abner (1940 film)|movie adaptation]] starred Granville Owen (later known as [[Jeff York]]) as Li'l Abner, with [[Buster Keaton]] taking the role of Lonesome Polecat, and featuring a title song with lyrics by [[Milton Berle]]. A successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the St. James Theater on November 15, 1956, and had a long run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. The [[Li'l Abner (musical)|stage musical]], with music and lyrics by [[Gene de Paul]] and [[Johnny Mercer]], was adapted into a [[Technicolor]] [[Li'l Abner (1959 film)|motion picture]] at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] in 1959 by producer [[Norman Panama]] and director [[Melvin Frank]], with a score by [[Nelson Riddle]]. Several performers repeated their Broadway roles in the film, most memorably [[Julie Newmar]] as Stupefyin' Jones and [[Stubby Kaye]] as Marryin' Sam.<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F04E3D9103CE63BBC4A52DFB4678382649EDE The Screen 'Li'l Abner' - New York Times Review]</ref>\n\nOther highlights of that decade included the 1942 debut of Fearless Fosdick as Abner's \"ideel\" (hero); the 1946 Lena the Hyena Contest, in which a hideous Lower Slobbovian gal was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, [[Boris Karloff]], and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]]) drawn by noted cartoonist [[Basil Wolverton]]; and an ill-fated Sunday parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' that aroused anger and legal threats from author [[Margaret Mitchell]], and led to a printed apology within the strip. In October 1947, Li'l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Comic Strip Syndicate. The resulting sequence, \"Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!\", was a devastating satire of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s notorious exploitation by [[DC Comics]] over ''[[Superman]]''. It was later reprinted in ''The World of Li'l Abner'' (1953). (Siegel and Shuster had earlier poked fun at Capp in a ''Superman'' story in ''[[Action Comics]] #55'', December 1942, in which a cartoonist named \"Al Hatt\" invents a comic strip featuring the hillbilly \"Tiny Rufe\".)\n\nIn 1947, Capp earned a ''[[Newsweek]]'' cover story. That same year the ''[[New Yorker magazine|New Yorker's]]'' profile on him was so long that it ran in consecutive issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak with the introduction of the [[Shmoo]]s, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was [[metaphor]]ically interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]].\n\nFollowing his close friend Milton Caniff's lead (with ''[[Steve Canyon]]''), Capp had recently fought a successful battle with the syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950\u2014including a ''Time'' cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, ''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'', became a bestseller for [[Simon & Schuster]]. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, [[Halloween]] masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other Shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in [[Baltimore]] turned out a whole line of Shmoo apparel, including \"Shmooveralls\". The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, ''The Return of the Shmoo'', have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos would later have their own animated television series.\n\nCapp followed this success with other [[allegory|allegorical]] fantasy critters, including the aboriginal and [[Self-defeating personality disorder|masochistic]] \"Kigmies\", who craved abuse (a story that began as a veiled comment on racial and religious oppression), the dreaded \"Nogoodniks\" (or ''bad'' shmoos), and the irresistible \"Bald Iggle\", a guileless creature whose sad-eyed countenance compelled involuntary truthfulness\u2014with predictably disastrous results.\n\n''Li'l Abner'' was [[censorship|censored]] for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by [[Scripps-Howard]]. The controversy, as reported in ''Time'', centered on Capp's portrayal of the [[United States Senate]]. Edward Leech of Scripps said, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks&nbsp;... boobs and undesirables.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,804275,00.html Tain't Funny - TIME]</ref> Capp criticized [[Senator Joseph McCarthy]] in 1954, calling him a \"poet\". \"He uses [[poetic license]] to try to create the beautifully ordered world of good guys and bad guys that he wants,\" said Capp. \"He seems at his best when terrifying the helpless and na\u00efve.\"<ref>\"Poet: Cartoonist Al Capp said in New York{{nbsp}}...\" quoted in ''The Argus'', 10 May 1954</ref>\n\nCapp received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s [[National Cartoonists Society#Billy DeBeck Memorial Award|Billy DeBeck Memorial Award]] in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year. (When the award name was changed in 1954, Capp also retroactively received a [[National Cartoonists Society#Reuben Award|Reuben]] statuette.) He was an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the NCS by admitting women cartoonists. Originally, the Society had disallowed female members. Capp briefly resigned his membership in 1949 to protest their refusal of admission to [[Hilda Terry]], creator of the comic strip ''[[Teena]]''. According to Tom Roberts, author of ''[[Alex Raymond]]: His Life and Art'' (2007), Capp delivered a stirring speech that was instrumental in changing those rules. The NCS finally accepted female members the following year. In December 1952, Capp published an article in ''Real'' magazine entitled \"The REAL Powers in America\" that further challenged the conventional attitudes of the day: \"The real powers in America are ''women''\u2014the wives and sweethearts behind the masculine dummies&nbsp;...\"\n\nHighlights of the 1950s included the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, the birth of their son \"Honest Abe\" Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long-lost kid brother Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both ''Life'' and ''[[TV Guide]]''. 1956 saw the debut of Bald Iggle, considered by some ''Abner'' enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the \"Square Eyes\" Family\u2014Capp's thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This [[fable]]-like story was collected into an educational comic book called ''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!'', and distributed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] later that year.) Two years later, Capp's studio issued ''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]'', a biographical comic book distributed by the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]].<ref name=Grio>Love, David A.

Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when [[General Motors]] president [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]], nominated for a cabinet post, told [[United States Congress|Congress]] \"...&nbsp;what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa\", he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires\u2014the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying \"What's good for General Bullmoose is good for ''everybody!''\" Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of \"haves\" versus \"have-nots\". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.\n\n==Feud with Ham Fisher==\nAfter Capp quit his ghosting job on [[Ham Fisher]]'s ''Joe Palooka'' in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had \"stolen\" his idea. For years, Fisher would bring the characters back to his strip, billing them as \"The ORIGINAL Hillbilly Characters\" and advising readers not to be \"fooled by imitations\". (In fact, Fisher's brutish hillbilly character\u2014Big Leviticus, created by Capp in Fisher's absence\u2014bore little resemblance to Li'l Abner.) According to a November 1950 ''Time'' article, \"Capp parted from Fisher with a definite impression, (to put it mildly) that he had been underpaid and unappreciated. Fisher, a man of Roman self esteem, considered Capp an ingrate and a whippersnapper, and watched his rise to fame with unfeigned horror.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813720-7,00.html Die Monstersinger - TIME]</ref>\n\n\"Fisher repeatedly brought Leviticus and his clan back, claiming their primacy as comics' first hillbilly family&nbsp;\u2014 but he was missing the point. It wasn't the setting that made Capp's strip such a huge success. It was Capp's finely tuned sense of the absurd, his ability to milk an outrageous situation for every laugh in it and then, impossibly, to squeeze even more laughs from it, that found such favor with the public,\" (from [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]'').<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/abner.htm Don Markstein's Toonopedia / Li'l Abner]</ref>\n\nThe Capp-Fisher feud was well known in cartooning circles, and it grew more personal as Capp's strip eclipsed ''Joe Palooka'' in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, [[Moe Leff]]. After Fisher underwent [[plastic surgery]], Capp included a racehorse in ''Li'l Abner'' named \"Ham's Nose-Bob\". In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named \"Happy Vermin\"\u2014a caricature of Fisher\u2014who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet (after sacking his previous \"temporary\" assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: \"I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do&nbsp;\u2014 I'll get ''you'' a new light bulb!!\"\n\nTraveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in 1998: \"They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city's gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks.\"<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html Maeder, Jay. \u201cSpitting on Pictures Funny Papers, 1955\u201d, ''Daily News'', September 18, 1998.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008035428/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1998/09/18/1998-09-18_spitting_on_pictures_funny_p.html |date=October 8, 2009 }}</ref> In 1950, Capp wrote a nasty article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', entitled \"I Remember Monster\". The article recounted Capp's days working for an unnamed \"benefactor\" with a miserly, swinish personality, who Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip. The thinly-veiled boss was understood to be Ham Fisher.\n\nFisher retaliated, doctoring photostats of ''Li'l Abner'' and falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Fisher submitted examples of ''Li'l Abner'' to Capp's syndicate and to the New York courts, in which Fisher had identified pornographic images that were hidden in the background art. However, the X-rated material had been drawn there by Fisher. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original artwork.\n\nIn 1954, when Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) received an anonymous packet of pornographic ''Li'l Abner'' drawings. The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled for the forgery from the same organization that he had helped found; Fisher's scheme had backfired in spectacular fashion. Around the same time, his mansion in Wisconsin was destroyed by a storm. On December 27, 1955, Fisher committed suicide in his studio. The feud and Fisher's suicide were used as the basis for a lurid, highly fictionalized murder mystery, ''Strip for Murder'' by [[Max Allan Collins]].\n\nAnother \"feud\" seemed to be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip ''[[Mary Worth]]'' as \"Mary Worm\". The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. [[Allen Saunders]], the creator of the ''Mary Worth'' strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character \"Hal Rapp\", a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a [[teetotaler]]{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}). Later, the \"feud\" was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders \"feud\" fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips\u2014and Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893653,00.html Rap for Capp - TIME]</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nCapp is often associated with two other giants of the medium: [[Milton Caniff]] (''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', ''Steve Canyon'') and [[Walt Kelly]] (''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]''). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally, referenced each other in their strips. According to one [[anecdote]] (from ''Al Capp Remembered'', 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home\u2014leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's [[baby grand piano]]. According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between [[Argentina]] and the United States, and b. \"Because you can't play the piano, anyway!\" (''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' creator [[Mort Walker]] confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, ''Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook'', 2001.)\n\nMilton Caniff offered another anecdote (from ''Phi Beta Pogo'', 1989) involving Capp and Walt Kelly, \"two boys from [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], nose to nose,\" onstage at a meeting of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. \"Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing ''his'' version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them&nbsp;...\"\n\nAlthough he was often considered a difficult person,<ref name=\"printmag.com\">http://www.printmag.com/interviews/lil-abner-al-capp-monster-cartoonist/</ref> some acquaintances of Capp have stressed that the cartoonist also had a sensitive side. In 1973, when learning that the son of his political rival, [[Ted Kennedy]], had his right leg amputated, Capp wrote the boy a letter of encouragement, giving candid advice as to how to deal with the loss of a limb,<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.243</ref> which he had experienced as a boy. One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, tears were streaming down the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the [[Jonestown]] massacre.<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, ''Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary'' (2013) [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], p.244</ref> Also, it is reported that Capp gave money anonymously to charities and \"people in need\" at various points in his life.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/>\n\n==Sexual misconduct claims==\nIn her autobiography, American actress [[Goldie Hawn]] stated that Capp sexually propositioned her on a [[casting couch]] and exposed himself to her when she was nineteen years old. When she refused his advances, Capp became angry and told her that she was \"never gonna make anything in your life\" and that she should \"go and marry a Jewish dentist. You'll never get anywhere in this business.\"<ref name=couch>[http://people.com/movies/goldie-hawn-remembers-casting-couch-sexual-predator-who-left-her-in-tears-at-19/ Goldie Hawn Remembers the Casting-Couch Sexual Predator Who Left Her in Tears]</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LrI-86BHE0QC&pg=PT113&lpg=PT113&dq=a+lotus+grows+in+the+mud+al+capp#v=onepage&q=a%20lotus%20grows%20in%20the%20mud%20al%20capp&f=false |title=A Lotus Grows in the Mud |last=Hawn |first=Goldie |date=2006-02-28 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9781101205327 |language=en}}</ref>\nTwo biographies, one about Goldie Hawn and the other about [[Grace Kelly]], describe Capp as trying to force Kelly into having sex with him, and he later tried to do the same with Hawn.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/</ref>\n\nIn 1971, investigative journalist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] wrote that Capp had exposed his genitals to four female students at the University of Alabama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/07/12/cartoonist-al-capp-exposed-in-new-bio/2511355/|title=Cartoonist Al Capp exposed in \u2018Life to the Contrary\u2019|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> Then, after an incident at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire, Capp was arrested.

During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics, and other specialty work\u2014in addition to the regular six dailies and one [[Sunday strip]] per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for [[Cream of Wheat]] using the ''Abner'' characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic in a series of daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks\u2014including a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, [[Kickapoo Joy Juice]]\u2014and [[General Electric]] and [[Procter & Gamble]] products, all requiring special artwork.\n\nNo matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on his drawing and inking the characters' faces and hands\u2014especially of Abner and Daisy Mae\u2014and his distinctive touch is often discernible. \"He had ''the touch,''\" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. \"He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it ''pop''. I'll never knock his talent.\"\n\nAs is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited\u2014 although, sensitive to his own experience working on ''Joe Palooka'', Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in ''Time'' even included photographs of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy (along with the subsequent fame of Frank Frazetta) has led to the misconception that his strip was \"ghosted\" by other hands. The production of ''Li'l Abner'' has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the hands and faces of the characters. Frazetta authority David Winiewicz described the everyday working mode of operation in ''Li'l Abner Dailies: 1954 Volume 20'' (Kitchen Sink, 1994):\n\n{{quote|text=By the time Frazetta began working on the strip, the work of producing ''Li'l Abner'' was too much for one person. Capp had a group of assistants who he taught to reproduce his distinctive individual style, working under his direct supervision. Actual production of the strip began with a rough layout in pencil done by Al Capp, from Capp's script or a co-authored script, and the page would pass to Andy Amato and Walter Johnson. Amato would ink the figures, then Johnson added backgrounds and any mechanical objects. Harvey Curtis was responsible for the lettering and also shared inking duties with Amato&nbsp;... In order to make sure that the work stayed true to his style, the final touches would be added by Capp himself. He enjoyed adding a distinctive glint to an eye or an idiosyncratic contortion to a character's face. The finished strip was truly an ensemble effort, a skillful blending of talents.}}\n\nThere was also a separate line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned [[Toby Press]], including ''Shmoo Comics'' featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist [[Mell Lazarus]], creator of ''[[Miss Peach]]'' and ''[[Momma]]'', wrote a comic novel in 1963 entitled ''The Boss Is Crazy, Too'' which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the [[Charles Schulz Museum]] on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby \"the five funniest years of my life\". Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the \"four essentials\" in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, [[Charles Schulz]], and [[Milton Caniff]].\n\nCapp detailed his approach to writing and drawing the stories in an instructional course book for the [[Famous Artists School]], beginning in 1956. In 1959, Capp recorded and released an album for [[Folkways Records]] (now owned by the [[Smithsonian]]) on which he identified and described \"The Mechanics of the Comic Strip\".<ref>[http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1284 An Interview with Al Capp - Smithsonian Folkways]</ref>\n\nFrazetta, later famous as a [[fantasy art]]ist, assisted on the strip from 1954 to December, 1961. Fascinated by Frazetta's abilities, Capp initially gave him a free hand in an extended daily sequence (about a biker named \"Frankie,\" a caricature of Frazetta) to experiment with the basic look of the strip by adding a bit more realism and detail (particularly to the inking). After editors complained about the stylistic changes, the strip's previous look was restored. During most of his tenure with Capp, Frazetta's primary responsibility\u2014along with various specialty art, such as a series of ''Li'l Abner'' greeting cards\u2014was tight-penciling the Sunday pages from studio roughs. This work was collected by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in a four-volume hardcover series entitled ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Frazetta Years''. In 1961, Capp, complaining of declining revenue, wanted to have Frazetta continue with a 50% pay cut. \"[Capp] said he would cut the salary in half. Goodbye. That was that. ''I'' said goodbye,\" (from ''Frazetta: Painting with Fire''). However, Frazetta returned briefly a few years later to draw a public service comic book called ''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space'', distributed by the [[Job Corps]] in 1965.\n\n==Public service works==\nCapp provided specialty artwork for civic groups, government agencies, and charitable or nonprofit organizations, spanning several decades.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708021015/http://cartoonician.com/2012/05/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/ |date=8 July 2012 }}</ref> The following titles are all single-issue, educational comic books and pamphlets produced for various [[public services]]:\n\n*''Al Capp by Li'l Abner''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] (1946)\n*''Yo' Bets Yo' Life!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Army]] (circa 1950)\n*''Li'l Abner Joins the Navy''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Navy|Dept. of the Navy]] (1950)\n*''Fearless Fosdick and the Case of the Red Feather''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by Red Feather Services, a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]] (1951)\n*''The Youth You Supervise''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (1956)\n*''Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith]] (1956)\n*''Operation: Survival!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Civil Defense|Dept. of Civil Defense]] (1957)\n*''Natural Disasters!''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the Department of Civil Defense (1957)\n*''[[Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story]]''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by [[The Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (1958)<ref name=Grio />\n*''Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space''\u2014 Public service giveaway issued by the [[Job Corps]] (1965)\n\nIn addition, Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the [[U.S. Treasury]], the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the Sister Kenny Foundation, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]], the National Reading Council, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, [[Christmas Seal & Charity Stamp Society|Christmas Seals]], the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]],<ref name=\"news.google.com\">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2506&dat=19500511&id=DZZIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4AkNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4808,2345975 \"Al Capp Replies to Critic of Newspaper Comic Strips;\" ''The News and Courier'', 11 May 1950]</ref> among others.\n\n==Public figure==\nIn the Golden Age of the American comic strip, successful cartoonists received a great deal of attention; their professional and private lives were reported in the press, and their celebrity was often nearly sufficient to rival their creations. As ''Li'l Abner'' reached its peak years, and following the success of the Shmoos and other high moments in his work, Al Capp achieved a public profile that is still unparalleled in his profession, and arguably exceeded the fame of his strip. \"Capp was the best known, most influential and most controversial cartoonist of his era,\" writes publisher (and leading Shmoo collector) [[Denis Kitchen]]. \"His personal celebrity transcended comics, reaching the public and influencing the culture in a variety of media. For many years he simultaneously produced the daily strip, a weekly syndicated [[newspaper column]], and a 500-station [[radio program]]{{nbsp}}...\" He ran the Boston Summer Theatre with ''[[The Phantom (comics)|The Phantom]]'' cartoonist [[Lee Falk]], bringing in Hollywood actors such as [[Mae West]], [[Melvyn Douglas]], and [[Claude Rains]] to star in their live productions. He even briefly considered running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew]] urged Capp to run in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Massachusetts]] primary in 1970 against [[Ted Kennedy]], but Capp ultimately declined. (He did, however, donate his services as a speaker at a $100-a-plate fundraiser for Republican Congressman [[Jack Kemp]].)\n[[File:Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida.jpg|thumb|Al Capp at 1966 Art Festival in Florida]]\nBesides his use of the comic strip to voice his opinions and display his humor, Capp was a popular guest speaker at universities, and on radio<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779734,00.html The Press: Bane of the Bassinet, ''Time'', 15 March 1948]</ref> and [[television]]. He remains the only cartoonist to be embraced by television; no other comic artist to date has come close to Capp's televised exposure.<ref>[http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reportsitem.aspx?id=102060 Al Capp Views the Networks (April 1952) ''Nieman Reports'']</ref> Capp appeared as a regular on ''[[The Author Meets the Critics]]'' (1948\u2013'54) and made regular, weekly appearances on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' in 1953. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC's ''[[Who Said That?]]'' (1948\u2013'55), and co-hosted DuMont's ''[[What's the Story|What's the Story?]]'' (1953). Between 1952 and 1972, he hosted at least ''five'' television shows\u2013three different [[talk show]]s called ''The Al Capp Show'' (1952 and 1968) and ''Al Capp'' (1971\u2013'72), ''Al Capp's America'' (a live \"chalk talk,\" with Capp providing a barbed commentary while sketching cartoons, 1954), and a CBS game show called ''Anyone Can Win'' (1953). He also hosted similar vehicles on the radio\u2014and was a familiar celebrity guest on various other broadcast programs, including [[NBC Radio]]'s long-running ''[[Monitor (NBC radio)|Monitor]]'' with its famous ''Monitor'' Beacon audio signature, as a commentator dubbed \"An expert of nothing with opinions on everything.\"\n\nHis frequent appearances on NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' spanned three emcees ([[Steve Allen]], [[Jack Paar]], and [[Johnny Carson]]), from the 1950s to the 1970s. One memorable story, as recounted to Johnny Carson, was about his meeting with then-President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. As Capp was ushered into the [[Oval Office]], his [[Prosthesis|prosthetic leg]] suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, \"Call [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed]] (Hospital), or maybe [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda]],\" to which Capp replied, \"Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!\" (Capp also spoofed Carson in his strip, in a 1970 episode called \"The Tommy Wholesome Show\".)\n\nCapp portrayed himself in a cameo role in the [[Bob Hope]] film ''That Certain Feeling'', for which he also provided promotional art. He was interviewed live on ''[[Person to Person]]'' on November 27, 1959, by host [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]]. He also appeared as himself on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'', and guested on [[Ralph Edwards]]' ''[[This Is Your Life]]'' on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, in a wide variety of publications including ''[[Life magazine|Life]]'', ''Show'', ''Pageant'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''Coronet'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Capp was impersonated by comedians [[Rich Little]] and [[David Frye]]. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends [[Milton Caniff]] and Walt Kelly), and\u2014with an irony that would become apparent later\u2014a brand of cigarettes ([[Chesterfield cigarettes|Chesterfield]]).\n\nCapp resumed visiting war amputees during the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]]. He toured Vietnam with the [[USO]], entertaining troops along with [[Art Buchwald]] and [[George Plimpton]]. He served as chairman of the Cartoonists' Committee in President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s People-to-People program in 1954 (although Capp had supported [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] for president in 1952 and 1956),<ref>[http://www.reuben.org/ncs/members/memorium/capp.jpg Al Capp's biography card from the National Cartoonists Society]</ref> which was organized to promote [[Savings bond]]s for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]. Capp had earlier provided the Shmoo for a special Children's Savings Bond in 1949, accompanying President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/presarvin-freedom-al-capp-treasury-man/\"Presarvin' Freedom: Al Capp, Treasury Man,\" ''Hogan's Alley Online Magazine'', 9 May 2012]</ref> During the [[Soviet Union]]'s blockade of [[West Berlin]] in 1948, the commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting inflatable shmoos as part of \"Operation: Little Vittles\". Candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron during the [[humanitarian]] effort. \"When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted,\" (reported in ''[[Newsweek]]''\u2014October 11, 1948).\n\nIn addition to his public service work for charitable organizations for the handicapped, Capp also served on the National Reading Council, which was organized to combat illiteracy. He published a column (\"Wrong Turn Onto Sesame Street\") challenging federally funded [[public television]] endowments in favor of educational comics\u2014which, according to Capp, \"didn't cost a dime in taxes and never had. I pointed out that a kid could enjoy ''[[Sesame Street]]'' ''without'' learning how to read, but he couldn't enjoy comic strips ''unless'' he could read; and that a smaller investment in getting kids to read by supplying them with educational matter in such ''reading'' form might make better sense.\"\n\nCapp's academic interests included being one of nineteen original \"Trustees and Advisors\" for \"Endicott, Junior College for Young Woman\", located in Pride's Crossing (Beverly), Massachusetts, which was founded in 1939. Al Capp is listed in the 1942 Mingotide Yearbook, representing the first graduating class from Endicott Junior College. The yearbook entry includes his credential as a \"Cartoonist for United Feature Syndicate\" and a resident of New York City.\n\n\"Comics,\" wrote Capp in 1970, \"can be a combination of the highest quality of art and text, and many of them are.\" Capp would produce many giveaway educational comic books and [[public services]] pamphlets, spanning several decades, for the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]], the [[United States civil defense|Department of Civil Defense]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]], the [[U.S. Army]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], [[Community Chest (organization)|Community Chest]] (a forerunner of [[United Way of America|United Way]]), and the [[Job Corps]]. Capp's studio provided special artwork for various civic groups and [[nonprofit organizations]] as well. Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the Cancer Foundation, the [[March of Dimes]], the National Heart Fund, the [[Boy Scouts of America]], Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the National Amputation Foundation, and [[Disabled American Veterans]], among others.<ref name=\"news.google.com\"/> They were also used to help sell [[Christmas Seals]].\n\nIn the early 1960s, Capp regularly wrote a column entitled ''Al Capp's Column'' for the newspaper ''The Schenectady Gazette'' (currently ''[[The Daily Gazette]]''). He was the ''[[Playboy]]'' interview subject in December 1965, in a conversation conducted by [[Alvin Toffler]]. In August 1967, Capp was the narrator and host of an ABC network special called ''Do Blondes Have More Fun?'' In 1970, he was the subject of a provocative NBC documentary called ''This Is Al Capp''.\n\n==The 1960s and 1970s==\nCapp and his family lived in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], near [[Harvard]] during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were watching on their television sets was happening live\u2014right in his own neighborhood. Campus [[Far left|radicals]] and \"[[hippies]]\" inevitably became one of Capp's favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing [[counterculture]] icons such as [[Joan Baez]] (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of \"protest songs\").<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html Which One Is the Phoanie? - Time]</ref> The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a [[limousine liberal]], a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, ''And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir''. Another target was Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], parodied as \"Senator O. Noble McGesture\", resident of \"Hyideelsport\". The town name is a play on [[Hyannisport, Massachusetts]], where a number of the Kennedy clan have lived.\n\nCapp became a popular public speaker on college campuses, where he reportedly relished hecklers. He attacked militant antiwar demonstrators, both in his personal appearances and in his strip. He also satirized student political groups. The [[Youth International Party]] (YIP) and [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) emerged in ''Li'l Abner'' as \"Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!\" (SWINE). In an April 1969 letter to ''Time'', Capp insisted, \"The students I blast are not the dissenters, but the destroyers\u2014the less than 4% who lock up deans in washrooms, who burn manuscripts of unpublished books, who make combination pigpens and playpens of their universities. The remaining 96% detest them as heartily as I do.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844734-3,00.html Letters page April 18, 1969 - TIME]</ref>\n\nCapp's increasingly controversial remarks at his campus speeches and during television appearances cost him his semi-regular spot on the ''Tonight Show''. His contentious public persona during this period was captured on a late sixties comedy LP called ''Al Capp On Campus''. The album features his interaction with students at Fresno State College (now [[California State University, Fresno]]) on such topics as \"sensitivity training,\" \"humanitarianism,\" \"abstract art\" (Capp hated it), and \"student protest\". The cover features a cartoon drawing by Capp of wildly dressed, angry hippies carrying protest signs with slogans like \"End Capp Brutality\", \"Abner and Daisy Mae Smoke Pot\", \"Capp Is Over [30, 40, 50\u2014all crossed out] the Hill!!\", and \"If You Like Crap, You'll Like Capp!\"\n\nHighlights of the strip's final decades include \"Boomchik\" (1961), in which America's international prestige is saved by Mammy Yokum, \"Daisy Mae Steps Out\" (1966), a female-empowering tale of Daisy's brazenly audacious \"homewrecker gland\", \"The Lips of Marcia Perkins\" (1967), a satirical, thinly-veiled commentary on [[venereal disease]] and public health warnings, \"Ignoble Savages\" (1968), in which [[Mafia|the Mob]] takes over Harvard, and \"Corporal Crock\" (1973), in which Bullmoose reveals his reactionary cartoon role model, in a tale of obsession and the fanatical world of comic book collecting.\n\nThe cartoonist visited [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] at their 1969 [[Bed-In for Peace]] in [[Montreal]], and their testy exchange later appeared in the documentary film ''[[Imagine: John Lennon]]'' (1988). Introducing himself with the words \"I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?,\" Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins|Two Virgins]]'' nude album cover: \"I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it.\" Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono (\"Good God, you've gotta live with that?\"), and was asked to \"get out\" by [[Derek Taylor]]. Lennon allowed him to stay, however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his ''[[Ballad of John and Yoko]]'' song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: \"Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify ''Capp!'' \"<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/i/imagine-john-lennon-script-transcript.html Imagine: John Lennon Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or documentary movie about John Lennon]</ref>\n\nDespite his political conservatism in the last decade of his life, Capp is reported to have been liberal in some particular causes; he supported [[gay rights]], and did not tolerate any attempts at homophobic jokes.<ref name=\"printmag.com\"/> He is also said to have supported [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and the fight for racial equality in American society, although he was very sceptical of the tactics of [[Black Panthers]] and [[Malcolm X]].<ref>Kitchen, Denis, and Michael Schumacher, Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary (2013) Bloomsbury Publishing, p. 196</ref>\n\nIn 1968, a [[theme park]] called [[Dogpatch USA]] opened at Marble Falls, [[Arkansas]], based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties. By 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch \"founder\" General Jubilation T. Cornpone) had been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and was slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.\n\nOn April 22, 1971, syndicated [[columnist]] Jack Anderson reported allegations that Capp made indecent advances to four female students when he was invited to speak at the [[University of Alabama]] in February 1968. Anderson and an associate confirmed that Capp was shown out of town by university police, but that the incident had been hushed up by the university to avoid negative publicity.<ref>[[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Anderson, Jack]], \"Washington Merry-Go-Round,\" April 22, 1971</ref>\n\nThe following month, Capp was charged in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]], in connection with another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire|University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire]].<ref>\"Al Capp Accused on Moral Counts at Eau Claire U.\"; ''[[The Capital Times]]'', May 7, 1971</ref> Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included [[Sodomy laws in the United States|\"sodomy\"]]. As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty to the charge of \"attempted adultery\" (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |title= Adultery is a crime in Wisconsin {{!}} Law Offices of criminal defense attorneys Christopher Van Wagner and Tracey Wood, Madison WI |access-date= 2008-06-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516092007/http://www.vanwagnerwood.com/CM/Custom/Adultery.asp |archive-date= 2008-05-16 |url-status= dead }}</ref>) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs.<ref>\"Al Capp Admits One Morals Count; Pays $500 Fine\"; ''[[The Capital Times]],'' February 12, 1972</ref> In a December 1992 article for ''[[The New Yorker]],'' [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Charles Colson]] had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against [[Ted Kennedy]] for the U.S. Senate. \"Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public\", Hersh wrote. \"The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the president by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the president was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors.\" Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge.<ref>[[Seymour Hersh|Hersh, Seymour]], \"Nixon's Last Cover-Up: The Tapes He Wants the Archives to Suppress\"; ''[[The New Yorker]]'', December 14, 1992, pp. 80\u201381</ref> In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe resulting publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip,<ref name=\"salon\">[http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= Dogpatch confidential - Salon.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304230031/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2002/09/30/capp/index.html?pn= |date=2008-03-04}}</ref> and Capp, already in failing health, withdrew from public speaking. [[Celebrity biographer]] James Spada has claimed that similar allegations were made by actress [[Grace Kelly]]. However, no firsthand allegation has ever surfaced.<ref>Spada, James, ''Grace: The Secret Lives of a Princess''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday & Company, 1987, p.37</ref>\n\n\"From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in ''Abner'' waned, and this showed in the strip itself,\" according to [[Don Markstein]]'s ''[[Toonopedia]]''. On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to declining health. \"If you have any sense of humor about your strip\u2014and I had a sense of humor about mine\u2014you knew that for three or four years ''Abner'' was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,\" he admitted,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948819,00.html Mr. Dogpatch - 1979 TIME obituary]</ref> adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. \"When he retired ''Li'l Abner'', newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. ''[[People magazine]]'' ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' devoted nearly a full page to the event\", wrote publisher [[Denis Kitchen]].\n\nCapp's final years were marked by advancing illness and by family tragedy. In October 1977, one of his two daughters died; a few weeks later, a beloved granddaughter was killed in a car accident. A lifelong chain smoker, Capp died in 1979 from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] at his home in [[South Hampton, New Hampshire]].<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x546276190/Al-Capp-was-here Al Capp Was Here ''Newburyport Daily News'' Sept. 27, 2009]</ref> Capp is buried in Mount Prospect Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Engraved on his headstone is a stanza from [[Thomas Gray]]: ''The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me'' (from ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'', 1751).\n\n==Legacy==\n\"Neither the strip's shifting political leanings nor the slide of its final few years had any bearing on its status as a classic; and in 1995, it was recognized as such by the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]]\", according to ''Toonopedia''. ''Li'l Abner'' was one of 20 American comic strips included in the [[Comic Strip Classics]] series of USPS [[commemorative stamp]]s. Al Capp, an inductee into the [[National Cartoon Museum]] (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art), is one of only 31 artists selected to their [[Hall of Fame]]. Capp was also inducted into the [[Will Eisner Award]] Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\n[[Sadie Hawkins Day]] and [[:wikt:double whammy|double whammy]] are two terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the English language. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include [[skunk works]] and [[Lower Slobbovia]]. The term [[shmoo]] also has entered the [[lexicon]], defining highly technical concepts in no fewer than ''four'' separate fields of science, including the variations [[Mating of yeast|shmooing]] (a [[microbiological]] term for the \"budding\" process in yeast reproduction), and [[shmoo plot]] (a technical term in the field of [[electrical engineering]]). In [[socioeconomics]], a \"shmoo\" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to \"[[widget (economics)|widget]]s\" which require resources and active production). In the field of [[particle physics]], \"shmoo\" refers to a high energy survey instrument, as used at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] to capture subatomic [[cosmic ray]] particles emitted from the [[Cygnus X-3]] [[constellation]]. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as [[List of American words not widely used in the United Kingdom|druthers]], [[schmooze]], and [[-nik|nogoodnik, neatnik, etc.]] In his book ''[[The American Language]]'', [[H.L. Mencken]] credits the postwar mania for adding \"-nik\" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning\u2014not with [[beatnik]] or [[Sputnik]]\u2014but earlier, in the pages of ''Li'l Abner''.\n\nAl Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized [[mural]] commemorating the 100th anniversary of his birth. Created by resident artist [[Jon P. Mooers]], the mural was unveiled in downtown [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]] on May 15, 2010.<ref>[http://www.newburyportnews.com/local/x1612544031/Town-to-honor-famous-cartoonist-who-lived-worked-in-Amesbury#comment-45683673 Town to Honor Famous Cartoonist Who Lived, Worked in Amesbury ''Newburyport Daily News'' April 20, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2010/05/15/amesbury_gives_lil_abner_his_due/?page=full Amesbury Gives Li'l Abner His Due ''Boston Globe'' May 15, 2010]</ref> According to the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum. Capp is also the subject of an upcoming [[WNET-TV]] ''[[American Masters]]'' [[documentary]], ''The Life and Times of Al Capp'', produced by his granddaughter, independent filmmaker Caitlin Manning.\n\nSince his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. [[Underground comix|Underground cartoonist]] and ''Li'l Abner'' expert [[Denis Kitchen]] has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as consultant on nearly all of them. Kitchen is currently compiling a biographical [[monograph]] on Al Capp.\n\nAt the [[San Diego Comic Con]] in July 2009, [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] announced the upcoming publication of ''Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Complete Dailies and Color Sundays'' as part of their ongoing [[The Library of American Comics]] series. The comprehensive series, a reprinting of the entire 43-year history of ''Li'l Abner'' spanning a projected 20 volumes, began on April 7, 2010.<ref>[http://www.libraryofamericancomics.com/catalog/series/1101/ IDW Library of American Comics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511032402/http://www.libraryofamericancomics.com/catalog/series/1101/ |date=2010-05-11 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category-inline|Al Capp}}\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner in New York'' (1936) [[Whitman Publishing]]\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner Among the Millionaires'' (1939) Whitman Publishing\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner and Sadie Hawkins Day'' (1940) [[Saalfield Publishing]]\n*Capp, Al, ''Li'l Abner and the Ratfields'' (1940) Saalfield Publishing\n*Sheridan, Martin, ''Comics and Their Creators'' (1942) R.T.
