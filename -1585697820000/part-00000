The game was considered quite advanced at the time, with interactive characters that moved between locations independent of the player, and Melbourne House's 'Inglish' text parser which accepted full-sentence commands where the norm was simple two-word verb/noun commands. They went on to release 1986's ''[[Lord of the Rings: Game One|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', 1987's ''[[Shadows of Mordor]]'', and 1989's ''[[The Crack of Doom]]''. A [[BBC Micro]] text adventure released around the same time was unrelated to Melbourne's titles except for the literary origin. In 1987, Melbourne House released ''[[War in Middle Earth]]'', a [[real-time strategy]] game. Konami also released an action-strategy game titled ''[[J. R. R. Tolkien's Riders of Rohan]]''.\n\n''The Lord of Rings: Journey to Rivendell'' was announced in 1983 by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600, but was never released.

A third installment was planned, but never released. Interplay's games mostly appeared on the PC and Amiga, but later they did a ''Lord of the Rings'' game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], which was different from the PC Version.\n\n===Film trilogy revival===\nThereafter, no official ''The Lord of the Rings'' titles were released until the making of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] for [[New Line Cinema]] in 2001\u20132003, when mass-market awareness of the story appeared. [[Electronic Arts]] obtained the licenses for the three films, while [[Vivendi Games]] obtained the license to produce games based on the books  from [[Tolkien Enterprises]] - this gave rise to an unusual situation: Electronic Arts produced no adaptation of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', but  produced adaptations named  [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'']] (which covered events of both the first two films) and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'']], whereas Vivendi only produced a game covering the first book of the trilogy, [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'']]. While Vivendi's access to the book rights prevented them from using material from the film, it permitted them to include elements of ''The Lord of the Rings'' which were not in the films. EA, on the other hand, were not permitted to do this, as they were only licensed to develop games based on the films, which left out elements of the original story or deviated in places.\n\nIn 2003, Vivendi produced an adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', aimed at a younger audience: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'']], as well as a real-time strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'', both based on Tolkien's literature.\n\nFurther spin-offs from the film trilogy were produced: A real time strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', and turn based role-playing game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'' were released in 2004, and a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]-exclusive title, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]'' in 2005.\n\nIn 2005, EA secured the rights to both the films and the books, thus ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' incorporated elements of the film adaptions, and the original Tolkienesque lore. EA also began work on an open world [[role-playing video game]] called ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The White Council]]'', but development of the game was cancelled in 2007.\n\nIn May 2005 [[Turbine, Inc.]] announced that they had acquired exclusive rights to create [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s based on the novel by [[Tolkien Enterprises]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson |first=Kristin |title=The Frodo Franchise: The Lord of the Rings and Modern Hollywood |url={{Google books|1odPDYvGBygC|page=359|plainurl=yes}}|page=359}}</ref> and launched ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online|The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'' on 24 April 2007. Initially, the game covered the region of [[Eriador]], from the Grey Havens to the [[Misty Mountains]], and about as far north and south, but subsequent updates and expansion packs have more than doubled the game world, including areas such as [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], [[Mirkwood]], [[Isengard]] and [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]. The game is based on the books and Turbine's license explicitly prohibits them from including any story or design elements unique to the movie adaptations. On the other hand, this allowed game designers to include lesser-known areas and references to the events, which are absent from the movies. The first expansion to ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' was released on 18 November 2008, entitled ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/226-morialaunchdate |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506111351/http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/226-morialaunchdate |archive-date=6 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The next expansion, ''[[Siege of Mirkwood]]'', was released on 1 December 2009.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110903222336/http://www.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/550-turbine-launches-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-siege-of-mirkwood- TURBINE LAUNCHES THE LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE\u2122: SIEGE OF MIRKWOOD\u2122]</ref>\nThe third expansion titled ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard|Rise of Isengard]]'' went live on 27 September 2011 and included the areas of Dunland, the Gap of Rohan and Isengard where the tower of Orthanc is located.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/1236-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-rise-of-isengard-to-launch-on-september-27th |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306033847/http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/1236-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-rise-of-isengard-to-launch-on-september-27th |archive-date=6 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The fourth expansion, ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'', was released on 15 October 2012, featuring The Eaves of Fangorn and eastern part of Rohan up to the East Wall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/2081-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-riders-of-rohan-to-launch-september-5-2012- |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313022740/http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/2081-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-riders-of-rohan-to-launch-september-5-2012- |archive-date=13 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The fifth expansion, ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep]]'', launched in November 2013 and added the remaining of Rohan landscape.\n\n''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'' produced by [[Pandemic Studios]] using the [[Game engine]] used in ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' was released in early 2009 on consoles, PC and Nintendo DS.

The game was considered quite advanced at the time, with interactive characters that moved between locations independent of the player, and Melbourne House's 'Inglish' text parser which accepted full-sentence commands where the norm was simple two-word verb/noun commands. They went on to release 1986's ''[[Lord of the Rings: Game One|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', 1987's ''[[Shadows of Mordor]]'', and 1989's ''[[The Crack of Doom]]''. A [[BBC Micro]] text adventure released around the same time was unrelated to Melbourne's titles except for the literary origin. In 1987, Melbourne House released ''[[War in Middle Earth]]'', a [[real-time strategy]] game. Konami also released an action-strategy game titled ''[[J. R. R. Tolkien's Riders of Rohan]]''.\n\n''The Lord of Rings: Journey to Rivendell'' was announced in 1983 by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600, but was never released. The prototype ROM can be found at AtariAge.<ref name=\"atariage.com\">{{cite web|url=http://atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=1955|title=AtariAge|publisher=|access-date=2 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120511/http://atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=1955|archive-date=6 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"atariage.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atariage.com/features/lotr/|title=AtariAge|publisher=|access-date=2 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030043255/http://www.atariage.com/features/lotr/|archive-date=30 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]], in collaboration with [[Electronic Arts]] (who would later obtain the licenses to the film trilogy), released ''Lord of the Rings Vol. I'' (a special CD-ROM version of which featured cut-scenes from [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|animated adaptation]]) and the following year's ''Lord of the Rings Vol. II: The Two Towers'', a series of [[role-playing video game]]s based on the events of the first two books. A third installment was planned, but never released. Interplay's games mostly appeared on the PC and Amiga, but later they did a ''Lord of the Rings'' game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], which was different from the PC Version.\n\n===Film trilogy revival===\nThereafter, no official ''The Lord of the Rings'' titles were released until the making of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] for [[New Line Cinema]] in 2001\u20132003, when mass-market awareness of the story appeared. [[Electronic Arts]] obtained the licenses for the three films, while [[Vivendi Games]] obtained the license to produce games based on the books  from [[Tolkien Enterprises]] - this gave rise to an unusual situation: Electronic Arts produced no adaptation of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', but  produced adaptations named  [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'']] (which covered events of both the first two films) and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'']], whereas Vivendi only produced a game covering the first book of the trilogy, [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'']]. While Vivendi's access to the book rights prevented them from using material from the film, it permitted them to include elements of ''The Lord of the Rings'' which were not in the films. EA, on the other hand, were not permitted to do this, as they were only licensed to develop games based on the films, which left out elements of the original story or deviated in places.\n\nIn 2003, Vivendi produced an adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', aimed at a younger audience: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'']], as well as a real-time strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'', both based on Tolkien's literature.\n\nFurther spin-offs from the film trilogy were produced: A real time strategy game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'', and turn based role-playing game ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'' were released in 2004, and a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]-exclusive title, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]'' in 2005.\n\nIn 2005, EA secured the rights to both the films and the books, thus ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' incorporated elements of the film adaptions, and the original Tolkienesque lore. EA also began work on an open world [[role-playing video game]] called ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The White Council]]'', but development of the game was cancelled in 2007.\n\nIn May 2005 [[Turbine, Inc.]] announced that they had acquired exclusive rights to create [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s based on the novel by [[Tolkien Enterprises]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson |first=Kristin |title=The Frodo Franchise: The Lord of the Rings and Modern Hollywood |url={{Google books|1odPDYvGBygC|page=359|plainurl=yes}}|page=359}}</ref> and launched ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online|The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'' on 24 April 2007. Initially, the game covered the region of [[Eriador]], from the Grey Havens to the [[Misty Mountains]], and about as far north and south, but subsequent updates and expansion packs have more than doubled the game world, including areas such as [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], [[Mirkwood]], [[Isengard]] and [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]]. The game is based on the books and Turbine's license explicitly prohibits them from including any story or design elements unique to the movie adaptations. On the other hand, this allowed game designers to include lesser-known areas and references to the events, which are absent from the movies. The first expansion to ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' was released on 18 November 2008, entitled ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/226-morialaunchdate |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506111351/http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/226-morialaunchdate |archive-date=6 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The next expansion, ''[[Siege of Mirkwood]]'', was released on 1 December 2009.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110903222336/http://www.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/550-turbine-launches-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-siege-of-mirkwood- TURBINE LAUNCHES THE LORD OF THE RINGS ONLINE\u2122: SIEGE OF MIRKWOOD\u2122]</ref>\nThe third expansion titled ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard|Rise of Isengard]]'' went live on 27 September 2011 and included the areas of Dunland, the Gap of Rohan and Isengard where the tower of Orthanc is located.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/1236-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-rise-of-isengard-to-launch-on-september-27th |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306033847/http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/1236-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-rise-of-isengard-to-launch-on-september-27th |archive-date=6 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The fourth expansion, ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'', was released on 15 October 2012, featuring The Eaves of Fangorn and eastern part of Rohan up to the East Wall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/2081-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-riders-of-rohan-to-launch-september-5-2012- |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313022740/http://archive.lotro.com/news/pressreleases/2081-the-lord-of-the-rings-online-riders-of-rohan-to-launch-september-5-2012- |archive-date=13 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The fifth expansion, ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep]]'', launched in November 2013 and added the remaining of Rohan landscape.\n\n''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'' produced by [[Pandemic Studios]] using the [[Game engine]] used in ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'' was released in early 2009 on consoles, PC and Nintendo DS.

The arm holding up the trap has the [[Flag of Iraq|Iraqi flag]] on it.]]\n\nPsychological operations are a vital part of the broad range of U.S. political, military, economic and ideological activities used by the U.S. government to secure national objectives. PSYOP is the dissemination of information to foreign audiences in support of U.S. policy and national objectives.\n\nUsed during peacetime, contingencies and declared war, these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments. Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire, or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes, or behaviors. The ultimate objective of U.S. military psychological operations is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nPsychological operations support national security objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels of operations. Strategic psychological operations advance broad or long-term objectives. Global in nature, they may be directed toward large audiences or at key communicators.\n\nOperational psychological operations are conducted on a smaller scale. They are employed by theater commanders to target groups within the [[theater of operations]]. Their purpose can range from gaining support for U.S. operations to preparing the battlefield for combat.\n\nTactical psychological operations are more limited, used by commanders to secure immediate and near-term goals. In this environment, these force-enhancing activities serve as a means to lower the morale and efficiency of enemy forces.\n\nBoth tactical and theater-level psychological operations may be used to enhance peacetime military activities of conventional forces operating in foreign countries. Cultural awareness packages attune U.S. forces before departing overseas. In theater, media programs publicize the positive aspects of combined military exercises and deployments.\n\nIn addition to supporting commanders, PSYOP units provide interagency support to other [[U.S. government]] agencies. In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, psychological operations enhance the impact of those agencies' actions. Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.\n\nPsychological operations units in the U.S. Army Reserve are language and culturally oriented. Seventy one percent of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense's]] PSYOP capability rests within USACAPOC (A)'s 2nd and 7th Psychological Operations Groups located in Ohio and California respectively.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Psychological Operations units\n!

The arm holding up the trap has the [[Flag of Iraq|Iraqi flag]] on it.]]\n\nPsychological operations are a vital part of the broad range of U.S. political, military, economic and ideological activities used by the U.S. government to secure national objectives. PSYOP is the dissemination of information to foreign audiences in support of U.S. policy and national objectives.\n\nUsed during peacetime, contingencies and declared war, these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments. Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire, or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes, or behaviors. The ultimate objective of U.S. military psychological operations is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nPsychological operations support national security objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels of operations. Strategic psychological operations advance broad or long-term objectives. Global in nature, they may be directed toward large audiences or at key communicators.\n\nOperational psychological operations are conducted on a smaller scale. They are employed by theater commanders to target groups within the [[theater of operations]]. Their purpose can range from gaining support for U.S. operations to preparing the battlefield for combat.\n\nTactical psychological operations are more limited, used by commanders to secure immediate and near-term goals. In this environment, these force-enhancing activities serve as a means to lower the morale and efficiency of enemy forces.\n\nBoth tactical and theater-level psychological operations may be used to enhance peacetime military activities of conventional forces operating in foreign countries. Cultural awareness packages attune U.S. forces before departing overseas. In theater, media programs publicize the positive aspects of combined military exercises and deployments.\n\nIn addition to supporting commanders, PSYOP units provide interagency support to other [[U.S. government]] agencies. In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, psychological operations enhance the impact of those agencies' actions. Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.\n\nPsychological operations units in the U.S. Army Reserve are language and culturally oriented.
