Founded in 1990 by Stefan H\u00e5kans, the club has a rivalry with [[Turun Palloseura]].\n\nInter have won one [[List of Finnish football champions#Performance by club|League title]], two [[Finnish Cup]]s, and one [[Finnish League Cup|League Cup]]. They play their home league matches at [[Veritas Stadion]], with a capacity of 9,372 seats for most matches.\n\n==History==\nFC Inter was founded in 1990 by Stefan H\u00e5kans, the [[managing director]] of the [[tugboat|towage]] and [[Marine salvage|salvage]] company Alfons H\u00e5kans, allegedly after his 11-year-old son couldn't fit into any of the other youth teams in Turku. The club started out as a youth team, but in 1992 a senior squad was founded and it entered the Finnish league system at the fourth level (Third Division). The following year, the club assumed the place of the financially troubled local club [[Turun Toverit]] in the Second Division. Manager Timo Sinkkonen invested in new players, and eventually the club finished first and was promoted to the First Division ([[Ykk\u00f6nen]]).\n\nIn 1995, Inter finished first in the ''Ykk\u00f6nen'' and was promoted, as well as reaching the semi-final stage in the Finnish [[Tournament|Cup]]. The squad was strengthened with new players, and in 1996, as both of Turku's better teams were now playing in the ''Veikkausliiga'', the club's attendance records were broken with 8,200 spectators in the [[local derby]] between [[Turun Palloseura|TPS]] and Inter.\n\nIn 1997, the club were relegated after finishing last in the ''Veikkausliiga'', but achieved promotion again the following season. New foreign players were bought to strengthen the squad, such as Richard Teberio and Fernando della Sala. Since then the club has consistently finished between 7th and 4th in the league, and maintained a steady inflow of foreign players as well as young starlets from its own youth academy.\n\nDuring the 2006 season Inter sacked their manager Kari Virtanen and hired new coach, Dutchman [[Rene van Eck]]. After the season van Eck returned to Switzerland to coach [[FC Wohlen]], and another Dutchman [[Job Dragtsma]] took over.\n\nIn 2008 Inter led the league since early season and clinched their first Finnish championship title after winning against [[FF Jaro]] in their final game.\n\n==European cup history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Founded in 1990 by Stefan H\u00e5kans, the club has a rivalry with [[Turun Palloseura]].\n\nInter have won one [[List of Finnish football champions#Performance by club|League title]], two [[Finnish Cup]]s, and one [[Finnish League Cup|League Cup]]. They play their home league matches at [[Veritas Stadion]], with a capacity of 9,372 seats for most matches.\n\n==History==\nFC Inter was founded in 1990 by Stefan H\u00e5kans, the [[managing director]] of the [[tugboat|towage]] and [[Marine salvage|salvage]] company Alfons H\u00e5kans, allegedly after his 11-year-old son couldn't fit into any of the other youth teams in Turku. The club started out as a youth team, but in 1992 a senior squad was founded and it entered the Finnish league system at the fourth level (Third Division). The following year, the club assumed the place of the financially troubled local club [[Turun Toverit]] in the Second Division. Manager Timo Sinkkonen invested in new players, and eventually the club finished first and was promoted to the First Division ([[Ykk\u00f6nen]]).\n\nIn 1995, Inter finished first in the ''Ykk\u00f6nen'' and was promoted, as well as reaching the semi-final stage in the Finnish [[Tournament|Cup]]. The squad was strengthened with new players, and in 1996, as both of Turku's better teams were now playing in the ''Veikkausliiga'', the club's attendance records were broken with 8,200 spectators in the [[local derby]] between [[Turun Palloseura|TPS]] and Inter.\n\nIn 1997, the club were relegated after finishing last in the ''Veikkausliiga'', but achieved promotion again the following season. New foreign players were bought to strengthen the squad, such as Richard Teberio and Fernando della Sala. Since then the club has consistently finished between 7th and 4th in the league, and maintained a steady inflow of foreign players as well as young starlets from its own youth academy.\n\nDuring the 2006 season Inter sacked their manager Kari Virtanen and hired new coach, Dutchman [[Rene van Eck]]. After the season van Eck returned to Switzerland to coach [[FC Wohlen]], and another Dutchman [[Job Dragtsma]] took over.\n\nIn 2008 Inter led the league since early season and clinched their first Finnish championship title after winning against [[FF Jaro]] in their final game.\n\n==European cup history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The highest mountain in the range, [[Lugnaquilla]], rises to {{convert|925|m|ft}}, giving Wicklow the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|second-highest county peak]] after [[County Kerry|Kerry]].\n\n=== Hydrodrology ===\nThe [[River Liffey]], chief river of Dublin, rises in the county, and is a major source of water for Greater Dublin.  The Liffey's leading tributary, the [[River Dodder]], rises just across the border in southern County Dublin, and receives some minor flows from extreme northern Wicklow.  The [[River Dargle]] runs to the Irish Sea at Bray.  The [[River Avoca]] forms from the confluence of the [[River Avonmore|Avonmore]] and [[River Avonbeg|Avonbeg]] at the Meeting of the Waters, before discharging into the [[Irish Sea]] at Arklow. The [[River Aughrim]] is a tributary of the Avoca.  The [[River Slaney]] is in the western part of the county, bordering [[County Carlow]].  One of the smaller rivers of the county, the [[River Vartry]] is important to Dublin's water supply.\n\nLakes are small but numerous, located mainly in mountain valleys or glacial [[Cirque|corries]]. They include [[Lough Dan]], [[Lough Tay]], Lough Brae, the lakes of Glendalough, and the [[Poulaphouca]] reservoir (the largest by volume).\n\n==Built environment==\nWicklow is home to several major water supply and hydroelectric facilities.  The [[Turlough Hill]] [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage scheme]], a significant [[civil engineering]] project, was carried out in the mountains in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Leisure and tourism==\nWicklow, often called \"The Garden of Ireland\", has been a popular tourist destination for many years, due to its scenery, beaches, walking, hiking and climbing options, and attractions including the ruins of the monastic city of Glendalough, Wicklow Gaol and water-based activities on reservoirs and the coast.\n\nThe [[Wicklow Way]] is the oldest [[waymarking|waymarked]] [[long-distance trail|long-distance walking trail]] in Ireland.\n\nThe popular annual mass participation bike ride [[Wicklow 200]] has taken place in the county every year since 1982.<ref>[[Wicklow 200]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Glendalough monastery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kevin of Glendalough|Saint Kevin's]] monastery at [[Glendalough]].]]\nCounty Wicklow was the last of the traditional counties of Ireland to be shired in 1606 from land previously part of counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]] and [[County Carlow|Carlow]]. Established as a distinct county, it was aimed at controlling local groups such as the [[Fiach McHugh O'Byrne|O'Byrnes]]. ''[[R115 road|The Military Road]]'', stretching from [[Rathfarnham]] to [[Aghavannagh]] crosses the mountains, north to south, was built by the [[British Army]] to assist them in defeating the rebels still active in the [[Wicklow Mountains]] following the failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]].<ref name=niahwicklow>''See'' Philip Smith (writer), ''An Introduction to the Architectural Heritage of County Wicklow.'' Dublin: [[Wordwell Press]] / [[Government of Ireland]], Department of the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government, National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, 2004.</ref> It provided them with access to an area that had been a hotbed of Irish rebellion for centuries. Several barracks to house the soldiers were built along the route and the [[Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation]] was built alongside the remains of barracks there. Battalions of the [[Irish Army]] use firing ranges in County Wicklow for tactical exercises, especially the largest one in the [[Glen of Imaal]] which was previously used by the [[British Army]] prior to independence.\n\nThe ancient [[monastery]] of [[Glendalough]] is located in County Wicklow. During the [[Cromwellian invasion of Ireland]], local authorities immediately surrendered without a fight. During the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], some of the insurgents took refuge in the Wicklow Mountains, resulting in clashes between British troops and the troops commanded by General [[Joseph Holt (rebel)|Joseph Holt]] (1756\u20131826) near Aughrim and later at Arklow.\n\nThe boundaries of the county were extended in 1957 by the [[Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1957|Local Government Act]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1957/en/act/prv/0001/print.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|date=|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref> which \"detached lands from the [[County Dublin|County of Dublin]] and from the jurisdiction and powers of the Council of the County of Dublin\" near Bray and added them to the County of Wicklow.\n\n==Local government and politics==\n{{main|Wicklow County Council}}\nThe local government authority is [[Wicklow County Council]] which returns 32 councillors from five municipal districts (Arklow, Baltinglass, Bray, Greystones, Wicklow).

The highest mountain in the range, [[Lugnaquilla]], rises to {{convert|925|m|ft}}, giving Wicklow the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|second-highest county peak]] after [[County Kerry|Kerry]].\n\n=== Hydrodrology ===\nThe [[River Liffey]], chief river of Dublin, rises in the county, and is a major source of water for Greater Dublin.  The Liffey's leading tributary, the [[River Dodder]], rises just across the border in southern County Dublin, and receives some minor flows from extreme northern Wicklow.  The [[River Dargle]] runs to the Irish Sea at Bray.  The [[River Avoca]] forms from the confluence of the [[River Avonmore|Avonmore]] and [[River Avonbeg|Avonbeg]] at the Meeting of the Waters, before discharging into the [[Irish Sea]] at Arklow. The [[River Aughrim]] is a tributary of the Avoca.  The [[River Slaney]] is in the western part of the county, bordering [[County Carlow]].  One of the smaller rivers of the county, the [[River Vartry]] is important to Dublin's water supply.\n\nLakes are small but numerous, located mainly in mountain valleys or glacial [[Cirque|corries]]. They include [[Lough Dan]], [[Lough Tay]], Lough Brae, the lakes of Glendalough, and the [[Poulaphouca]] reservoir (the largest by volume).\n\n==Built environment==\nWicklow is home to several major water supply and hydroelectric facilities.  The [[Turlough Hill]] [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-storage scheme]], a significant [[civil engineering]] project, was carried out in the mountains in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Leisure and tourism==\nWicklow, often called \"The Garden of Ireland\", has been a popular tourist destination for many years, due to its scenery, beaches, walking, hiking and climbing options, and attractions including the ruins of the monastic city of Glendalough, Wicklow Gaol and water-based activities on reservoirs and the coast.\n\nThe [[Wicklow Way]] is the oldest [[waymarking|waymarked]] [[long-distance trail|long-distance walking trail]] in Ireland.\n\nThe popular annual mass participation bike ride [[Wicklow 200]] has taken place in the county every year since 1982.<ref>[[Wicklow 200]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Glendalough monastery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kevin of Glendalough|Saint Kevin's]] monastery at [[Glendalough]].]]\nCounty Wicklow was the last of the traditional counties of Ireland to be shired in 1606 from land previously part of counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]] and [[County Carlow|Carlow]]. Established as a distinct county, it was aimed at controlling local groups such as the [[Fiach McHugh O'Byrne|O'Byrnes]]. ''[[R115 road|The Military Road]]'', stretching from [[Rathfarnham]] to [[Aghavannagh]] crosses the mountains, north to south, was built by the [[British Army]] to assist them in defeating the rebels still active in the [[Wicklow Mountains]] following the failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]].<ref name=niahwicklow>''See'' Philip Smith (writer), ''An Introduction to the Architectural Heritage of County Wicklow.'' Dublin: [[Wordwell Press]] / [[Government of Ireland]], Department of the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government, National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, 2004.</ref> It provided them with access to an area that had been a hotbed of Irish rebellion for centuries. Several barracks to house the soldiers were built along the route and the [[Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation]] was built alongside the remains of barracks there. Battalions of the [[Irish Army]] use firing ranges in County Wicklow for tactical exercises, especially the largest one in the [[Glen of Imaal]] which was previously used by the [[British Army]] prior to independence.\n\nThe ancient [[monastery]] of [[Glendalough]] is located in County Wicklow. During the [[Cromwellian invasion of Ireland]], local authorities immediately surrendered without a fight. During the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], some of the insurgents took refuge in the Wicklow Mountains, resulting in clashes between British troops and the troops commanded by General [[Joseph Holt (rebel)|Joseph Holt]] (1756\u20131826) near Aughrim and later at Arklow.\n\nThe boundaries of the county were extended in 1957 by the [[Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation Act, 1957|Local Government Act]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1957/en/act/prv/0001/print.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|date=|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref> which \"detached lands from the [[County Dublin|County of Dublin]] and from the jurisdiction and powers of the Council of the County of Dublin\" near Bray and added them to the County of Wicklow.\n\n==Local government and politics==\n{{main|Wicklow County Council}}\nThe local government authority is [[Wicklow County Council]] which returns 32 councillors from five municipal districts (Arklow, Baltinglass, Bray, Greystones, Wicklow).

[[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24\u201336 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation.

During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>\n\nThe loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.

[[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24\u201336 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen.

The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref name=Silverthorn />\n\n=== Ovarian cycle ===\n\n==== Follicular phase ====\n{{main|Follicular phase}}\nThe follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.<ref name=Silverthorn /> The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.\n\nThrough the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n==== Ovulation ====\n{{main|Ovulation}}\n[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]\n\nOvulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.<ref>[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center.

During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>\n\nThe loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.  Most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n=== Uterine cycle ===\nThe uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative, secretory.<ref>{{cite book | title =Textbook of Medical Physiology | chapter = Chapter 81 Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones |pages =  1018ff  | edition = 11th |editor=Guyton AC |editor2=Hall JE |publisher = Elsevier Saunders | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780721602400}}</ref>\n\n==== Menstruation ====\n{{main|Menstruation}}\nMenstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle.

The next-most reliable timing is based on desiccated flesh dated 2,200 YBP from Thylacine Hole, 110&nbsp;km west of Eucla on the Nullarbor Plain, southeastern Western Australia. When dingoes first arrived, they would have been taken up by indigenous Australians, who then provided a network for their swift transfer around the continent. Based on the recorded distribution time for dogs across Tasmania and cats across Australia once indigenous Australians had acquired them, the dispersal of dingoes from their point of landing until they occupied continental Australia is proposed to have taken only 70 years.<ref name=balme2018/> The red fox is estimated to have dispersed across the continent in only 60\u201380 years.<ref name=smithC3/>\n\nAt the end of the [[last glacial maximum]] and the associated rise in sea levels, Tasmania became separated from the Australian mainland 12,000 YBP,<ref name=lyndall2012/> and New Guinea 6,500<ref name=cairns2016/>\u20138,500 YBP<ref name=cairns2016/><ref name=bourke2009/> by the inundation of the [[Sahul Shelf]].<ref name=monash2015/> Fossil remains in Australia date to around 3,500 YBP and no dingo remains have been uncovered in Tasmania, so the dingo is estimated to have arrived in Australia at a time between 3,500 and 12,000 YBP.

In this respect, the dingo resembles two similar [[mesopredators]], the dhole and the coyote.<ref name=smith2017b/> The eyes are triangular (or almond-shaped) and are hazel to dark in colour with dark rims. The ears are [[Erect (position)|erect]] and occur high on the skull.<ref name=smithC1/>\n\n===Coat colour===\nThe dingo's three main coat colours are described as being light ginger (or tan), black and tan, and creamy white.<ref name=smithC1/><ref name=purcellC3/> The ginger colour ranges from a deep rust to a pale cream and can be found in 74% of dingoes. Often, small white markings are seen on the tip of the tail, the feet, and the chest, but with no large white patches. Some do not exhibit white tips. The black and tan dingoes possess a black coat with a tan muzzle, chest, belly, legs, and feet and can be found in 12% of dingoes. Solid white can be found in 2% of dingoes and solid black 1%. Coat colours with [[Coat (dog)#Patterns|sable]], [[Roan (color)|ticking]], or [[Coat (dog)#Patterns|brindle]] indicate some hybridisation and can be found in 12% of dingoes. Only three genes affect coat colour in the dingo compared with nine genes in the domestic dog. The ginger colour is dominant and carries the other three main colours - black, tan, and white. White dingoes breed true, and black and tan dingoes breed true; when these cross, the result is a sandy colour.<ref name=smithC1/><ref name=cairns2011/> The coat is not oily, nor does not have a dog-like odour.

Land clearance, poisoning, and trapping caused the extinction of the dingo and hybrids from most of their former range in southern Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Today, they are absent from most of New South Wales, Victoria, the southeastern third of South Australia, and the southwestern tip of Western Australia. They are sparse in the eastern half of Western Australia and the adjoining areas of the Northern Territory and South Australia. They are regarded as common across the remainder of the continent.<ref name=NTPWS2006/><ref name=flemingC1/>\n\nThe dingo could be considered an [[ecotype]] or an ecospecies that has adapted to Australia's unique environment.<ref name=smith49/> The dingo's present distribution covers a variety of habitats, including the temperate regions of [[Eastern states of Australia|eastern Australia]], the alpine moorlands of the [[Great Dividing Range|eastern highlands]], the arid hot deserts of [[Central Australia]], and the tropical forests and wetlands of [[Northern Australia]].<ref name=smithC2/> The occupation of, and adaption to, these habitats may have been assisted by their relationship with indigenous Australians.<ref name=purcellC3/>\n\n===Prey===\n[[File:The Dingo Finds a Dead Fish.jpg|thumb|Dingo with a fish on Fraser Island]]\n\nA 20-year study of the dingo's diet was conducted across Australia by the federal and state governments. These examined a total of 13,000 stomach contents and fecal samples.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> For the fecal samples, determining the matching tracks of foxes and feral cats  was possible without including these samples in the study, but in distinguishing between the tracks left by dingoes and those of dingo hybrids or feral dogs was impossible.<ref name=corbett1995C2/> The study found that these canines prey on 177 species represented by 72.3% mammals (71 species), 18.8% birds (53 species), 3.3% vegetation (seeds), 1.8% reptiles (23 species), and 3.8% insects, fish, crabs, and frogs (28 species).<ref name=corbett1995C7/><ref name=flemingC2/><ref name=smithC2/> The relative proportions of prey are much the same across Australia, apart from more birds being eaten in the north and south-east coastal regions, and more lizards in Central Australia.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> Some 80% of the diet consisted of 10 species: [[red kangaroo]], [[swamp wallaby]], cattle, [[dusky rat]], [[magpie goose]], [[common brushtail possum]], [[long-haired rat]], [[agile wallaby]], [[European rabbit]], and [[common wombat]].<ref name=corbett1995A3/><ref name=flemingC2/> Of the mammals eaten, 20% could be regarded as large.<ref name=corbett1995C7/>\n\nHowever, the relative proportions of the size of prey mammals varied across regions. In the tropical coast region of the Northern Territory, agile wallabies, dusky rats, and magpie geese formed 80% of the diet. In Central Australia, the rabbit has become a substitute for native mammals, and during droughts, cattle carcasses provide most of the diet. On the [[Barkly Tableland]],  no rabbits occur nor does any native species dominate the diet, except for long-haired rats that form occasional plagues. In the [[Fortescue River]] region, the large red kangaroo and [[common wallaroo]] dominate the diet, as few smaller mammals are found in this area. On the Nullarbor Plain, rabbits and red kangaroos dominate the diet, and twice as much rabbit eaten as red kangaroo. In the temperate mountains of eastern Australia, swamp wallaby and red-necked wallaby dominate the diet on the lower slopes and wombat on the higher slopes. Possums are commonly eaten here when found on the ground.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> In coastal regions, dingoes patrol the beaches for washed-up fish, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[penguins]], and other birds.<ref name=flemingC2/>\n\nDingoes drink about a litre of water each day in the summer and  half a litre in winter. In arid regions during the winter, dingoes may live from the liquid in the bodies of their [[prey]], as long as the number of prey is sufficient. In arid Central Australia, weaned pups draw most of their water from their food. There, regurgitation of water by the females for the pups was observed. During lactation, captive females  have no higher need of water than usual, since they consume the urine and feces of the pups, thus recycling the water and keeping the den clean.<ref name=flemingC2/> Tracked dingoes in the [[Strzelecki Desert]] regularly visited water-points every 3\u20135 days, with two dingoes surviving 22 days without water during both winter and summer.<ref name=allan2012/>\n\n===Hunting behaviour===\nDingoes, dingo hybrids, and feral dogs usually attack from the rear as they pursue their prey. They kill their prey by biting the throat, which damages the [[trachea]] and the major blood vessels of the neck.<ref name=flemingC6/> The size of the hunting pack is determined by the type of prey targeted, with large packs formed to help hunt large prey. Large prey can include kangaroos, cattle, water buffalo, and feral horses.<ref name=flemingC2/> Dingoes will assess and target prey based on the prey's ability to inflict damage on dingoes. Large [[kangaroo]]s are the most commonly killed prey. The main tactic is to sight the kangaroo, bail it up, then kill it. Dingoes typically hunt large kangaroos by having lead dingoes chase the quarry toward the paths of their pack mates, which are skilled at cutting corners in chases. The kangaroo becomes exhausted and is then killed. This same tactic is used by wolves, [[African wild dogs]], and [[hyenas]]. Another tactic shared with African wild dogs is a relay pursuit until the prey is exhausted. A pack of dingoes is three times as likely to bring down a kangaroo than an individual because the killing is done by those following the lead chaser, which has also become exhausted.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> Two patterns are seen for the final stage of the attack. An adult or juvenile kangaroo is nipped at the hamstrings of the hind legs to slow it before an attack to the throat. A small adult female or juvenile is bitten on the neck or back by dingoes running beside it.<ref name=flemingC2/> In one area of Central Australia, dingoes hunt kangaroos by chasing them into a wire fence, where they become temporarily immobilised. The largest male red kangaroos tend to ignore dingoes, even when the dingoes are hunting the younger males and females. A large eastern grey kangaroo successfully fought off an attack by a single dingo that lasted over an hour. Wallabies are hunted in a similar manner to kangaroos, the difference being that a single dingo hunts using scent rather than sight and the hunt may last several hours.<ref name=corbett1995C7/>\n\nDingo packs may attack young cattle and buffalo, but never healthy, grown adults. They focus on the sick or injured young. The tactics include harassing a mother with young, panicking a herd to separate the adults from the young, or watching a herd and looking for any unusual behaviour that might then be exploited.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> One 1992 study in the [[Fortescue River]] region observed that cattle defend their calves by circling around the calves or aggressively charging dingoes. In one study of 26 approaches, 24 were by more than one dingo and only four resulted in calves being killed. Dingoes often revisited carcasses. They did not touch fresh cattle carcasses until these were largely skin and bone, and even when these were plentiful, they still preferred to hunt kangaroos. Of 68 chases of sheep, 26 sheep were seriously injured, but only eight were killed. The dingoes could outrun the sheep and the sheep were defenceless. However, the dingoes in general appeared not to be motivated to kill sheep, and in many cases just loped alongside the sheep before veering off to chase another sheep. For those that did kill and consume sheep,  a large quantity of kangaroo was still in their diet, indicating once again a preference for kangaroo.<ref name=thomson1992/> \n \nLone dingoes can run down a rabbit, but are more successful by targeting kittens near rabbit warrens. Dingoes take nestling birds, in addition to birds that are moulting and therefore cannot fly.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> Predators often use highly intelligent hunting techniques. Dingoes on Fraser Island have been observed using waves to entrap, tire, and help drown an adult swamp wallaby<ref name=behrendorff2018/> and an echidna.<ref name=behrendorff2018b/> In the coastal wetlands of northern Australia, dingoes depend on magpie geese for a large part of their diet and a lone dingo sometimes distracts these while a [[White-bellied sea eagle|white-breasted sea eagle]] makes a kill that is too heavy for it to carry off, with the dingo then driving the sea eagle away. They also scavenge on prey dropped from the nesting platforms of sea eagles.  Lone dingoes may hunt small rodents and grasshoppers in grass by using their senses of smell and hearing, then pouncing on them with their forepaws.<ref name=corbett1995C7/>\n\n===Competitors===\nDingoes and their hybrids co-exist with the native [[quoll]]. They also co-occur in the same territory as the introduced European [[red fox]] and feral cat, but little is known about the relationships between these three. Dingoes and their hybrids can drive off foxes from sources of water and occasionally eat feral cats. Dingoes can be killed by buffalo and cattle goring and kicking them, from snake bite, and predation on their pups by wedge-tailed eagles.<ref name=flemingC2/>\n\n==Communication==\nLike all domestic dogs, dingoes tend towards [[phonetics|phonetic]] communication. However, in contrast to domestic dogs, dingoes howl and whimper more, and bark less. Eight [[Sonority hierarchy|sound classes]] with 19 sound types have been identified.<ref name=\"DoritAusdruck\"/>\n\n===Barking===\n[[File:Nullarbor Dingo.jpg|thumb|Dingo on the [[Nullarbor]]]]\n\nCompared to most domestic dogs, the [[bark (dog)|bark]] of a dingo is short and monosyllabic, and is rarely used.

In addition, barking is almost exclusively used for giving warnings. Warn-barking in a homotypical sequence and a kind of \"warn-howling\" in a heterotypical sequence have also been observed. The bark-howling starts with several barks and then fades into a rising and ebbing howl and is probably (similar to coughing) used to warn the puppies and members of the [[Pack (canine)|pack]]. Additionally, dingoes emit a sort of \"wailing\" sound, which they mostly use when approaching a [[Depression (geology)|watering hole]], probably to warn already present dingoes.<ref name=\"canid\">{{cite book|author=Corbett, Laurie |year=2004|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]|chapter-url=http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/actionplans/canids.pdf|chapter=Dingo|title=Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals and Dogs|editor1=Claudio Sillero-Zubiri |editor2=Michael Hoffmann |editor3=David W.

Usually, three kinds of howls are distinguished: long and persistent, rising and ebbing, and short and abrupt.\n\nObservations have shown that each kind of howling has several variations, though their purpose is unknown. The frequency of howling varies with the season and time of day, and is also influenced by [[Breeding in the wild|breeding]], [[Animal migration|migration]], [[lactation]], social stability, and [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] behaviour. Howling can be more frequent in times of food shortage, because the dogs become more widely distributed within their [[home range]].<ref name=\"canid\"/>\n\nAdditionally, howling seems to have a group function, and is sometimes an expression of joy (for example, greeting-howls). Overall, howling was observed less frequently in dingoes than among grey wolves. It may happen that one dog will begin to howl, and several or all other dogs will howl back and bark from time to time. In the [[wilderness]], dingoes howl over long distances to attract other members of the pack, to find other dogs, or to keep intruders at bay. Dingoes howl in chorus with significant pitches, and with increasing number of pack members, the variability of pitches also increases.<ref name=corbett1995C5/> Therefore,  dingoes are suspected to be able to measure the size of a pack without visual contact.<ref name=\"impact\">{{Cite book|last=Fleming|first=Peter|author2=Laurie Corbett |author3=Robert Harden |author4=Peter Thomson |title=Managing the Impacts of Dingoes and Other Wild Dogs|publisher=Bureau of Rural Sciences|location=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2001}}</ref> Moreover,  their highly variable chorus howls have been proposed to generate a confounding effect in the receivers by making pack size appear larger.<ref>Ortolani, A., Corbett, L.K., Feinstein, F.H., and R.P.

Similar to many domestic dogs, a reactive usage of defensive growling is only rarely observed. Growling very often occurs in combination with other sounds, and has been observed almost exclusively in swooshing noises (similar to barking).<ref name=\"DoritAusdruck\"/>\n\nDuring observations in [[Germany]], dingoes were heard to produce a sound that observers have called ''Schrappen''. It was only observed in an agonistic context, mostly as a defence against obtrusive pups or for defending resources. It was described as a bite intention, during which the receiver is never touched or hurt. Only a clashing of the teeth could be heard.<ref name=\"DoritAusdruck\"/>\n\nAside from vocal communication, dingoes communicate, like all domestic dogs, via [[Raised-leg urination|scent marking]] specific objects (for example, ''[[Triodia (grass)|Spinifex]]'') or places (such as waters, trails, and hunting grounds) using [[Urine spraying#Canidae|chemical signals from their urine]], feces, and [[scent gland]]s. Males scent mark more frequently than females, especially during the [[Mating season#Breeding season|mating season]]. They also [[scent rub]], whereby a dog rolls its neck, shoulders, or back on something that is usually associated with food or the scent markings of other dogs.<ref name=\"canid\"/>\n\nUnlike wolves, dingoes can react to social cues and gestures from humans.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Young| first=Emma| title=Dingoes skilled at Reading Human Gestures| journal=[[Australian Geographic]]| date=5 March 2010| url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/dingoes-skilled-at-reading-human-gestures.htm| accessdate=13 January 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126142449/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/dingoes-skilled-at-reading-human-gestures.htm| archive-date=26 January 2013| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\nDingoes tend to be [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] in warmer regions, but less so in cooler areas.

A rise in [[testosterone]] was observed in the males during the breeding season, but this was attributed to the heat of the females and copulation. In contrast to the captive dingoes, captured dingo males from Central Australia did show evidence of a male breeding cycle. Those dingoes showed no interest in females in heat (this time other domestic dogs) outside of the mating season (January to July) and did not breed with them.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Catling|first1=PC|title=Seasonal variation in plasma testosterone and the testis in captive male dingoes, Canis familiaries dingo|journal=Australian Journal of Zoology|volume=27|pages=939\u201344|year=1979|doi=10.1071/ZO9790939|issue=6}}</ref>\n\nThe mating season usually occurs in Australia between March and May (according to other sources between April and June). During this time, dingoes may actively defend their territories using vocalisations, dominance behaviour, growling, and barking.<ref name=\"impact\"/>\n\nMost females in the wild start breeding at the age of 2 years. Within packs, the alpha female tends to go into heat before subordinates and actively suppresses mating attempts by other females. Males become sexually mature between the ages of 1 and 3 years. The precise start of breeding varies depending on age, social status, geographic range, and seasonal conditions. Among dingoes in captivity, the pre-estrus was observed to last 10\u201312 days. However, the pre-estrus may last as long as 60 days in the wild.<ref name=\"canid\"/>\n\n[[File:Look at me dad.jpg|thumb|right|A male dingo with his pups]]\nIn general, the only dingoes in a pack that successfully breed are the alpha pair, and the other pack members help with raising the pups.

Pups of subordinate females usually get killed by the alpha female, which causes the population increase to be low even in good times. This behaviour possibly developed as an adaptation to the fluctuating environmental conditions in Australia. Pups are usually born between May and August (the winter period), but in tropical regions, breeding can occur at any time of the year.<ref name=\"canid\"/>\n\nAt the age of 3 weeks, the pups leave the den for the first time, and leave it completely at 8 weeks. In Australia, dens are mostly underground. Reports exist of dens in abandoned rabbit burrows, rock formations, under boulders in dry creeks, under large [[Triodia (grass)|spinifex]], in hollow logs, and augmented burrows of monitor lizards and wombat burrows. The pups usually stray around the den within a radius of {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, and are accompanied by older dogs during longer travels. The transition to consuming solid food is normally accompanied by all members of the pack during the age of 9 to 12 weeks.

However, during times of [[famine]], even in normally \"safe\" areas, dingoes travel into [[pastoral]] areas, where intensive, human-induced control measures are undertaken. In [[Western Australia]] in the 1970s, young dogs were found to travel for long distances when necessary.

Therefore, travelling dingoes had lower chances of survival in foreign territories, and  they are apparently unlikely to survive long migrations through occupied territories. The rarity of long migration routes seemed to confirm this. During investigations in the Nullarbor Plain, even longer migration routes were recorded.

Most attacks involve people feeding wild dingoes, particularly on Fraser Island, which is a special centre of dingo-related tourism. The vast majority of dingo attacks are minor in nature, but some can be major, and a few have been fatal: the death of 2-month-old [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain|Azaria Chamberlain]] in the [[Northern Territory]] in 1980 is one of them. Many [[Protected areas of Australia|Australian national parks]] have signs advising visitors not to feed wildlife, partly because this practice is not healthy for the animals, and partly because it may encourage undesirable behaviour, such as snatching or biting by dingoes, kangaroos, [[goannas]], and some birds.\n\n==Impact==\n===Ecological ===\n====Extinction of thylacines====\n{{See also|Thylacine#Extinction|l1=Extinction of the thylacine in mainland Australia}}\n\nSome researchers propose that the dingo caused the extinction of the [[thylacine]], the [[Tasmanian devil]], and the [[Tasmanian nativehen|Tasmanian native hen]] from mainland Australia because of the correlation in space and time with the dingo's arrival. Recent studies have questioned this proposal, suggesting that climate change and increasing human populations may have been the cause.<ref>{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Fiona|title=Dingoes cleared of mainland extinctions|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2013/09/dingoes-cleared-of-mainland-extinctions/|work=Australian geographic|publisher=Nine MSN|accessdate=2 March 2014|author2=AAP|date=9 September 2013}}</ref> Dingoes do not seem to have had the same ecological impact that the [[Feral foxes in Australia|red fox]] had in later times.

Also, wild dingo populations might have had [[Demographics|demographic]] support from [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] living with humans.\n\nThe extinction of the thylacine on the continent around 2,000 years ago has also been linked to changes in climate and land use by the Aborigines. Naming the dingo as the cause of the extinction is plausible, but significant morphological differences between the two suggest that the ecological overlapping of both species might be exaggerated. The dingo has the dentition of a [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]], while the thylacine had the dentition of a specialist carnivore without any signs of consumption of [[carrion]] or bones.\n\nThis theory does not explain how the Tasmanian devil and the dingo coexisted on the same continent until about 430 years ago, when the dingo supposedly caused the Tasmanian devil's demise. The [[group dynamics]] of dingoes should have successfully kept devils away from carrion, and since dingoes are able to break bones, little would have been left for the devils to scavenge. Additionally, devils are successful hunters of small- to medium-sized prey, so overlapping of the species should have occurred in this area, too. Furthermore, the arguments that the dingo caused the extinction of the thylacine, the devil, and the hen are in direct conflict with each other. If the dingo were <!--subjunctive--> really so similar to the thylacine and the Tasmanian devil in its ecological role and suppressed both, then coexisting with both for such an extended time is strange. Although this is a possible result of the dingo's introduction, critics regard the evidence for this as insubstantial.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=C. N.|author2=S.

Therefore, it may happen that, over the years, the tame populations may become less suitable for living in the wild than their ancestors. In addition, a loss of genetic diversity (thus resulting in a higher susceptibility to diseases) might occur due to a small founding population, and negative changes could occur simply because the dogs were captive-bred. Furthermore, some features that are necessary for survival in the wild, such as hunting techniques, might \"fade\" under the conditions of domestication, because they are no longer needed.\n\nDingo pets are likely to escape.<ref name=\"oakman1\">{{cite news|title=Australia's dingo dogs face extinction|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-10-07-dongos-extinct_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=7 October 2003|access-date=14 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Interactions with other animals====\nThe dingo is regarded as part of the native [[Fauna of Australia|Australian fauna]] by many [[environmentalist]]s and [[biologist]]s, as these dogs existed on the continent before the arrival of the Europeans and a mutual adaptation of the dingoes and their surrounding [[ecosystem]]s had occurred.\n\nMuch of the present place of wild dogs in the Australian ecosystem, especially in the urban areas, remains unknown.

Likely (with increasing evidence from scientific research), they control the diversity of the ecosystem by limiting the number of prey and keeping the competition in check. Wild dogs hunt feral livestock such as goats and pigs, as well as native prey and [[Invasive species|introduced animals]]. The low number of [[Feral goats in Australia|feral goats]] in Northern Australia is possibly caused by the presence of the dingoes, but whether they control the goats' numbers or not is still disputable. Studies from 1995 in the northern wet forests of Australia found the dingoes there did not reduce the number of [[feral pigs]], but their predation only affects the pig population together with the presence of water buffaloes (which hinder the pigs' access to food).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Corbett|first1=L|title=Does Dingo Predation or Buffalo Competition Regulate Feral Pig Populations in the Australian Wet-Dry Tropics?

As a result,  a disappearance of the dingoes may cause an increase of red fox and [[feral cat]] numbers, and therefore, a higher pressure on native animals. These studies found the presence of dingoes is one of the factors that keep fox numbers in an area low, and therefore reduces pressure on native animals, which then do not disappear from the area. The countrywide numbers of red foxes are especially high where dingo numbers are low, but other factors might responsible for this, depending on the area.<ref name=\"regulator\">{{cite journal|title=Evaluating the role of the dingo as a trophic regulator in Australian ecosystems|doi=10.1111/j.1442-8903.2008.00402.x|year=2008|last1=Claridge|first1=Andrew W.|last2=Hunt|first2=Rob|journal=Ecological Management & Restoration|volume=9|issue=2|page=116}}</ref> Evidence was found for a competition between wild dogs and red foxes in the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] of New South Wales, since  many overlaps occurred in the spectrum of preferred prey, but only evidence for local competition, not on a grand scale, was found.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Bruce D.|last2=Banks|first2=Peter B.|title=Do wild dogs exclude foxes?

Although wild dogs also eat cats,  whether this affects the cat populations is not known.<ref name=\"regulator\"/>\n\nAdditionally, the disappearance of dingoes might increase the prevalence of kangaroo, rabbit, and [[Australian brushturkey]] numbers. In the areas outside the Dingo Fence, the number of dingoes and [[emu]]s is lower than in the areas inside.  However, the numbers changed depending on the habitat.

The dingoes \"are what we would be if we were not what we are.\"<ref name=roseC3/>\n\nSimilar to how Europeans acquired dingoes, the Aboriginal people of Australia acquired dogs from the immigrants very quickly. This process was so fast that [[Francis Barrallier]] (surveyor on early expeditions around the colony at Port Jackson) discovered in 1802 that five dogs of European origin were there before him.<ref name=\"broadcast\"/> One theory holds that other domestic dogs adopt the role of the \"pure\" dingo.<ref name=\"bringing\"/> Introduced animals, such as the water buffalo and the domestic cat, have been adopted into the indigenous Aboriginal culture in the forms of [[ritual]]s, traditional paintings, and dreamtime stories.<ref name=\"heimisch\"/>\n\nMost of the published myths originate from the [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]] and show a remarkable complexity. In some stories, dingoes are the central characters, while in others, they are only minor ones. One time, an ancestor from the Dreamtime created humans and dingoes or gave them their current shape. Stories mention creation, socially acceptable behaviour, and explanations why some things are the way they are. Myths exist about [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifters]] (human to dingo or vice versa), \"dingo-people\", and the creation of certain landscapes or elements of those landscapes, like waterholes or mountains.\n\n===Economic ===\nLivestock farming commenced expanding across Australia from the early 1800s, which led to conflict between the dingo and graziers. Sheep, and to a lesser extent cattle, are an easy target for dingoes. The [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]] and the government bodies that support this industry have shot, trapped, and poisoned dingoes or destroyed dingo pups in their dens. After two centuries of persecution, the dingo or dingo\u2013dog hybrids can still be found across most of the continent.<ref name=smithC5/>\n\nResearch on the real extent of the damage and the reason for this problem only started recently. Livestock can die from many causes, and when the carcass is found,  determining with certainty the cause of death is often difficult. Since the outcome of an attack on livestock depends to a high degree on the behaviour and experience of the predator and the prey, only direct observation is certain to determine whether an attack was by dingoes or other domestic dogs. Even the existence of remnants of the prey in the scat of wild dogs does not prove they are pests, since wild dogs also eat carrion.\n\n[[File:Wild dog distribution 2.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of wild dogs and livestock<ref name=flemingC1/>]]\n\nThe cattle industry can tolerate low to moderate, and sometimes high, grades{{clarify|date=May 2014}} of wild dogs (therefore dingoes are not so easily regarded as pests in these areas). In the case of sheep and goats, a zero-tolerance attitude is common. The biggest threats are dogs that live inside or near the [[paddock]] areas. The extent of sheep loss is hard to determine due to the wide [[pasture]] lands in some parts of Australia.\n\nIn 2006, cattle losses in the Northern Territory rangeland grazing areas were estimated to be up to 30%.<ref name=\"Nord\"/>\n\nTherefore, factors such as availability of native prey, as well as the defending behaviour and health of the cattle, play an important role in the number of losses. A study in Central Australia in 2003 confirmed that dingoes only have a low impact on cattle numbers when a sufficient supply of other prey (such as kangaroos and rabbits) is available. In some parts of Australia, the loss of calves is assumed to be minimised if horned cattle are used instead of [[Polled livestock|polled]].<ref name=\"impact\"/> The precise economic impact is not known in this{{which|date=May 2014}} case, and  the rescue of some calves is unlikely to compensate for the necessary costs of control measures. Calves usually suffer less lethal wounds than sheep due to their size and the protection by the adult cattle, so have a higher chance of surviving an attack. As a result, the evidence of a dog attack may only be discovered after the cattle have been herded back into the enclosure,{{clarify|date=May 2014}} and signs such as bitten ears, tails, and other wounds are discovered.\n\nThe opinions of cattle owners regarding dingoes are more variable than those of sheep owners. Some cattle owners believe that the weakened mother losing her calf is better in times of drought so that she does not have to care for her calf, too. Therefore, these owners are more hesitant to kill dingoes.<ref name=\"Ian\"/> The cattle industry may benefit from the predation of dingoes on rabbits, kangaroos, and rats. Furthermore, the mortality rate of calves has many possible causes, and  discriminating between them is difficult. The only reliable method to document the damage would be to document all pregnant cows, then observe their development and those of their calves.<ref name=\"Nord\"/> The loss of calves in observed areas where dingoes were controlled was higher than in other areas. Loss of livestock is, therefore, not necessarily caused by the occurrence of dingoes and is independent from wild dogs.<ref name=\"ReviewCanid\">{{cite journal|author1=Allen, L.R.  |author2=Fleming, P.J.S. |title=Review of Canid Management in Australia for the Protection of Livestock and Wildlife \u2013 Potential Application to Coyote Management|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/icwdmsheepgoat/2/|journal=Sheep & Goat Research Journal |volume=19 |year=2004|page=97}}</ref> One researcher has stated that for cattle stations where dingoes were controlled, kangaroos were abundant, and this affects the availability of grass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/northern-territory/dingo-expert-says-its-better-for-the-environment-to-let-them-live-even-if-they-eat-one-or-two-cows-here-and-there/story-fnn3gfdo-1227377786816|title=Dingo expert says it's better for the environment to let them live|access-date=9 August 2015|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\nDomestic dogs are the only terrestrial predators in Australia that are big enough to kill fully grown sheep, and only a few sheep manage to recover from the severe injuries. In the case of lambs, death can have many causes apart from attacks by predators, which are blamed for the deaths because they eat from the carcasses. Although attacks by red foxes are possible, such attacks are more rare than previously thought.<ref name=\"ReviewCanid\"/> The fact that the sheep and goat industry is much more susceptible to damage caused by wild dogs than the cattle industry is mostly due to two factors - the flight behaviour of the sheep and their tendency to flock together in the face of danger, and the hunting methods of wild dogs, along with their efficient way of handling goat and sheep.\n\nTherefore, the damage to the livestock industry does not correlate to the numbers of wild dogs in an area (except that no damage occurs where no wild dogs occur<ref name=\"ReviewCanid\"/>).\n\nAccording to a report from the government of Queensland, wild dogs cost the state about $30 million annually due to livestock losses, the spread of diseases, and control measures. Losses for the livestock industry alone were estimated to be as high as $18 million.<ref name=\"Nord\"/> In [[Barcaldine, Queensland]], up to one-fifth of all sheep are killed by dingoes annually, a situation which has been described as an \"epidemic\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Dingo 'epidemic' on farm |first=Aden |last=Miles |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/sheep/8769476/Dingo-epidemic-on-farms |newspaper=Stuff |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref> According to a survey among cattle owners in 1995, performed by the Park and Wildlife Service, owners estimated their annual losses due to wild dogs (depending on the district) to be from 1.6% to 7.1%.<ref name=\"nt\">{{cite web|title=Animals \u2013 Dingo Wild Dog (canis lupus familiaris, canis lupus dingo and hybrids)|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/native/dingo.html?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309125809/http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/native/dingo.html|archivedate=9 March 2009|publisher=Northern Territory Government|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, a study in northern South Australia indicates that fetal/calf loss average 18.6%, with no significant reduction due to dingo baiting.

There was also evidence of dingo predation on calves.<ref name=campbell2018/>\n\nAmong the indigenous Australians, dingoes were also used as hunting aids, living [[hot water bottle]]s, and camp dogs. Their scalps were used as a kind of [[currency]], their teeth were traditionally used for decorative purposes, and their fur for traditional costumes.\n\nSometimes \"pure\" dingoes are important for [[tourism]], when they are used to attract visitors. However, this seems to be common only on Fraser Island, where the dingoes are extensively used as a symbol to enhance the attraction of the island. Tourists are drawn to the experience of personally interacting with dingoes.

The dingo is protected in all Australian government managed national parks and reserves, [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Areas]], and other protected areas.\n* [[Australian Capital Territory]]: The dingo is listed as a \"pest animal\" in the ''Pest Plants and Animals (Pest Animals) Declaration 2016 (No 1)'' made under the ''Pest Plants and Animals Act 2005'', which calls for a management plan for pest animals. The ''Nature Conservation Act 2014'' protects native animals in national parks and reserves but excludes this protection to \"pest animals\" declared under the ''Pest Plants and Animals Act 2005''.\n* [[New South Wales]]: The dingo falls under the definition of \"wildlife\" under the ''National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974'' however it also becomes \"unprotected fauna\" under Schedule 11 of the act. The ''Wild Dog Destruction Act (1921)'' applies only to the [[Western Division (New South Wales)|western division]] of the state and includes the dingo in its definition of \"wild dogs\". The act requires landowners to destroy any wild dogs on their property and any person owning a dingo or half-bred dingo without a permit faces a fine. In other parts of the state, dingoes can be kept as pets under the ''Companion Animals Act 1998'' as a dingo is defined under this act as a \"dog\". The dingo has been proposed for listing under the ''Threatened Species Conservation Act'' because it is argued that these dogs had established populations before the arrival of Europeans, however no decision has been made.\n* [[Northern Territory]]: The dingo is a \"vertebrate that is indigenous to Australia\" and therefore \"protected wildlife\" under the ''Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2014''. A permit is required for all matters dealing with protected wildlife.\n* [[Queensland]]: The dingo is listed as \"least concern wildlife\" in the ''Nature Conservation (Wildlife) Regulation 2006'' under the ''[[Nature Conservation Act 1992]]'', therefore the dingo is protected in National Parks and conservation areas. The dingo is listed as a \"pest\" in the ''Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Regulation 2003'' under the ''Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Act 2002'', which requires land owners to take reasonable steps to keep their lands free of pests.\n* [[South Australia]]: The ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' defines a protected animal as one that is indigenous to Australia but then lists the dingo as an \"unprotected species\" under Schedule 11. The purpose of the ''Dog Fence Act 1946'' is to prevent wild dogs entering into the pastoral and agricultural areas south of the dog-proof fence. The dingo is listed as a \"wild dog\" under this act, and landowners are required to maintain the fence and destroy any wild dog within the vicinity of the fence by shooting, trapping or baiting. The dingo is listed as an \"unprotected species\" in the ''Natural Resources Management Act 2004'', which allows landowners to lay baits \"to control animals\" on their land just north of the dog fence.\n* [[Tasmania]]: Tasmania does not have a native dingo population. The dingo is listed as a \"restricted animal\" in the ''Nature Conservation Act 2002'' and cannot be imported without a permit. Once imported into Tasmania, a dingo is listed as a dog under the ''Dog Control Act 2000''. \n* [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]: The dingo is a \"vertebrate taxon\" that is \"indigenous\" to Australia and therefore \"wildlife\" under the ''Wildlife Act 1975'', which protects wildlife. The act mandates that a permit is required to keep a dingo, and that this dingo must not be cross-bred with a dog. The act allows an order to be made to unprotect dingoes in certain areas of the state. The ''Order in Council made on the 28 September 2010'' includes the far north-west of the state and all of the state north-east of Melbourne. It was made to protect stock on private land. The order allows dingoes to be trapped, shot or baited by any person on private land in these regions, while protecting the dingo on state-owned land.\n* [[Western Australia]]: Dingoes are considered as \"unprotected\" native fauna under the ''[[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950|Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act]]''. The dingo is recorded as a \"declared pest\" on the ''Western Australian Organism List''. This list records those species that have been declared as pests under the ''Biosecurity and Agriculture Management Act 2007'', and these are regarded as pests across all of Western Australia. Landowners must take the prescribed measures to deal with declared pests on their land. The policy of the WA government is to promote eradication of dingoes in the livestock grazing areas but leave them undisturbed in the rest of the state.<ref name=wagov2017/>\n\n==Control measures==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}\nDingo attacks on livestock led to widescale efforts to repel them from areas with intensive agricultural usage, and all states and territories have enacted laws for the control of dingoes.<ref name=\"impact\"/> In the early 20th century, fences were erected to keep dingoes away from areas frequented by sheep, and a tendency to routinely eradicate dingoes developed among some livestock owners. Established methods for the control of dingoes in sheep areas entailed the employment of specific workers on every property. The job of these people (who were nicknamed \"doggers\") was to reduce the number of dingoes by using [[Animal trapping|steel traps]], [[Bait (luring substance)|baits]], firearms and other methods. The responsibility for the control of wild dogs lay solely in the hands of the landowners. At the same time, the government was forced to control the number of dingoes. As a result, a number of measures for the control of dingoes developed over time. It was also considered that dingoes travel over long distances to reach areas with richer prey populations, and the control methods were often concentrated along \"paths\" or \"trails\" and in areas that were far away from sheep areas. All dingoes were regarded as a potential danger and were hunted.\n\nApart from the introduction of the poison [[Sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] (extensively used for 40 years and nicknamed \"doggone\"), the methods and strategies for controlling wild dogs have changed little over time. Information concerning cultural importance to indigenous people and the importance of dingoes and the impact of control measures on other species is also lacking in some areas. Historically, the attitudes and needs of indigenous people were not taken into account when dingoes were controlled. Other factors that might be taken into account are the genetic status (degree of interbreeding) of dingoes in these areas, ownership and land usage, as well as a reduction of killing measures to areas outside of the zones. However, most control measures and the appropriate studies are there to minimise the loss of livestock and not to protect dingoes.\n\nIncreasing pressure from environmentalists against the random killing of dingoes, as well as the impact on other animals, demanded that more information needed to be gathered to prove the necessity of control measures and to disprove the claim of unnecessary killings. Today, permanent population control is regarded as necessary to reduce the impact of all wild dogs and to ensure the survival of the \"pure\" dingo in the wild.<ref name=\"Nord\"/>\n\n===Guardian animals===\nTo protect livestock, [[livestock guardian dog]]s (for example, [[Maremma Sheepdog|Maremmas]]), [[donkey]]s, [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s are used.<ref name=\"wilddogs/dingo\">{{cite web|title=Wild dogs/dingo Canis familiaris/Canis familiaris (dingo) |url=http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Biosecurity_EnvironmentalPests/IPA-Wild-Dog-Strategy.pdf |publisher=Queensland Government |date=September 2002 |accessdate=13 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531220438/http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Biosecurity_EnvironmentalPests/IPA-Wild-Dog-Strategy.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pest of the past, dingo's star in the ascendancy|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/pest-of-the-past-dingoes-star-in-the-ascendancy/2007/07/21/1184560109155.html|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=16 May 2009| location=Melbourne| work=The Age}}</ref>\n\n===Dingo Fence===\n[[File:Dogfence.jpg|thumb|right|A part of the [[dingo fence]]]]\nIn the 1920s, the [[Dingo Fence]] was erected on the basis of the ''Wild Dog Act (1921)'' and, until 1931, thousands of miles of Dingo Fences had been erected in several areas of South Australia. In the year 1946, these efforts were directed to a single goal, and the Dingo Fence was finally completed. The fence connected with other fences in New South Wales and Queensland. The main responsibilities in maintaining the Dingo Fence still lies with the landowners, whose properties border on the fence and receive financial support from the government.\n\n===Reward system===\nA [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] system (local, as well from the government) was active from 1846 to the end of the 20th century, but there is no evidence that \u2013 despite the billions of dollars spent \u2013 it was ever an efficient control method.

The number of doggers also decreased and the frequency of government-approved aerial baiting increased. During this period, many farmers in Western Australia switched to the cattle industry, and findings in the area of biology led to a significant change in control measures and techniques in association with reduced costs and increased efficiency. At the same time, the importance of [[Sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] increased.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 2016, controversy surrounded a plan to inject a population of dingoes on Pelorus Island, off the coast of northern Queensland, Australia, with pills that would release a fatal dose of 1080 poison two years after the dingoes were to be intentionally released to help eradicate goats.

The measures seem{{which|date=October 2014}} to be rather detrimental to the livestock industry because the empty territories are taken over by young dogs and the predation then increases. Nonetheless, it is regarded as unlikely that the control measures could completely eradicate the dingo in Central Australia, and the elimination of all wild dogs is not considered a realistic option.\n\nIt has been shown that culling a small percentage of immature dingoes on Fraser Island have little significant negative impact on the overall island population, though this is being disputed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theconversation.com/culling-is-no-danger-to-the-future-of-dingoes-on-fraser-island-24073|title= Culling is no danger to the future of dingoes on Fraser Island|last1= Benjamin|first1= Allen|date= April 13, 2015|website= theconversation.com|access-date= April 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation of purebreds==\nUntil 2004, the dingo was categorised as of \"least concern\" on the [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]].

Presently, the efforts of the dingo conservation groups are considered to be ineffective because most of their dogs are untested or are known to be hybrids.<ref name=\"canid\"/>\n\nDingo conservation efforts focus primarily on preventing interbreeding between dingoes and other domestic dogs in order to conserve the population of pure dingoes. This is extremely difficult and costly. Conservation efforts are hampered by the fact that it is not known how many pure dingoes still exist in Australia. Steps to conserve the pure dingo can only be effective when the identification of dingoes and other domestic dogs is absolutely reliable, especially in the case of living specimens. Additionally, conservation efforts are in conflict with control measures.\n\nConservation of pure and survivable dingo populations is promising in remote areas, where contact with humans and other domestic dogs is rare. Under New South Wales state policy in parks, reserves and other areas not used by agriculture, these populations are only to be controlled when they pose a threat to the survival of other native species. The introduction of \"dog-free\" buffer zones around areas with pure dingoes is regarded as a realistic method to stop interbreeding. This is enforced in the way that all wild dogs can be killed outside of the conservation areas. However, studies from the year 2007 indicate that even an intensive control of core areas is probably not able to stop the process of interbreeding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Predation and Hybridisation by Feral Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) \u2013 proposed key threatening process listing|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/feraldogspd.htm|publisher=New South Wales Government|date=29 August 2008|accessdate=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Dingo Discovery Sanctuary and Research Centre, many studies are finding a case for the re-introduction of the dingo into previously occupied areas in order to return some balance to badly degraded areas as a result of \"unregulated and ignorant farming practices\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingofoundation.org/|title=Dingo Discovery Research Centre|last=Centre|first=Dingo Discovery Research|website=www.dingofoundation.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref>\n\nDingo densities have been measured at up to 0.3 per square kilometre (0.8/sq&nbsp;mi) in both the [[Guy Fawkes River]] region of New South Wales and in [[South Australia]] at the height of a [[Rabbit plagues in Australia|rabbit plague]].<ref name=\"impact\"/>\n\n===Hybridisation===\n{{Main|Dingo\u2013dog hybrid}}\n[[File:Dingo and hybrid distribution.jpg|thumb|Broad distribution map of dingoes and [[dingo-dog hybrid]]s showing percent purity.<ref name=corbett1995C10/>]]\n[[File:Dingo or maybe crossbreed.jpg|thumb|right|Although dingo-like, this wild dog has an atypical colouration and is therefore most likely a dingo-crossbreed.]]\n\nEuropean domestic dogs first arrived in Australia during the European colonisation.

It is also unclear what kind of role these hybrids would play in the Australian ecosystems. However, it is unlikely that the dynamics of the various ecosystems will be excessively disturbed by this process.<ref name=\"impact\"/>\n\nIn 2011, a total of 3,941 samples were included in the first continent-wide DNA study of wild dogs. The study found that 46% were pure dingoes which exhibited no dog [[alleles]] (gene expressions). There was evidence of hybridisation in every region sampled. In Central Australia only 13% were hybrids, however in southeastern Australia 99% were hybrids or feral dogs. Pure dingo distribution was 88% in the Northern Territory, intermediate numbers in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland, and 1% in New South Wales and Victoria. Almost all wild dogs showed some dingo ancestry,<ref name=stephens2011/><ref name=parr2016/> with only 3% of dogs showing less than 80% dingo ancestry. This indicates that domestic dogs have a low survival rate in the wild or that most hybridisation is the result of roaming dogs that return to their owners. No populations of feral dogs have been found in Australia.<ref name=stephens2011/>\n\nIn 2016, a three dimensional [[Morphometrics#Landmark-based geometric morphometrics|geometric morphometric analysis]] of the skulls of dingoes, dogs and their hybrids found that dingo-dog hybrids exhibit morphology closer to the dingo than to the parent group dog. Hybridisation did not push the unique ''Canis dingo'' cranial morphology towards the wolf phenotype, therefore hybrids cannot be distinguished from dingoes based on cranial measures. The study suggests that the wild dingo morphology is dominant when compared with the recessive dog breed morphology, and concludes that although hybridisation introduces dog DNA into the dingo population, the native cranial morphology remains resistant to change.<ref name=parr2016/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[New Guinea singing dog]]\n*[[Indian Pariah Dog]]\n*[[Free-ranging dog]]\n*[[Carolina Dog]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=AFD2017>{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/Canis_familiaris|title=Species Canis familiaris Linnaeus, 1758 - Common Dog, Dingo, Domestic Dog|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=15 December 2017|website=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Australian Government: Dept of Environment & Energy|access-date=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=allan2012>{{cite journal|doi=10.1071/AM12012|title=Do desert dingoes drink daily?

name=smithC1/><ref name=jackson2017/> Its taxonomic classification is debated. It is a medium-sized [[Canis|canine]] that possesses a lean, hardy body adapted for speed, agility, and stamina. The dingo's three main coat colours are: light ginger or tan, black and tan, or creamy white.<ref name=smithC1/><ref name=purcellC3/> The skull, the widest part of the dingo, is wedge-shaped and large in proportion to the body.<ref name=smithC1/> It differs from that of the domestic dog by its larger [[palate|palatal]] width, longer [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], shorter skull height, and wider [[sagittal crest]].<ref name=crowther2014/>\n\nThey earliest known dingo fossil, found in Western Australia, dates to 3,450 years ago,<ref name=greig2016/><ref name=jackson2015/><ref name=smithC3/> which led to the presumption that dingoes came to Australia with seafarers prior to that time,<ref name=cairns2016/> possibly from south-west [[Sulawesi]] in modern-day Indonesia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/how-did-dingo-get-australia|title=How did the dingo get to Australia?|last=Dayton|first=Leigh|date=4 April 2016|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en|access-date=2019-01-26}}</ref> Dingo morphology has not changed over the past 3,500 years: this suggests that no artificial selection has been applied over this period.<ref name=smithC3/> \n \nThe dingo is closely related to the [[New Guinea singing dog]]:<ref name=greig2016/> their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today's domestic dogs,<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=freedman2014/> and can be traced back through the [[Malay Archipelago]] to Asia.<ref name=greig2016/> A recent genetic study shows that the lineage of those dingoes found today in the northwestern part of the Australian continent split from the lineage of the New Guinea singing dog and southeastern dingo 6,300 BC, followed by a split between the New Guinea singing dog lineage from the southeastern dingo lineage 5,800 BC. The study proposes that two dingo migrations occurred when sea levels were lower and Australia and New Guinea formed one landmass named [[Sahul Shelf|Sahul]]<ref name=cairns2016/><ref name=cairns2017/> that existed until 6,500\u20138,000 years ago.<ref name=smithC3/><ref name=cairns2016/><ref name=cairns2017/>\n\nThe dingo's habitat covers most of Australia, but they are absent in the southeast and Tasmania, a strip on the northeastern coast, and an area in the southwest (see map).<ref name=smithC2/> Dingoes prey on mammals up to the size of the large [[red kangaroo]], in addition to birds, reptiles, fish, crabs, frogs, insects, and seeds.<ref name=smithC2/><ref name=corbett1995C7/><ref name=flemingC2/> The dingo's competitors include the native [[quoll]], the introduced European [[red fox]] and the feral cat.<ref name=flemingC2/> A dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair, their offspring from the current year, and sometimes offspring from the previous year.<ref name=jackson2003/>\n\nThe first [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] colonists who settled at [[Port Jackson]] in 1788 recorded dingoes living with [[Aboriginal Australians|indigenous Australians]].<ref name=tench1789/> When livestock farming began expanding across Australia in the early 19th century, dingoes began preying on sheep and cattle. Numerous population-control measures have been implemented since then, with only limited success.<ref name=smithC5/> The dingo is recognised as a [[Native species|native animal]] under the laws of all Australian jurisdictions.\n\nThe dingo plays a prominent role in the [[Dreamtime]] stories of indigenous Australians;<ref name=roseC3/> however, it rarely appears depicted in their [[cave paintings]] when compared with the extinct [[thylacine]],<ref name=smithC3/><ref name=gunn2010/> also known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf.\n\n==Etymology, synonyms, and usage==\n[[File:George Stubbs, A portrait of a large Dog from New Holland (Dingo), 1772.jpg|thumb|\"[[Portrait of a Large Dog]] from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]\" by [[George Stubbs]], 1772.

Christopher Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under the wolf ''Canis lupus'' its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: \"''familiaris'' Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]\" and \"''dingo'' Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]\". Wozencraft included ''hallstromi'' - the New Guinea singing dog - as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision.<ref name=wozencraft2005/> The inclusion of ''familiaris'' and ''dingo'' under a \"domestic dog\" clade has been noted by other mammalogists,<ref name=jackson2017/> and their classification under the wolf debated.<ref name=smithC1/>\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/SSC Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea Singing Dog and the Dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN_CSG/>\n\n===Domestic status===\nThe dingo is regarded as a [[feral]] dog because it descended from domesticated ancestors.<ref name=greig2016/><ref name=jackson2017/> The dingo's relationship with indigenous Australians is one of [[commensalism]], in which two organisms live in close association, but do not depend on each other for survival. They both hunt and sleep together. The dingo is, therefore, comfortable enough around humans to associate with them, but is still capable of living independently.<ref name=pierotti2017/> Any free-ranging, unowned dog can be socialised to become an owned dog, as some dingoes do when they join human families.<ref name=miklosi2015/> Although the dingo exists in the wild,<ref name=smithC3/> it associates with humans, but has not been [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] similarly to other [[Domestication|domesticated]] animals.<ref name=jackson2015/><ref name=smithC3/> Therefore, its status as a domestic animal is not clear.<ref name=jackson2015/> Whether the dingo was a wild or domesticated species was not clarified from Meyer's original description, which translated from the German language ambiguously reads:\n\n<blockquote>It is not known if it is the only dog species in New South Wales, and if it can also still be found in the wild state; however, so far it appears to have lost little of its wild condition; moreover, no divergent varieties have been discovered.<ref name=meyer1793/></blockquote>\n\n===Fossil record===\nThe oldest reliable date for dog remains found in mainland Southeast Asia is from Vietnam at 4,000 years [[YBP]], and in island southeast Asia from [[Timor-Leste]] at 3,000 YBP.<ref name=balme2018/> The earliest dingo remains in the [[Torres Straits]] date to 2,100 YBP.

The next-most reliable timing is based on desiccated flesh dated 2,200 YBP from Thylacine Hole, 110&nbsp;km west of Eucla on the Nullarbor Plain, southeastern Western Australia. When dingoes first arrived, they would have been taken up by indigenous Australians, who then provided a network for their swift transfer around the continent. Based on the recorded distribution time for dogs across Tasmania and cats across Australia once indigenous Australians had acquired them, the dispersal of dingoes from their point of landing until they occupied continental Australia is proposed to have taken only 70 years.<ref name=balme2018/> The red fox is estimated to have dispersed across the continent in only 60\u201380 years.<ref name=smithC3/>\n\nAt the end of the [[last glacial maximum]] and the associated rise in sea levels, Tasmania became separated from the Australian mainland 12,000 YBP,<ref name=lyndall2012/> and New Guinea 6,500<ref name=cairns2016/>\u20138,500 YBP<ref name=cairns2016/><ref name=bourke2009/> by the inundation of the [[Sahul Shelf]].<ref name=monash2015/> Fossil remains in Australia date to around 3,500 YBP and no dingo remains have been uncovered in Tasmania, so the dingo is estimated to have arrived in Australia at a time between 3,500 and 12,000 YBP. To reach Australia through the [[Malay Archipelago]] even at the lowest sea level of the last glacial maximum, a journey of at least 50&nbsp;km over open sea between ancient [[Sunda Shelf|Sunda]] and Sahul was necessary, so they must have accompanied humans on boats.<ref name=savolainen2004/>\n\nBased on a comparison with these early fossils, dingo morphology has not changed over thousands of years. This suggests that no artificial selection has been applied over this period and that the dingo represents an early form of dog.<ref name=smithC3/> They have lived, bred, and undergone natural selection in the wild, isolated from other canines until the arrival of European settlers, resulting in a unique canid.<ref name=clutton2015/><ref name=crowther2014/>\n\n==Phylogeny==\n[[Image:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|350px|thumb|The [[Sahul Shelf]] and the [[Sunda Shelf]] during the past 12,000 years: Tasmania separated from the mainland 12,000 YBP,<ref name=lyndall2012/> and New Guinea separated from the mainland 6,500<ref name=cairns2016/>\u20138,500 YBP.<ref name=cairns2016/><ref name=bourke2009/>]]\n\n[[Whole genome sequencing]] indicates the dog to be a [[Genetic divergence|genetically divergent]] subspecies of the grey wolf,<ref name=fan2016/> the dog is not a descendant of the extant grey wolf, but these are sister taxa which share a common ancestor from a [[ghost population]] of wolves that went extinct at the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]],<ref name=freedman2014/> and the dog and the dingo are not separate species.<ref name=fan2016/> The dingo and the [[Basenji]] are [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] members of the domestic dog clade.<ref name=fan2016/><ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=freedman2014/> \"The term basal taxon refers to a lineage that diverges early in the history of the group and lies on a branch that originates near the common ancestor of the group.\"<ref name=reece2015/> [[Mitochondrial genome]] sequences indicates that the dingo falls within the domestic dog clade,<ref name=thalmann2013/> and that the New Guinea singing dog is genetically closer to those dingoes that live in southeastern Australia than to those that live in the northwest.<ref name=cairns2016/> The dingo and New Guinea singing dog lineage can be traced back through the Malay Archipelago to Asia.<ref name=greig2016/> [[Gene flow]] from the genetically divergent [[Tibetan wolf#Lineage|Tibetan wolf]] forms 2% of the dingo's genome,<ref name=fan2016/> which likely represents ancient admixture in eastern Eurasia.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=wang2015/>\n\n{{Details|Canis lupus dingo#Lineage}}\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Wolf cranium labelled.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=Incisors at the front, followed by canines, followed by premolars, followed by molars at the back|Key features of a wolf skull and dentition]]\n[[File:Dingoskull.jpg|thumb|Sketching of a dingo skull by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier]]]]\n[[File:Dingo (Canis lupus dingo) skeleton at the Royal Veterinary College anatomy museum.JPG|thumb|Skeleton]]\n\n===Body===\nThe dingo is a medium-sized canid with a lean, hardy body that is designed for speed, agility, and stamina. The head is the widest part of the body,  wedge-shaped, and large in proportion to the body.<ref name=smithC1/> Captive dingoes are longer and heavier than wild dingoes, as they have access to better food and veterinary care. The average wild dingo male weighs {{convert|15.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the female {{convert|14.1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, compared with the captive male {{convert|18.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the female {{convert|16.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

Dingoes rarely carry excess fat and the wild ones display exposed ribs.<ref name=smithC1/> Dingoes from northern and northwestern Australia are often larger than those found in central and southern Australia.<ref name=corbett2004/><ref name=smithC1/> The dingo is similar to the New Guinea singing dog in morphology apart from the dingo's greater height at the [[withers]].<ref name=crowther2014/>\n\n===Head===\nEarly studies identified the skull as being more like that of the [[golden jackal]] than it is to the wolf or coyote.<ref name=clutton1976/> Compared with the skull of the dog, the dingo possesses a longer [[Snout|muzzle]], longer [[carnassial]] teeth, longer and more slender [[canine teeth]],  larger [[auditory bullae]], a flatter [[cranium]] with a larger [[sagittal crest]], and larger [[nuchal lines]].<ref name=smithC1/> In 2014, a study was conducted on pre-20th century dingo specimens that are unlikely to have been influenced by later hybridisation. The dingo skull was found to differ relative to the domestic dog by its larger [[palate|palatal]] width, longer [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]], shorter skull height, and wider sagittal crest.<ref name=crowther2014/> Based on a comparison with the remains of a dingo found at Fromme's Landing, the dingo's skull and skeleton have not changed over the past 3,000 years.<ref name=smithC1/> Compared to the wolf, the dingo possesses a [[paedomorphic]] [[cranium]] similar to domestic dogs. However, the dingo has a larger brain size compared to dogs of the same body weight, with the dingo being more comparable with the wolf than dogs are. In this respect, the dingo resembles two similar [[mesopredators]], the dhole and the coyote.<ref name=smith2017b/> The eyes are triangular (or almond-shaped) and are hazel to dark in colour with dark rims. The ears are [[Erect (position)|erect]] and occur high on the skull.<ref name=smithC1/>\n\n===Coat colour===\nThe dingo's three main coat colours are described as being light ginger (or tan), black and tan, and creamy white.<ref name=smithC1/><ref name=purcellC3/> The ginger colour ranges from a deep rust to a pale cream and can be found in 74% of dingoes. Often, small white markings are seen on the tip of the tail, the feet, and the chest, but with no large white patches. Some do not exhibit white tips. The black and tan dingoes possess a black coat with a tan muzzle, chest, belly, legs, and feet and can be found in 12% of dingoes. Solid white can be found in 2% of dingoes and solid black 1%. Coat colours with [[Coat (dog)#Patterns|sable]], [[Roan (color)|ticking]], or [[Coat (dog)#Patterns|brindle]] indicate some hybridisation and can be found in 12% of dingoes. Only three genes affect coat colour in the dingo compared with nine genes in the domestic dog. The ginger colour is dominant and carries the other three main colours - black, tan, and white. White dingoes breed true, and black and tan dingoes breed true; when these cross, the result is a sandy colour.<ref name=smithC1/><ref name=cairns2011/> The coat is not oily, nor does not have a dog-like odour. The dingo has a single coat in the tropical north of Australia and a double thick coat in the cold mountains of the south, the undercoat being a wolf-grey colour.<ref name=smithC1/>\n\n===Tail===\nThe dingo's tail is flatish, tapering after mid-length and does not curve over the back, but is carried low.<ref name=smithC1/> \n\n===Gait===\nWhen walking, the dingo's rear foot steps in line with the front foot,<ref name=smithC1/> and these do not possess [[dewclaws]].<ref name=corbett2004/>\n\n===Lifespan===\nDingoes in the wild live 3\u20135 years with few living past 7\u20138 years. Some have been recorded living up to 10 years. In captivity, they live for 14\u201316 years.<ref name=jackson2003/> One dingo has been recorded to live just under 20 years.<ref name=smithC11/>\n\n==Adaptation==\n\n===Hybrids, distribution and habitat===\n[[File:Dingo-Distribution-Fleming.png|thumb|left|Distribution map of dingoes and dingo-dog [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]]: The black line represents the [[Dingo Fence]]<ref name=flemingC1/>]]\n\nThe [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]] are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because their [[chromosome]]s number 78, therefore they can potentially interbreed to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrids]].<ref name=wayne1999/> In the Australian wild there exist dingoes, feral dogs, and the crossings of these two, which produce [[Interbreeding of dingoes with other domestic dogs|dingo-dog hybrids]].<ref name=flemingC1/> Most studies looking at the distribution of dingoes focus on the distribution of dingo-dog hybrids, instead.<ref name=smithC2/>\n\nDingoes occurred throughout mainland Australia before European settlement.<ref name=NTPWS2006/><ref name=flemingC1/> They are not found in the fossil record of Tasmania, so they apparently arrived in Australia after Tasmania had separated from the mainland due to rising sea levels.<ref name=purcellC2/> The introduction of agriculture reduced dingo distribution, and by the early 1900s, large barrier fences, including the [[Dingo Fence]], excluded them from the sheep-grazing areas. Land clearance, poisoning, and trapping caused the extinction of the dingo and hybrids from most of their former range in southern Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. Today, they are absent from most of New South Wales, Victoria, the southeastern third of South Australia, and the southwestern tip of Western Australia. They are sparse in the eastern half of Western Australia and the adjoining areas of the Northern Territory and South Australia. They are regarded as common across the remainder of the continent.<ref name=NTPWS2006/><ref name=flemingC1/>\n\nThe dingo could be considered an [[ecotype]] or an ecospecies that has adapted to Australia's unique environment.<ref name=smith49/> The dingo's present distribution covers a variety of habitats, including the temperate regions of [[Eastern states of Australia|eastern Australia]], the alpine moorlands of the [[Great Dividing Range|eastern highlands]], the arid hot deserts of [[Central Australia]], and the tropical forests and wetlands of [[Northern Australia]].<ref name=smithC2/> The occupation of, and adaption to, these habitats may have been assisted by their relationship with indigenous Australians.<ref name=purcellC3/>\n\n===Prey===\n[[File:The Dingo Finds a Dead Fish.jpg|thumb|Dingo with a fish on Fraser Island]]\n\nA 20-year study of the dingo's diet was conducted across Australia by the federal and state governments. These examined a total of 13,000 stomach contents and fecal samples.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> For the fecal samples, determining the matching tracks of foxes and feral cats  was possible without including these samples in the study, but in distinguishing between the tracks left by dingoes and those of dingo hybrids or feral dogs was impossible.<ref name=corbett1995C2/> The study found that these canines prey on 177 species represented by 72.3% mammals (71 species), 18.8% birds (53 species), 3.3% vegetation (seeds), 1.8% reptiles (23 species), and 3.8% insects, fish, crabs, and frogs (28 species).<ref name=corbett1995C7/><ref name=flemingC2/><ref name=smithC2/> The relative proportions of prey are much the same across Australia, apart from more birds being eaten in the north and south-east coastal regions, and more lizards in Central Australia.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> Some 80% of the diet consisted of 10 species: [[red kangaroo]], [[swamp wallaby]], cattle, [[dusky rat]], [[magpie goose]], [[common brushtail possum]], [[long-haired rat]], [[agile wallaby]], [[European rabbit]], and [[common wombat]].<ref name=corbett1995A3/><ref name=flemingC2/> Of the mammals eaten, 20% could be regarded as large.<ref name=corbett1995C7/>\n\nHowever, the relative proportions of the size of prey mammals varied across regions. In the tropical coast region of the Northern Territory, agile wallabies, dusky rats, and magpie geese formed 80% of the diet. In Central Australia, the rabbit has become a substitute for native mammals, and during droughts, cattle carcasses provide most of the diet. On the [[Barkly Tableland]],  no rabbits occur nor does any native species dominate the diet, except for long-haired rats that form occasional plagues. In the [[Fortescue River]] region, the large red kangaroo and [[common wallaroo]] dominate the diet, as few smaller mammals are found in this area. On the Nullarbor Plain, rabbits and red kangaroos dominate the diet, and twice as much rabbit eaten as red kangaroo. In the temperate mountains of eastern Australia, swamp wallaby and red-necked wallaby dominate the diet on the lower slopes and wombat on the higher slopes. Possums are commonly eaten here when found on the ground.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> In coastal regions, dingoes patrol the beaches for washed-up fish, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[penguins]], and other birds.<ref name=flemingC2/>\n\nDingoes drink about a litre of water each day in the summer and  half a litre in winter. In arid regions during the winter, dingoes may live from the liquid in the bodies of their [[prey]], as long as the number of prey is sufficient. In arid Central Australia, weaned pups draw most of their water from their food. There, regurgitation of water by the females for the pups was observed. During lactation, captive females  have no higher need of water than usual, since they consume the urine and feces of the pups, thus recycling the water and keeping the den clean.<ref name=flemingC2/> Tracked dingoes in the [[Strzelecki Desert]] regularly visited water-points every 3\u20135 days, with two dingoes surviving 22 days without water during both winter and summer.<ref name=allan2012/>\n\n===Hunting behaviour===\nDingoes, dingo hybrids, and feral dogs usually attack from the rear as they pursue their prey. They kill their prey by biting the throat, which damages the [[trachea]] and the major blood vessels of the neck.<ref name=flemingC6/> The size of the hunting pack is determined by the type of prey targeted, with large packs formed to help hunt large prey. Large prey can include kangaroos, cattle, water buffalo, and feral horses.<ref name=flemingC2/> Dingoes will assess and target prey based on the prey's ability to inflict damage on dingoes. Large [[kangaroo]]s are the most commonly killed prey. The main tactic is to sight the kangaroo, bail it up, then kill it. Dingoes typically hunt large kangaroos by having lead dingoes chase the quarry toward the paths of their pack mates, which are skilled at cutting corners in chases. The kangaroo becomes exhausted and is then killed. This same tactic is used by wolves, [[African wild dogs]], and [[hyenas]]. Another tactic shared with African wild dogs is a relay pursuit until the prey is exhausted. A pack of dingoes is three times as likely to bring down a kangaroo than an individual because the killing is done by those following the lead chaser, which has also become exhausted.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> Two patterns are seen for the final stage of the attack. An adult or juvenile kangaroo is nipped at the hamstrings of the hind legs to slow it before an attack to the throat. A small adult female or juvenile is bitten on the neck or back by dingoes running beside it.<ref name=flemingC2/> In one area of Central Australia, dingoes hunt kangaroos by chasing them into a wire fence, where they become temporarily immobilised. The largest male red kangaroos tend to ignore dingoes, even when the dingoes are hunting the younger males and females. A large eastern grey kangaroo successfully fought off an attack by a single dingo that lasted over an hour. Wallabies are hunted in a similar manner to kangaroos, the difference being that a single dingo hunts using scent rather than sight and the hunt may last several hours.<ref name=corbett1995C7/>\n\nDingo packs may attack young cattle and buffalo, but never healthy, grown adults. They focus on the sick or injured young. The tactics include harassing a mother with young, panicking a herd to separate the adults from the young, or watching a herd and looking for any unusual behaviour that might then be exploited.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> One 1992 study in the [[Fortescue River]] region observed that cattle defend their calves by circling around the calves or aggressively charging dingoes. In one study of 26 approaches, 24 were by more than one dingo and only four resulted in calves being killed. Dingoes often revisited carcasses. They did not touch fresh cattle carcasses until these were largely skin and bone, and even when these were plentiful, they still preferred to hunt kangaroos. Of 68 chases of sheep, 26 sheep were seriously injured, but only eight were killed. The dingoes could outrun the sheep and the sheep were defenceless. However, the dingoes in general appeared not to be motivated to kill sheep, and in many cases just loped alongside the sheep before veering off to chase another sheep. For those that did kill and consume sheep,  a large quantity of kangaroo was still in their diet, indicating once again a preference for kangaroo.<ref name=thomson1992/> \n \nLone dingoes can run down a rabbit, but are more successful by targeting kittens near rabbit warrens. Dingoes take nestling birds, in addition to birds that are moulting and therefore cannot fly.<ref name=corbett1995C7/> Predators often use highly intelligent hunting techniques. Dingoes on Fraser Island have been observed using waves to entrap, tire, and help drown an adult swamp wallaby<ref name=behrendorff2018/> and an echidna.<ref name=behrendorff2018b/> In the coastal wetlands of northern Australia, dingoes depend on magpie geese for a large part of their diet and a lone dingo sometimes distracts these while a [[White-bellied sea eagle|white-breasted sea eagle]] makes a kill that is too heavy for it to carry off, with the dingo then driving the sea eagle away. They also scavenge on prey dropped from the nesting platforms of sea eagles.  Lone dingoes may hunt small rodents and grasshoppers in grass by using their senses of smell and hearing, then pouncing on them with their forepaws.<ref name=corbett1995C7/>\n\n===Competitors===\nDingoes and their hybrids co-exist with the native [[quoll]]. They also co-occur in the same territory as the introduced European [[red fox]] and feral cat, but little is known about the relationships between these three. Dingoes and their hybrids can drive off foxes from sources of water and occasionally eat feral cats. Dingoes can be killed by buffalo and cattle goring and kicking them, from snake bite, and predation on their pups by wedge-tailed eagles.<ref name=flemingC2/>\n\n==Communication==\nLike all domestic dogs, dingoes tend towards [[phonetics|phonetic]] communication. However, in contrast to domestic dogs, dingoes howl and whimper more, and bark less. Eight [[Sonority hierarchy|sound classes]] with 19 sound types have been identified.<ref name=\"DoritAusdruck\"/>\n\n===Barking===\n[[File:Nullarbor Dingo.jpg|thumb|Dingo on the [[Nullarbor]]]]\n\nCompared to most domestic dogs, the [[bark (dog)|bark]] of a dingo is short and monosyllabic, and is rarely used. Barking was observed to make up only 5% of [[Animal communication|vocalisations]]. Dog barking has always been distinct from wolf barking.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schassburger|first=R.M.|title=Man and Wolf|year=1987|publisher=Dr. W. Junk|location=Dordrecht, the Netherlands|editor=H.

In addition, barking is almost exclusively used for giving warnings. Warn-barking in a homotypical sequence and a kind of \"warn-howling\" in a heterotypical sequence have also been observed. The bark-howling starts with several barks and then fades into a rising and ebbing howl and is probably (similar to coughing) used to warn the puppies and members of the [[Pack (canine)|pack]]. Additionally, dingoes emit a sort of \"wailing\" sound, which they mostly use when approaching a [[Depression (geology)|watering hole]], probably to warn already present dingoes.<ref name=\"canid\">{{cite book|author=Corbett, Laurie |year=2004|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]|chapter-url=http://www.carnivoreconservation.org/files/actionplans/canids.pdf|chapter=Dingo|title=Canids: Foxes, Wolves, Jackals and Dogs|editor1=Claudio Sillero-Zubiri |editor2=Michael Hoffmann |editor3=David W. Macdonald }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the present state of knowledge,  getting Australian dingoes to bark more frequently by putting them in contact with other domestic dogs is not possible. However, German zoologist [[Alfred Brehm]] reported a dingo that learned the more \"typical\" form of barking and how to use it, while its brother did not.<ref name=\"Brehm\">{{cite book|authorlink=Alfred Edmund Brehm|title=Brehms Tierleben|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|location=Leipzig, Wien|year=1900|pages=82\u201385|language=German|title-link=Brehms Tierleben}}</ref> Whether dingoes bark or bark-howl less frequently in general is not certain.<ref name=\"DoritAusdruck\">{{cite book|last=Feddersen-Petersen|first=Dorit Urd|title=Ausdrucksverhalten beim Hund|publisher=Franckh-Kosmos Verlags-GmbH & Co.

Usually, three kinds of howls are distinguished: long and persistent, rising and ebbing, and short and abrupt.\n\nObservations have shown that each kind of howling has several variations, though their purpose is unknown. The frequency of howling varies with the season and time of day, and is also influenced by [[Breeding in the wild|breeding]], [[Animal migration|migration]], [[lactation]], social stability, and [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] behaviour. Howling can be more frequent in times of food shortage, because the dogs become more widely distributed within their [[home range]].<ref name=\"canid\"/>\n\nAdditionally, howling seems to have a group function, and is sometimes an expression of joy (for example, greeting-howls). Overall, howling was observed less frequently in dingoes than among grey wolves. It may happen that one dog will begin to howl, and several or all other dogs will howl back and bark from time to time. In the [[wilderness]], dingoes howl over long distances to attract other members of the pack, to find other dogs, or to keep intruders at bay. Dingoes howl in chorus with significant pitches, and with increasing number of pack members, the variability of pitches also increases.<ref name=corbett1995C5/> Therefore,  dingoes are suspected to be able to measure the size of a pack without visual contact.<ref name=\"impact\">{{Cite book|last=Fleming|first=Peter|author2=Laurie Corbett |author3=Robert Harden |author4=Peter Thomson |title=Managing the Impacts of Dingoes and Other Wild Dogs|publisher=Bureau of Rural Sciences|location=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2001}}</ref> Moreover,  their highly variable chorus howls have been proposed to generate a confounding effect in the receivers by making pack size appear larger.<ref>Ortolani, A., Corbett, L.K., Feinstein, F.H., and R.P. Coppinger. 2001. \"A comparative study of larynx anatomy and howling vocalizations in five canids,\" poster presented at Canid Biology and Conservation Conference, Oxford University, Oxford, UK.</ref>\n\n===Other forms ===\nGrowling, making up about 65% of the vocalisations, is used in an [[wikt:agonistic|agonistic]] context for [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]], and as a defensive sound. Similar to many domestic dogs, a reactive usage of defensive growling is only rarely observed. Growling very often occurs in combination with other sounds, and has been observed almost exclusively in swooshing noises (similar to barking).<ref name=\"DoritAusdruck\"/>\n\nDuring observations in [[Germany]], dingoes were heard to produce a sound that observers have called ''Schrappen''. It was only observed in an agonistic context, mostly as a defence against obtrusive pups or for defending resources. It was described as a bite intention, during which the receiver is never touched or hurt. Only a clashing of the teeth could be heard.<ref name=\"DoritAusdruck\"/>\n\nAside from vocal communication, dingoes communicate, like all domestic dogs, via [[Raised-leg urination|scent marking]] specific objects (for example, ''[[Triodia (grass)|Spinifex]]'') or places (such as waters, trails, and hunting grounds) using [[Urine spraying#Canidae|chemical signals from their urine]], feces, and [[scent gland]]s. Males scent mark more frequently than females, especially during the [[Mating season#Breeding season|mating season]]. They also [[scent rub]], whereby a dog rolls its neck, shoulders, or back on something that is usually associated with food or the scent markings of other dogs.<ref name=\"canid\"/>\n\nUnlike wolves, dingoes can react to social cues and gestures from humans.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Young| first=Emma| title=Dingoes skilled at Reading Human Gestures| journal=[[Australian Geographic]]| date=5 March 2010| url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/dingoes-skilled-at-reading-human-gestures.htm| accessdate=13 January 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126142449/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/dingoes-skilled-at-reading-human-gestures.htm| archive-date=26 January 2013| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\nDingoes tend to be [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] in warmer regions, but less so in cooler areas. Their main period of activity is around [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]. The periods of activity are short (often less than 1 hour) with short times of resting.

Within packs, the alpha female tends to go into heat before subordinates and actively suppresses mating attempts by other females. Males become sexually mature between the ages of 1 and 3 years. The precise start of breeding varies depending on age, social status, geographic range, and seasonal conditions. Among dingoes in captivity, the pre-estrus was observed to last 10\u201312 days.

This behaviour possibly developed as an adaptation to the fluctuating environmental conditions in Australia.

However, during times of [[famine]], even in normally \"safe\" areas, dingoes travel into [[pastoral]] areas, where intensive, human-induced control measures are undertaken. In [[Western Australia]] in the 1970s, young dogs were found to travel for long distances when necessary.

Most attacks involve people feeding wild dingoes, particularly on Fraser Island, which is a special centre of dingo-related tourism. The vast majority of dingo attacks are minor in nature, but some can be major, and a few have been fatal: the death of 2-month-old [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain|Azaria Chamberlain]] in the [[Northern Territory]] in 1980 is one of them. Many [[Protected areas of Australia|Australian national parks]] have signs advising visitors not to feed wildlife, partly because this practice is not healthy for the animals, and partly because it may encourage undesirable behaviour, such as snatching or biting by dingoes, kangaroos, [[goannas]], and some birds.\n\n==Impact==\n===Ecological ===\n====Extinction of thylacines====\n{{See also|Thylacine#Extinction|l1=Extinction of the thylacine in mainland Australia}}\n\nSome researchers propose that the dingo caused the extinction of the [[thylacine]], the [[Tasmanian devil]], and the [[Tasmanian nativehen|Tasmanian native hen]] from mainland Australia because of the correlation in space and time with the dingo's arrival. Recent studies have questioned this proposal, suggesting that climate change and increasing human populations may have been the cause.<ref>{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Fiona|title=Dingoes cleared of mainland extinctions|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2013/09/dingoes-cleared-of-mainland-extinctions/|work=Australian geographic|publisher=Nine MSN|accessdate=2 March 2014|author2=AAP|date=9 September 2013}}</ref> Dingoes do not seem to have had the same ecological impact that the [[Feral foxes in Australia|red fox]] had in later times. This might be connected to the dingo's way of hunting and the size of their favoured prey, as well as to the low number of dingoes in the time before European colonisation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Short|first1=J|title=Surplus killing by introduced predators in Australia\u2014evidence for ineffective anti-predator adaptations in native prey species?|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=103|pages=283\u2013301|year=2002|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(01)00139-2|issue=3|last2=Kinnear|first2=J.E.|last3=Robley|first3=Alan}}</ref>\n\nThe assumption that dingoes and thylacines were competitors for the same prey stems from their external similarities; the thylacine had a stronger and more efficient bite, but was probably dependent on relatively small prey, while the dingo's stronger skull and neck would have allowed it to bring down larger prey.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wroe|first1=S.|last2=Clausen|first2=P.|last3=McHenry|first3=C.|last4=Moreno|first4=K.|last5=Cunningham|first5=E.|title=Computer simulation of feeding behaviour in the thylacine and dingo as a novel test for convergence and niche overlap|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|volume=274|pages=2819\u201328|year=2007|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0906|issue=1627|pmid=17785272|pmc=2288692}}</ref> The dingo was probably a superior hunter, as it hunted cooperatively in packs and could better defend resources, while the thylacine was probably more solitary. Also, wild dingo populations might have had [[Demographics|demographic]] support from [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] living with humans.\n\nThe extinction of the thylacine on the continent around 2,000 years ago has also been linked to changes in climate and land use by the Aborigines. Naming the dingo as the cause of the extinction is plausible, but significant morphological differences between the two suggest that the ecological overlapping of both species might be exaggerated. The dingo has the dentition of a [[Generalist and specialist species|generalist]], while the thylacine had the dentition of a specialist carnivore without any signs of consumption of [[carrion]] or bones.\n\nThis theory does not explain how the Tasmanian devil and the dingo coexisted on the same continent until about 430 years ago, when the dingo supposedly caused the Tasmanian devil's demise. The [[group dynamics]] of dingoes should have successfully kept devils away from carrion, and since dingoes are able to break bones, little would have been left for the devils to scavenge. Additionally, devils are successful hunters of small- to medium-sized prey, so overlapping of the species should have occurred in this area, too. Furthermore, the arguments that the dingo caused the extinction of the thylacine, the devil, and the hen are in direct conflict with each other. If the dingo were <!--subjunctive--> really so similar to the thylacine and the Tasmanian devil in its ecological role and suppressed both, then coexisting with both for such an extended time is strange. Although this is a possible result of the dingo's introduction, critics regard the evidence for this as insubstantial.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=C. N.|author2=S.

The main criticism is that the activities and the resulting consequences of the dingo conservation groups, \"dingo farms\" and legislation for legal ownership of dingoes for people in public, is seen to be an additional threat to the survival of the pure dingoes.

Likely (with increasing evidence from scientific research), they control the diversity of the ecosystem by limiting the number of prey and keeping the competition in check. Wild dogs hunt feral livestock such as goats and pigs, as well as native prey and [[Invasive species|introduced animals]]. The low number of [[Feral goats in Australia|feral goats]] in Northern Australia is possibly caused by the presence of the dingoes, but whether they control the goats' numbers or not is still disputable. Studies from 1995 in the northern wet forests of Australia found the dingoes there did not reduce the number of [[feral pigs]], but their predation only affects the pig population together with the presence of water buffaloes (which hinder the pigs' access to food).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Corbett|first1=L|title=Does Dingo Predation or Buffalo Competition Regulate Feral Pig Populations in the Australian Wet-Dry Tropics?

As a result,  a disappearance of the dingoes may cause an increase of red fox and [[feral cat]] numbers, and therefore, a higher pressure on native animals. These studies found the presence of dingoes is one of the factors that keep fox numbers in an area low, and therefore reduces pressure on native animals, which then do not disappear from the area.

The dingoes \"are what we would be if we were not what we are.\"<ref name=roseC3/>\n\nSimilar to how Europeans acquired dingoes, the Aboriginal people of Australia acquired dogs from the immigrants very quickly. This process was so fast that [[Francis Barrallier]] (surveyor on early expeditions around the colony at Port Jackson) discovered in 1802 that five dogs of European origin were there before him.<ref name=\"broadcast\"/> One theory holds that other domestic dogs adopt the role of the \"pure\" dingo.<ref name=\"bringing\"/> Introduced animals, such as the water buffalo and the domestic cat, have been adopted into the indigenous Aboriginal culture in the forms of [[ritual]]s, traditional paintings, and dreamtime stories.<ref name=\"heimisch\"/>\n\nMost of the published myths originate from the [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]] and show a remarkable complexity. In some stories, dingoes are the central characters, while in others, they are only minor ones. One time, an ancestor from the Dreamtime created humans and dingoes or gave them their current shape. Stories mention creation, socially acceptable behaviour, and explanations why some things are the way they are. Myths exist about [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifters]] (human to dingo or vice versa), \"dingo-people\", and the creation of certain landscapes or elements of those landscapes, like waterholes or mountains.\n\n===Economic ===\nLivestock farming commenced expanding across Australia from the early 1800s, which led to conflict between the dingo and graziers. Sheep, and to a lesser extent cattle, are an easy target for dingoes. The [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]] and the government bodies that support this industry have shot, trapped, and poisoned dingoes or destroyed dingo pups in their dens. After two centuries of persecution, the dingo or dingo\u2013dog hybrids can still be found across most of the continent.<ref name=smithC5/>\n\nResearch on the real extent of the damage and the reason for this problem only started recently. Livestock can die from many causes, and when the carcass is found,  determining with certainty the cause of death is often difficult. Since the outcome of an attack on livestock depends to a high degree on the behaviour and experience of the predator and the prey, only direct observation is certain to determine whether an attack was by dingoes or other domestic dogs. Even the existence of remnants of the prey in the scat of wild dogs does not prove they are pests, since wild dogs also eat carrion.\n\n[[File:Wild dog distribution 2.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of wild dogs and livestock<ref name=flemingC1/>]]\n\nThe cattle industry can tolerate low to moderate, and sometimes high, grades{{clarify|date=May 2014}} of wild dogs (therefore dingoes are not so easily regarded as pests in these areas). In the case of sheep and goats, a zero-tolerance attitude is common. The biggest threats are dogs that live inside or near the [[paddock]] areas. The extent of sheep loss is hard to determine due to the wide [[pasture]] lands in some parts of Australia.\n\nIn 2006, cattle losses in the Northern Territory rangeland grazing areas were estimated to be up to 30%.<ref name=\"Nord\"/>\n\nTherefore, factors such as availability of native prey, as well as the defending behaviour and health of the cattle, play an important role in the number of losses. A study in Central Australia in 2003 confirmed that dingoes only have a low impact on cattle numbers when a sufficient supply of other prey (such as kangaroos and rabbits) is available. In some parts of Australia, the loss of calves is assumed to be minimised if horned cattle are used instead of [[Polled livestock|polled]].<ref name=\"impact\"/> The precise economic impact is not known in this{{which|date=May 2014}} case, and  the rescue of some calves is unlikely to compensate for the necessary costs of control measures. Calves usually suffer less lethal wounds than sheep due to their size and the protection by the adult cattle, so have a higher chance of surviving an attack. As a result, the evidence of a dog attack may only be discovered after the cattle have been herded back into the enclosure,{{clarify|date=May 2014}} and signs such as bitten ears, tails, and other wounds are discovered.\n\nThe opinions of cattle owners regarding dingoes are more variable than those of sheep owners. Some cattle owners believe that the weakened mother losing her calf is better in times of drought so that she does not have to care for her calf, too. Therefore, these owners are more hesitant to kill dingoes.<ref name=\"Ian\"/> The cattle industry may benefit from the predation of dingoes on rabbits, kangaroos, and rats. Furthermore, the mortality rate of calves has many possible causes, and  discriminating between them is difficult. The only reliable method to document the damage would be to document all pregnant cows, then observe their development and those of their calves.<ref name=\"Nord\"/> The loss of calves in observed areas where dingoes were controlled was higher than in other areas. Loss of livestock is, therefore, not necessarily caused by the occurrence of dingoes and is independent from wild dogs.<ref name=\"ReviewCanid\">{{cite journal|author1=Allen, L.R.  |author2=Fleming, P.J.S. |title=Review of Canid Management in Australia for the Protection of Livestock and Wildlife \u2013 Potential Application to Coyote Management|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/icwdmsheepgoat/2/|journal=Sheep & Goat Research Journal |volume=19 |year=2004|page=97}}</ref> One researcher has stated that for cattle stations where dingoes were controlled, kangaroos were abundant, and this affects the availability of grass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/northern-territory/dingo-expert-says-its-better-for-the-environment-to-let-them-live-even-if-they-eat-one-or-two-cows-here-and-there/story-fnn3gfdo-1227377786816|title=Dingo expert says it's better for the environment to let them live|access-date=9 August 2015|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\nDomestic dogs are the only terrestrial predators in Australia that are big enough to kill fully grown sheep, and only a few sheep manage to recover from the severe injuries. In the case of lambs, death can have many causes apart from attacks by predators, which are blamed for the deaths because they eat from the carcasses. Although attacks by red foxes are possible, such attacks are more rare than previously thought.<ref name=\"ReviewCanid\"/> The fact that the sheep and goat industry is much more susceptible to damage caused by wild dogs than the cattle industry is mostly due to two factors - the flight behaviour of the sheep and their tendency to flock together in the face of danger, and the hunting methods of wild dogs, along with their efficient way of handling goat and sheep.\n\nTherefore, the damage to the livestock industry does not correlate to the numbers of wild dogs in an area (except that no damage occurs where no wild dogs occur<ref name=\"ReviewCanid\"/>).\n\nAccording to a report from the government of Queensland, wild dogs cost the state about $30 million annually due to livestock losses, the spread of diseases, and control measures. Losses for the livestock industry alone were estimated to be as high as $18 million.<ref name=\"Nord\"/> In [[Barcaldine, Queensland]], up to one-fifth of all sheep are killed by dingoes annually, a situation which has been described as an \"epidemic\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Dingo 'epidemic' on farm |first=Aden |last=Miles |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/sheep/8769476/Dingo-epidemic-on-farms |newspaper=Stuff |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref> According to a survey among cattle owners in 1995, performed by the Park and Wildlife Service, owners estimated their annual losses due to wild dogs (depending on the district) to be from 1.6% to 7.1%.<ref name=\"nt\">{{cite web|title=Animals \u2013 Dingo Wild Dog (canis lupus familiaris, canis lupus dingo and hybrids)|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/native/dingo.html?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309125809/http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/wildlife/animals/native/dingo.html|archivedate=9 March 2009|publisher=Northern Territory Government|accessdate=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, a study in northern South Australia indicates that fetal/calf loss average 18.6%, with no significant reduction due to dingo baiting. The calf losses did not correlate with increased dingo activity, and the cattle diseases pestivirus and leptospirosis were a major cause. Dingoes then scavenged on the carcasses. There was also evidence of dingo predation on calves.<ref name=campbell2018/>\n\nAmong the indigenous Australians, dingoes were also used as hunting aids, living [[hot water bottle]]s, and camp dogs. Their scalps were used as a kind of [[currency]], their teeth were traditionally used for decorative purposes, and their fur for traditional costumes.\n\nSometimes \"pure\" dingoes are important for [[tourism]], when they are used to attract visitors. However, this seems to be common only on Fraser Island, where the dingoes are extensively used as a symbol to enhance the attraction of the island. Tourists are drawn to the experience of personally interacting with dingoes. Pictures of dingoes appear on brochures, many websites, and postcards advertising the island.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Lawrance, Kate|author2=Higginbottom, Karen|title=Behavioural Responses of Dingoes to Tourist on Fraser Island|url=http://www.crctourism.com.au/WMS/Upload/Resources/bookshop/WT27_Lawrance-DingoFraserIs.pdf|publisher=Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre|year=2002|accessdate=3 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916042757/http://www.crctourism.com.au/WMS/Upload/Resources/bookshop/WT27_Lawrance-DingoFraserIs.pdf|archive-date=16 September 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Legal status==\nThe dingo is recognised as a [[Native species|native animal]] under the laws of all Australian jurisdictions. Australia has over 500 national parks of which all but six are managed by the [[States and territories of Australia|states and territories]].<ref name=austgov2017/> {{as of|2017}}, the legal status of the dingo varies between these jurisdictions and in some instances it varies between different regions of a single jurisdiction.\n* [[Australian government]]: The ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' under section 528 defines a native species as one that was present in Australia before the year 1400. The dingo is protected in all Australian government managed national parks and reserves, [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Areas]], and other protected areas.\n* [[Australian Capital Territory]]: The dingo is listed as a \"pest animal\" in the ''Pest Plants and Animals (Pest Animals) Declaration 2016 (No 1)'' made under the ''Pest Plants and Animals Act 2005'', which calls for a management plan for pest animals. The ''Nature Conservation Act 2014'' protects native animals in national parks and reserves but excludes this protection to \"pest animals\" declared under the ''Pest Plants and Animals Act 2005''.\n* [[New South Wales]]: The dingo falls under the definition of \"wildlife\" under the ''National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974'' however it also becomes \"unprotected fauna\" under Schedule 11 of the act. The ''Wild Dog Destruction Act (1921)'' applies only to the [[Western Division (New South Wales)|western division]] of the state and includes the dingo in its definition of \"wild dogs\". The act requires landowners to destroy any wild dogs on their property and any person owning a dingo or half-bred dingo without a permit faces a fine. In other parts of the state, dingoes can be kept as pets under the ''Companion Animals Act 1998'' as a dingo is defined under this act as a \"dog\". The dingo has been proposed for listing under the ''Threatened Species Conservation Act'' because it is argued that these dogs had established populations before the arrival of Europeans, however no decision has been made.\n* [[Northern Territory]]: The dingo is a \"vertebrate that is indigenous to Australia\" and therefore \"protected wildlife\" under the ''Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2014''. A permit is required for all matters dealing with protected wildlife.\n* [[Queensland]]: The dingo is listed as \"least concern wildlife\" in the ''Nature Conservation (Wildlife) Regulation 2006'' under the ''[[Nature Conservation Act 1992]]'', therefore the dingo is protected in National Parks and conservation areas. The dingo is listed as a \"pest\" in the ''Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Regulation 2003'' under the ''Land Protection (Pest and Stock Route Management) Act 2002'', which requires land owners to take reasonable steps to keep their lands free of pests.\n* [[South Australia]]: The ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' defines a protected animal as one that is indigenous to Australia but then lists the dingo as an \"unprotected species\" under Schedule 11. The purpose of the ''Dog Fence Act 1946'' is to prevent wild dogs entering into the pastoral and agricultural areas south of the dog-proof fence. The dingo is listed as a \"wild dog\" under this act, and landowners are required to maintain the fence and destroy any wild dog within the vicinity of the fence by shooting, trapping or baiting. The dingo is listed as an \"unprotected species\" in the ''Natural Resources Management Act 2004'', which allows landowners to lay baits \"to control animals\" on their land just north of the dog fence.\n* [[Tasmania]]: Tasmania does not have a native dingo population. The dingo is listed as a \"restricted animal\" in the ''Nature Conservation Act 2002'' and cannot be imported without a permit. Once imported into Tasmania, a dingo is listed as a dog under the ''Dog Control Act 2000''. \n* [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]: The dingo is a \"vertebrate taxon\" that is \"indigenous\" to Australia and therefore \"wildlife\" under the ''Wildlife Act 1975'', which protects wildlife. The act mandates that a permit is required to keep a dingo, and that this dingo must not be cross-bred with a dog. The act allows an order to be made to unprotect dingoes in certain areas of the state. The ''Order in Council made on the 28 September 2010'' includes the far north-west of the state and all of the state north-east of Melbourne. It was made to protect stock on private land. The order allows dingoes to be trapped, shot or baited by any person on private land in these regions, while protecting the dingo on state-owned land.\n* [[Western Australia]]: Dingoes are considered as \"unprotected\" native fauna under the ''[[Wildlife Conservation Act 1950|Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act]]''. The dingo is recorded as a \"declared pest\" on the ''Western Australian Organism List''. This list records those species that have been declared as pests under the ''Biosecurity and Agriculture Management Act 2007'', and these are regarded as pests across all of Western Australia. Landowners must take the prescribed measures to deal with declared pests on their land. The policy of the WA government is to promote eradication of dingoes in the livestock grazing areas but leave them undisturbed in the rest of the state.<ref name=wagov2017/>\n\n==Control measures==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}\nDingo attacks on livestock led to widescale efforts to repel them from areas with intensive agricultural usage, and all states and territories have enacted laws for the control of dingoes.<ref name=\"impact\"/> In the early 20th century, fences were erected to keep dingoes away from areas frequented by sheep, and a tendency to routinely eradicate dingoes developed among some livestock owners. Established methods for the control of dingoes in sheep areas entailed the employment of specific workers on every property. The job of these people (who were nicknamed \"doggers\") was to reduce the number of dingoes by using [[Animal trapping|steel traps]], [[Bait (luring substance)|baits]], firearms and other methods. The responsibility for the control of wild dogs lay solely in the hands of the landowners. At the same time, the government was forced to control the number of dingoes. As a result, a number of measures for the control of dingoes developed over time. It was also considered that dingoes travel over long distances to reach areas with richer prey populations, and the control methods were often concentrated along \"paths\" or \"trails\" and in areas that were far away from sheep areas. All dingoes were regarded as a potential danger and were hunted.\n\nApart from the introduction of the poison [[Sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] (extensively used for 40 years and nicknamed \"doggone\"), the methods and strategies for controlling wild dogs have changed little over time. Information concerning cultural importance to indigenous people and the importance of dingoes and the impact of control measures on other species is also lacking in some areas. Historically, the attitudes and needs of indigenous people were not taken into account when dingoes were controlled. Other factors that might be taken into account are the genetic status (degree of interbreeding) of dingoes in these areas, ownership and land usage, as well as a reduction of killing measures to areas outside of the zones. However, most control measures and the appropriate studies are there to minimise the loss of livestock and not to protect dingoes.\n\nIncreasing pressure from environmentalists against the random killing of dingoes, as well as the impact on other animals, demanded that more information needed to be gathered to prove the necessity of control measures and to disprove the claim of unnecessary killings. Today, permanent population control is regarded as necessary to reduce the impact of all wild dogs and to ensure the survival of the \"pure\" dingo in the wild.<ref name=\"Nord\"/>\n\n===Guardian animals===\nTo protect livestock, [[livestock guardian dog]]s (for example, [[Maremma Sheepdog|Maremmas]]), [[donkey]]s, [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s are used.<ref name=\"wilddogs/dingo\">{{cite web|title=Wild dogs/dingo Canis familiaris/Canis familiaris (dingo) |url=http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Biosecurity_EnvironmentalPests/IPA-Wild-Dog-Strategy.pdf |publisher=Queensland Government |date=September 2002 |accessdate=13 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531220438/http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/documents/Biosecurity_EnvironmentalPests/IPA-Wild-Dog-Strategy.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pest of the past, dingo's star in the ascendancy|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/pest-of-the-past-dingoes-star-in-the-ascendancy/2007/07/21/1184560109155.html|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=16 May 2009| location=Melbourne| work=The Age}}</ref>\n\n===Dingo Fence===\n[[File:Dogfence.jpg|thumb|right|A part of the [[dingo fence]]]]\nIn the 1920s, the [[Dingo Fence]] was erected on the basis of the ''Wild Dog Act (1921)'' and, until 1931, thousands of miles of Dingo Fences had been erected in several areas of South Australia. In the year 1946, these efforts were directed to a single goal, and the Dingo Fence was finally completed. The fence connected with other fences in New South Wales and Queensland. The main responsibilities in maintaining the Dingo Fence still lies with the landowners, whose properties border on the fence and receive financial support from the government.\n\n===Reward system===\nA [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] system (local, as well from the government) was active from 1846 to the end of the 20th century, but there is no evidence that \u2013 despite the billions of dollars spent \u2013 it was ever an efficient control method.

Aerial baiting can nearly eliminate whole dingo populations.<ref name=\"western\"/> Livestock guardian dogs can effectively minimise livestock losses, but are less effective on wide open areas with widely distributed livestock. Furthermore, they can be a danger to the livestock or be killed by control measures themselves when they are not sufficiently supervised by their owners.<ref name=\"beefy12\"/> Fences are reliable in keeping wild dogs from entering certain areas, but they are expensive to build, need permanent maintenance, and only cause the problem to be relocated.\n\nControl measures mostly result in smaller packs and a disruption of pack structure. The measures seem{{which|date=October 2014}} to be rather detrimental to the livestock industry because the empty territories are taken over by young dogs and the predation then increases. Nonetheless, it is regarded as unlikely that the control measures could completely eradicate the dingo in Central Australia, and the elimination of all wild dogs is not considered a realistic option.\n\nIt has been shown that culling a small percentage of immature dingoes on Fraser Island have little significant negative impact on the overall island population, though this is being disputed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://theconversation.com/culling-is-no-danger-to-the-future-of-dingoes-on-fraser-island-24073|title= Culling is no danger to the future of dingoes on Fraser Island|last1= Benjamin|first1= Allen|date= April 13, 2015|website= theconversation.com|access-date= April 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation of purebreds==\nUntil 2004, the dingo was categorised as of \"least concern\" on the [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]].

Dingoes receive varying levels of protection in conservation areas such as national parks and natural reserves in New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Victoria, [[Arnhem Land]] and other Aboriginal lands, [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]], and the whole of the Australian Capital Territory. In some states, dingoes are regarded as declared pests and landowners are allowed to control the local populations. Throughout Australia, all other wild dogs are considered pests.\n\n[[File:Canis lupus dingo 2.jpg|thumb|right|Dingo with a tagged ear on [[Fraser Island]]]]\n\nFraser Island is a 1,840 square kilometre [[World Heritage Site]] located off Australia's eastern coast.

Presently, the efforts of the dingo conservation groups are considered to be ineffective because most of their dogs are untested or are known to be hybrids.<ref name=\"canid\"/>\n\nDingo conservation efforts focus primarily on preventing interbreeding between dingoes and other domestic dogs in order to conserve the population of pure dingoes. This is extremely difficult and costly. Conservation efforts are hampered by the fact that it is not known how many pure dingoes still exist in Australia. Steps to conserve the pure dingo can only be effective when the identification of dingoes and other domestic dogs is absolutely reliable, especially in the case of living specimens. Additionally, conservation efforts are in conflict with control measures.\n\nConservation of pure and survivable dingo populations is promising in remote areas, where contact with humans and other domestic dogs is rare. Under New South Wales state policy in parks, reserves and other areas not used by agriculture, these populations are only to be controlled when they pose a threat to the survival of other native species. The introduction of \"dog-free\" buffer zones around areas with pure dingoes is regarded as a realistic method to stop interbreeding. This is enforced in the way that all wild dogs can be killed outside of the conservation areas. However, studies from the year 2007 indicate that even an intensive control of core areas is probably not able to stop the process of interbreeding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Predation and Hybridisation by Feral Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) \u2013 proposed key threatening process listing|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/feraldogspd.htm|publisher=New South Wales Government|date=29 August 2008|accessdate=13 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Dingo Discovery Sanctuary and Research Centre, many studies are finding a case for the re-introduction of the dingo into previously occupied areas in order to return some balance to badly degraded areas as a result of \"unregulated and ignorant farming practices\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dingofoundation.org/|title=Dingo Discovery Research Centre|last=Centre|first=Dingo Discovery Research|website=www.dingofoundation.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}</ref>\n\nDingo densities have been measured at up to 0.3 per square kilometre (0.8/sq&nbsp;mi) in both the [[Guy Fawkes River]] region of New South Wales and in [[South Australia]] at the height of a [[Rabbit plagues in Australia|rabbit plague]].<ref name=\"impact\"/>\n\n===Hybridisation===\n{{Main|Dingo\u2013dog hybrid}}\n[[File:Dingo and hybrid distribution.jpg|thumb|Broad distribution map of dingoes and [[dingo-dog hybrid]]s showing percent purity.<ref name=corbett1995C10/>]]\n[[File:Dingo or maybe crossbreed.jpg|thumb|right|Although dingo-like, this wild dog has an atypical colouration and is therefore most likely a dingo-crossbreed.]]\n\nEuropean domestic dogs first arrived in Australia during the European colonisation.

The first, and likely most common, position states that the \"pure\" dingo should be preserved via strong controls of the wild dog populations, and only \"pure\" or \"nearly-pure\" dingoes should be protected.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Draft Dingo Management Strategy for Fraser Island|url=http://www.fido.org.au/DingoManagement.html|publisher=Fraser Island Defenders Organization|accessdate=14 May 2009}}</ref> The second position is relatively new and is of the opinion that people must accept that the dingo has changed and that it is impossible to bring the \"pure\" dingo back.

It is also unclear what kind of role these hybrids would play in the Australian ecosystems. However, it is unlikely that the dynamics of the various ecosystems will be excessively disturbed by this process.<ref name=\"impact\"/>\n\nIn 2011, a total of 3,941 samples were included in the first continent-wide DNA study of wild dogs. The study found that 46% were pure dingoes which exhibited no dog [[alleles]] (gene expressions). There was evidence of hybridisation in every region sampled. In Central Australia only 13% were hybrids, however in southeastern Australia 99% were hybrids or feral dogs. Pure dingo distribution was 88% in the Northern Territory, intermediate numbers in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland, and 1% in New South Wales and Victoria. Almost all wild dogs showed some dingo ancestry,<ref name=stephens2011/><ref name=parr2016/> with only 3% of dogs showing less than 80% dingo ancestry. This indicates that domestic dogs have a low survival rate in the wild or that most hybridisation is the result of roaming dogs that return to their owners. No populations of feral dogs have been found in Australia.<ref name=stephens2011/>\n\nIn 2016, a three dimensional [[Morphometrics#Landmark-based geometric morphometrics|geometric morphometric analysis]] of the skulls of dingoes, dogs and their hybrids found that dingo-dog hybrids exhibit morphology closer to the dingo than to the parent group dog. Hybridisation did not push the unique ''Canis dingo'' cranial morphology towards the wolf phenotype, therefore hybrids cannot be distinguished from dingoes based on cranial measures. The study suggests that the wild dingo morphology is dominant when compared with the recessive dog breed morphology, and concludes that although hybridisation introduces dog DNA into the dingo population, the native cranial morphology remains resistant to change.<ref name=parr2016/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[New Guinea singing dog]]\n*[[Indian Pariah Dog]]\n*[[Free-ranging dog]]\n*[[Carolina Dog]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=AFD2017>{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/Canis_familiaris|title=Species Canis familiaris Linnaeus, 1758 - Common Dog, Dingo, Domestic Dog|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=15 December 2017|website=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Australian Government: Dept of Environment & Energy|access-date=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=allan2012>{{cite journal|doi=10.1071/AM12012|title=Do desert dingoes drink daily?

{"title_page": "Beacon", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Beacon (disambiguation)}}\nA '''beacon''' is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a [[Geodetic datum|specific location]]. A common example is the [[lighthouse]], which provides a fixed location that can be used to navigate around obstacles or into port. More modern examples include a variety of [[radio beacon]]s that can be read on [[radio direction finder]]s in all weather, and [[Transponder|radar transponder]]s that appear on [[radar]] displays.\n\nBeacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important [[information]], such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its [[aerodrome beacon|airport beacon]], or of pending weather as indicated on a [[weather beacon]] mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of [[Telegraph#Optical telegraph|optical telegraphy]].\n\n== For navigation ==\n[[File:Beacon at Orontes Bank.jpg|right|thumb|A navigational beacon denoting the presence of Orontes Bank off [[Port Vincent, South Australia]].]]\n\nBeacons help guide [[navigation|navigators]] to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include [[radar]] reflectors, [[radio beacons]], sonic and visual signals.
