Poulenc preferred composing for woodwinds above strings. He premiered the piece with the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. The work was an immediate success, and was quickly taken up in the US, Britain and elsewhere and has been recorded many times. Critics have noted Poulenc's characteristic \"trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment\" in the piece. In 1976, thirteen years after Poulenc's death, the composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] made a well-regarded orchestrated version of the work that has also been recorded.\n\nThe flute sonata became one of Poulenc's best known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire. It has a claim to be the most played of any work for flute and piano.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015). Notes to Nimbus CD NI 5933</ref> In April 1956, when he was still working on the opera, he was approached by [[Harold Spivacke]] of the American [[Library of Congress]] with a request to write a piece for two pianos or alternatively a chamber piece for up to six instruments.<ref>Schmidt (2001), p. 408</ref> Poulenc was too busy to accept, but Spivacke persisted. Poulenc told him, \"Much more at home with wind instruments than strings, I admit I am tempted by this combination\", as he had always preferred winds \u2013 with their similarities to the human voice \u2013 to stringed instruments.{{refn|Poulenc wrote: \"nothing could be further from human breath than the stroke of a bow\". He thought little of his own sonatas for cello and for violin.<ref>Mellers, pp. 160\u2013161</ref>|group=n}} In August he agreed to go ahead.<ref name=ib>Battioni, Isabelle (2000). Notes to Naxos CD 8.553611</ref> The sonata was commissioned in memory of a musical benefactor, [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], to whom Poulenc dedicated the work.<ref name=nimbus/> \n\nPoulenc spent the winter of 1956\u201357 in [[Cannes]], where he composed the sonata between December and March.<ref name=mm> MacDonald, Malcolm (2013). Notes to Opus Arte CD OACD9012D</ref> When he had completed the first two of the three movements, he wrote to his friend [[Pierre Bernac]]:\n{{blockindent|In working on this Flute Sonata I have the feeling of going back a long way, but with a more settled technique. It's a sonata of [[Claude Debussy|Debussyan]] dimensions. It's the French sense of balance [''la mesure fran\u00e7aise'']. Finding the form for your language is the most difficult thing. It's what [[Anton Webern|Webern]] has in the highest degree \u2026 and what [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]] has not yet found.<ref>Nichols, p. 251</ref>|}}\n\nOn 18 June 1957, the public premiere was given at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]] by the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]], for whom it had been written, with the composer at the piano.<ref name=hype>Mawer, Deborah (2001). Notes to Hyperion CD CDH55386</ref>{{refn|Rampal and Poulenc had given gave the work a private performance the previous day to an audience of one: the pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]], who could not be present at the official premiere.<ref name=mm/>|group=n}} ''[[Le Figaro]]'' said of the work, \"The music burst forth from the heart, without formality, and 'sang', in every sense\". Another critic stated that the sonata was \"the best of Poulenc, and even a little better\".<ref name=js>Siegel, Joseph (2000).

In its song-like tune Poulenc acknowledged there were echoes of Sister Constance in ''Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites'' but the effect here is purely lyrical \u2013 an \"infinite melody\" (''m\u00e9lodie infinie'') \u2013 with none of the drama of the opera.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 45</ref> The movement begins with two [[quarter note|quavers]] on the piano, which are echoed by the flute during the course of the next two bars.<ref>Poulenc, p. 10</ref> The smooth [[Scale (music)|scalic]] lines of the opening section are succeeded by contrasting vigorous dotted rhythmic material in the middle section with the flute going up up a top B, before the tranquil opening theme returns to bring the movement to a close.<ref name=hype/>\n\nAsked about the term \"cantilena\", Poulenc replied that it \"is not a fixed form like passacaglia for example, it is a free form \u2026 I could have called it an interlude (\"interm\u00e8de\") or a romance\".<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 46</ref>\n\n===''Presto giocoso''===\nThis movement (\u2669=160\u2013168) is predominantly extrovert and fast; the beat is a strongly marked {{music|time|3|4}}.

In Mellers's phrase, \"The flute flickers, the piano bounces, in a helter skelter gallop\".<ref>Mellers, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The fast music culminates in a long trill on high G, followed by a brief silence from which there comes, unexpectedly, a quotation from the dotted rhythm \"''m\u00e9lancolique''\" theme of the first movement's middle section, in its original key of F sharp minor.<ref name=m165>Mellers, p. 165</ref> The music gathers speed again and the sonata sprints to a double fortissimo finish, \"strictement en mesure sans ralentir\" (\"strictly in time without any slowing down\").<ref>Poulenc, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe finale is sometimes compared to the exuberant finales of Poulenc's early chamber works, particularly the [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|Trio]] (1926), but the Poulenc scholar Claude Car\u00e9 finds more in common between this movement and the ''[[Concert champ\u00eatre]]'' (1927\u201328).<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 48\u201349</ref> The composer is reported to have said that the movement should be played as quickly as possible because \"it isn't any good\" (he probably would have liked more time to work on it)<ref name=nimbus/> but others have found it \"masterly\"<ref name=m165/> and \"a perfect conclusion\".<ref name=nimbus/>\n\n==Later concert performances and recordings==\nPoulenc considered giving the American premiere together with Rampal during a planned US tour, but the tour did not take place and Rampal gave the American premiere in February 1958 with his regular accompanist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]].<ref>Schmidt (2002), p. 464</ref> Poulenc was pleased to accompany other flautists in the sonata.

Poulenc preferred composing for woodwinds above strings. He premiered the piece with the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. The work was an immediate success, and was quickly taken up in the US, Britain and elsewhere and has been recorded many times. Critics have noted Poulenc's characteristic \" trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment\" in the piece. In 1976, thirteen years after Poulenc's death, the composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] made a well-regarded orchestrated version of the work that has also been recorded.\n\nThe flute sonata became one of Poulenc's best known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire. It has a claim to be the most played of any work for flute and piano.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015). Notes to Nimbus CD NI 5933</ref> In April 1956, when he was still working on the opera, he was approached by [[Harold Spivacke]] of the American [[Library of Congress]] with a request to write a piece for two pianos or alternatively a chamber piece for up to six instruments.<ref>Schmidt (2001), p. 408</ref> Poulenc was too busy to accept, but Spivacke persisted. Poulenc told him, \"Much more at home with wind instruments than strings, I admit I am tempted by this combination\", as he had always preferred winds \u2013 with their similarities to the human voice \u2013 to stringed instruments.{{refn|Poulenc wrote: \"nothing could be further from human breath than the stroke of a bow\".

It is the state of equilibrium in which demands of personal life, professional life, and family life are equal. Work\u2013life balance consists of, but it is not limited to, flexible work arrangements that allow employees to carry out other life programs and practices. The term 'work\u2013life balance' is recent in origin, as it was first used in UK and US in the late 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Work\u2013life balance is a term commonly used to describe the balance that a working individual needs between time allocated for work and other aspects of life. Areas of life other than work\u2013life can include personal interests, family and social or leisure activities. Technological advances have made it possible for work tasks to be accomplished faster due to the use of smartphones, email, video-chat, and other technological software. These technology advances facilitate individuals to work without having a typical '9 to 5' work day.\n\nThe United States' current lack of paid parental leave negates work-life balance for many American citizens. New parents fear that asking for paid time off to bond with their new families will lead to negative consequences professionally. If an employee seeks paid leave of absence for significant amounts of time, they could receive less training, lose out on promotions or may not become a candidate for hiring altogether (Ruhm, C., 2011). Support of paid parental leave by the US government, according to Heymann et al. (2017), reducing the chances of negative mental health outcomes, such as postpartum depression and indicate a \u201clong term attachment to the labor force\u201d (p.&nbsp;5).\n\nThose not currently in the predicament of deciding what level of absence they will require from employment responsibilities may feel singled out and expected to assume additional/unfair workloads, thereby attributing to unsatisfactory work-life balance (Richardson, D., et al., 2019).  In theory, this outcome could lead to interpersonal conflicts between personnel in the latter term when the new parent resumes work.  Not to mention, as pointed out by Adema et al. (2016), this could lead employers to intentionally or unintentionally discriminate against hiring women of child rearing age with motherhood being the determining factor.\n\nStudies from the London Hazards Centre indicate that work today is more intense than it was a decade ago creating the need for a balance between work and life. Experiencing being over-worked, long working hours, and an extreme work environment has proven to affect the overall physical and psychological health of employees and deteriorate family-life. Britain's government recognized this reality and started making an effort to balance the work and home life of its employees by providing alternatives such as being able to use portable electronic equipment to do their jobs from a virtual office, or to work from their actual homes.\n\nAccording to 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] data, 16% of U.S. workers reported difficulty balancing work and family. The findings were more prevalent among workers between 30\u201344 years old.\n\n18% of workers with a bachelor's degree and higher education have difficulties balancing work and life outside of work; compared with workers with a high school diploma or G.E.D., which is 16%. Workers without a high school education (15%). The results of workers in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting are (9%) had a lower work\u2013family imbalance ratio compared to adult employees in other industries (16%). Among other occupations, a higher prevalence rate of work\u2013family imbalance was found in legal occupations (26%), whereas a lower prevalence rate was observed for workers in office and administrative support (14%).\n\n== Identity through work ==\nBy working in an organization, employees identify, to some extent, with the organization, as part of a collective group.<ref name=\"Van Knippenberg 2006\">Van Knippenberg, Daan. \"Organizational Identification versus Organizational Commitment: Self-definition, Social Exchange, and Job Attitudes.\" Journal of Organizational Behavior 27.5 (2006): 571.</ref>  [[Organization]]al [[Value (ethics)|values]], [[Norm (social)|norms]] and interests become incorporated in the self-concept as [[Employment|employees]] increase their [[Organizational identification|identification]] with the organization.

In other words, identity is \"fragmented and constructed\" through a number of interactions within and outside of the organization; employees do not have just one self.\n\nMost employees identify not only with the organization, but also other facets of their life ([[family]], [[child]]ren, [[religion]], etc.).  Sometimes these identities align and sometimes they do not.  When identities are in conflict, the sense of a healthy work\u2013life balance<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myfitnesschat.com/maintaining-a-healthy-work-life-balance/|title=Tips to Maintain Healthy Work-life balance|last=|first=|date=7 Nov 2019|website=MyFitnessChat|access-date=}}</ref> may be affected.

This being said, long hours could be interpreted positively or negatively depending on the individuals. Working long hours affect the family duties, but on the other side, there are financial benefits that accompany this action which negate the effect on family duties.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFamily characteristics include single employers, married or cohabiting employers, parent employers, and dual-earning parents. Parents who are employed experience reduced family satisfaction due to their family duties or requirements.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is due to the fact that they are unable to successfully complete these family duties. In addition, parent workers value family-oriented activities; thus, working long hours reduces their ability to fulfill this identity, and, in return, reduces family satisfaction. As for the married and/ or dual-earning couples, it seems that \"not only require more time and effort at home but also are a resource for individuals to draw from, both instrumentally through higher income and emotionally through increased empathy and support.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn addition to these moderators that could lead to an imbalance, many people expose themselves to unsolicited job stress, because they enjoy high social recognition. This aspect can also be the cause of an imbalance in the areas of life.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\">Gerbert, Frank (2010): Wenn Arbeit krank macht \u2013 Burn-out- das Leiden einer modernen Gesellschaft.

Some companies have taken proactive measures in providing programs and initiatives to help their employees cope with work\u2013life balance.\n\nThe conflict of work and family can be exacerbated by perceived deviation from the \"ideal worker\" archetype, leading to those with caretaker roles to be perceived as not as dedicated to the organization.

About 64% of mothers whose youngest child was under age six, as well as 77% of mothers with a youngest child age 6\u201317\u2014were employed in 2010, this indicates that the majority of women with dependent-care responsibilities cannot, or do not, wish to give up careers. While women are increasingly represented in the workforce, they still face challenges balancing work and home life. Both domestic and market labor compete for time and energy. \"For women, the results show that only time spent in female housework chores has a significant negative effect on wages\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Noonan|first=Mary|date=2001-11-01|title=The Impact of Domestic Work on Men's and Women's Wages|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227535858|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=63|issue=4|pages=1134\u20131145|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2001.01134.x|hdl=2027.42/72357}}</ref>\n\nMany men do not see work alone as providing their lives with full satisfaction, and they often want a balance between paid work and personal attachments, without being penalized at work.<ref name=\"Natalie Jolly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nataliejolly.com|title=Natalie Jolly|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref><ref name=\"Gerson, Kathleen 2011, p. 402\">Gerson, Kathleen.

A new study on fatherhood (2010) shows that more men are looking for alternatives to their 40-hour workweek in order to spend more time with their family. Though working less means a smaller paycheck and higher stress levels, men are looking for flexibility just as much as women. However, with an ever-changing society, flexibility is becoming much more apparent. \"It seems that some traditional stereotypes are starting to lessen just a bit in terms of who's responsible for care of the children,\" says human resource specialist Steve Moore.

It can also result in poor [[coping skills]], irritability, jumpiness, insecurity, exhaustion, and difficulty concentrating. Stress may also perpetuate or lead to [[binge eating]], [[smoking]], and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption.\n\nThe feeling that simply working hard is not enough anymore is acknowledged by many other American workers. \"To get ahead, a seventy-hour work week is the new standard.

For example, appearance, occupation, education of the children are compared to a media-staged ideal. This idea of perfection is due to this deep-rooted aversion to all things average; the pathological pursuit to excellence.<ref name=\"Reich p. 44-54\" /> Whoever wants more from the job\u2014from the partner, from the children, and from themselves\u2014could one day burn out. The individual is then faced with the realization that perfection does not exist.<ref>Poelchau, Nina 2010: Interview: wer lassen kann, wird gelassen. In: Stern no. 11, p. 56</ref> To date, burnout is not a recognized illness. It has been noticed that a burnout affects those passionate people who seek perfection. This condition is not considered a mental illness but only a grave exhaustion that can lead to numerous sick days.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\" /> It can benefit the term that it is a disease model which is socially acceptable and also, to some extent, the individual self-esteem stabilizing. According to experts in the field, the individuals who detain the following characteristics are more prone to burnouts: the hard-working, the [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]], the [[loner]], the grim and the thin-skinned. All together, they usually have a lack of a healthy distance to work, leading to work\u2013life imbalance.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\" />\n\nAnother example related to burnout is decision-makers in government offices and upper echelons. They are not allowed to show weaknesses or signs of [[disease]], because this would immediately lead to doubts of their ability for further responsibilities. Only 20% of managers (e.g. in [[Germany]]) do sports regularly, and only 2% regularly attend preventive medical check-ups.<ref>Boersch et al. (2008): Das Summa Summarum der Gesundheit \u2013 20 wichtige Aspekte zu Gesundheit und Wohlbefinden f\u00fcr Manager und F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte. 1. ed. Frankfurt: [[Betriebswirtschaftlicher Verlag Dr. Th. Gabler]]</ref> In such a position other priorities seem to be set and the time is lacking for regular sports. The highest priority seems linked to the job, and it leads individuals to waive screening as a sign of weakness. Nonetheless, the burnout syndrome seems to be gaining popularity. Nothing seems shameful about showing weaknesses, but quite the opposite, the burnout is part of a successful career like a home for the role model family.<ref>Meckel, Miriam (2010): Brief an mein Leben \u2013 Erfahrungen mit einem Burnout. 1. ed. Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowolt Verlag</ref> In other terms, attributing the highest priority and allotted time to work leads to a higher chance for success, but also interrupts the balance between work and life. Since the description of burnout could be  \"socially recognized precious version of the depression and despair that lets also at the moment of failure the self-image intact\", it concludes that \"only losers become depressed, burnout against it is a diagnosis for winners, more precisely, for former winners.\".<ref>Beck, Sebastian 2009: Die M\u00fcdigkeit der Rastlosen. In: S\u00fcd-deutsche Zeitung of  03/15/2009</ref>\n\nAlthough burnout is linked to a more positive view, four out of five Germans complain about high stress levels. In fact, one in every sixth individual under the age of 60 consumes medication against insomnia, depression or to boost energy levels, at least once a week.<ref name=\"Reich p. 44-54\" /> The phases of burnout can be described first by great ambition, then the suppression of failure, isolation, and, finally, the cynical attitude towards the employer or supervisor. Often, those individuals seem to have anxiety disorders and depression as well, which are serious mental diseases. [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is the predominant cause of nearly 10,000 suicides that occur each year in Germany.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\" /> The consequences of high stress levels could lead to depression, which in turns affects the balance between work and life. For example, in Germany, early [[retirement]] due to mental illness represented 15.4 percent of all cases in 1993. In 2008, the percentage increased to 35.6 percent. The proportion of failures due to mental disorders seems to be increasing. In 2008, statisticians calculated 41&nbsp;million absent days that were related to these crises, leading to 3.9&nbsp;billion euros in lost production costs.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\" />\n\n== Role of technology ==\nAccording to Bowswell and Olson-Buchanan the recent changes in the work place are due to changes in technology. Greater technological advancements such as portable cellphones, portable computers, e-mail and cell phone have made it possible for employees to work beyond the confinement of their physical office space. This allows employees to answer e-mails and work on deadlines after-hours while not officially \"on the job\".\n\nHaving these technological resources at all times and everywhere increases the likelihood of employees to spend their \"free time\" or outside of work, family time doing work related tasks. Employees that consider their work roles highly important are more likely to apply all these technological advancements to work while outside of their work domain.\n\nSome theorists suggest that this vague boundary of work and life is a result of technological control. Technological control unfolds from the physical technology provided by an organization\". Companies use email and distribute smartphones to enable and encourage their employees to stay connected to the business even when they are not in the office. This type of control, as Barker argues, replaces the more direct, authoritarian control, or simple control, such as managers and bosses. As a result, communication technologies in the temporal and structural aspects of work have changed, defining a \"new workplace\" in which employees are more connected to the jobs beyond the boundaries of the traditional workday and workplace. The more this boundary is blurred, the higher work-to-life conflict is self-reported by employees. In a review of recent literature looking at the theory of technological control suggests employers and employees often communicate and continue to work during \"off hours\" or even periods of vacation. This added use of technology creates a confusion as to what the purpose of the technology poses for the individual using it. Questions such as \"what is work usage media compared to non-work usage media look like\" or \"are we working more because it is easier and more accessible or because we want to work more?\"\n\nEmployee assistance professionals say there are many causes for this situation ranging from personal ambition and the pressure of family obligations to the accelerating pace of technology. According to a recent study for the Center for Work-Life Policy, 1.7&nbsp;million people in the United States consider their jobs and their work hours excessive because of globalization.\n\n=== Working from home ===\nTechnology has also provided the opportunity to work from home rather than from the company's physical office. Working from home is an initiative that arose from the efforts of improving the work\u2013life balance. One of the ways in which the UK government believes the desired work-life balance can be achieved is by working from home. The idea of working from home started in the UK and the number of people working from home is only increasing. By 2000 it was reported that a quarter of Britain's workforce worked from home at least part-time. Working from home can be defined as any paid work that is done primarily from home. Working from home is also known as Telecommuting.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that 8&nbsp;million people in the US are working from home, that is 5% of the entire US work force. This increase has been in response to the demand for more flexibility work environments. A 2017 report by a polling company named Gallup found that allowing their employees to work from home decreases employee turnover and increases employee productivity. Trend suggests the type of workers leading the work from home wave are professionals in industries such as finance, designers, computer scientists, and other high-skill professionals.\n\n== Improving work\u2013life balance ==\n===Responsibility of the employer===\nTexas Quick, an expert witness at trials of companies who were accused of overworking their employees, states that \"when people get worked beyond their capacity, companies pay the price.\"<ref name=\"cqpress2\" /> Although some employers believe that workers should reduce their own stress by [[simple living|simplifying their lives]] and making a better effort to care for their health, most experts feel that the chief responsibility for reducing stress should be management.\n\nAccording to Esther M. Orioli, president of Essi Systems, a stress management consulting firm, \"Traditional stress-management programs placed the responsibility of reducing stress on the individual rather than on the organization where it belongs. No matter how healthy individual employees are when they start out, if they work in a dysfunctional system, they'll burn out.\"<ref name=\"cqpress2\" />\n\nWork\u2013life balance has been addressed by some employers and has been seen as a benefit to them. Indeed, employees report increased job satisfaction, greater sense of job security, better physical and mental health, reduced levels of job stress and enhanced control of their environment. In fact, work\u2013life balance does not only benefit the employee, but also the organization. Once work\u2013life balance has been introduced to the employee, the organization faces less absenteeism, lateness and staff turnover rates. In addition, there is an increase retention of valuable employees, higher employee loyalty and commitment towards the organization, improved productivity and enhanced organizational image.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the literature, \"work\u2013family policies, family-friendly or family-responsive policies\" are practices intended for work and life balances. In fact, \"the primary way companies can help facilitate work\u2013life balance for their employees is through work\u2013life practices, that are usually associated with flexible working and reductions in working time or family-friendly policies\".<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Hartel et al., a variety of policies could be implemented to help manage work life balance just as \"flexible working hour, job sharing, part-time work, compressed work weeks, parental leave, telecommuting, on-site child care facility\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nStudies from Canadian adjunct professor and psychology researcher Yani Likongo demonstrated that sometimes in organizations an idiosyncratic psychological contract is built between the employee and his direct supervisor in order to create an \"informal deal\" regarding work\u2013life balance. These \"deals\" support the idea of a constructivist approach including both the employer and the employee, based on a give-and-take situation for both of them.<ref>https://politique.uqam.ca/upload/files/POL4801-30-A15-Likongo.pdf</ref>\n\nAs of March 2011, paid leave benefits continued to be the most widely available benefit offered by employers in the United States, with paid vacations available to 91 percent of full-time workers in private industry. Access to these benefits, however, varied by employee and establishment characteristics. According to the data from the National Compensation Survey (NCS), paid vacation benefits were available to 37 percent of part-time workers in private industry. These benefits were available to 90 percent of workers earning wages in the highest 10th percent of employees and only to 38 percent of workers in the lowest 10 percent of private industry wage earners. Paid sick leave was available to 75 percent of full-time workers and 27 percent of part-time workers. Access to paid sick leave benefits ranged from 21 percent for the lowest wage category to 87 percent for the highest wage category. These data provide comprehensive measures of compensation cost trends and incidence and provisions of employee benefit plans.<ref>http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ebs2.pdf</ref>\n\n\"It is generally only highly skilled workers that can enjoy such benefits as written in their contracts, although many professional fields would not go so far as to discourage workaholic behaviour. Unskilled workers will almost always have to rely on bare minimum legal requirements. The legal requirements are low in many countries, in particular, the United States. In contrast, the European Union has gone quite far in assuring a legal work\u2013life balance framework, for example pertaining to [[parental leave]] and the non-discrimination of part-time workers.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Managing Human Resources in Global Era - Prospects & Challenges|last=Aluvala|first=Ravi|year=2014|isbn=9788192681931|pages=153\u2013154}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Stewart Friedman]]\u2014professor of management and founding director of the Wharton School's Leadership Program and of its Work/Life Integration Project\u2014a \"one size fits all\" mentality in human resources management often perpetuates frustration among employees. \"[It's not an] uncommon problem in many HR areas where, for the sake of equality, there's a standard policy that is implemented in a way that's universally applicable\u2014[even though] everyone's life is different and everyone needs different things in terms of how to integrate the different pieces. It's got to be customized.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1970 |title=Four-way Win: How to Integrate Work, Home, Community and Self - Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref>\n\nFriedman's research indicates that the solution lies in approaching the components of work, home, community, and self as a comprehensive system. Instead of taking a zero-sum approach, Friedman's Total Leadership program teaches professionals how to successfully pursue \"four-way wins\"\u2014improved performance across all parts of life.\n\nAlthough employers are offering many opportunities to help their employees balance work and life, these opportunities may be a catch twenty-two for some female employees. Even if the organization offers part-time options, many women will not take advantage of it as this type of arrangement is often seen as \"occupational dead end\".<ref name=\"Williams, J. 2000\">Williams, J. (2000). ''Unbending gender: Why family and work conflict and what to do about it''. New York, NY: Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nEven with the more flexible schedule, working mothers opt not to work part-time because these positions typically receive less interesting and challenging assignments; taking these assignments and working part-time may hinder advancement and growth. Even when the option to work part-time is available, some may not take advantage of it because they do not want to be marginalized.<ref name=\"Williams, J. 2000\" /> This feeling of marginalization could be a result of not fitting into the \"ideal worker\" framework (see: Formation of the \"ideal worker\" and gender differences).\n\nAdditionally, some mothers, after returning to work, experience what is called the maternal wall. The maternal wall is experienced in the less desirable assignments given to the returning mothers. It is also a sense that because these women are mothers, they cannot perform as \"ideal workers\".<ref name=\"Williams, J. 2000\" /> If an organization is providing means for working mothers and fathers to better balance their work\u2013life commitments, the general organizational norm needs to shift so the \"ideal worker\" includes those who must manage a home, children, elderly parents, etc.\n\n=== Corporate social responsibility ===\nWork\u2013life balance practices are institutionalized arrangements that make it easier for employees to manage the often discordant worlds of work and personal life. These practices are part of a company's social responsibility with its stakeholders.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Asian Journal of Management Research Online Open Access publishing platform for Management Research|journal=Asian Journal of Management Research|issn=2229-3795}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=April 2019}} These practices can be summarized in three major categories: policies, benefits and services.<ref name=\":6\">''Work\u2010Life Balance \u2013 a Social Responsibility'', J.

In the current{{When|date=November 2019}} business world work\u2013life balance is not only a common term but it ranks as one of the most important workplace aspects second only to compensation.<ref name=\":6\" /> According to research conducted by more than 50,000 corporate executive board members, employees who have a better work\u2013life balance tend to work harder than those that don't.

Some of the world's best performing organizations understand that creating a work-life balance is a key factor for great business performance outcomes. Work\u2013life balance is a strategic initiative for engaged employees that produce business growth.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Maternity leave===\n[[Maternity leave]] and [[parental leave]] are leaves of absence for expectant or new mothers (sometimes fathers) for the birth and care of the baby. These policies vary significantly by country (regarding factors such as the length of the leave and what amount of money is paid). They may help create a work\u2013life balance for families. For example, in Canada there is the Quebec Parental Insurance Program which is responsible for providing maternity, paternity, parental and adoption benefits to citizens of Quebec. According to the government of Canada website, El maternity benefits are offered for a maximum of 15 weeks. Both the biological and surrogate mothers are eligible to get these benefits. Those involved can receive these benefits as early as 12 weeks before the expected due date. In addition, there is also the possibility to be paid 17 weeks after the date of birth. These benefits can be received either by the standard or extended option. The standard parental benefits differ from the extended parental benefits in the percentage of the individual's average weekly earnings and the number of weeks the individuals are being paid. Indeed, the extended parental benefit's rate is 33% of the individuals' average weekly earnings (for a maximum of 61 weeks) compared to 55% (for a maximum of 35 weeks) for the standard parental benefits. There is also the possibility for both parents to apply to the El parental benefits. Men are just as likely as women obtain these benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental.html|title=EI Maternity and Parental Benefits - Overview - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|website=www.canada.ca|access-date=2018-03-21|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in the United States, most states do not offer any paid time off for the birth of a child.

[[New Jersey]] lawmakers are working on legislation that would make their state the second state to add this employee benefit. Under one New Jersey proposal, workers who take leave would be paid through the state's temporary disability insurance fund, \"augmented by a 0.1 percent charge on workers' weekly wages.\"<ref name=msn/> Traditionally, many conservatives have opposed paid family leave, but there is a sign that this mindset is beginning to change. Reverend Paul Schenck, a prominent member of the National [[Pro-Life]] Action Center recently stated that he would support paid maternity leave on the assumption that it might encourage women to follow through with their pregnancies instead of having [[abortions]]. According to Heyman, \"Across the political spectrum, people are realizing these policies have an enormous impact on working families.

St. Josemaria Escriva stated that 'heroism at work is to be found in finishing each task'. He also stated that 'no occupation is in itself great or small. Everything gains the value of the Love with which it is done'.  He stated again that 'It is in the simplicity of your ordinary work, in the monotonous details of each day, that you have to find the secret, which is hidden from so many, of something great and new: Love'. When we love fulfilling our work and other duties, then there is a work-life balance, and stress is reduced; while we are at the same time serving others happily.\n \nAn employee's religious beliefs are often associated with their ethical beliefs, and an important role in self-identity<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> and religion-based societies in Saudi Arabia or Israel organize religious accommodations with special provisions in government legislation and organizational policies.

Jody Heyman, founder of the Harvard-based Project on Global Working Families and director of McGill's Institute for Health and Social Policy, states that, \"More countries are providing the workplace protections that millions of Americans can only dream of.

However, the U.S. Labor Department is examining regulations that give workers unpaid leave to deal with family or medical emergencies (a review that supporters of the FMLA worry might be a prelude to scaling back these protections, as requested by some business groups). Senator [[Chris Dodd]] from [[Connecticut]] proposed [[legislation]] that would enable workers to take six weeks of paid leave.

It is the state of equilibrium in which demands of personal life, professional life, and family life are equal. Work\u2013life balance consists of, but it is not limited to, flexible work arrangements that allow employees to carry out other life programs and practices. The term 'work\u2013life balance' is recent in origin, as it was first used in UK and US in the late 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Work\u2013life balance is a term commonly used to describe the balance that a working individual needs between time allocated for work and other aspects of life. Areas of life other than work\u2013life can include personal interests, family and social or leisure activities. Technological advances have made it possible for work tasks to be accomplished faster due to the use of smartphones, email, video-chat, and other technological software. These technology advances facilitate individuals to work without having a typical '9 to 5' work day.\n\nThe United States current lack of paid parental leave negates work-life balance for many American citizens. New parents fear that asking for paid time off to bond with their new families will lead to negative consequences professionally. If an employee seeks paid leave of absence for significant amounts of time, they could receive less training, lose out on promotions or may not become a candidate for hiring altogether (Ruhm, C., 2011). Support of paid parental leave by the US government, according to Heymann et al. (2017), reducing the chances of negative mental health outcomes, such as postpartum depression and indicate a \u201clong term attachment to the labor force\u201d (p.&nbsp;5).\n\nThose not currently in the predicament of deciding what level of absence they will require from employment responsibilities may feel singled out and expected to assume additional/unfair workloads, thereby attributing to unsatisfactory work-life balance (Richardson, D., et al., 2019).  In theory, this outcome could lead to interpersonal conflicts between personnel in the latter term when the new parent resumes work.  Not to mention, as pointed out by Adema et al. (2016), this could lead employers to intentionally or unintentionally discriminate against hiring women of child rearing age with motherhood being the determining factor.\n\nStudies from the London Hazards Centre indicate that work today is more intense than it was a decade ago creating the need for a balance between work and life. Experiencing being over-worked, long working hours, and an extreme work environment has proven to affect the overall physical and psychological health of employees and deteriorate family-life. Britain's government recognized this reality and started making an effort to balance the work and home life of its employees by providing alternatives such as being able to use portable electronic equipment to do their jobs from a virtual office, or to work from their actual homes.\n\nAccording to 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] data, 16% of U.S. workers reported difficulty balancing work and family. The findings were more prevalent among workers between 30\u201344 years old.\n\n18% of workers with a bachelor's degree and higher education have difficulties balancing work and life outside of work; compared with workers with a high school diploma or G.E.D., which is 16%. Workers without a high school education (15%). The results of workers in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting are (9%) had a lower work\u2013family imbalance ratio compared to adult employees in other industries (16%). Among other occupations, a higher prevalence rate of work\u2013family imbalance was found in legal occupations (26%), whereas a lower prevalence rate was observed for workers in office and administrative support (14%).\n\n== Identity through work ==\nBy working in an organization, employees identify, to some extent, with the organization, as part of a collective group.<ref name=\"Van Knippenberg 2006\">Van Knippenberg, Daan. \"Organizational Identification versus Organizational Commitment: Self-definition, Social Exchange, and Job Attitudes.\" Journal of Organizational Behavior 27.5 (2006): 571.</ref>  [[Organization]]al [[Value (ethics)|values]], [[Norm (social)|norms]] and interests become incorporated in the self-concept as [[Employment|employees]] increase their [[Organizational identification|identification]] with the organization.

In other words, identity is \"fragmented and constructed\" through a number of interactions within and outside of the organization; employees do not have just one self.\n\nMost employees identify not only with the organization, but also other facets of their life ([[family]], [[child]]ren, [[religion]], etc.).  Sometimes these identities align and sometimes they do not.  When identities are in conflict, the sense of a healthy work\u2013life balance<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.myfitnesschat.com/maintaining-a-healthy-work-life-balance/|title=Tips to Maintain Healthy Work-life balance|last=|first=|date=7 Nov 2019|website=MyFitnessChat|access-date=}}</ref> may be affected.

This being said, long hours could be interpreted positively or negatively depending on the individuals. Working long hours affect the family duties, but on the other side, there are financial benefits that accompany this action which negate the effect on family duties.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFamily characteristics include single employers, married or cohabiting employers, parent employers, and dual-earning parents. Parents who are employed experience reduced family satisfaction due to their family duties or requirements.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is due to the fact that they are unable to successfully complete these family duties. In addition, parent workers value family-oriented activities; thus, working long hours reduces their ability to fulfill this identity, and, in return, reduces family satisfaction. As for the married and/ or dual-earning couples, it seems that \"not only require more time and effort at home but also are a resource for individuals to draw from, both instrumentally through higher income and emotionally through increased empathy and support.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn addition to these moderators that could lead to an imbalance, many people expose themselves to unsolicited job stress, because they enjoy high social recognition. This aspect can also be the cause of an imbalance in the areas of life.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\">Gerbert, Frank (2010): Wenn Arbeit krank macht \u2013 Burn-out- das Leiden einer modernen Gesellschaft.

Generally speaking, men have more interests in financial gain which requires working longer hours.

About 64% of mothers whose youngest child was under age six, as well as 77% of mothers with a youngest child age 6\u201317\u2014were employed in 2010, this indicates that the majority of women with dependent-care responsibilities cannot, or do not, wish to give up careers. While women are increasingly represented in the workforce, they still face challenges balancing work and home life. Both domestic and market labor compete for time and energy. \"For women, the results show that only time spent in female housework chores has a significant negative effect on wages\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Noonan|first=Mary|date=2001-11-01|title=The Impact of Domestic Work on Men's and Women's Wages|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227535858|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=63|issue=4|pages=1134\u20131145|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2001.01134.x|hdl=2027.42/72357}}</ref>\n\nMany men do not see work alone as providing their lives with full satisfaction, and they often want a balance between paid work and personal attachments, without being penalized at work.<ref name=\"Natalie Jolly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nataliejolly.com|title=Natalie Jolly|accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref><ref name=\"Gerson, Kathleen 2011, p. 402\">Gerson, Kathleen.

A new study on fatherhood (2010) shows that more men are looking for alternatives to their 40-hour workweek in order to spend more time with their family. Though working less means a smaller paycheck and higher stress levels, men are looking for flexibility just as much as women. However, with an ever-changing society, flexibility is becoming much more apparent. \"It seems that some traditional stereotypes are starting to lessen just a bit in terms of who's responsible for care of the children,\" says human resource specialist Steve Moore.

Symptoms of stress are manifested both physiologically and psychologically. Persistent stress can result in [[cardiovascular disease]], [[sexual health]] problems, a weaker [[immune system]] and frequent headaches, stiff muscles, or backache. It can also result in poor [[coping skills]], irritability, jumpiness, insecurity, exhaustion, and difficulty concentrating. Stress may also perpetuate or lead to [[binge eating]], [[smoking]], and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption.\n\nThe feeling that simply working hard is not enough anymore is acknowledged by many other American workers. \"To get ahead, a seventy-hour work week is the new standard. What little time is left is often divided up among relationships, kids, and sleep.\" This increase in work hours over the past two decades means that less time will be spent with family, friends, and community as well as pursuing activities that one enjoys and taking the time to grow personally and spiritually.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Innovate Happily|last=Shetty|first=Rekha|publisher=Portfolio|year=2012|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the [[National Insurance Company|National Life Insurance Company]], four out of ten U.S. employees state that their jobs are \"very\" or \"extremely\" stressful.<ref name=\"cqpress2\" /> Those in high-stress jobs are three times more likely than others to suffer from stress-related medical conditions and are twice as likely to quit. The study states that women, in particular, report stress related to the conflict between work and family.\n\nIn the study, ''Work\u2013Family Spillover and Daily Reports of Work and Family Stress in the Adult Labor Force'', researchers found that with an increased amount of negative spillover from work to family, the likelihood of reporting stress within the family increased by 74%, and with an increased amount of negative spillover from family to work the likelihood to report stress felt at work increased by 47%.<ref>Grzywacs, Joseph G., Almeida, David M., and Daniel A. McDonald. 2002. \"Work\u2013Family Spillover and Daily Reports of Work and Family Stress in the Adult Labor Force\"''Family Relations''. 51: 28-36</ref>\nShepherd-Banigan, Basu, Booth & Harris (2016) conduct research on how stress can cause extremely negative effects on new parents. Between trying to balance a new schedule, managing additional responsibilities, and lacking flexibility and support, they can only ''increase'' stress, potentially causing depression to the employee.\n\nPsychoanalysts diagnose uncertainty as the dominant attitude to life in the postmodern society.<ref name=\"Reich p. 44-54\">Reich, Franziska 2010: Raus aus der Perfektions-Falle. In: Stern no. 11, p. 44-54</ref> The pressure that society exerts on individuals can cause them to have an uncertain attitude. It is the uncertainty to fail, but also the fear of their own limits, not to achieve what the society expects, and especially the desire for recognition in all areas of life.<ref name=\"Reich p. 44-54\" /> In today's society, competition manifests itself in various settings. For example, appearance, occupation, education of the children are compared to a media-staged ideal. This idea of perfection is due to this deep-rooted aversion to all things average; the pathological pursuit to excellence.<ref name=\"Reich p. 44-54\" /> Whoever wants more from the job\u2014from the partner, from the children, and from themselves\u2014could one day burn out. The individual is then faced with the realization that perfection does not exist.<ref>Poelchau, Nina 2010: Interview: wer lassen kann, wird gelassen. In: Stern no. 11, p. 56</ref> To date, burnout is not a recognized illness. It has been noticed that a burnout affects those passionate people who seek perfection. This condition is not considered a mental illness but only a grave exhaustion that can lead to numerous sick days.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\" /> It can benefit the term that it is a disease model which is socially acceptable and also, to some extent, the individual self-esteem stabilizing. According to experts in the field, the individuals who detain the following characteristics are more prone to burnouts: the hard-working, the [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionist]], the [[loner]], the grim and the thin-skinned. All together, they usually have a lack of a healthy distance to work, leading to work\u2013life imbalance.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\" />\n\nAnother example related to burnout is decision-makers in government offices and upper echelons. They are not allowed to show weaknesses or signs of [[disease]], because this would immediately lead to doubts of their ability for further responsibilities. Only 20% of managers (e.g. in [[Germany]]) do sports regularly, and only 2% regularly attend preventive medical check-ups.<ref>Boersch et al. (2008): Das Summa Summarum der Gesundheit \u2013 20 wichtige Aspekte zu Gesundheit und Wohlbefinden f\u00fcr Manager und F\u00fchrungskr\u00e4fte. 1. ed. Frankfurt: [[Betriebswirtschaftlicher Verlag Dr. Th. Gabler]]</ref> In such a position other priorities seem to be set and the time is lacking for regular sports. The highest priority seems linked to the job, and it leads individuals to waive screening as a sign of weakness. Nonetheless, the burnout syndrome seems to be gaining popularity. Nothing seems shameful about showing weaknesses, but quite the opposite, the burnout is part of a successful career like a home for the role model family.<ref>Meckel, Miriam (2010): Brief an mein Leben \u2013 Erfahrungen mit einem Burnout. 1. ed. Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowolt Verlag</ref> In other terms, attributing the highest priority and allotted time to work leads to a higher chance for success, but also interrupts the balance between work and life. Since the description of burnout could be  \"socially recognized precious version of the depression and despair that lets also at the moment of failure the self-image intact\", it concludes that \"only losers become depressed, burnout against it is a diagnosis for winners, more precisely, for former winners.\".<ref>Beck, Sebastian 2009: Die M\u00fcdigkeit der Rastlosen. In: S\u00fcd-deutsche Zeitung of  03/15/2009</ref>\n\nAlthough burnout is linked to a more positive view, four out of five Germans complain about high stress levels. In fact, one in every sixth individual under the age of 60 consumes medication against insomnia, depression or to boost energy levels, at least once a week.<ref name=\"Reich p. 44-54\" /> The phases of burnout can be described first by great ambition, then the suppression of failure, isolation, and, finally, the cynical attitude towards the employer or supervisor. Often, those individuals seem to have anxiety disorders and depression as well, which are serious mental diseases. [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]] is the predominant cause of nearly 10,000 suicides that occur each year in Germany.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\" /> The consequences of high stress levels could lead to depression, which in turns affects the balance between work and life. For example, in Germany, early [[retirement]] due to mental illness represented 15.4 percent of all cases in 1993. In 2008, the percentage increased to 35.6 percent. The proportion of failures due to mental disorders seems to be increasing. In 2008, statisticians calculated 41 million absent days that were related to these crises, leading to 3.9 billion euros in lost production costs.<ref name=\"Gerbert, Frank 2010 p. 92-103\" />\n\n== Role of technology ==\nAccording to Bowswell and Olson-Buchanan the recent changes in the work place are due to changes in technology. Greater technological advancements such as portable cellphones, portable computers, e-mail and cell phone have made it possible for employees to work beyond the confinement of their physical office space. This allows employees to answer e-mails and work on deadlines after-hours while not officially \"on the job\".\n\nHaving these technological resources at all times and everywhere increases the likelihood of employees to spend their \"free time\" or outside of work, family time doing work related tasks. Employees that consider their work roles highly important are more likely to apply all these technological advancements to work while outside of their work domain.\n\nSome theorists suggest that this vague boundary of work and life is a result of technological control. Technological control unfolds from the physical technology provided by an organization\". Companies use email and distribute smartphones to enable and encourage their employees to stay connected to the business even when they are not in the office. This type of control, as Barker argues, replaces the more direct, authoritarian control, or simple control, such as managers and bosses. As a result, communication technologies in the temporal and structural aspects of work have changed, defining a \"new workplace\" in which employees are more connected to the jobs beyond the boundaries of the traditional workday and workplace. The more this boundary is blurred, the higher work-to-life conflict is self-reported by employees. In a review of recent literature looking at the theory of technological control suggests employers and employees often communicate and continue to work during \"off hours\" or even periods of vacation. This added use of technology creates a confusion as to what the purpose of the technology poses for the individual using it. Questions such as \"what is work usage media compared to non-work usage media look like\" or \"are we working more because it is easier and more accessible or because we want to work more?\"\n\nEmployee assistance professionals say there are many causes for this situation ranging from personal ambition and the pressure of family obligations to the accelerating pace of technology. According to a recent study for the Center for Work-Life Policy, 1.7 million people in the United States consider their jobs and their work hours excessive because of globalization.\n\n=== Working from home ===\nTechnology has also provided the opportunity to work from home rather than from the company's physical office. Working from home is an initiative that arose from the efforts of improving the work\u2013life balance. One of the ways in which the UK government believes the desired work-life balance can be achieved is by working from home. The idea of working from home started in the UK and the number of people working from home is only increasing. By 2000 it was reported that a quarter of Britain's workforce worked from home at least part-time. Working from home can be defined as any paid work that is done primarily from home. Working from home is also known as Telecommuting.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that 8 million people in the US are working from home, that is 5% of the entire US work force. This increase has been in response to the demand for more flexibility work environments. A 2017 report by a polling company named Gallup found that allowing their employees to work from home decreases employee turnover and increases employee productivity. Trend suggests the type of workers leading the work from home wave are professionals in industries such as finance, designers, computer scientists, and other high-skill professionals.\n\n== Improving work\u2013life balance ==\n===Responsibility of the employer===\nTexas Quick, an expert witness at trials of companies who were accused of overworking their employees, states that \"when people get worked beyond their capacity, companies pay the price.\"<ref name=\"cqpress2\" /> Although some employers believe that workers should reduce their own stress by [[simple living|simplifying their lives]] and making a better effort to care for their health, most experts feel that the chief responsibility for reducing stress should be management.\n\nAccording to Esther M. Orioli, president of Essi Systems, a stress management consulting firm, \"Traditional stress-management programs placed the responsibility of reducing stress on the individual rather than on the organization where it belongs. No matter how healthy individual employees are when they start out, if they work in a dysfunctional system, they'll burn out.\"<ref name=\"cqpress2\" />\n\nWork\u2013life balance has been addressed by some employers and has been seen as a benefit to them. Indeed, employees report increased job satisfaction, greater sense of job security, better physical and mental health, reduced levels of job stress and enhanced control of their environment. In fact, work\u2013life balance does not only benefit the employee, but also the organization. Once work\u2013life balance has been introduced to the employee, the organization faces less absenteeism, lateness and staff turnover rates. In addition, there is an increase retention of valuable employees, higher employee loyalty and commitment towards the organization, improved productivity and enhanced organizational image.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the literature, \"work\u2013family policies, family-friendly or family-responsive policies\" are practices intended for work and life balances. In fact, \"the primary way companies can help facilitate work\u2013life balance for their employees is through work\u2013life practices, that are usually associated with flexible working and reductions in working time or family-friendly policies\".<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Hartel et al., a variety of policies could be implemented to help manage work life balance just as \"flexible working hour, job sharing, part-time work, compressed work weeks, parental leave, telecommuting, on-site child care facility\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nStudies from Canadian adjunct professor and psychology researcher Yani Likongo demonstrated that sometimes in organizations an idiosyncratic psychological contract is built between the employee and his direct supervisor in order to create an \"informal deal\" regarding work\u2013life balance. These \"deals\" support the idea of a constructivist approach including both the employer and the employee, based on a give-and-take situation for both of them.<ref>https://politique.uqam.ca/upload/files/POL4801-30-A15-Likongo.pdf</ref>\n\nAs of March 2011, paid leave benefits continued to be the most widely available benefit offered by employers in the United States, with paid vacations available to 91 percent of full-time workers in private industry. Access to these benefits, however, varied by employee and establishment characteristics. According to the data from the National Compensation Survey (NCS), paid vacation benefits were available to 37 percent of part-time workers in private industry. These benefits were available to 90 percent of workers earning wages in the highest 10th percent of employees and only to 38 percent of workers in the lowest 10 percent of private industry wage earners. Paid sick leave was available to 75 percent of full-time workers and 27 percent of part-time workers. Access to paid sick leave benefits ranged from 21 percent for the lowest wage category to 87 percent for the highest wage category. These data provide comprehensive measures of compensation cost trends and incidence and provisions of employee benefit plans.<ref>http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ebs2.pdf</ref>\n\n\"It is generally only highly skilled workers that can enjoy such benefits as written in their contracts, although many professional fields would not go so far as to discourage workaholic behaviour. Unskilled workers will almost always have to rely on bare minimum legal requirements. The legal requirements are low in many countries, in particular, the United States. In contrast, the European Union has gone quite far in assuring a legal work\u2013life balance framework, for example pertaining to [[parental leave]] and the non-discrimination of part-time workers.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Managing Human Resources in Global Era - Prospects & Challenges|last=Aluvala|first=Ravi|year=2014|isbn=9788192681931|pages=153\u2013154}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Stewart Friedman]]\u2014professor of management and founding director of the Wharton School's Leadership Program and of its Work/Life Integration Project\u2014a \"one size fits all\" mentality in human resources management often perpetuates frustration among employees. \"[It's not an] uncommon problem in many HR areas where, for the sake of equality, there's a standard policy that is implemented in a way that's universally applicable\u2014[even though] everyone's life is different and everyone needs different things in terms of how to integrate the different pieces. It's got to be customized.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1970 |title=Four-way Win: How to Integrate Work, Home, Community and Self - Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref>\n\nFriedman's research indicates that the solution lies in approaching the components of work, home, community, and self as a comprehensive system. Instead of taking a zero-sum approach, Friedman's Total Leadership program teaches professionals how to successfully pursue \"four-way wins\"\u2014improved performance across all parts of life.\n\nAlthough employers are offering many opportunities to help their employees balance work and life, these opportunities may be a catch twenty-two for some female employees. Even if the organization offers part-time options, many women will not take advantage of it as this type of arrangement is often seen as \"occupational dead end\".<ref name=\"Williams, J. 2000\">Williams, J. (2000). ''Unbending gender: Why family and work conflict and what to do about it''. New York, NY: Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nEven with the more flexible schedule, working mothers opt not to work part-time because these positions typically receive less interesting and challenging assignments; taking these assignments and working part-time may hinder advancement and growth. Even when the option to work part-time is available, some may not take advantage of it because they do not want to be marginalized.<ref name=\"Williams, J. 2000\" /> This feeling of marginalization could be a result of not fitting into the \"ideal worker\" framework (see: Formation of the \"ideal worker\" and gender differences).\n\nAdditionally, some mothers, after returning to work, experience what is called the maternal wall. The maternal wall is experienced in the less desirable assignments given to the returning mothers. It is also a sense that because these women are mothers, they cannot perform as \"ideal workers\".<ref name=\"Williams, J. 2000\" /> If an organization is providing means for working mothers and fathers to better balance their work\u2013life commitments, the general organizational norm needs to shift so the \"ideal worker\" includes those who must manage a home, children, elderly parents, etc.\n\n=== Corporate social responsibility ===\nWork\u2013life balance practices are institutionalized arrangements that make it easier for employees to manage the often discordant worlds of work and personal life. These practices are part of a company's social responsibility with its stakeholders.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Asian Journal of Management Research Online Open Access publishing platform for Management Research|journal=Asian Journal of Management Research|issn=2229-3795}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=April 2019}} These practices can be summarized in three major categories: policies, benefits and services.<ref name=\":6\">''Work\u2010Life Balance \u2013 a Social Responsibility'', J. Arpankumar</ref>\n\nThe term ''work\u2013life balance'' has been neglected by employers{{Opinion|date=November 2019}} since it has been the norm to put pressure on employees in the workplace. In the current{{When|date=November 2019}} business world work\u2013life balance is not only a common term but it ranks as one of the most important workplace aspects second only to compensation.<ref name=\":6\" /> According to research conducted by more than 50,000 corporate executive board members, employees who have a better work\u2013life balance tend to work harder than those that don't. These practices result in more productivity and employees reporting higher work satisfaction and company reviews.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe changing global social demands have changed the structure and nature of traditional work practices. Work is not just a matter of necessity or survival but of personal and professional development and family satisfaction.{{Opinion|date=November 2019}} All these factors must balance in order to achieve the best results for both the employer and the employee; this is a characteristic of organizational wisdom. This will engage people to the organization while allowing them to have a balanced life outside of the workplace. This has become an organizational responsibility due to the fact that the demand for flexibility is only increasing and the opposite of it brings dissatisfaction of one will impact the other two which is not beneficial for the organization.<ref name=\":6\" /> Executive leaders and human resources professionals are recognizing the importance of employee engagement or \"happiness at work\" as a driver of a company's success. Employees that consider the companies they work for invest in them are usually more invested in the success of the organization.{{Opinion|date=November 2019}}\n\nCompanies such as Starbucks, Google and Boston Consulting Group who have incorporated these practices as part of their organizations have been recognized in Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for. Some of the world's best performing organizations understand that creating a work-life balance is a key factor for great business performance outcomes. Work\u2013life balance is a strategic initiative for engaged employees that produce business growth.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Maternity leave===\n[[Maternity leave]] and [[parental leave]] are leaves of absence for expectant or new mothers (sometimes fathers) for the birth and care of the baby. These policies vary significantly by country (regarding factors such as the length of the leave and what amount of money is paid). They may help create a work\u2013life balance for families. For example, in Canada there is the Quebec Parental Insurance Program which is responsible for providing maternity, paternity, parental and adoption benefits to citizens of Quebec. According to the government of Canada website, El maternity benefits are offered for a maximum of 15 weeks. Both the biological and surrogate mothers are eligible to get these benefits. Those involved can receive these benefits as early as 12 weeks before the expected due date. In addition, there is also the possibility to be paid 17 weeks after the date of birth. These benefits can be received either by the standard or extended option. The standard parental benefits differ from the extended parental benefits in the percentage of the individual's average weekly earnings and the number of weeks the individuals are being paid. Indeed, the extended parental benefit's rate is 33% of the individuals' average weekly earnings (for a maximum of 61 weeks) compared to 55% (for a maximum of 35 weeks) for the standard parental benefits. There is also the possibility for both parents to apply to the El parental benefits. Men are just as likely as women obtain these benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-maternity-parental.html|title=EI Maternity and Parental Benefits - Overview - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Service|website=www.canada.ca|access-date=2018-03-21|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in the United States, most states do not offer any paid time off for the birth of a child. As of 2015, the US was one of only three countries in the world (the other two being [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Suriname]]) that does not have paid maternity leave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-industrialized-nation-paid-maternity-leave/story?id=30852419|title=US Is Still Only Industrialized Nation Without Paid Maternity Leave|author=ABC News|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome new mothers (and fathers) in the US will take unpaid time off, allowed by the Family and Medical Leave Act.

[[New Jersey]] lawmakers are working on legislation that would make their state the second state to add this employee benefit. Under one New Jersey proposal, workers who take leave would be paid through the state's temporary disability insurance fund, \"augmented by a 0.1 percent charge on workers' weekly wages.\"<ref name=msn/> Traditionally, many conservatives have opposed paid family leave, but there is a sign that this mindset is beginning to change. Reverend Paul Schenck, a prominent member of the National [[Pro-Life]] Action Center recently stated that he would support paid maternity leave on the assumption that it might encourage women to follow through with their pregnancies instead of having [[abortions]]. According to Heyman, \"Across the political spectrum, people are realizing these policies have an enormous impact on working families.

Sexual minorities are often overlooked in establishing these policies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Managing Diversity and Inclusion: An International Perspective (2015). Jawad Syed & Mustafa Ozbilgin\n.</ref> As a result, the needs of non-traditional families, which consist of couples or individuals with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) backgrounds, are not met. The sexual stigma and prejudice are present in managing diversity and inclusion on an international level, and an array of contextual and societal factors define the lack of attention given to sexual minority employees.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> As a result, these employees can be subjected to exclusion, neglect, and isolation, which have a negative effect on their work\u2013life balance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSeveral international studies reveal that LGBT-supportive corporate policies allow for an inclusive environment in the workplace. As a result, this entails benefits for the employees and overall company performance.<ref name=\"Ozbilgin Badgett 2013\">Ozbilgin Badgett, M. V., Durso, L. E., Mallory, C., & Kastanis, A. (2013).

Some organizations also allow their employees to make up time spent on religious activities out of contractual hours.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Religion and spirituality represent an essential issue in diversity management, as the question of accommodating religion at work often raises controversial debate.  St. Josemaria Escriva stated that 'heroism at work is to be found in finishing each task'. He also stated that 'no occupation is in itself great or small. Everything gains the value of the Love with which it is done'.  He stated again that 'It is in the simplicity of your ordinary work, in the monotonous details of each day, that you have to find the secret, which is hidden from so many, of something great and new: Love'. When we love fulfilling our work and other duties, then there is a work-life balance, and stress is reduced; while we are at the same time serving others happily.\n \nAn employee's religious beliefs are often associated with their ethical beliefs, and an important role in self-identity<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> and religion-based societies in Saudi Arabia or Israel organize religious accommodations with special provisions in government legislation and organizational policies.  Some organizations also allow their employees to make up time spent on religious activities out of contractual hours.<ref name=\"auto\">Smith, P. R. (2001). Accommodating Routine Parental Obligations in an Era of Work\u2013Family Conflict: Lessons from Religious Accommodations. Wis. L. Rev., 1443.</ref> As such, poor management of religious diversity may affect employees' performances if they feel forced to choose between aspects of their religious identity and their jobs. This may also lead to them dissociating themselves from the organization.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\nTherefore, religious diversity management is essential to ensuring a satisfying work\u2013life balance for employees. The American Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that 'companies have a duty to provide reasonable religious accommodation'.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Global comparisons==\n\n===United States===\n{{Further|Work\u2013life balance in the United States}}\n\nAccording to a new{{when|date=July 2019}} study by [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[McGill University]] researchers, the United States lags far behind nearly all wealthy countries when it comes to family-oriented workplace policies such as [[maternity leave]], paid sick days and support for [[breast feeding]]. Jody Heyman, founder of the Harvard-based Project on Global Working Families and director of McGill's Institute for Health and Social Policy, states that, \"More countries are providing the workplace protections that millions of Americans can only dream of. The United States has been a proud leader in adopting laws that provide for equal opportunity in the workplace, but our work/family protections are among the worst.\"<ref name=\"msnbc.msn.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16907584/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202173750/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16907584/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-02 |title=U.S. workplace not family-oriented - Business - Careers &#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref>\n\nThis observation is being shared by many Americans today and is considered by many experts to be indicative of the current climate. However, the U.S. Labor Department is examining regulations that give workers unpaid leave to deal with family or medical emergencies (a review that supporters of the FMLA worry might be a prelude to scaling back these protections, as requested by some business groups). Senator [[Chris Dodd]] from [[Connecticut]] proposed [[legislation]] that would enable workers to take six weeks of paid leave. Congress was also expected to reconsider the Healthy Families Act, a bill that would have required employers with at least fifteen employees to provide seven paid sick days per year.<ref name=\"msnbc.msn.com\"/>\n\nAt least 107 countries protect working women's right to breast-feed and, in at least seventy-three of them, women are paid. The United States does not have any federal legislation guaranteeing mothers the right to breast-feed their infants at work, but 24 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have laws related to breastfeeding in the workplace.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jennifer Saunders, Alise Garcia |url=http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=14389 |title=Breastfeeding State Laws |publisher=Ncsl.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref>\n\nAt least 134 countries have laws setting the maximum length of the work week; the U.S. does not have a maximum work week length and does not place any limits on the amount of [[overtime]] that an employee is required to work each week.

A 2003 survey by Management Recruiter International stated that fifty percent of executives surveyed didn't have plans to take a vacation. They decided to stay at work and use their vacation time to get caught up on their increased workloads.<ref name=\"ergoweb.com\"/> More recently, 2018 research from Project: Time Off indicates 52% of employees reported having unused vacation days at the end of 2017.

However, most employers will give the 10 days off of national holidays. This is one of the lowest paid holidays total in the world.

Various companies have taken initiatives to drastically improve the employees work satisfaction. Companies such as 3M have introduced free stress management coaches into the work place to aid employees with their busy schedules. Google, Facebook and Sales Force have put areas to be physically active in the workplace as well as providing free food and snacks for the workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/payscale-best-companies-with-happiest-employees-in-america-2016-4#4-google-10|title=13 of the happiest companies in America|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> These companies are some of the best in terms of benefits for sick and maternal leave.

As stated by Jeremy Reynolds, \"cultural norms may encourage work as an end in itself or as a means to acquiring other things, including consumer products.\" This might be why Americans are bound to work more than people in other countries.

It was fought a month after the [[Battle of the Dardanelles (1807)|Battle of the Dardanelles]].\n\nThe battle was triggered by [[Dmitry Senyavin]]'s retreat from the [[Dardanelles]], which he had been blockading since March, towards the Russian naval base at [[Tenedos]]. The Ottoman commander, Kapudan Pasha [[Seyit-Ali]], ventured with 9 ships of the line, 5 [[frigate]]s and 5 other vessels out of the strait into the [[Aegean Sea]]. Thereupon Senyavin returned to cut off his retreat and fell upon the Ottoman fleet halfway between [[Mount Athos]] and [[Lemnos]]. Trying to avoid a battle or distraction from Tenedos, the Turkish fleet went around him on the south side and rushed to the west. Senyavin, leaving the smaller ships to help the fortress, set out to find the enemy, and found him on 19 June in an unsettled situation at anchor between the island of Lemnos and Athos Mountain.\n\nFrom his previous experience, Senyavin had learned that the Ottomans fought bravely unless their flagship was sunk or taken captive. He therefore ordered [[Aleksey Greig]] and other captains of his ships of the line to concentrate their attack on the three Ottoman flagships, whilst other Russian vessels were to prevent Ottoman frigates from delivering help.\n\nThe Russians approached in two parallel lines of five ships of the line each, turning north to run alongside the Ottoman line. During the battle 3 Ottoman ships of the line and four frigates \u2013 around one third of the Sultan's fleet \u2013 were either sunk or forced aground. The rest retired to the safety of the Dardanelles. On the way they scuttled another ship of the line and a frigate near [[Thasos]] on 4 July and lost a frigate and a [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] near [[Samothrace]] on about 5 July.\n\nIn the morning of 20 June it was revealed that the whole Turkish fleet, running before the wind, was going north to the island of Thassos. A ship of the line and two frigates (the former captain of the ship helped Bey) were cut off their squadron by the Russians. On 21 June Senyavin dispatched rear-admiral Greig with three [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] in pursuit of the latter, but the Turks ran their ships ashore and burned them. At dawn of 22 June in the retreating Turkish squadron exploded another ship of the line and a frigate, and two damaged frigates sank off the island of Samothrace. Of the 20 Turkish ships in the Dardanelles, only 12 returned.\n[[Image:Athosbattle.jpg|thumb|300px|''Russian Fleet after the Battle of Athos'', by [[Aleksey Bogolyubov]] (1824\u201396).]]\n\nOn 23 June Senyavin decided not to pursue the enemy and return to help beleaguered Tenedos. However, due to the wind and calms he arrived there just on 25 June. Turkish troops surrendered, and, leaving all their guns and arms, were transported to the Anatolian coast.\n\nAs a result of the battle, the [[Ottoman Empire]] lost a combat-capable fleet for more than a decade and signed an armistice with Russia on 12 August.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Order of battle at the Battle of Athos]]\n* [[Dardanelles Operation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Bond, Brian. & Roy, Ian.

In the game, players created super-powered [[player character]]s that could team up with others to complete missions and fight criminals belonging to various gangs and organizations in the fictional Paragon City.\n\nTwenty-three free major updates for ''City of Heroes'' were released before its shutdown.

They have, however, objected to the distribution of ''City of Heroes'' content binaries themselves.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:coh-screenshot.jpg|thumb|A tanker (foreground) confronts one of the game's arch villains, the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Vahzilok, in ''City of Heroes''.]]\nAfter [[#Character creation|creating their character]] and selecting a name (the game would check if the name was already taken on the server), players could either begin play in an isolated [[tutorial]] zone, or skip the tutorial and begin in an open low-level zone. A character's level increased by earning experience points from defeating foes, completing Missions, and exploring Zones, then returning to an NPC known as a Trainer. Benefits for rising in level included more Health, more Powers to choose for the character, more slots to allocate Enhancements to Powers, and larger inventories for Inspirations (quick use items) and Salvage (crafting materials). If a player loses all of their Health, they could be revived through use of an item, by an ally's powers, or in one of the Hospitals on the map; reviving in a Hospital after a certain level incurred Experience Debt, which made gaining additional experience more difficult.\n\nThe setting of the game, Paragon City for Heroes, was divided into different Zones (essentially neighborhoods) by giant energy \"War Walls\", which were justified in the back story. Especially dangerous zones called \"Hazard\" or \"Trial\" zones, which teemed with larger groups of enemies, were marked in red on the in-game map and were much more dangerous than normal zones. The Villains' setting, the Rogue Isles, consisted of islands connected by a network of ferries and helicopters. A few zones were accessible to both heroes and villains; some were cooperative zones, while others were player versus player (PvP) zones. Praetoria, for characters created in the ''Going Rogue'' update, lacked War Walls, allowing more or less free movement between areas.\n\nPlayers initially moved around the zones by jogging or using a minor speed-increasing power such as \"Sprint\". As heroes grew in level and accumulated more powers, they could choose among four higher speed traveling powers: Teleportation, Super Speed, Super Jumping, and Flight.\n\nAs characters leveled-up, players could choose new powers from the character's primary and secondary power sets, as set during creation, or from shared power pools. The power pools contained the four travel powers and other generic, usually utilitarian, powers that fell under categories such as Fitness, Concealment, and Leadership. In addition, as characters leveled up, they gained access to new costume features, including the ability to change between up to five costumes and unlockable costume parts such as capes and auras (unlocked after missions).\n\n[[Quest (video gaming)|Quests]] in the game were known as missions, and were obtained through various channels, generally from various NPCs the player met in the game. Although missions could be completed alone, the player had the option to form Teams with other player characters to play off of each other's characters' strengths and abilities. The level of the characters used, size of the team, and a separate difficulty scale chosen by the player called Notoriety, all affected the difficulty of the mission. Missions could take the form of an [[Instance dungeon|instanced area]] where the player(s) must defeat a [[boss (video games)|boss]], save NPC characters held hostage (sometimes taking the form of [[escort mission]]s), or search the instance for a certain object or number of objects (such as clues or defusing bombs), while other Missions required that players defeat a certain number and type of [[Mob (video gaming)|mobs]], possibly in a defined area of the game. Some missions are part of [[story arc]]s that involve the player in a larger narrative that tells some of the back story of the setting. Task Forces (''City of Heroes''), Strike Forces (''City of Villains''), and Trials (both) were particular missions that could be completed multiple times, but only as part of a team, and had to be completed in entirety to earn particular rewards for completion, such as the ability to [[respec]] a character's chosen Powers and Enhancements.\n\nCooperative play also took the form of larger [[Clan (video gaming)|clans]] called Supergroups, reminiscent of comic book groups such as the [[Justice League]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], or the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Players part of Supergroups could team up together or convene in Bases (introduced with ''City of Villains''). Bases were used for social meeting or housing special items used in crafting Inventions, serving as a collective item vault, or to recover after losing all Health in the overworld. Supergroups in turn could form Coalitions with each other for increased collaborations. Coalitions were generally formed for the [[Raid (gaming)|raids]] featured in the game.\n\nAnother form of cooperative play was the Sidekick feature, which allowed for characters of disparate experience levels to participate in the game together. A Sidekick's experience level would be temporarily risen to be close to their partner's level, and their Health and strength would be scaled to their artificial level, while any experience or Influence they gained was scaled to their original level. A reverse feature known as Exemplar was added later, which artificially lowered the level of a higher level character (also removing access to powers unavailable at their new level), but they earn experience at their original level, which is useful in removing Debt, or gains Influence rather than Experience. For the release of ''City of Villains'', these features are Lackey and Malefactor. Issue 16 overhauled the system such that it was automatically scaled to the \"Anchor\", which was either the player on the team whose mission the team was set to perform or the team's leader.\n\nPlayers could also set \"leveling pacts\" which allowed two players to sync up the experience their characters gained, although this was disabled in a later update.\n\nOther game features included auction houses and crafting inventions to make characters more powerful or unlock further costume options. The Architect release gave players the ability to construct custom mission arcs, with customized enemies and layouts that could then be played by all other players. The ''Going Rogue'' expansion allowed players to switch their alignment using Tip Missions collected from defeated enemies.\n\n==Character creation==\n\nIn character creation, the player first selected a character's origin and archetype, then primary and secondary power sets. Next, the actual avatar with its costume was created. Then the player had a choice of customizing the colors of his/her powers. Lastly, the player chose a name and could optionally write a background story to add some flavor to the character, as well as creating an individual battle cry.\n\nThere were five origins a player could choose for his/her character that dictated what type of enhancements the character may use, affected which single short-ranged power they begin with (in addition to powers obtained from their primary and secondary power sets), and influenced the various enemy groups that the character went up against. These origins were as follows:\n*Natural: Powers obtained through training the body, weapons, or inherent abilities if the character is not human\n*Magic: Powers obtained through a magic item, magical spells, or a mystical being\n*Science: Powers obtained through some sort of scientific means, whether intentionally or accidentally\n*Mutation: Powers obtained through a change in genetics, manifesting at any point in their life\n*Technology: Powers obtained through highly advanced technology\nA special \"Incarnate\" origin was programmed for various NPCs in the game who obtained powers from the fictional Well of the Furies. The \"Incarnate System\", which added additional powers for the player to choose from after completing difficult missions.\n\nThere were five basic hero archetypes, which affected a character's power choices and team role throughout the game. Blasters were versatile damage dealers, capable of fighting at short or long range against one or many opponents, but had relatively little health. Controllers were adept at preventing enemies from moving or acting through inducing status effects, as well as possessing pet summons. Defenders turned the tide of battle with weakening enemy attacks ([[debuff]]s) and ally-strengthening ([[buff (computer gaming)|buff]]s). Scrappers were melee fighters with a greater chance of critical hits against tough opponents such as bosses. Tankers possessed great defenses and the ability to take hits for the team, as well as powers to adjust [[Hate (video gaming)|aggro]] towards them.\n\nThere were also five basic villain archetypes. Brutes dealt increasing damage as they attacked or were themselves attacked. Corruptors could cause damage at range, with high chance for critical hits against wounded targets. Dominators assailed enemies with status effects and direct damage. Masterminds summoned, upgraded, and controlled combat pets. Stalkers were stealthy fighters, dealing critical hits when hidden or when accompanied by a team.\n\nThere were also two epic hero archetypes which were unlocked after reaching level 20 (level 50 prior to Issue 17) with another hero character. Peacebringers were peaceful symbiotic aliens that had light based powers. Warshades were war-like symbiotes that were normally enemies to the Peacebringers but had reformed their evil ways. Both archetypes were capable of shapeshifting into a more offensive or more defensive form. The villain side mirrored this, with two branching villain archetypes which were unlocked after reaching level 20 (also level 50 prior to Issue 17) with another villain character. Both are rank-and-file soldiers for the villainous group Arachnos (Soldiers and Widows) attempting to make a name for themselves, each with two distinct specializations.\n\nWith Issue 21, players could now create a character and go through a tutorial involving the destruction of Galaxy City by Shivans that allowed them to choose their alignment, such as a heroic Corruptor or a villainous Blaster. Heroes went to Paragon City, and Villains went to the Rogue Isles. Characters created with ''Going Rogue'' started the game in Praetoria, and chose whether to be a Loyalist, who followed Emperor Cole, or to be in the Resistance, who opposed him. In Praetoria, however, things were not so black and white. There were good and evil people on both sides, and, when leaving Praetoria at level 20, players could choose their character to be either a Hero or a Villain. The alignment could also be changed later on, allowing for Heroes to go Vigilante before becoming Villains or Villains to become Rogues before being redeemed as Heroes.\n\n==Virtual rewards==\nSimilarly to other MMORPGs, ''City of Heroes/Villains'' had various items that were rewarded within the game. However, many of these items were described as intangible or other-worldly; such as \"inspirations\" (temporary power-ups) or \"inf\" (an abbreviation of \"influence,\" \"infamy,\" or \"information,\" for Heroes, Villains, and Praetorians, respectively, which was used instead of money), which were abstract ideas in the real world. \"Enhancements\" \u2014 slottable attribute boosts \u2014 also covered a range of ideas and items from magic enchantments to technological gadgets to training techniques. With the release of Issue 6, while in supergroup mode, a setting that could be toggled on and off, players accumulated prestige points which were used to improve the supergroup base.\n\nIssue 9 brought the Invention system to the game, which allowed characters to combine other dropped items they salvaged and recipes to create various goods. Invented enhancements could provide better bonuses than normal enhancements, including set bonuses for slotting invented enhancements from the same set into the same power. Costume pieces and limited-use temporary powers could also be invented.\n\nIn addition to these, there were also collectible badges for players to earn. Gained for performing various actions in game (such as moving over specific places in each zone, defeating certain numbers of enemies, healing allies, and taking damage) most served no functional purpose for players, except to provide characters with tag lines under their character names. However, a few, called \"Accolades\" gave players access to temporary powers and permanent bonuses to health and endurance (the game's equivalent to mana or magic points) and were gained by collecting other badges.\n\nPlayers also had the option of purchasing a vast array items on the Paragon Market. Introduced with ''City of Heroes: Freedom'', the Paragon Market was a cash shop wherein players could purchase, for example, power sets, costume sets, temporary powers and boosts, character renames and respecs, extra costume slots, and access to game content that to which they might not normally have access. The currency used on the Paragon Market was Paragon Points, which were either purchased with real money through the Market or awarded as bonuses for VIP subscribers.\n\n==Enemies==\nIn ''City of Heroes'' there were multiple NPC groups that players fought as part of random encounters. Many enemies were found on the streets of Paragon City and the Rogue Isles, whereas others were found in specific instances or areas. There were also Giant Monsters and zone events that took place in parts of the city that were even more uncommon, such as Lusca the giant octopus in the waters of the Independence Port zone or the Ghost of Scrapyard that wanders through Sharkhead Isle.  Enemies in instances were also graded with easier NPC's at the start of the map and more difficult enemies towards the end of the instance.\n\n{{anchor|Paragon City}}\n\n==Setting==\n{{see also|List of City of Heroes characters}}\nThe setting of ''City of Heroes'' was the fictional Paragon City, located in [[Rhode Island]] in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cityofheroes.com/paper/newspaper.html |title = The Paragon Times: Capes Return to Paragon City! |quote = An in-game newspaper article, that mentions ''Paragon City, Rhode Island''. |accessdate=2007-01-25 |date=2004-07-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209163237/http://www.cityofheroes.com/paper/newspaper.html|archivedate=February 9, 2006}}</ref> The city was divided into several smaller neighborhoods that had varying enemies and progressively higher levels of enemies within them. The arbitrary divisions between zones are explained in game by the presence of \"War Walls\", powerful force fields derived from alien technology which were used to defend various areas of the city. Heroes set out by dealing with low-powered street gangs in the initial zones, working their way up to fighting increasingly dangerous threats \u2014 such as organized crime, corrupt corporations, hostile aliens, and supernatural terrors \u2014 even eventually entering other dimensions to fight supremely powerful enemies.\n\nThe setting of ''City of Villains'' was the Rogue Isles, a fictitious group of islands off the eastern coast of the United States. There, under the watchful gaze of Lord Recluse and the Arachnos organization, prospective villains fought to make a name for themselves, seizing any opportunity that presented itself.\n\nThe setting of the ''Going Rogue'' expansion was Praetoria, a parallel dimension version of Paragon City where the world was ravaged by Hamidon and his Devouring Earth legions and only Emperor Marcus Cole managed to bring stability to a world ravaged by the Hamidon Wars. Superpowered individuals living in Praetoria begin as Praetors, working for Emperor Cole, but decide to either join the Loyalist faction and remain a member of the Praetorian armed police force or join the Resistance and attempt to reveal the corruption of Emperor Cole (otherwise known as Tyrant) and free humanity from his rule.\n\n==Updates and history==\nThe Development Team continually expanded ''City of Heroes'' with free downloadable patches/updates as well as free game expansions dubbed \"Issues\". All Issues were made available to both ''City of Heroes'' and (as of Issue 6) ''City of Villains'' titles throughout the lifespan of the game, improving features in both games with each release.\n\n===Issues (free updates)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:7%;\"| Issue #\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Title\n!

Other changes included Zone events in all Praetoria city maps, opening Praetoria to levels past 20, merging subways/ferries to include all destinations (across same alignment only), power animations, increased tip mission drops, mission architect enhancements, hazard zone badges, and making the Fitness Power Pool inherent to all characters.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robison |first=Seth |url=http://www.newsarama.com/games/city-of-heroes-going-rogue-pax-100907.html |title=PAX 2010 \u2013 CITY OF HEROES: GOING ROGUE And Beyond! |publisher=Newsarama|date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}</ref>\n| November 30, 2010\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 20\n|\"Incarnates\"\n| Issue 20 further expanded on the Incarnate system introduced in Issue 19.

Further additions included a new Incarnate Trial (Dilemma Diabolique), new power sets (Beast Mastery and Darkness Control) available from the Paragon Market or free to VIPs, and a new Trial (Drowning in Blood) for Level 15+.

It offered five new character archetypes that were, at the time, exclusive to Villain characters, new maps, and began the first PvP Zones (versus the Arena, which were instanced maps made for PvP fighting) of the game. ''City of Villains'' also was playable with the same subscription fee that paid for ''City of Heroes'' access after buying ''City of Villains''. The retail box included four [[CD-ROM]]s for installation current to Issue 6, one of four limited edition [[HeroClix]] figures of the game's villains, a poster of a map of the Rogue Isles, and a serial code that gave access to the game and one month of game play. Also included was a code for a 30-day trial for ''City of Heroes'', as both games were currently separate. Since 2008, after the NCSoft acquisition of the intellectual properties, owning either ''City of Heroes'' or ''City of Villains'' unlocked both titles at no additional cost.\n\n====''Going Rogue''====\n''City of Heroes: Going Rogue'' was released in 2010. Unlike ''City of Villains'', ''Going Rogue'' was an expansion rather than a stand-alone expansion and required the original game to play. ''Going Rogue'' added an Alignment system, which allowed players to switch from Hero to Villain and added two intermediate Alignments: Vigilante, as a player progresses from Hero to Villain, and Rogue, as a player progresses from Villain to Hero. Players with Vigilante or Rogue characters had access to both ''City of Heroes''{{'}}s Paragon City and ''City of Villains''{{'}}s Rogue Isles until they change to Hero or Villain. The expansion also added the Praetorian Earth dimension where players could start out as neutrally-aligned Praetorians (choosing any of the ten basic Archetypes available to Heroes or Villains), either deciding to side with Emperor Cole's ruling faction and become a Loyalist or side with the Resistance; the allegiance could change as the player chose and completed missions. Praetorian players could also attack new Neutral [[Mob (computer gaming)|mobs]] and would eventually be able to play a mission that allowed them to choose to be a Hero or Villain and complete gameplay in the original games. ''Going Rogue'' also granted access to four new power sets, new costume sets and auras, and introduced missions that started after defeating mobs that affected the player's Alignment.\n\n===Retail releases and special editions===\n*''City of Heroes: Collector's Edition'': Sold through stores in 2005, this included an installation [[DVD-ROM]] that had game content up to Issue 4, a poster of a map of Paragon City, a ''CoH/[[PvP]]'' comic book, a Statesman [[HeroClix]] figure, and a serial code that added access to a special movement power, badge, and cape, in addition to access to the game and one month of game play. A special Hero Kit was later sold that allowed people to get all of the physical and digital content included in the ''Collector's Edition'' aside from the game installation disc.\n*''City of Villains: Collector's Edition'': Sold in stores alongside the standard game edition, this pack included an installation DVD-ROM current through Issue 6, seven exclusive HeroClix figures of characters from both games, a book featuring [[concept art]] for both games, a promotional card for the [[City of Heroes Collectible Card Game]], one of five preview decks for the CCG, a two-sided poster of the game map from the standard edition and a Heroes vs. Villains fight scene, a ''CoH'' trial serial code, and a serial code that allowed access to a special costume icon and cape, in addition to access to ''CoV'' and one month of game play.\n*''City of Heroes: Bootleg Edition'': A trial copy of ''City of Heroes'' released free of charge as a promotional copy during City of Villains. The Bootleg Edition came with no special features, a 10-day demo key, and required a player to purchase a digital key for the ''City of Heroes'' or ''City of Villains'' game in order to play after the demo. Released during Issue 6, the disc allowed players to try either Heroes or Villains.\n*''City of Heroes & City of Villains: Good Versus Evil Edition'': This retail box included an installation DVD-ROM current to Issue 7, a two-sided map of Paragon City and the Rogue Isles, digital copies of issues 1 through 6 of [[Top Cow]]'s ''CoH'' comic book, and a \"Pocket D VIP Pass\" that had the serial code for access to both games, a month of free game play, special costume pieces for both Heroes and Villains, a special badge, and two special powers. This serial code was later made available digitally.\n*''City of Heroes: Architect Edition'': This edition of the game included an installation DVD-ROM current to Issue 14 for both PC and Mac, a quick-start guide, the map from the ''Good Versus Evil Edition'', and an activation code for the unified games, one month of free game play, and access to one of the first two Super Booster packs. A digital-only purchase later was made available for the same content.\n*''City of Heroes Going Rogue: Complete Collection'': Released in 2010 alongside the standard version of the game, this edition includes ''City of Heroes'', ''City of Villains'', and adds access to unique in-game costume pieces, auras, emotes, and a unique invisibility power in addition to access to all of the content available with the standard ''Going Rogue'' game. Ordering this from GameStop included exclusive power enhancements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofheroes.com/news/news_archive/new_gamestoprazer_going_rogue.html|title=New Gamestop/Razer Going Rogue Promotion|publisher=Paragon Studios|accessdate=May 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602032031/http://www.cityofheroes.com/news/news_archive/new_gamestoprazer_going_rogue.html|archivedate=June 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Booster packs===\nStarting in 2008, \"Booster Packs\" were also released sporadically around Issue updates. Booster Packs did not function like expansions (adding content to the game), but rather added optional costume sets to the game's character creator and user interface, and were available on the NCsoft Store for a one-time fee. Although each of these packs were themed after their similarly named character option in the game (so far character origins and power sets), their features could be applied to any or all the characters in a player's account regardless of their actual origin, archetype or powers.\n\nThere was also a \"Mini-Booster\" pack for the purchase of an in-game jetpack for 30 days of real time. As of August 30, 2011, Booster Packs were no longer available for sale on the NCSoft website. While costume pieces were still available in the Paragon Market under the Booster Pack names for one price, the prestige powers and emotes had been separated from the packs as an additional purchase.<ref name=\"City of Heroes\">{{cite web |url=http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showthread.php?t=269559 |title=City of Heroes Forums: Retiring Booster Packs, Expansions and Boxed Sets on the NCsoft store on August 30 |publisher=City of Heroes |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929022441/http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showthread.php?t=269559 |archivedate=2011-09-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Super Packs===\nOn February 24, 2012, Heroes and Villains Super Packs were introduced to the Paragon Market after feedback from the beta release of the program was made known by the players.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lefebvre |first=Eliot |url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/02/14/city-of-heroes-introduces-the-super-pack-players-respond-with-r/ |title=City of Heroes introduces the super pack, players respond with rage &#124; Massively |publisher=Massively.joystiq.com |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2012-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808023037/http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/02/14/city-of-heroes-introduces-the-super-pack-players-respond-with-r/ |archive-date=2012-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Super Packs contained five cards which were turned over (upon opening of the pack) to reveal random items given to the player's account as a Character Item (one character per account receives the item), or, in the case of costume parts or prestige powers, the reward is applied account-wide.\n\nSuper Packs functioned much like a lottery mini-game, which offered two cards that give common rewards, and one card each that offered an uncommon, rare and ultra rare reward per reveal. There were 205 possible rewards in the entire pack, of which 92% were repeatable (Costume Parts and Temp Powers only granted once per account.)\n\nSuper Packs were sold in quantities of 1, 12 or 24 uses each on the Paragon Market. Super Packs were not available through in-game play (Free players could not receive or use them), and as a Premium Player, a Super Pack may have granted rewards that you could keep but were unable to claim or use until you unlocked it in the Paragon Market or through the Paragon Rewards program.\n\n===Virtual item packs===\nA few in-game item packs were released to allow players to gain in-game items from select box releases of the game at a lower cost than repurchasing the title at retail price.  Item packs only contained the items in an Edition release, and did not come with free playtime or (in the case of expansions) the added game content that require an expansion purchase in order to use.\n*''Good versus Evil Edition Item Pack'' which included a Jump Jet Travel Power, Pocket D Teleport power and special Hero/Villain-themed costume sets.\n*''Mac Special Edition Item Pack'', which included all of the costume pieces from the Valkyrie set and the Mission Transporter power.\n*''Going Rogue Item Pack'', which included the Alpha and Omega costume sets and the Shadowy Presence power.\n*''Wedding Pack'': A serial code first sold on [[Valentine's Day]], 2008, added special wedding-themed costume pieces and emotes to the game.\n*''Party Pack'': Released in late September, 2010, which included party themed character emotes.\nAs of August 30, 2011 virtual item packs were no longer available for sale on the NCSoft website.

Holiday events granted commemorative badges upon signing in during the event, and had earnable themed badges by participating in the in-game events.\n\n===Anniversary===\n''City of Heroes'' granted a commemorative badge during its anniversary month of May and often scheduled special events and surprises during May.

However, since merging the titles in 2008, this became a moot point as any player of one of the games could access the opposite game without purchasing it.\n\nContinuing active subscriptions were also entitled to \"Veteran Rewards\". The system rewarded players with costume pieces, extra powers, supergroup base items, respec opportunities, and other minor in-game perks to all characters (both hero and villain characters) on any server tied to the active subscription. Inactive accounts did not accrue time for Veteran Rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofheroes.com/community/veteranrewards.html|title=www.cityofheroes.com: Veteran Rewards Program|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023211856/http://www.cityofheroes.com/community/veteranrewards.html|archivedate=2008-10-23}}</ref>\n\nSince 2009, players considering ''City of Heroes'' could sign up for a 14-day trial key without subscribing to the game, without receiving an in-game referral or using a credit card. Certain features, such as chat, trade, membership in groups, and leveling up were restricted to prevent exploitative players/groups from using trial accounts to further [[Real Money Trade]] activities that NCSoft prohibited in-game. After 14 days expire, a trial player would need to buy the game and subscribe for further months to continue their play.\n\nAs of September, 2008, ''City of Heroes'' had around 124,939 subscribers in the US & Europe, according to financial reports released by NCsoft in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsoft.net/global/ir/overview.aspx|title=NCsoft.com: financial report}}</ref>\n\nOn June 20, 2011, ''City of Heroes'' announced the ''City of Heroes: Freedom'' subscription model, which was implemented in September, 2011. The servers were free-to-play, with limitations on what Free players could access. Players who had their subscriptions lapse would become Premium players, and would have access to everything they used to have, but would be limited to what they would be able to access in the game's future updates unless they signed up for a VIP subscription. The VIP subscription added free access to the ''Going Rogue'' game content, and a monthly VIP Rewards system (as opposed to the quarterly releases of the Veteran Rewards). There was also an in-game market where all players could purchase points to purchase expansions to the game; VIP subscribers were given a monthly stipend of these points at no extra charge.<ref name=\"COH freedom\"/><ref name=\"IGN freedom\"/>\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Novels===\nThe first ''City of Heroes'' novel, ''The Web of Arachnos'', by [[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]], was published by CDS Books (an imprint of the Perseus Publishing Group) in October, 2005. The novel chronicles the back stories of the Statesman and Lord Recluse, the central iconic characters in the ''City of Heroes'' and ''City of Villains'' franchises. A second novel, ''The Freedom Phalanx'', written by [[Robin Laws]], was released in May, 2006, and detailed the re-formation of the hero team the Freedom Phalanx in the 1980s. The story centers on the fledgling heroes Positron and Synapse, but also includes Manticore, Sister Psyche, and Statesman. The book's villains include Lord Recluse, Doctor Null, Shadow Queen, and Revenant. Artist [[George P\u00e9rez]] provided the covers for the first two novels, as well as lending his name to one of the early areas of the game itself, Perez Park. A third novel titled ''The Rikti War'' was announced by CDS at the time the first novel was published, with an August 2006, scheduled release date. The book was reportedly going to cover the epic trans-dimensional war between Earth and the Rikti home world, however the book was later cancelled. [[James Lowder]] served as editor and packager of the City of Heroes novels for CDS.\n\n===Comic books===\n{{Main|City of Heroes (comics)}}\nTo tie in with the game, NCsoft released two original comic book series that featured various characters from within the games themselves. The original series by publisher Blue King featured the heroes/roommates Apex and War Witch with their neighbor Horus. The later series from publisher Top Cow featured signature heroes and villains from both ''City of Heroes'' and ''City of Villains'' such as Statesman, Positron, Lord Recluse, and Ghost Widow, along with scripts by well-known comic book creators Mark Waid, Troy Hickman, and Dan Jurgens. Both series were originally free for subscribers to the games, but later they were provided for an extra subscription fee with the game and for free in digital format afterwards on the official ''City of Heroes'' website. The Blue King series ran for 12 issues, after which the Top Cow series ran for an additional 20 issues, ending in July 2007.\n\n===Collectible card game===\n{{Main|City of Heroes Collectible Card Game}}\n[[Alderac Entertainment Group]] also worked with ''CoH'' to create a [[collectible card game]] featuring characters from the game, as well as several original characters. The game's website also allowed players to create a game-compliant card for their own online character.\n\n===Role-playing game===\nThe ''City of Heroes'' team worked with [[Eden Studios, Inc.]] to create a [[tabletop role-playing game]] based on the game. While a free preview version of the game was released, the game was [[Development hell|indefinitely delayed]] due to the cancellation license with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on their ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (roleplaying game)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (role-playing game)|Angel]]'' role-playing games. Eden owner [[George Vasilakos]] later made a statement in 2008 that they were waiting on information from the copyright holders, but no news arose after this date.<ref name=\"forum post 02/21/200\">{{cite web | url = http://edenstudiosdiscussionboards.yuku.com/reply/41669/t/Huh-.html#reply-41669 | title = George Vasilakos mentions delay do to CoH/V ownership change |author=George Vasilakos | date = 2008-02-21 | accessdate = 2008-03-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407173540/http://edenstudiosdiscussionboards.yuku.com/reply/41669/t/Huh-.html#reply-41669 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Heroclix===\nThe various collector's editions of ''City of Heroes'' and ''City of Villains'' included exclusive [[HeroClix]] figures of signature characters from the game. These included Statesman (without a cape), Manticore, Ghost Widow, Lord Recluse, Positron, Black Scorpion and Mako. There was also a separate, Limited Edition version of Statesman wearing a cape.\n\n===Film and television===\nIn June 2007, it was announced that the producer for the ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' film, [[Tom DeSanto]], had acquired the option to make movies and television shows based on the ''City of Heroes'' franchise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=41833 |title=SCI FI Wire {{!}} The News Service of the SCI FI Channel {{!}} SCIFI.COM: DeSanto Develops ''Heroes'' Film |accessdate=2007-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709031916/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0 |archivedate=July 9, 2008 }}</ref> In February 2008, it was announced that DeSanto had indeed begun preparations for the film.

The suit sought unspecified damages and an injunction halting further sales and shutting down the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-11-11-marvel-sues-over-avatars_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com&nbsp;\u2014 Marvel sues two companies over role-playing game|last=Veiga|first=Alex|agency=Associated Press | work=USA Today | date=November 11, 2004 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe game included in its [[Software license|user agreement]] strong language against such activity, however. It forbade the creation of potentially infringing characters, and NCI had been known to rename or \"genericize\" such characters. The User Agreement additionally held players accountable to indemnify (reimburse) NCI and its affiliates against third-party infringement claims, and demanded either a granting of sole ownership in player created content, including characters, to NCI, or a warranty that a third party owner of the rights in player created content had made such a grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsoft.com/en/legal/user-agreements/city-of-heroes-user-agreement.html|title=City of Heroes User Agreement|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906193718/http://www.ncsoft.com/en/legal/user-agreements/city-of-heroes-user-agreement.html|archivedate=2012-09-06}}</ref> It was unclear whether this grant was an exclusive [[assignment (law)|assignment]] or a non-exclusive [[license]], however.\n\nThe defendants replied that the lawsuit was frivolous, and while many [[intellectual property]] analysts agreed, others noted that trademark law is structured such that, if Marvel believed their marks were being infringed upon, they had little choice but to file a lawsuit, regardless of its outcome, to preserve the strength of the marks. At least one noted similarities to ''Fonovisa, Inc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc.'', a case in which a company that ran a [[flea market]] was successfully sued over [[intellectual property infringement]] because a vendor had been selling [[copyright infringement|bootlegged]] records at that flea market. Although Cherry Auction had not been directly selling the infringing items, the court found that it was vicariously or contributorially liable for the infringement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nMarvel subsequently admitted<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/IP/Marvel_v_NCSoft/motion_to_dismiss_order.pdf|title=Defendants Motion to strike matter from plaintiffs second amended complaint and motion to dismiss same (Section IIIA)|author=Judge R.

Marvel Universe Online was eventually cancelled by Microsoft.\n\n==Acquisition and new studio==\nOn November 6, 2007, NCsoft announced that it would assume ownership of both ''City of Heroes'' and ''City of Villains''. As part of a push to further develop ''City of Heroes'', the company also announced the formation of a new development studio dedicated to new titles as well as their interest in distributing and administering their future works once launched. This new team was centered on key members of the Cryptic and NCsoft ''City of Heroes/Villains'' teams who accepted the NCsoft offer to join their new studio in Northern California. The sale of the City of Heroes IP granted Cryptic Studios the freedom to work on its new superhero MMORPG (at this time, an RPG/Action hybrid) ''[[Champions Online]]'' without concerns of conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite web|title=NCsoft Announces New Studio in North California; Takes Full Ownership of Successful City of Heroes Property |url=http://www.ncsoft.com/eng/NCPress/View.asp?hSeq=1 |publisher=NCsoft |accessdate=2007-11-06 |format=\u2013<sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3ANCsoft+Announces+New+Studio+in+North+California%3B+Takes+Full+Ownership+of+Successful+City+of+Heroes+Property&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041054/http://www.ncsoft.com/eng/NCPress/View.asp?hseq=1 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nShortly after having acquired full ownership of the property, NCsoft granted all existing and former ''City of Heroes'' account holders access to both games (''City of Heroes'' and''City of Villains'').<ref>[http://www.cityofheroes.com/press/a_new_age.html City of Heroes Community Site<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213000606/http://www.cityofheroes.com/press/a_new_age.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref> This allowed all Hero players access to Superbases, which initially required a ''CoV'' purchase from its release in Issue 7 until Issue 10, and was no longer required as of Issue 11. Before the purchase, NCsoft allowed players with a subscription or a time card for ''City of Heroes'' to have the same access to ''City of Villains'' as well (at its lowest price point, $14.99 covered access to both titles for a month), whether or not they had purchased the other title. This was still being honored after all accounts who had only ''City of Heroes'' received access to ''City of Villains'' for free. In a July 2008 press release, NCsoft announced the successful completion of allowing all copies of ''City of Heroes'' or ''City of Villains'' to access the other game (it claimed that Single Title Retail Boxes recently purchased did not successfully unlock the other game when activated).\n\nOn April 14, 2009, NCsoft NorCal formally changed its name to [[Paragon Studios]] to become a fully owned developer subsidiary of [[NCsoft]] (similar to [[Destination Games]] and [[ArenaNet]]) dedicated to ''City of Heroes''.

They have, however, objected to the distribution of ''City of Heroes'' content binaries themselves.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:coh-screenshot.jpg|thumb|A tanker (foreground) confronts one of the game's arch villains, the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Vahzilok, in ''City of Heroes''.]]\nAfter [[#Character creation|creating their character]] and selecting a name (the game would check if the name was already taken on the server), players could either begin play in an isolated [[tutorial]] zone, or skip the tutorial and begin in an open low-level zone. A character's level increased by earning experience points from defeating foes, completing Missions, and exploring Zones, then returning to an NPC known as a Trainer. Benefits for rising in level included more Health, more Powers to choose for the character, more slots to allocate Enhancements to Powers, and larger inventories for Inspirations (quick use items) and Salvage (crafting materials). If a player loses all of their Health, they could be revived through use of an item, by an ally's powers, or in one of the Hospitals on the map; reviving in a Hospital after a certain level incurred Experience Debt, which made gaining additional experience more difficult.\n\nThe setting of the game, Paragon City for Heroes, was divided into different Zones (essentially neighborhoods) by giant energy \"War Walls\", which were justified in the back story. Especially dangerous zones called \"Hazard\" or \"Trial\" zones, which teemed with larger groups of enemies, were marked in red on the in-game map and were much more dangerous than normal zones. The Villains' setting, the Rogue Isles, consisted of islands connected by a network of ferries and helicopters. A few zones were accessible to both heroes and villains; some were cooperative zones, while others were player versus player (PvP) zones. Praetoria, for characters created in the ''Going Rogue'' update, lacked War Walls, allowing more or less free movement between areas.\n\nPlayers initially moved around the zones by jogging or using a minor speed-increasing power such as \"Sprint\". As heroes grew in level and accumulated more powers, they could choose among four higher speed traveling powers: Teleportation, Super Speed, Super Jumping, and Flight.\n\nAs characters leveled-up, players could choose new powers from the character's primary and secondary power sets, as set during creation, or from shared power pools. The power pools contained the four travel powers and other generic, usually utilitarian, powers that fell under categories such as Fitness, Concealment, and Leadership. In addition, as characters leveled up, they gained access to new costume features, including the ability to change between up to five costumes and unlockable costume parts such as capes and auras (unlocked after missions).\n\n[[Quest (video gaming)|Quests]] in the game were known as missions, and were obtained through various channels, generally from various NPCs the player met in the game. Although missions could be completed alone, the player had the option to form Teams with other player characters to play off of each other's characters' strengths and abilities. The level of the characters used, size of the team, and a separate difficulty scale chosen by the player called Notoriety, all affected the difficulty of the mission. Missions could take the form of an [[Instance dungeon|instanced area]] where the player(s) must defeat a [[boss (video games)|boss]], save NPC characters held hostage (sometimes taking the form of [[escort mission]]s), or search the instance for a certain object or number of objects (such as clues or defusing bombs), while other Missions required that players defeat a certain number and type of [[Mob (video gaming)|mobs]], possibly in a defined area of the game. Some missions are part of [[story arc]]s that involve the player in a larger narrative that tells some of the back story of the setting. Task Forces (''City of Heroes''), Strike Forces (''City of Villains''), and Trials (both) were particular missions that could be completed multiple times, but only as part of a team, and had to be completed in entirety to earn particular rewards for completion, such as the ability to [[respec]] a character's chosen Powers and Enhancements.\n\nCooperative play also took the form of larger [[Clan (video gaming)|clans]] called Supergroups, reminiscent of comic book groups such as the [[Justice League]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], or the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Players part of Supergroups could team up together or convene in Bases (introduced with ''City of Villains''). Bases were used for social meeting or housing special items used in crafting Inventions, serving as a collective item vault, or to recover after losing all Health in the overworld. Supergroups in turn could form Coalitions with each other for increased collaborations. Coalitions were generally formed for the [[Raid (gaming)|raids]] featured in the game.\n\nAnother form of cooperative play was the Sidekick feature, which allowed for characters of disparate experience levels to participate in the game together. A Sidekick's experience level would be temporarily risen to be close to their partner's level, and their Health and strength would be scaled to their artificial level, while any experience or Influence they gained was scaled to their original level. A reverse feature known as Exemplar was added later, which artificially lowered the level of a higher level character (also removing access to powers unavailable at their new level), but they earn experience at their original level, which is useful in removing Debt, or gains Influence rather than Experience. For the release of ''City of Villains'', these features are Lackey and Malefactor. Issue 16 overhauled the system such that it was automatically scaled to the \"Anchor\", which was either the player on the team whose mission the team was set to perform or the team's leader.\n\nPlayers could also set \"leveling pacts\" which allowed two players to sync up the experience their characters gained, although this was disabled in a later update.\n\nOther game features included auction houses and crafting inventions to make characters more powerful or unlock further costume options. The Architect release gave players the ability to construct custom mission arcs, with customized enemies and layouts that could then be played by all other players. The ''Going Rogue'' expansion allowed players to switch their alignment using Tip Missions collected from defeated enemies.\n\n==Character creation==\n\nIn character creation, the player first selected a character's origin and archetype, then primary and secondary power sets. Next, the actual avatar with its costume was created. Then the player had a choice of customizing the colors of his/her powers. Lastly, the player chose a name and could optionally write a background story to add some flavor to the character, as well as creating an individual battle cry.\n\nThere were five origins a player could choose for his/her character that dictated what type of enhancements the character may use, affected which single short-ranged power they begin with (in addition to powers obtained from their primary and secondary power sets), and influenced the various enemy groups that the character went up against. These origins were as follows:\n*Natural: Powers obtained through training the body, weapons, or inherent abilities if the character is not human\n*Magic: Powers obtained through a magic item, magical spells, or a mystical being\n*Science: Powers obtained through some sort of scientific means, whether intentionally or accidentally\n*Mutation: Powers obtained through a change in genetics, manifesting at any point in their life\n*Technology: Powers obtained through highly advanced technology\nA special \"Incarnate\" origin was programmed for various NPCs in the game who obtained powers from the fictional Well of the Furies. The \"Incarnate System\", which added additional powers for the player to choose from after completing difficult missions.\n\nThere were five basic hero archetypes, which affected a character's power choices and team role throughout the game. Blasters were versatile damage dealers, capable of fighting at short or long range against one or many opponents, but had relatively little health. Controllers were adept at preventing enemies from moving or acting through inducing status effects, as well as possessing pet summons. Defenders turned the tide of battle with weakening enemy attacks ([[debuff]]s) and ally-strengthening ([[buff (computer gaming)|buff]]s). Scrappers were melee fighters with a greater chance of critical hits against tough opponents such as bosses. Tankers possessed great defenses and the ability to take hits for the team, as well as powers to adjust [[Hate (video gaming)|aggro]] towards them.\n\nThere were also five basic villain archetypes. Brutes dealt increasing damage as they attacked or were themselves attacked. Corruptors could cause damage at range, with high chance for critical hits against wounded targets. Dominators assailed enemies with status effects and direct damage. Masterminds summoned, upgraded, and controlled combat pets. Stalkers were stealthy fighters, dealing critical hits when hidden or when accompanied by a team.\n\nThere were also two epic hero archetypes which were unlocked after reaching level 20 (level 50 prior to Issue 17) with another hero character. Peacebringers were peaceful symbiotic aliens that had light based powers. Warshades were war-like symbiotes that were normally enemies to the Peacebringers but had reformed their evil ways. Both archetypes were capable of shapeshifting into a more offensive or more defensive form. The villain side mirrored this, with two branching villain archetypes which were unlocked after reaching level 20 (also level 50 prior to Issue 17) with another villain character. Both are rank-and-file soldiers for the villainous group Arachnos (Soldiers and Widows) attempting to make a name for themselves, each with two distinct specializations.\n\nWith Issue 21, players could now create a character and go through a tutorial involving the destruction of Galaxy City by Shivans that allowed them to choose their alignment, such as a heroic Corruptor or a villainous Blaster. Heroes went to Paragon City, and Villains went to the Rogue Isles. Characters created with ''Going Rogue'' started the game in Praetoria, and chose whether to be a Loyalist, who followed Emperor Cole, or to be in the Resistance, who opposed him. In Praetoria, however, things were not so black and white. There were good and evil people on both sides, and, when leaving Praetoria at level 20, players could choose their character to be either a Hero or a Villain. The alignment could also be changed later on, allowing for Heroes to go Vigilante before becoming Villains or Villains to become Rogues before being redeemed as Heroes.\n\n==Virtual rewards==\nSimilarly to other MMORPGs, ''City of Heroes/Villains'' had various items that were rewarded within the game. However, many of these items were described as intangible or other-worldly; such as \"inspirations\" (temporary power-ups) or \"inf\" (an abbreviation of \"influence,\" \"infamy,\" or \"information,\" for Heroes, Villains, and Praetorians, respectively, which was used instead of money), which were abstract ideas in the real world. \"Enhancements\" \u2014 slottable attribute boosts \u2014 also covered a range of ideas and items from magic enchantments to technological gadgets to training techniques. With the release of Issue 6, while in supergroup mode, a setting that could be toggled on and off, players accumulated prestige points which were used to improve the supergroup base.\n\nIssue 9 brought the Invention system to the game, which allowed characters to combine other dropped items they salvaged and recipes to create various goods. Invented enhancements could provide better bonuses than normal enhancements, including set bonuses for slotting invented enhancements from the same set into the same power. Costume pieces and limited-use temporary powers could also be invented.\n\nIn addition to these, there were also collectible badges for players to earn. Gained for performing various actions in game (such as moving over specific places in each zone, defeating certain numbers of enemies, healing allies, and taking damage) most served no functional purpose for players, except to provide characters with tag lines under their character names. However, a few, called \"Accolades\" gave players access to temporary powers and permanent bonuses to health and endurance (the game's equivalent to mana or magic points) and were gained by collecting other badges.\n\nPlayers also had the option of purchasing a vast array items on the Paragon Market. Introduced with ''City of Heroes: Freedom'', the Paragon Market was a cash shop wherein players could purchase, for example, power sets, costume sets, temporary powers and boosts, character renames and respecs, extra costume slots, and access to game content that to which they might not normally have access. The currency used on the Paragon Market was Paragon Points, which were either purchased with real money through the Market or awarded as bonuses for VIP subscribers.\n\n==Enemies==\nIn ''City of Heroes'' there were multiple NPC groups that players fought as part of random encounters. Many enemies were found on the streets of Paragon City and the Rogue Isles, whereas others were found in specific instances or areas. There were also Giant Monsters and zone events that took place in parts of the city that were even more uncommon, such as Lusca the giant octopus in the waters of the Independence Port zone or the Ghost of Scrapyard that wanders through Sharkhead Isle.  Enemies in instances were also graded with easier NPC's at the start of the map and more difficult enemies towards the end of the instance.\n\n{{anchor|Paragon City}}\n\n==Setting==\n{{see also|List of City of Heroes characters}}\nThe setting of ''City of Heroes'' was the fictional Paragon City, located in [[Rhode Island]] in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cityofheroes.com/paper/newspaper.html |title = The Paragon Times: Capes Return to Paragon City! |quote = An in-game newspaper article, that mentions ''Paragon City, Rhode Island''. |accessdate=2007-01-25 |date=2004-07-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209163237/http://www.cityofheroes.com/paper/newspaper.html|archivedate=February 9, 2006}}</ref> The city was divided into several smaller neighborhoods that had varying enemies and progressively higher levels of enemies within them. The arbitrary divisions between zones are explained in game by the presence of \"War Walls\", powerful force fields derived from alien technology which were used to defend various areas of the city. Heroes set out by dealing with low-powered street gangs in the initial zones, working their way up to fighting increasingly dangerous threats \u2014 such as organized crime, corrupt corporations, hostile aliens, and supernatural terrors \u2014 even eventually entering other dimensions to fight supremely powerful enemies.\n\nThe setting of ''City of Villains'' was the Rogue Isles, a fictitious group of islands off the eastern coast of the United States. There, under the watchful gaze of Lord Recluse and the Arachnos organization, prospective villains fought to make a name for themselves, seizing any opportunity that presented itself.\n\nThe setting of the ''Going Rogue'' expansion was Praetoria, a parallel dimension version of Paragon City where the world was ravaged by Hamidon and his Devouring Earth legions and only Emperor Marcus Cole managed to bring stability to a world ravaged by the Hamidon Wars. Superpowered individuals living in Praetoria begin as Praetors, working for Emperor Cole, but decide to either join the Loyalist faction and remain a member of the Praetorian armed police force or join the Resistance and attempt to reveal the corruption of Emperor Cole (otherwise known as Tyrant) and free humanity from his rule.\n\n==Updates and history==\nThe Development Team continually expanded ''City of Heroes'' with free downloadable patches/updates as well as free game expansions dubbed \"Issues\". All Issues were made available to both ''City of Heroes'' and (as of Issue 6) ''City of Villains'' titles throughout the lifespan of the game, improving features in both games with each release.\n\n===Issues (free updates)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:7%;\"| Issue #\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Title\n!

Further additions included a new Incarnate Trial (Dilemma Diabolique), new power sets (Beast Mastery and Darkness Control) available from the Paragon Market or free to VIPs, and a new Trial (Drowning in Blood) for Level 15+.

It offered five new character archetypes that were, at the time, exclusive to Villain characters, new maps, and began the first PvP Zones (versus the Arena, which were instanced maps made for PvP fighting) of the game. ''City of Villains'' also was playable with the same subscription fee that paid for ''City of Heroes'' access after buying ''City of Villains''. The retail box included four [[CD-ROM]]s for installation current to Issue 6, one of four limited edition [[HeroClix]] figures of the game's villains, a poster of a map of the Rogue Isles, and a serial code that gave access to the game and one month of game play. Also included was a code for a 30-day trial for ''City of Heroes'', as both games were currently separate. Since 2008, after the NCSoft acquisition of the intellectual properties, owning either ''City of Heroes'' or ''City of Villains'' unlocked both titles at no additional cost.\n\n====''Going Rogue''====\n''City of Heroes: Going Rogue'' was released in 2010. Unlike ''City of Villains'', ''Going Rogue'' was an expansion rather than a stand-alone expansion and required the original game to play. ''Going Rogue'' added an Alignment system, which allowed players to switch from Hero to Villain and added two intermediate Alignments: Vigilante, as a player progresses from Hero to Villain, and Rogue, as a player progresses from Villain to Hero. Players with Vigilante or Rogue characters had access to both ''City of Heroes''{{'}}s Paragon City and ''City of Villains''{{'}}s Rogue Isles until they change to Hero or Villain. The expansion also added the Praetorian Earth dimension where players could start out as neutrally-aligned Praetorians (choosing any of the ten basic Archetypes available to Heroes or Villains), either deciding to side with Emperor Cole's ruling faction and become a Loyalist or side with the Resistance; the allegiance could change as the player chose and completed missions. Praetorian players could also attack new Neutral [[Mob (computer gaming)|mobs]] and would eventually be able to play a mission that allowed them to choose to be a Hero or Villain and complete gameplay in the original games. ''Going Rogue'' also granted access to four new power sets, new costume sets and auras, and introduced missions that started after defeating mobs that affected the player's Alignment.\n\n===Retail releases and special editions===\n*''City of Heroes: Collector's Edition'': Sold through stores in 2005, this included an installation [[DVD-ROM]] that had game content up to Issue 4, a poster of a map of Paragon City, a ''CoH/[[PvP]]'' comic book, a Statesman [[HeroClix]] figure, and a serial code that added access to a special movement power, badge, and cape, in addition to access to the game and one month of game play. A special Hero Kit was later sold that allowed people to get all of the physical and digital content included in the ''Collector's Edition'' aside from the game installation disc.\n*''City of Villains: Collector's Edition'': Sold in stores alongside the standard game edition, this pack included an installation DVD-ROM current through Issue 6, seven exclusive HeroClix figures of characters from both games, a book featuring [[concept art]] for both games, a promotional card for the [[City of Heroes Collectible Card Game]], one of five preview decks for the CCG, a two-sided poster of the game map from the standard edition and a Heroes vs. Villains fight scene, a ''CoH'' trial serial code, and a serial code that allowed access to a special costume icon and cape, in addition to access to ''CoV'' and one month of game play.\n*''City of Heroes: Bootleg Edition'': A trial copy of ''City of Heroes'' released free of charge as a promotional copy during City of Villains. The Bootleg Edition came with no special features, a 10-day demo key, and required a player to purchase a digital key for the ''City of Heroes'' or ''City of Villains'' game in order to play after the demo. Released during Issue 6, the disc allowed players to try either Heroes or Villains.\n*''City of Heroes & City of Villains: Good Versus Evil Edition'': This retail box included an installation DVD-ROM current to Issue 7, a two-sided map of Paragon City and the Rogue Isles, digital copies of issues 1 through 6 of [[Top Cow]]'s ''CoH'' comic book, and a \"Pocket D VIP Pass\" that had the serial code for access to both games, a month of free game play, special costume pieces for both Heroes and Villains, a special badge, and two special powers. This serial code was later made available digitally.\n*''City of Heroes: Architect Edition'': This edition of the game included an installation DVD-ROM current to Issue 14 for both PC and Mac, a quick-start guide, the map from the ''Good Versus Evil Edition'', and an activation code for the unified games, one month of free game play, and access to one of the first two Super Booster packs. A digital-only purchase later was made available for the same content.\n*''City of Heroes Going Rogue: Complete Collection'': Released in 2010 alongside the standard version of the game, this edition includes ''City of Heroes'', ''City of Villains'', and adds access to unique in-game costume pieces, auras, emotes, and a unique invisibility power in addition to access to all of the content available with the standard ''Going Rogue'' game. Ordering this from GameStop included exclusive power enhancements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofheroes.com/news/news_archive/new_gamestoprazer_going_rogue.html|title=New Gamestop/Razer Going Rogue Promotion|publisher=Paragon Studios|accessdate=May 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602032031/http://www.cityofheroes.com/news/news_archive/new_gamestoprazer_going_rogue.html|archivedate=June 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Booster packs===\nStarting in 2008, \"Booster Packs\" were also released sporadically around Issue updates. Booster Packs did not function like expansions (adding content to the game), but rather added optional costume sets to the game's character creator and user interface, and were available on the NCsoft Store for a one-time fee. Although each of these packs were themed after their similarly named character option in the game (so far character origins and power sets), their features could be applied to any or all the characters in a player's account regardless of their actual origin, archetype or powers.\n\nThere was also a \"Mini-Booster\" pack for the purchase of an in-game jetpack for 30 days of real time. As of August 30, 2011, Booster Packs were no longer available for sale on the NCSoft website. While costume pieces were still available in the Paragon Market under the Booster Pack names for one price, the prestige powers and emotes had been separated from the packs as an additional purchase.<ref name=\"City of Heroes\">{{cite web |url=http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showthread.php?t=269559 |title=City of Heroes Forums: Retiring Booster Packs, Expansions and Boxed Sets on the NCsoft store on August 30 |publisher=City of Heroes |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929022441/http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showthread.php?t=269559 |archivedate=2011-09-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Super Packs===\nOn February 24, 2012, Heroes and Villains Super Packs were introduced to the Paragon Market after feedback from the beta release of the program was made known by the players.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lefebvre |first=Eliot |url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/02/14/city-of-heroes-introduces-the-super-pack-players-respond-with-r/ |title=City of Heroes introduces the super pack, players respond with rage &#124; Massively |publisher=Massively.joystiq.com |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2012-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808023037/http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/02/14/city-of-heroes-introduces-the-super-pack-players-respond-with-r/ |archive-date=2012-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Super Packs contained five cards which were turned over (upon opening of the pack) to reveal random items given to the player's account as a Character Item (one character per account receives the item), or, in the case of costume parts or prestige powers, the reward is applied account-wide.\n\nSuper Packs functioned much like a lottery mini-game, which offered two cards that give common rewards, and one card each that offered an uncommon, rare and ultra rare reward per reveal. There were 205 possible rewards in the entire pack, of which 92% were repeatable (Costume Parts and Temp Powers only granted once per account.)\n\nSuper Packs were sold in quantities of 1, 12 or 24 uses each on the Paragon Market. Super Packs were not available through in-game play (Free players could not receive or use them), and as a Premium Player, a Super Pack may have granted rewards that you could keep but were unable to claim or use until you unlocked it in the Paragon Market or through the Paragon Rewards program.\n\n===Virtual item packs===\nA few in-game item packs were released to allow players to gain in-game items from select box releases of the game at a lower cost than repurchasing the title at retail price.  Item packs only contained the items in an Edition release, and did not come with free playtime or (in the case of expansions) the added game content that require an expansion purchase in order to use.\n*''Good versus Evil Edition Item Pack'' which included a Jump Jet Travel Power, Pocket D Teleport power and special Hero/Villain-themed costume sets.\n*''Mac Special Edition Item Pack'', which included all of the costume pieces from the Valkyrie set and the Mission Transporter power.\n*''Going Rogue Item Pack'', which included the Alpha and Omega costume sets and the Shadowy Presence power.\n*''Wedding Pack'': A serial code first sold on [[Valentine's Day]], 2008, added special wedding-themed costume pieces and emotes to the game.\n*''Party Pack'': Released in late September, 2010, which included party themed character emotes.\nAs of August 30, 2011 virtual item packs were no longer available for sale on the NCSoft website.

Eventual changes to holiday events included the addition of a Zombie Apocalypse world event during Halloween, and a [[ski slope]] inside of Pocket D during the holidays. Holiday events granted commemorative badges upon signing in during the event, and had earnable themed badges by participating in the in-game events.\n\n===Anniversary===\n''City of Heroes'' granted a commemorative badge during its anniversary month of May and often scheduled special events and surprises during May.

However, since merging the titles in 2008, this became a moot point as any player of one of the games could access the opposite game without purchasing it.\n\nContinuing active subscriptions were also entitled to \"Veteran Rewards\". The system rewarded players with costume pieces, extra powers, supergroup base items, respec opportunities, and other minor in-game perks to all characters (both hero and villain characters) on any server tied to the active subscription. Inactive accounts did not accrue time for Veteran Rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofheroes.com/community/veteranrewards.html|title=www.cityofheroes.com: Veteran Rewards Program|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023211856/http://www.cityofheroes.com/community/veteranrewards.html|archivedate=2008-10-23}}</ref>\n\nSince 2009, players considering ''City of Heroes'' could sign up for a 14-day trial key without subscribing to the game, without receiving an in-game referral or using a credit card. Certain features, such as chat, trade, membership in groups, and leveling up were restricted to prevent exploitative players/groups from using trial accounts to further [[Real Money Trade]] activities that NCSoft prohibited in-game. After 14 days expire, a trial player would need to buy the game and subscribe for further months to continue their play.\n\nAs of September, 2008, ''City of Heroes'' had around 124,939 subscribers in the US & Europe, according to financial reports released by NCsoft in November 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsoft.net/global/ir/overview.aspx|title=NCsoft.com: financial report}}</ref>\n\nOn June 20, 2011, ''City of Heroes'' announced the ''City of Heroes: Freedom'' subscription model, which was implemented in September, 2011. The servers were free-to-play, with limitations on what Free players could access. Players who had their subscriptions lapse would become Premium players, and would have access to everything they used to have, but would be limited to what they would be able to access in the game's future updates unless they signed up for a VIP subscription. The VIP subscription added free access to the ''Going Rogue'' game content, and a monthly VIP Rewards system (as opposed to the quarterly releases of the Veteran Rewards). There was also an in-game market where all players could purchase points to purchase expansions to the game; VIP subscribers were given a monthly stipend of these points at no extra charge.<ref name=\"COH freedom\"/><ref name=\"IGN freedom\"/>\n\n==Other media==\n\n===Novels===\nThe first ''City of Heroes'' novel, ''The Web of Arachnos'', by [[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]], was published by CDS Books (an imprint of the Perseus Publishing Group) in October, 2005. The novel chronicles the back stories of the Statesman and Lord Recluse, the central iconic characters in the ''City of Heroes'' and ''City of Villains'' franchises. A second novel, ''The Freedom Phalanx'', written by [[Robin Laws]], was released in May, 2006, and detailed the re-formation of the hero team the Freedom Phalanx in the 1980s. The story centers on the fledgling heroes Positron and Synapse, but also includes Manticore, Sister Psyche, and Statesman. The book's villains include Lord Recluse, Doctor Null, Shadow Queen, and Revenant. Artist [[George P\u00e9rez]] provided the covers for the first two novels, as well as lending his name to one of the early areas of the game itself, Perez Park. A third novel titled ''The Rikti War'' was announced by CDS at the time the first novel was published, with an August 2006, scheduled release date. The book was reportedly going to cover the epic trans-dimensional war between Earth and the Rikti home world, however the book was later cancelled. [[James Lowder]] served as editor and packager of the City of Heroes novels for CDS.\n\n===Comic books===\n{{Main|City of Heroes (comics)}}\nTo tie in with the game, NCsoft released two original comic book series that featured various characters from within the games themselves. The original series by publisher Blue King featured the heroes/roommates Apex and War Witch with their neighbor Horus. The later series from publisher Top Cow featured signature heroes and villains from both ''City of Heroes'' and ''City of Villains'' such as Statesman, Positron, Lord Recluse, and Ghost Widow, along with scripts by well-known comic book creators Mark Waid, Troy Hickman, and Dan Jurgens. Both series were originally free for subscribers to the games, but later they were provided for an extra subscription fee with the game and for free in digital format afterwards on the official ''City of Heroes'' website. The Blue King series ran for 12 issues, after which the Top Cow series ran for an additional 20 issues, ending in July 2007.\n\n===Collectible card game===\n{{Main|City of Heroes Collectible Card Game}}\n[[Alderac Entertainment Group]] also worked with ''CoH'' to create a [[collectible card game]] featuring characters from the game, as well as several original characters. The game's website also allowed players to create a game-compliant card for their own online character.\n\n===Role-playing game===\nThe ''City of Heroes'' team worked with [[Eden Studios, Inc.]] to create a [[tabletop role-playing game]] based on the game. While a free preview version of the game was released, the game was [[Development hell|indefinitely delayed]] due to the cancellation license with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on their ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (roleplaying game)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (role-playing game)|Angel]]'' role-playing games. Eden owner [[George Vasilakos]] later made a statement in 2008 that they were waiting on information from the copyright holders, but no news arose after this date.<ref name=\"forum post 02/21/200\">{{cite web | url = http://edenstudiosdiscussionboards.yuku.com/reply/41669/t/Huh-.html#reply-41669 | title = George Vasilakos mentions delay do to CoH/V ownership change |author=George Vasilakos | date = 2008-02-21 | accessdate = 2008-03-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407173540/http://edenstudiosdiscussionboards.yuku.com/reply/41669/t/Huh-.html#reply-41669 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Heroclix===\nThe various collector's editions of ''City of Heroes'' and ''City of Villains'' included exclusive [[HeroClix]] figures of signature characters from the game. These included Statesman (without a cape), Manticore, Ghost Widow, Lord Recluse, Positron, Black Scorpion and Mako. There was also a separate, Limited Edition version of Statesman wearing a cape.\n\n===Film and television===\nIn June 2007, it was announced that the producer for the ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' film, [[Tom DeSanto]], had acquired the option to make movies and television shows based on the ''City of Heroes'' franchise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=41833 |title=SCI FI Wire {{!}} The News Service of the SCI FI Channel {{!}} SCIFI.COM: DeSanto Develops ''Heroes'' Film |accessdate=2007-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709031916/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0 |archivedate=July 9, 2008 }}</ref> In February 2008, it was announced that DeSanto had indeed begun preparations for the film.

The suit sought unspecified damages and an injunction halting further sales and shutting down the game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-11-11-marvel-sues-over-avatars_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com&nbsp;\u2014 Marvel sues two companies over role-playing game|last=Veiga|first=Alex|agency=Associated Press | work=USA Today | date=November 11, 2004 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe game included in its [[Software license|user agreement]] strong language against such activity, however. It forbade the creation of potentially infringing characters, and NCI had been known to rename or \"genericize\" such characters. The User Agreement additionally held players accountable to indemnify (reimburse) NCI and its affiliates against third-party infringement claims, and demanded either a granting of sole ownership in player created content, including characters, to NCI, or a warranty that a third party owner of the rights in player created content had made such a grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsoft.com/en/legal/user-agreements/city-of-heroes-user-agreement.html|title=City of Heroes User Agreement|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120906193718/http://www.ncsoft.com/en/legal/user-agreements/city-of-heroes-user-agreement.html|archivedate=2012-09-06}}</ref> It was unclear whether this grant was an exclusive [[assignment (law)|assignment]] or a non-exclusive [[license]], however.\n\nThe defendants replied that the lawsuit was frivolous, and while many [[intellectual property]] analysts agreed, others noted that trademark law is structured such that, if Marvel believed their marks were being infringed upon, they had little choice but to file a lawsuit, regardless of its outcome, to preserve the strength of the marks. At least one noted similarities to ''Fonovisa, Inc. v. Cherry Auction, Inc.'', a case in which a company that ran a [[flea market]] was successfully sued over [[intellectual property infringement]] because a vendor had been selling [[copyright infringement|bootlegged]] records at that flea market. Although Cherry Auction had not been directly selling the infringing items, the court found that it was vicariously or contributorially liable for the infringement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nMarvel subsequently admitted<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/IP/Marvel_v_NCSoft/motion_to_dismiss_order.pdf|title=Defendants Motion to strike matter from plaintiffs second amended complaint and motion to dismiss same (Section IIIA)|author=Judge R.

The dismissed claims included all indirect [[trademark infringement]] counts, because Marvel had not [[pleading|pleaded]] commercial use of Marvel's marks by the game's players. Commercial use is a required element of infringement under American trademark statutes.\n\nOn December 12, 2005, all remaining claims were settled under undisclosed terms. The game's operators asserted that the settlement did not require changes to the character creation engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.ncsoft.com/en/news/press-releases/marvel-entertai.html|title=Marvel Entertainment, Inc., NCsoft Corporation, NC Interactive, Inc., Cryptic Studios, Inc.

The alliance surprised players, but developer Matt \"Positron\" Miller assured fans on Cryptic's official website that development and maintenance would continue separately on both games <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofheroes.com/news/archives/2006/09/letter_from_pos.html|title=Miller's article about the announcement|author=Matt Miller|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521194100/http://www.cityofheroes.com/news/archives/2006/09/letter_from_pos.html|archivedate=May 21, 2007}}</ref>{{Dead link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521194100/http://www.cityofheroes.com/news/archives/2006/09/letter_from_pos.html|date=July 2009}}, proved later by the complete split between ''City of Heroes'' and Cryptic Studios. Marvel Universe Online was eventually cancelled by Microsoft.\n\n==Acquisition and new studio==\nOn November 6, 2007, NCsoft announced that it would assume ownership of both ''City of Heroes'' and ''City of Villains''. As part of a push to further develop ''City of Heroes'', the company also announced the formation of a new development studio dedicated to new titles as well as their interest in distributing and administering their future works once launched. This new team was centered on key members of the Cryptic and NCsoft ''City of Heroes/Villains'' teams who accepted the NCsoft offer to join their new studio in Northern California. The sale of the City of Heroes IP granted Cryptic Studios the freedom to work on its new superhero MMORPG (at this time, an RPG/Action hybrid) ''[[Champions Online]]'' without concerns of conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite web|title=NCsoft Announces New Studio in North California; Takes Full Ownership of Successful City of Heroes Property |url=http://www.ncsoft.com/eng/NCPress/View.asp?hSeq=1 |publisher=NCsoft |accessdate=2007-11-06 |format=\u2013<sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=intitle%3ANCsoft+Announces+New+Studio+in+North+California%3B+Takes+Full+Ownership+of+Successful+City+of+Heroes+Property&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041054/http://www.ncsoft.com/eng/NCPress/View.asp?hseq=1 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nShortly after having acquired full ownership of the property, NCsoft granted all existing and former ''City of Heroes'' account holders access to both games (''City of Heroes'' and''City of Villains'').<ref>[http://www.cityofheroes.com/press/a_new_age.html City of Heroes Community Site<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213000606/http://www.cityofheroes.com/press/a_new_age.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}</ref> This allowed all Hero players access to Superbases, which initially required a ''CoV'' purchase from its release in Issue 7 until Issue 10, and was no longer required as of Issue 11. Before the purchase, NCsoft allowed players with a subscription or a time card for ''City of Heroes'' to have the same access to ''City of Villains'' as well (at its lowest price point, $14.99 covered access to both titles for a month), whether or not they had purchased the other title. This was still being honored after all accounts who had only ''City of Heroes'' received access to ''City of Villains'' for free. In a July 2008 press release, NCsoft announced the successful completion of allowing all copies of ''City of Heroes'' or ''City of Villains'' to access the other game (it claimed that Single Title Retail Boxes recently purchased did not successfully unlock the other game when activated).\n\nOn April 14, 2009, NCsoft NorCal formally changed its name to [[Paragon Studios]] to become a fully owned developer subsidiary of [[NCsoft]] (similar to [[Destination Games]] and [[ArenaNet]]) dedicated to ''City of Heroes''. Paragon Studios was credited alongside Cryptic Studios on the website and NCsoft websites for development of the game.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==General references==\n*''City of Heroes, PRIMA Official Game Guide'', Chris McCubbin and Christopher Pinckard, Prima Games (2004). {{ISBN|0-7615-4516-6}}\n*''City of Heroes Binder, PRIMA Official Game Guide'', Eric Mylonis, Prima Games (2005), {{ISBN|0-7615-5205-7}}\n*''City of Heroes/City of Villains Bind, Macro & Emote Guide'', \"Shenanigunner\" (2006\u20132009, updated regularly)\n\n==External links==\n<!--External links to fansites should generally be avoided unless written by a recognized authority.
