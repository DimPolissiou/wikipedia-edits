She was the vocalist for the band [[Deee-Lite]], followed by a career as a DJ and solo songwriter. She is also known widely for her social, environmental, and human-rights activism.\n\n==Music career==\n===Deee-Lite===\nIn 1986, Kirby met Ukrainian-born Dmitry Brill (\"Supa DJ Dmitry\") in New York, when she made him silver platform boots and a glitter blue spacesuit for his band, Shazork. That same year, she began experimenting with singing and writing music with Brill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Deee-Lite.html|title=Deee-Lite Biography: OLDIES.com|publisher=Oldies.com |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nShortly after their first show in 1986, Brill was introduced to [[Towa Tei]], a Japan-raised Korean DJ who Kirby and Brill invited to join the band several years later. Combining Kirby's vocal and writing talents with Brill's sampling skills and Tei's techno mixing, the three formed the band [[Deee-Lite]]. They had performances every month, with Kier designing new costumes for each one. When the band signed a seven-album deal with [[Elektra Records]] she stopped go-go dancing, which she previously had continued to do at Bentleys and The Copa.\n\nDeee-Lite's sound was a mix of [[house music|house]], [[techno]] and [[Electronic dance music|dance]] elements. Deee-Lite shot to stardom in 1990 with the release of their first album ''[[World Clique]]'' and the hit \"[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\". In [[1991 MTV Video Music Awards|1991]], MTV nominated Deee-Lite for several Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best Dance Video, Best New Artist, Best Breakthrough Video, and Best Editing in a Video.\n\nKirby was very involved in the band's output: writing, producing, and performing the bulk of the band's songs. Known as much for their outrageous personae and costumes as for their music, the three took on larger-than-life alter-egos: Super DJ Dmitri, Jungle DJ Towa Towa, and Lady Miss Kier. Kirby is credited with designing and creating the look of the band, as well as much of the artwork accompanying the band's albums and marketing material. Her initial look relied on revamped and exaggerated retro '60s fashions. Her signature look was a zip-up catsuit, platform shoes and flipped hair-do.\n\nDeee-Lite followed their successful first album with ''[[Infinity Within]]'', a politically charged second album, in 1992. Their third album ''[[Dewdrops in the Garden]]'' was released in 1994 and saw a return to house roots with a new, more naturalistic tone.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Neither of the two follow-up albums matched the commercial success of their debut. The second and third albums were hampered by difficulties with the label, which refused to promote, support touring, or fund contractual videos.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The band functionally broke up during the writing of their third album in 1993, but Kirby and Brill decided to finish the project and tour together to promote the album before going their separate ways. In 1996, a remix album was released, and a greatest hits album was released in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/lady-miss-kier/2006/02/13/1139679507664.html |title=Lady Miss Kier \u2013 Gig Reviews \u2013 Music \u2013 Entertainment|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===International DJ and songwriting solo career===\nBrill and Kirby's relationship fractured, and Deee-lite disbanded in 1995.<ref name=\"Smh.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/lady-miss-kier/2006/02/13/1139679507664.html?page=2 |title=Lady Miss Kier \u2013 Gig Reviews \u2013 Music \u2013 Entertainment|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref> \"When Dmitry and I split up, that was the end of the band,\" Kirby said. \"It was sad because I loved the band.

She was the vocalist for the band [[Deee-Lite]], followed by a career as a DJ and solo songwriter. She is also known widely for her social, environmental, and human-rights activism.\n\n==Music career==\n===Deee-Lite===\nIn 1986, Kirby met Ukrainian-born Dmitry Brill (\"Supa DJ Dmitry\") in New York, when she made him silver platform boots and a glitter blue spacesuit for his band, Shazork. That same year, she began experimenting with singing and writing music with Brill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Deee-Lite.html|title=Deee-Lite Biography: OLDIES.com|publisher=Oldies.com |accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nShortly after their first show in 1986, Brill was introduced to [[Towa Tei]], a Japan-raised Korean DJ who Kirby and Brill invited to join the band several years later. Combining Kirby's vocal and writing talents with Brill's sampling skills and Tei's techno mixing, the three formed the band [[Deee-Lite]]. They had performances every month, with Kier designing new costumes for each one. When the band signed a seven-album deal with [[Elektra Records]] she stopped go-go dancing, which she previously had continued to do at Bentleys and The Copa.\n\nDeee-Lite's sound was a mix of [[house music|house]], [[techno]] and [[Electronic dance music|dance]] elements. Deee-Lite shot to stardom in 1990 with the release of their first album ''[[World Clique]]'' and the hit \"[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\". In [[1991 MTV Video Music Awards|1991]], MTV nominated Deee-Lite for several Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year, Best Dance Video, Best New Artist, Best Breakthrough Video, and Best Editing in a Video.\n\nKirby was very involved in the band's output: writing, producing, and performing the bulk of the band's songs. Known as much for their outrageous personae and costumes as for their music, the three took on larger-than-life alter-egos: Super DJ Dmitri, Jungle DJ Towa Towa, and Lady Miss Kier. Kirby is credited with designing and creating the look of the band, as well as much of the artwork accompanying the band's albums and marketing material. Her initial look relied on revamped and exaggerated retro '60s fashions. Her signature look was a zip-up catsuit, platform shoes and flipped hair-do.\n\nDeee-Lite followed their successful first album with ''[[Infinity Within]]'', a politically charged second album, in 1992. Their third album ''[[Dewdrops in the Garden]]'' was released in 1994 and saw a return to house roots with a new, more naturalistic tone.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Neither of the two follow-up albums matched the commercial success of their debut. The second and third albums were hampered by difficulties with the label, which refused to promote, support touring, or fund contractual videos.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The band functionally broke up during the writing of their third album in 1993, but Kirby and Brill decided to finish the project and tour together to promote the album before going their separate ways. In 1996, a remix album was released, and a greatest hits album was released in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/lady-miss-kier/2006/02/13/1139679507664.html |title=Lady Miss Kier \u2013 Gig Reviews \u2013 Music \u2013 Entertainment|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===International DJ and songwriting solo career===\nBrill and Kirby's relationship fractured, and Deee-lite disbanded in 1995.<ref name=\"Smh.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/lady-miss-kier/2006/02/13/1139679507664.html?page=2 |title=Lady Miss Kier \u2013 Gig Reviews \u2013 Music \u2013 Entertainment|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2008}}</ref> \"When Dmitry and I split up, that was the end of the band,\" Kirby said. \"It was sad because I loved the band.

Warren enlisted [[Paul Revere]] and [[William Dawes]] on April 18, 1775, to leave Boston and spread the alarm that the British garrison in Boston was setting out to raid the town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] and arrest rebel leaders [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]]. Warren participated in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] the following day, which are commonly considered to be the opening engagements of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=AMB>{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Warren, Joseph}}</ref>\n\nWarren had been commissioned a [[major general]] in the colony's militia shortly before the June 17, 1775 [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. Rather than exercising his rank, Warren chose to serve in the battle as a [[private (military)|private]] soldier, and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the [[redoubt]] atop [[Breed's Hill]]. His death, immortalized in [[John Trumbull]]'s painting, ''[[The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775]]'', galvanized the rebel forces. He has been memorialized in the naming of many towns, counties, streets, and other locations in the [[United States]], by statues, and in numerous other ways.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:1826 JosephWarren BostonMonthlyMag v2 no1.png|thumb|left|upright|Portrait from ''[[Boston Monthly Magazine]]'', 1826]]\nJoseph Warren was born in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], to Joseph Warren and Mary (n\u00e9e Stevens). His father was a respected farmer who died in October 1755 when he fell off a ladder while gathering fruit in his orchard. After attending the [[Roxbury Latin School]], Joseph enrolled in [[Harvard College]], graduating in 1759, and then taught for about a year at Roxbury Latin.<ref>Frothingham 1865, pp. 12\u201313. The book's description of \"the grammar school in Roxbury\" appears to indicate [[Roxbury Latin School]].</ref> He studied medicine and married 18-year-old heiress Elizabeth Hooten on September 6, 1764. She died in 1773, leaving him with four children: Elizabeth, Joseph, Mary, and Richard.<ref>Frothingham 1865, p. 558.</ref> Before his death in 1775, he was engaged to Mercy Scollay.<ref>[http://www.drjosephwarren.com/2013/02/miss-mercy-scollay-is-john-singleton-copley%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98lady-in-a-blue-dress%E2%80%99/ Mercy Scollary is Copley's \"Lady in a Blue Dress]</ref>\n\nWhile practicing medicine and surgery in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], he became involved in politics, associating with [[John Hancock]], [[Samuel Adams]], and other leaders of the broad movement labeled [[Sons of Liberty]]. Warren conducted an autopsy on the body of young [[Christopher Seider]] in February 1770, and was a member of the Boston committee that assembled a report on the following month's [[Boston Massacre]]. Earlier, in 1768, Royal officials tried to place his publishers Edes and Gill on trial for an incendiary newspaper essay Warren wrote under the pseudonym ''A True Patriot'', but no local jury would indict them.{{sfn|Forman|2012|loc=Chapter 10}}\n\nIn 1774, he authored a song, \"Free America\", which was published in colonial newspapers. The poem was set to a traditional British tune, \"[[The British Grenadiers]].\"<ref>Silverman, Jerry. \"Of Thee I Sing,\" Citadel Press, 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\nJoseph Warren joined the [[Scottish Rite Freemasonry]], being initiated in the St. Andrew's Lodge, and later became Past Provincial [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.matawanlodge.org/famous.htm | title = U.S. Famous Freemasons | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510153526/http://www.matawanlodge.org/famous.htm | archive-date = May 10, 2008 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://mastermason.com/PGH32/famousmasons.html | title = U.S. Famous Master Mason | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160104173702/http://mastermason.com/PGH32/famousmasons.html | archive-date = Jan 4, 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n==Lexington and Concord==\n[[File:WarrenPutnam.jpg|thumb|Warren (right) offering to serve General [[Israel Putnam]] as a private before the Battle of Bunker Hill]] hello there\n\nAs Boston's conflict with the royal government came to a head in 1773\u201375, Warren was appointed to the Boston [[Committee of Correspondence]]. He twice delivered orations in commemoration of the Massacre, the second time in March 1775 while the town was occupied by army troops. Warren drafted the [[Suffolk Resolves]], which were endorsed by the [[Continental Congress]], to advocate resistance to Parliament's [[Coercive Acts]], which were otherwise known as the Intolerable Acts. He was appointed President of the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]], the highest position in the revolutionary government.\n\nIn mid-April 1775, Warren and Dr. [[Benjamin Church (physician)|Benjamin Church]] were the two top members of the Committee of Correspondence left in Boston. On the afternoon of April 18, the British troops in the town mobilized for a long-planned raid on the nearby town of Concord, and already before nightfall word of mouth had spread knowledge of the mobilization widely within Boston. It had been known to rebel leadership for weeks that General Gage in Boston had plans to destroy munitions stored in Concord by the colonials, and it was also known that they would be taking a route through Lexington. Some unsupported stories{{sfn|Fischer|1994|p=95\u201397}} argue that Warren received additional information from a highly placed informant (usually claiming it was from [[Margaret Kemble Gage]], the wife of General [[Thomas Gage]]) that the troops had orders to arrest [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Hancock]]. However, there is little evidence of this as the troops apparently had no such orders. Regardless, Warren learned there was some British expedition likely to begin that night, and so sent [[William Dawes]] and [[Paul Revere]] on their famous \"midnight rides\" to warn Hancock and Adams in Lexington. (There is growing consensus in new scholarship that Mrs. Gage never did conspire against the British and that Warren needed no informant to deduce that the British were mobilizing.{{sfn|Journal of the American Revolution: \"Dr. Joseph Warren's Informant\" (April 3, 2014) https://allthingsliberty.com/2014/04/dr-joseph-warrens-informant/}})\n\nWarren slipped out of Boston early on April 19, and during that day's [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]], he coordinated and led militia into the fight alongside [[William Heath]] as the British Army returned to Boston. When the enemy were returning from Concord, he was among the foremost in hanging upon their rear and assailing their flanks. During this fighting Warren was nearly killed, a musket ball striking part of his wig. When his mother saw him after the battle and heard of his escape, she entreated him with tears again not to risk life so precious. \"Where danger is, dear mother,\" he answered, \"there must your son be. Now is no time for any of America's children to shrink from any hazard. I will set her free or die.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He then turned to recruiting and organizing soldiers for the [[Siege of Boston]], promulgating the Patriots' version of events, and negotiating with Gen. Gage in his role as head of the Provincial Congress.\n\n==Death==\n[[File: The death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill]]'' by [[John Trumbull]] (1786)]]\nWarren was commissioned as a [[major general]] by the Provincial Congress on June 14, 1775.  Several days later, in the moments before the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], Warren arrived where the militia was forming and asked where the heaviest fighting would be; General [[Israel Putnam]] pointed to [[Breed's Hill]].  Warren volunteered to join the fighting as a [[private (rank)|private]] against the wishes of General Putnam and Colonel [[William Prescott]], both of whom requested that he serve as their commander. Warren declined the command in the belief that Putnam and Prescott were more experienced with war. He was among those inspiring the men to hold rank against superior numbers. Warren was known to have repeatedly declared of the British:  \"These fellows say we won't fight! By Heaven, I hope I shall die up to my knees in blood!\"{{sfn|Tourtellot|1959|p=213}} He fought in the redoubt until out of ammunition and remained until the British made their third and final assault on the hill to give time for the militia to escape. He was killed instantly by a musket or pistol ball in the head by a British officer (possibly [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lieutenant Lord Rawdon]]) who recognized him, or by an officer's servant.  This account is supported by a 2011 forensic analysis.<ref>{{YouTube|DdggCICMnkU|Samuel A.

Warren enlisted [[Paul Revere]] and [[William Dawes]] on April 18, 1775, to leave Boston and spread the alarm that the British garrison in Boston was setting out to raid the town of [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] and arrest rebel leaders [[John Hancock]] and [[Samuel Adams]]. Warren participated in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] the following day, which are commonly considered to be the opening engagements of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=AMB>{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Warren, Joseph}}</ref>\n\nWarren had been commissioned a [[major general]] in the colony's militia shortly before the June 17, 1775 [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. Rather than exercising his rank, Warren chose to serve in the battle as a [[private (military)|private]] soldier, and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the [[redoubt]] atop [[Breed's Hill]]. His death, immortalized in [[John Trumbull]]'s painting, ''[[The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775]]'', galvanized the rebel forces. He has been memorialized in the naming of many towns, counties, streets, and other locations in the [[United States]], by statues, and in numerous other ways.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:1826 JosephWarren BostonMonthlyMag v2 no1.png|thumb|left|upright|Portrait from ''[[Boston Monthly Magazine]]'', 1826]]\nJoseph Warren was born in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], to Joseph Warren and Mary (n\u00e9e Stevens). His father was a respected farmer who died in October 1755 when he fell off a ladder while gathering fruit in his orchard. After attending the [[Roxbury Latin School]], Joseph enrolled in [[Harvard College]], graduating in 1759, and then taught for about a year at Roxbury Latin.<ref>Frothingham 1865, pp. 12\u201313. The book's description of \"the grammar school in Roxbury\" appears to indicate [[Roxbury Latin School]].</ref> He studied medicine and married 18-year-old heiress Elizabeth Hooten on September 6, 1764. She died in 1773, leaving him with four children: Elizabeth, Joseph, Mary, and Richard.<ref>Frothingham 1865, p. 558.</ref> Before his death in 1775, he was engaged to Mercy Scollay.<ref>[http://www.drjosephwarren.com/2013/02/miss-mercy-scollay-is-john-singleton-copley%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98lady-in-a-blue-dress%E2%80%99/ Mercy Scollary is Copley's \"Lady in a Blue Dress]</ref>\n\nWhile practicing medicine and surgery in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], he became involved in politics, associating with [[John Hancock]], [[Samuel Adams]], and other leaders of the broad movement labeled [[Sons of Liberty]]. Warren conducted an autopsy on the body of young [[Christopher Seider]] in February 1770, and was a member of the Boston committee that assembled a report on the following month's [[Boston Massacre]]. Earlier, in 1768, Royal officials tried to place his publishers Edes and Gill on trial for an incendiary newspaper essay Warren wrote under the pseudonym ''A True Patriot'', but no local jury would indict them.{{sfn|Forman|2012|loc=Chapter 10}}\n\nIn 1774, he authored a song, \"Free America\", which was published in colonial newspapers. The poem was set to a traditional British tune, \"[[The British Grenadiers]].\"<ref>Silverman, Jerry. \"Of Thee I Sing,\" Citadel Press, 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\nJoseph Warren joined the [[Scottish Rite Freemasonry]], being initiated in the St. Andrew's Lodge, and later became Past Provincial [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.matawanlodge.org/famous.htm | title = U.S. Famous Freemasons | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080510153526/http://www.matawanlodge.org/famous.htm | archive-date = May 10, 2008 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://mastermason.com/PGH32/famousmasons.html | title = U.S. Famous Master Mason | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160104173702/http://mastermason.com/PGH32/famousmasons.html | archive-date = Jan 4, 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n==Lexington and Concord==\n[[File:WarrenPutnam.jpg|thumb|Warren (right) offering to serve General [[Israel Putnam]] as a private before the Battle of Bunker Hill]]\n\nAs Boston's conflict with the royal government came to a head in 1773\u201375, Warren was appointed to the Boston [[Committee of Correspondence]]. He twice delivered orations in commemoration of the Massacre, the second time in March 1775 while the town was occupied by army troops. Warren drafted the [[Suffolk Resolves]], which were endorsed by the [[Continental Congress]], to advocate resistance to Parliament's [[Coercive Acts]], which were otherwise known as the Intolerable Acts. He was appointed President of the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]], the highest position in the revolutionary government.\n\nIn mid-April 1775, Warren and Dr. [[Benjamin Church (physician)|Benjamin Church]] were the two top members of the Committee of Correspondence left in Boston. On the afternoon of April 18, the British troops in the town mobilized for a long-planned raid on the nearby town of Concord, and already before nightfall word of mouth had spread knowledge of the mobilization widely within Boston. It had been known to rebel leadership for weeks that General Gage in Boston had plans to destroy munitions stored in Concord by the colonials, and it was also known that they would be taking a route through Lexington. Some unsupported stories{{sfn|Fischer|1994|p=95\u201397}} argue that Warren received additional information from a highly placed informant (usually claiming it was from [[Margaret Kemble Gage]], the wife of General [[Thomas Gage]]) that the troops had orders to arrest [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Hancock]]. However, there is little evidence of this as the troops apparently had no such orders. Regardless, Warren learned there was some British expedition likely to begin that night, and so sent [[William Dawes]] and [[Paul Revere]] on their famous \"midnight rides\" to warn Hancock and Adams in Lexington. (There is growing consensus in new scholarship that Mrs. Gage never did conspire against the British and that Warren needed no informant to deduce that the British were mobilizing.{{sfn|Journal of the American Revolution: \"Dr. Joseph Warren's Informant\" (April 3, 2014) https://allthingsliberty.com/2014/04/dr-joseph-warrens-informant/}})\n\nWarren slipped out of Boston early on April 19, and during that day's [[Battle of Lexington and Concord]], he coordinated and led militia into the fight alongside [[William Heath]] as the British Army returned to Boston. When the enemy were returning from Concord, he was among the foremost in hanging upon their rear and assailing their flanks. During this fighting Warren was nearly killed, a musket ball striking part of his wig. When his mother saw him after the battle and heard of his escape, she entreated him with tears again not to risk life so precious. \"Where danger is, dear mother,\" he answered, \"there must your son be. Now is no time for any of America's children to shrink from any hazard. I will set her free or die.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He then turned to recruiting and organizing soldiers for the [[Siege of Boston]], promulgating the Patriots' version of events, and negotiating with Gen. Gage in his role as head of the Provincial Congress.\n\n==Death==\n[[File: The death of general warren at the battle of bunker hill.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker Hill]]'' by [[John Trumbull]] (1786)]]\nWarren was commissioned as a [[major general]] by the Provincial Congress on June 14, 1775.  Several days later, in the moments before the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]], Warren arrived where the militia was forming and asked where the heaviest fighting would be; General [[Israel Putnam]] pointed to [[Breed's Hill]].  Warren volunteered to join the fighting as a [[private (rank)|private]] against the wishes of General Putnam and Colonel [[William Prescott]], both of whom requested that he serve as their commander. Warren declined the command in the belief that Putnam and Prescott were more experienced with war. He was among those inspiring the men to hold rank against superior numbers. Warren was known to have repeatedly declared of the British:  \"These fellows say we won't fight! By Heaven, I hope I shall die up to my knees in blood!\"{{sfn|Tourtellot|1959|p=213}} He fought in the redoubt until out of ammunition and remained until the British made their third and final assault on the hill to give time for the militia to escape. He was killed instantly by a musket or pistol ball in the head by a British officer (possibly [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lieutenant Lord Rawdon]]) who recognized him, or by an officer's servant.  This account is supported by a 2011 forensic analysis.<ref>{{YouTube|DdggCICMnkU|Samuel A.
