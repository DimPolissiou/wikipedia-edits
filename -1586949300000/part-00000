{"title_page": "Bidet", "text_new": "{{short description|plumbing fixture or type of sink intended for washing the genitalia and anus of the human body}}\n[[File:Bidet Ego Kolo.jpg|thumb|A modern bidet]]\n[[File:Bidet weiss.jpg|thumb|A modern bidet of the traditional type]]\n\nA '''bidet''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-bidet.ogg|us|b|\u1d7b|\u02c8|d|e\u026a}} or {{IPAc-en|uk|\u02c8|b|i\u02d0|d|e\u026a}}) is a bowl or receptacle designed to be sat on for the purpose of [[washing]] the human [[Sex organ|genitalia]], [[perineum]], inner [[buttocks]], and [[human anus|anus]]. The modern variety includes a plumbed-in water supply and a drainage opening, and is thus a type of [[plumbing fixture]] subject to local hygiene regulations. The bidet is designed to promote personal hygiene, and is used after defecation, and before and after sexual intercourse. In several European countries, a bidet is today required by law to be present in every bathroom containing a [[toilet|toilet bowl]]. It was originally located in the bedroom, near the chamber-pot and the marital bed, but in modern times is located near the toilet bowl in the bathroom. Fixtures that combine a [[toilet seat]] with a washing facility include the [[electronic bidet]]. \n\nOpinions as to the necessity of the bidet vary widely over different nationalities and cultures, with anglophone nations traditionally shunning it and finding its mere existence a notorious and proverbial source of personal embarrassment and bewilderment. To those world cultures which use it habitually, such as the Islamic world, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Europe and the French, it is an essential and indispensable tool in maintaining good personal hygiene. \"Bidet\" is a [[French language|French]] [[loanword]] meaning \"little horse\" due to the [[List of human positions#Riding positions|straddling position]] adopted in its usage.\n\n==Applications==\nBidets are primarily used to wash and clean the genitalia, perineum, inner buttocks, and anus. Some bidets have a vertical jet intended to give easy access for washing and rinsing the perineum and anal area. The traditional separate bidet is like a wash-basin which is filled with clean water, and may then used for many other purposes such as washing feet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/01/why-wont-prudish-brits-recognise-the-bidets-brilliance |title=Why won't prudish Brits recognise the bidet's brilliance? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 May 2017 |author=Michelle Hanson |accessdate= 13 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28237337 |title=The imaginative ways readers use bidets|website=BBC |date=15 July 2014  |author= |accessdate= 13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Bidet shower ===\n{{main|Bidet shower}}\n[[File:Bidee shower.jpg|upright|thumb|A Finnish bidet shower]]\nA [[bidet shower]] (also known as \"bidet spray\", \"bidet sprayer\", or \"health faucet\") is a hand-held triggered nozzle, similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer, that delivers a spray of water to assist in [[anal cleansing]] and cleaning the genitals after defecation and urination. In contrast to a bidet that is integrated with the toilet, a bidet shower has to be held by the hands, and cleaning does not take place automatically. Bidet showers are common in countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing.\n\nDrawbacks include the possibility of wetting a user's clothing if used carelessly. In addition, a user must be reasonably mobile and flexible to use a hand-held bidet shower.\n\n=== Conventional or standalone bidet===\n[[File:Bidet side.jpg|thumb|upright|A 20th century standalone bidet (foreground)]]\nA bidet is a plumbing fixture that is installed as a separate unit in the bathroom besides toilet, shower and sink, which users have to straddle. Some bidets resemble a large hand basin, with taps and a stopper so they can be filled up; other designs have a [[nozzle]] that squirts a jet of water to aid in cleansing.\n\n===  Add-on bidets  ===\n[[File:SB-BidetIntegrated.jpg|thumb|237px|An add-on bidet.]]\nThere are bidets that are attachable to toilet bowls, saving space and without the need to plumb in an additional unit. A bidet may be a movable or fixed nozzle attached to an existing toilet on back or side toilet rim, or replacing the toilet seat. In these cases, their use is restricted to cleaning the anus and genitals. Some bidets of this type produce a vertical water jet and others a more-or-less oblique one. Other bidets have one nozzle on the side rim aimed at both anal and genital areas, and other designs have two nozzles on the back rim. The shorter one, called the \"family nozzle\", is used for washing the area around the anus, and the longer one (\"bidet nozzle\") is designed for washing the vulva.\n\nSuch attachable bidets (also called \"combined toilets\", \"bidet attachments\", or \"add-on bidets\") are controlled either mechanically, by turning a valve, or electronically. Electronic bidets are controlled with waterproof electrical switches rather than a manual valve. There are models that have a [[Electrical element|heating element]] which blows warm air to dry the user after washing, that offer heated seats, wireless [[remote control]]s, illumination through built in [[night light]]s, or built in [[deodorizer]]s and [[activated carbon]] filters to remove odors. Further refinements include adjustable water pressure, temperature compensation, and directional spray control. Where bathroom appearance is of concern, under-the-seat mounting types have become more popular.\n\nAn add-on bidet typically connects to the existing water supply of a toilet via the addition of a [[Piping and plumbing fitting#Tee|threaded tee pipe adapter]], and requires no [[soldering]] or other [[plumbing]] work.<ref name=\"Manjoo\" /> Electronic add-on bidets also require a [[GFCI]] protected grounded electrical outlet.\n\n==Usage and health ==\nPersonal hygiene is improved and maintained more accurately and easily with the use of both toilet paper and a bidet as compared to the use of toilet paper alone.<ref>{{cite news |last= Rickett |first= Oscar |date= 11 February 2018 |title= The bottom line: why it's time the bidet made a comeback |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/11/the-bottom-line-why-its-time-the-bidet-made-a-comeback |work= The Guardian |access-date= 29 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cohen-Mansfield |first1=J. |last2=Biddison |first2=J.

Combined toilet/bidet installations make self-care toileting possible for many people, affording greater independence. There are often special units with higher toilet seats allowing easier [[wheelchair|wheelchair transfer]], and with some form of electronic remote control that benefits an individual with limited mobility or otherwise requiring assistance.\n\nBidets are common bathroom fixtures in the [[Arab world]], [[West Africa]], [[Southern Europe|southern European countries]], Italy (the installation of a bidet in a bathroom has been mandatory since 1975<ref>''Decreto ministeriale Sanit\u00e0'', 5 July 1975, art. 7.</ref>), Spain (but in recent times new or renewed houses tend to have bathrooms without bidets, except the luxurious ones<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/suplementos/magazine/2009/519/1251984079.html |title=\u00bfHa llegado el final del bid\u00e9? |author=Juan Carlos Rodr\u00edguez |date=6 September 2009 |language=es |website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |access-date=22 December 2016}}</ref>), and Portugal (installation is mandatory since 1975).<ref>[https://dre.pt/application/file/310347 Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 650/75 de 18 de Novembro] (in Portuguese), 18 November 1975, art. 84</ref> They are also found in Southern Eastern Europe in countries like Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Greece.

The modern variety includes a plumbed-in water supply and a drainage opening, and is thus a type of [[plumbing fixture]] subject to local hygiene regulations. The bidet is designed to promote personal hygiene, and is used after defecation, and before and after sexual intercourse. In several European countries, a bidet is today required by law to be present in every bathroom containing a [[toilet|toilet bowl]]. It was originally located in the bedroom, near the chamber-pot and the marital bed, but in modern times is located near the toilet bowl in the bathroom. Fixtures that combine a [[toilet seat]] with a washing facility include the [[electronic bidet]]. \n\nOpinions as to the necessity of the bidet vary widely over different nationalities and cultures, with anglophone nations traditionally shunning it and finding its mere existence a notorious and proverbial source of personal embarrassment and bewilderment. To those world cultures which use it habitually, such as the Islamic world, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Europe and the French, it is an essential and indispensable tool in maintaining good personal hygiene. \"Bidet\" is a [[French language|French]] [[loanword]] meaning \"little horse\" due to the [[List of human positions#Riding positions|straddling position]] adopted in its usage.\n\n==Applications==\nBidets are primarily used to wash and clean the genitalia, perineum, inner buttocks, and anus. Some bidets have a vertical jet intended to give easy access for washing and rinsing the perineum and anal area. The traditional separate bidet is like a wash-basin which is filled with clean water, and may then used for many other purposes such as washing feet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/01/why-wont-prudish-brits-recognise-the-bidets-brilliance |title=Why won't prudish Brits recognise the bidet's brilliance? |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 May 2017 |author=Michelle Hanson |accessdate= 13 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-28237337 |title=The imaginative ways readers use bidets|website=BBC |date=15 July 2014  |author= |accessdate= 13 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Bidet shower ===\n{{main|Bidet shower}}\n[[File:Bidee shower.jpg|upright|thumb|A Finnish bidet shower]]\nA [[bidet shower]] (also known as \"bidet spray\", \"bidet sprayer\", or \"health faucet\") is a hand-held triggered nozzle, similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer, that delivers a spray of water to assist in [[anal cleansing]] and cleaning the genitals after defecation and urination. In contrast to a bidet that is integrated with the toilet, a bidet shower has to be held by the hands, and cleaning does not take place automatically. Bidet showers are common in countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing.\n\nDrawbacks include the possibility of wetting a user's clothing if used carelessly. In addition, a user must be reasonably mobile and flexible to use a hand-held bidet shower.\n\n=== Conventional or standalone bidet===\n[[File:Bidet side.jpg|thumb|upright|A 20th century standalone bidet (foreground)]]\nA bidet is a plumbing fixture that is installed as a separate unit in the bathroom besides toilet, shower and sink, which users have to straddle. Some bidets resemble a large hand basin, with taps and a stopper so they can be filled up; other designs have a [[nozzle]] that squirts a jet of water to aid in cleansing.\n\n===  Add-on bidets  ===\n[[File:SB-BidetIntegrated.jpg|thumb|237px|An add-on bidet.]]\nThere are bidets that are attachable to toilet bowls, saving space and without the need to plumb in an additional unit. A bidet may be a movable or fixed nozzle attached to an existing toilet on back or side toilet rim, or replacing the toilet seat. In these cases, their use is restricted to cleaning the anus and genitals. Some bidets of this type produce a vertical water jet and others a more-or-less oblique one. Other bidets have one nozzle on the side rim aimed at both anal and genital areas, and other designs have two nozzles on the back rim. The shorter one, called the \"family nozzle\", is used for washing the area around the anus, and the longer one (\"bidet nozzle\") is designed for washing the vulva.\n\nSuch attachable bidets (also called \"combined toilets\", \"bidet attachments\", or \"add-on bidets\") are controlled either mechanically, by turning a valve, or electronically. Electronic bidets are controlled with waterproof electrical switches rather than a manual valve. There are models that have a [[Electrical element|heating element]] which blows warm air to dry the user after washing, that offer heated seats, wireless [[remote control]]s, illumination through built in [[night light]]s, or built in [[deodorizer]]s and [[activated carbon]] filters to remove odors. Further refinements include adjustable water pressure, temperature compensation, and directional spray control. Where bathroom appearance is of concern, under-the-seat mounting types have become more popular.\n\nAn add-on bidet typically connects to the existing water supply of a toilet via the addition of a [[Piping and plumbing fitting#Tee|threaded tee pipe adapter]], and requires no [[soldering]] or other [[plumbing]] work.<ref name=\"Manjoo\" /> Electronic add-on bidets also require a [[GFCI]] protected grounded electrical outlet.\n\n==Usage and health ==\nPersonal hygiene is improved and maintained more accurately and easily with the use of both toilet paper and a bidet as compared to the use of toilet paper alone.<ref>{{cite news |last= Rickett |first= Oscar |date= 11 February 2018 |title= The bottom line: why it's time the bidet made a comeback |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/feb/11/the-bottom-line-why-its-time-the-bidet-made-a-comeback |work= The Guardian |access-date= 29 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cohen-Mansfield |first1=J. |last2=Biddison |first2=J.

The acronym OPG is Organized Criminal (''Prestupnaya'' in Russian) Group, used to refer to any of the Russian mafia groups, sometimes modified with a specific name, e.g. Orekhovskaya OPG. Sometimes the initialism is translated and OCG is used.\n\nOrganized crime in Russia began in the imperial period of the [[tsar]]s, but it was not until the Soviet era that ''[[Thief in law|vory v zakone]]'' (\"thieves-in-law\") emerged as leaders of prison groups in [[Gulag|forced labor camps]], and their honor code became more defined. With the end of [[World War II]], the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Joseph Stalin]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], more gangs emerged in a flourishing [[black market]], exploiting the unstable governments of the former Republics, and at its highest point, even controlling as much as two-thirds of the Russian economy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Louis Freeh]], former director of the [[FBI]], said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to [[National Security of the United States|U.S. national security]] in the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"Freeh\" />\n\nIn modern times, there are as many as 6,000 different groups,<ref name=\"fas.org\" /> with more than 200 of them having a global reach. Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members, corrupt officials and business leaders, people with ethnic ties, or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders.{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> In December 2009, Timur Lakhonin, the head of the Russian National Central Bureau of [[Interpol]], stated \"Certainly, there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad, but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad\",<ref name=\"Lakhonin\" /> while in August 2010, [[Alain Bauer]], a French criminologist, said that it \"is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation.\"<ref name=\"Bauer\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Russian criminality can be traced back to Russia's [[Russian Empire|imperial period]], which began in the 1720s, in the form of banditry and thievery. Most of the population were [[peasants]], in poverty at the time, and criminals who stole from government entities and divided profits among the people earned [[Robin Hood]]-like status, being viewed as protectors of the poor and becoming [[folk heroes]]. In time, the ''Vorovskoy Mir'' (Thieves' World) emerged as these criminals grouped and started their own code of conduct that was based on strict loyalty with one another and opposition against the government. When the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] came around in 1917, the Thieves' World was alive and active. [[Vladimir Lenin]] attempted to wipe them out, but failed, and the criminals survived into [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reign.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\n===1917\u20131991: Soviet era===\nDuring Stalin's reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to ''[[gulag]]s'' (Soviet labor camps), where powerful criminals worked their way up to become ''vorami v zakone'' (\"thieves-in-law\"). These criminal elite often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter [[Hitler]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]], Stalin was recruiting more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed codes of the Thieves' World that one must not ally with the government. Those who chose not to fight in the war referred to the traitors as ''suka'' (\"bitch\"), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the \"hierarchy\". Outcast, the ''suki'' separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of [[Bitch Wars]] from 1945 to 1953 with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, around eight million inmates were released from ''gulags''. Those that survived the imprisonment and Bitch Wars became a new breed of criminal, no longer bound to the laws of the old Thieves' World. They adopted an \"every-man-for-himself\" attitude that meant cooperating with the government if necessary. This corruption was common during the [[Brezhnev era]], and in the 1970s, small illegal businesses sprang up throughout the country, with the government ignoring them, and the black market thrived. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Then, in the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAlso during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]], with most settling in a southern [[Brooklyn]] area known as [[Brighton Beach]] (sometimes nicknamed as \"Little [[Odessa]]\"). Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\"/> The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid-1970s by the \"[[Potato Bag Gang]],\" a group of [[con artists]] disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold [[rubles]] for cheap, but in fact, gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands. By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was [[Evsei Agron]].<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nPauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization,<ref name=\"RICO Act\"/> and in May 1985 Agron was assassinated. [[Boris Nayfeld|Boris \"Biba\" Nayfeld]], his bodyguard, moved on to employ under [[Marat Balagula]], who was believed to have succeeded Agron's authority. In the following year, Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of [[Merrill Lynch]] customers, and was found in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]] in 1989, where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison.<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nBalagula would later be convicted on a separate $360,000 [[credit card fraud]] in 1992.<ref name=\"influx of gangsters\"/> Nayfield took Balagula's place, partnering with the \"Polish Al Capone\", Ricardo Fanchiniin, in an import-export business and setting up a heroin business.<ref name=\"Ricardo Fanchini\"/> In 1990, his former friend, Monya Elson, back from a six-year prison sentence in Israel, returned to America and set up a rival heroin business, culminating in a mafia turf war.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\"/>\n\n===1992\u20132000: Growth and internationalization===\nWhen the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged, organized criminal groups began to take over Russia's economy, with many ex-[[KGB]] agents and veterans of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Afghan war]] offering their skills to the crime bosses.<ref name=\"Freeh\" /> Gangster [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet's dissolution, so that top ''vory v zakone'' could agree on who would rule what, and set plans on how to take over the post-Communist states. It was agreed that [[Vyacheslav Ivankov|Vyacheslav \"Yaponchik\" Ivankov]] would be sent to Brighton Beach in 1992, allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America.<ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" /> Within a year, he built an international operation that included, but was not limited to, [[narcotics]], [[money laundering]], and [[prostitution]] and made ties with the [[American Mafia]] and Colombian [[drug cartels]], eventually extending to [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]].<ref name=\"history channel\" /> Those who went against him were usually killed.\n\nPrior to Ivankov's arrival, Balagula's downfall left a void for America's next ''vory v zakone''. Monya Elson, leader of Monya's ''Brigada'' (a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York), was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld, with bodies dropping on both sides.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\" /> Ivankov's arrival virtually ended the feud, although Elson would later challenge his power as well, and a number of attempts were made to end the former's life.<ref name=\"Ivankov pdf\" /> Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January 1994 (released in 1998)<ref name=\"Sierra Leone\" /> and in Italy in 1995, respectively.<ref name=\"ny daily news\" />\n\nIvankov's reign also ended in June 1995 when a $3.5 million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen, Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin, ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten-year maximum security prison sentence.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /><ref name=\"history channel\" /> Before his arrest and besides his operations in America, Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters (like members of the ''Solntsevskaya Bratva''), as well as reinforce ties with others. This did not stop other people from denying him growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri \"Globus\" Glugech's drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in [[Vienna]] rewarded him with what was left of Glugech's business. Two months later, Ivankov got into  another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the [[Orekhovskaya gang|''Orekhovskaya'' gang]], Segei \"Sylvester\" Timofeyev, ending with the latter murdered a month later.<ref name=\"Friedman\" />\n\nIn 1995, the [[Camorra]] cooperated with the Russian Mafia in a scheme in which the Camorra would bleach out US$1 bills and reprint them as $100s. These bills would then be transported to the Russian Mafia for distribution in 29 post-[[Eastern Bloc]] countries and former Soviet republics. In return, the Russian Mafia paid the Camorra with property (including a Russian bank) and firearms, smuggled into Eastern Europe and [[Italy]].<ref name=Richards>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=James R.|title=Transnational Criminal Organizations, Cybercrime, and Money Laundering|pages=7|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=9781420048728}}</ref>\n\nBack in Eastern Europe in May 1995, crime boss [[Semion Mogilevich]] held a different summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|And\u011bl]], a neighborhood of [[Prague]]. The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin, the second-in-command of the ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]''. However, Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip-off that claimed that the ''Solntsevskaya'' were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location (it was rumored that Mogilevich and ''Solntsevskaya'' leader [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]] had a dispute over $5 million), and the police successfully raided the meeting. 200 guests were arrested, but no charges were put against them; only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country, most of whom moved to [[Hungary]].<ref name=\"prague daily\" />\n\nOne person who was not there was Mogilevich himself. He claimed that \"[b]y the time I arrived at U Holubu, everything was already in full swing, so I went into a neighboring hotel and sat in the bar there until about five or six in the morning.\"<ref name=\"Glenny\" /><ref name=\"BBC transcript\" /> Mikhailov would later be arrested in [[Switzerland]] in October 1996 on numerous charges,<ref name=\"Ivankov pdf\" /> including that he was the head of a powerful Russian mafia group, but was exonerated and released two years later after evidence was not enough to prove much.<ref name=\"ny times\" /><ref name=\"la times\" />\n\nThe global extent of Russian organized crime wasn't realized until [[Ludwig Fainberg|Ludwig \"Tarzan\" Fainberg]] was arrested in January 1997, primarily because of arms dealing. In 1990, Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to [[Miami]] and opened up a strip club called Porky's, which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals. Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an [[ambassador]] among international crime groups, becoming especially close to Juan Almeida, a Colombian cocaine dealer. Planning to expand his cocaine business, Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt [[Russian military]]. He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in 1993, and in the following year, helped arrange to buy a [[submarine]] for cocaine smuggling. Unfortunately for the two of them, federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months. Alexander Yasevich, an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent, was sent to verify the illegal dealing, and in 1997, Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami. Facing the possibility of life imprisonment, the latter agreed for his testimony against Almeida in exchange for a shorter sentence, which ended up being 33 months.<ref name=\"history channel\" /><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" />\n\n===2001\u2013present===\nAs the 21st century dawned, the Russian mafia remained after the death of Aslan Usoyan.

This could be Brigadier, Pakhan, Authoritet.\n* '''Brigadier''' \u2013 also called ''Avtoritet'' (\"Authority\"), is like a ''captain'' in charge of a small group of men, similar to [[Caporegime]] in Italian-American Mafia crime families and Sicilian Mafia clans. He gives out jobs to Boyeviks (\"warriors\") and pays tribute to Pakhan. He runs a crew which is called a Brigade. A Brigade is made up of 5\u20136 Patsanov or Brodyag.\n* '''Bratok''' \u2013 also called '''Patsan''', or '''Brodyaga''' works for a Brigadier having a special criminal activity to run, similar to [[Soldato|soldiers]] in [[American Mafia|Italian-American Mafia]] [[Crime family|crime families]] and [[Sicilian Mafia]] clans. A Boyevik is in charge of finding new guys and paying tribute up to his Brigadier. Boyeviks also make up the main strike force of a brigade.\n* '''Shestyorka''' \u2013 is an \"associate\" to the organization also called the \"six\", similar to associates in Italian-American Mafia crime families and Sicilian Mafia clans. Is an errand boy for the organization and is the lowest rank in the Russian Mafia. The sixes are assigned to some Avtorityets for support. They also provide an intelligence for the upcoming \"delo\" or on a certain target. They usually stay out of the main actions, although there might be exceptions, depending on circumstances. During a \"delo\" Shestyorkas perform security functions standing on the look out (Shukher \u2013 literally: danger). It is a temporary position and an individual either makes it into the Vor-world or is cast aside. As they are earning their respect and trust in Bratva they may be performing roles of the regular Boyeviks or Byki depending on the necessities and patronage of their Brigadier or Avtorityet. Etymology of 'shestyorka' word comes from the lowest rank of 36 playing card deck \u2013 sixes.\n\nIn the Russian Mafia, \"Vor\" (plural: Vory) (literally, \"Thief\") is an honorary title denoting a [[made man]]. The honor of becoming a Vor is only given when the recruit shows considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect and charisma. A Pakhan or another high-ranking member of an organization can decide if the recruit will receive such title. When you become a member of the Vor-world you have to accept the code of the Vor v Zakone (\"[[Thief in law]]\").<ref name=\"Finckenauer, Waring\">James O. Finckenauer and Elin Waring.

One such model (possibly outdated by now, as it is based on the old style of Soviet criminal enterprises) works out like this:\n\n# Elite group \u2013 led by a Pakhan who is involved in management, organization and ideology. This is the highest group that controls both support group and security group.\n# Security group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to make sure the organization keeps running and also keeps the peace between the organizations and other criminal groups and also paying off the right people. This group works with the Elite group and is equal in power with the Support groups. Is in charge of security and in intelligence.\n# Support group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to watch over the working unit collecting the money while supervising their criminal activities. This group works with the elite group and is equal in power with the Security group. They plan a specific crime for a specialized group or choose who carries out the operation.\n# Working Unit \u2013 There are four Brigadiers running a criminal activity in the working unit. Each Brigade is controlled by a Brigadier. This is the lowest group working with only the Support group. The group is involved in burglars, thieves, prostitution, extortion, street gangs and other crimes.\n\n==Notable individual groups==\n'''Groups based in and around the [[Moscow|City of Moscow]]:'''\n\n* ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]'': Led by [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei \"Mikhas\" Mikhailov]], it is Russia's largest criminal group with about 5,000 members, and is named after the [[Solntsevo District]].<ref name=\"focus features\"/><ref name=\"BBC rise\"/>\n* Lyuberetskaya Bratva (Russian: \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0432\u0430) or Lyubery (Russian: \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u044b): One of the largest criminal groups in late 1980s \u2013 early-mid-1990s in the USSR.

The acronym OPG is Organized Criminal (''Prestupnaya'' in Russian) Group, used to refer to any of the Russian mafia groups, sometimes modified with a specific name, e.g. Orekhovskaya OPG. Sometimes the initialism is translated and OCG is used.\n\nOrganized crime in Russia began in the imperial period of the [[tsar]]s, but it was not until the Soviet era that ''[[Thief in law|vory v zakone]]'' (\"thieves-in-law\") emerged as leaders of prison groups in [[Gulag|forced labor camps]], and their honor code became more defined. With the end of [[World War II]], the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Joseph Stalin]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], more gangs emerged in a flourishing [[black market]], exploiting the unstable governments of the former Republics, and at its highest point, even controlling as much as two-thirds of the Russian economy.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Louis Freeh]], former director of the [[FBI]], said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to [[National Security of the United States|U.S. national security]] in the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"Freeh\" />\n\nIn modern times, there are as many as 6,000 different groups,<ref name=\"fas.org\" /> with more than 200 of them having a global reach. Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members, corrupt officials and business leaders, people with ethnic ties, or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders.{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> In December 2009, Timur Lakhonin, the head of the Russian National Central Bureau of [[Interpol]], stated \"Certainly, there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad, but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad\",<ref name=\"Lakhonin\" /> while in August 2010, [[Alain Bauer]], a French criminologist, said that it \"is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe, with a quasi-military operation.\"<ref name=\"Bauer\" />\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Russian criminality can be traced back to Russia's [[Russian Empire|imperial period]], which began in the 1720s, in the form of banditry and thievery. Most of the population were [[peasants]], in poverty at the time, and criminals who stole from government entities and divided profits among the people earned [[Robin Hood]]-like status, being viewed as protectors of the poor and becoming [[folk heroes]]. In time, the ''Vorovskoy Mir'' (Thieves' World) emerged as these criminals grouped and started their own code of conduct that was based on strict loyalty with one another and opposition against the government. When the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] came around in 1917, the Thieves' World was alive and active. [[Vladimir Lenin]] attempted to wipe them out, but failed, and the criminals survived into [[Joseph Stalin]]'s reign.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\n===1917\u20131991: Soviet era===\nDuring Stalin's reign as ruler, millions of people were sent to ''[[gulag]]s'' (Soviet labor camps), where powerful criminals worked their way up to become ''vorami v zakone'' (\"thieves-in-law\"). These criminal elite often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos, symbols still used by Russian mobsters.<ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter [[Hitler]]'s [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]], Stalin was recruiting more men to fight for the nation, offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army. Many flocked to help out in the war, but this act betrayed codes of the Thieves' World that one must not ally with the government. Those who chose not to fight in the war referred to the traitors as ''suka'' (\"bitch\"), and the traitors landed at the bottom of the \"hierarchy\". Outcast, the ''suki'' separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials, eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions. Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of [[Bitch Wars]] from 1945 to 1953 with many killed every day. The prison officials encouraged the violence, seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAfter the death of Stalin, around eight million inmates were released from ''gulags''. Those that survived the imprisonment and Bitch Wars became a new breed of criminal, no longer bound to the laws of the old Thieves' World. They adopted an \"every-man-for-himself\" attitude that meant cooperating with the government if necessary. This corruption was common during the [[Brezhnev era]], and in the 1970s, small illegal businesses sprang up throughout the country, with the government ignoring them, and the black market thrived. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Then, in the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] loosened restrictions on private businesses, allowing them to grow legally, but by then, the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"history channel\"/>\n\nAlso during the 1970s and 1980s, the United States expanded its immigration policies, allowing [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]], with most settling in a southern [[Brooklyn]] area known as [[Brighton Beach]] (sometimes nicknamed as \"Little [[Odessa]]\"). Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US.<ref name=\"Mallory\"/><ref name=\"CBS worldwide\"/> The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid-1970s by the \"[[Potato Bag Gang]],\" a group of [[con artists]] disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold [[rubles]] for cheap, but in fact, gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands. By 1983, the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was [[Evsei Agron]].<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nPauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization,<ref name=\"RICO Act\"/> and in May 1985 Agron was assassinated. [[Boris Nayfeld|Boris \"Biba\" Nayfeld]], his bodyguard, moved on to employ under [[Marat Balagula]], who was believed to have succeeded Agron's authority. In the following year, Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of [[Merrill Lynch]] customers, and was found in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]] in 1989, where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison.<ref name=\"early US crime\"/>\n\nBalagula would later be convicted on a separate $360,000 [[credit card fraud]] in 1992.<ref name=\"influx of gangsters\"/> Nayfield took Balagula's place, partnering with the \"Polish Al Capone\", Ricardo Fanchiniin, in an import-export business and setting up a heroin business.<ref name=\"Ricardo Fanchini\"/> In 1990, his former friend, Monya Elson, back from a six-year prison sentence in Israel, returned to America and set up a rival heroin business, culminating in a mafia turf war.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\"/>\n\n===1992\u20132000: Growth and internationalization===\nWhen the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged, organized criminal groups began to take over Russia's economy, with many ex-[[KGB]] agents and veterans of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Afghan war]] offering their skills to the crime bosses.<ref name=\"Freeh\" /> Gangster [[Summit (meeting)|summit meetings]] had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet's dissolution, so that top ''vory v zakone'' could agree on who would rule what, and set plans on how to take over the post-Communist states. It was agreed that [[Vyacheslav Ivankov|Vyacheslav \"Yaponchik\" Ivankov]] would be sent to Brighton Beach in 1992, allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America.<ref name=\"CBS worldwide\" /> Within a year, he built an international operation that included, but was not limited to, [[narcotics]], [[money laundering]], and [[prostitution]] and made ties with the [[American Mafia]] and Colombian [[drug cartels]], eventually extending to [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Boston]].<ref name=\"history channel\" /> Those who went against him were usually killed.\n\nPrior to Ivankov's arrival, Balagula's downfall left a void for America's next ''vory v zakone''. Monya Elson, leader of Monya's ''Brigada'' (a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York), was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld, with bodies dropping on both sides.<ref name=\"Elson and Nayfield\" /> Ivankov's arrival virtually ended the feud, although Elson would later challenge his power as well, and a number of attempts were made to end the former's life.<ref name=\"Ivankov pdf\" /> Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January 1994 (released in 1998)<ref name=\"Sierra Leone\" /> and in Italy in 1995, respectively.<ref name=\"ny daily news\" />\n\nIvankov's reign also ended in June 1995 when a $3.5 million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen, Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin, ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten-year maximum security prison sentence.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /><ref name=\"history channel\" /> Before his arrest and besides his operations in America, Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters (like members of the ''Solntsevskaya Bratva''), as well as reinforce ties with others. This did not stop other people from denying him growing power. In one instance, Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri \"Globus\" Glugech's drug importation business. When the latter refused the offer, he and his top associates were shot dead. A summit held in May 1994 in [[Vienna]] rewarded him with what was left of Glugech's business. Two months later, Ivankov got into  another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the [[Orekhovskaya gang|''Orekhovskaya'' gang]], Segei \"Sylvester\" Timofeyev, ending with the latter murdered a month later.<ref name=\"Friedman\" />\n\nIn 1995, the [[Camorra]] cooperated with the Russian Mafia in a scheme in which the Camorra would bleach out US$1 bills and reprint them as $100s. These bills would then be transported to the Russian Mafia for distribution in 29 post-[[Eastern Bloc]] countries and former Soviet republics. In return, the Russian Mafia paid the Camorra with property (including a Russian bank) and firearms, smuggled into Eastern Europe and [[Italy]].<ref name=Richards>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=James R.|title=Transnational Criminal Organizations, Cybercrime, and Money Laundering|pages=7|publisher=CRC Press|year=1998|isbn=9781420048728}}</ref>\n\nBack in Eastern Europe in May 1995, crime boss [[Semion Mogilevich]] held a different summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|And\u011bl]], a neighborhood of [[Prague]]. The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin, the second-in-command of the ''[[Solntsevskaya Bratva]]''. However, Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip-off that claimed that the ''Solntsevskaya'' were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location (it was rumored that Mogilevich and ''Solntsevskaya'' leader [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]] had a dispute over $5 million), and the police successfully raided the meeting. 200 guests were arrested, but no charges were put against them; only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country, most of whom moved to [[Hungary]].<ref name=\"prague daily\" />\n\nOne person who was not there was Mogilevich himself.

In 1990, Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to [[Miami]] and opened up a strip club called Porky's, which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals. Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an [[ambassador]] among international crime groups, becoming especially close to Juan Almeida, a Colombian cocaine dealer. Planning to expand his cocaine business, Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt [[Russian military]]. He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in 1993, and in the following year, helped arrange to buy a [[submarine]] for cocaine smuggling. Unfortunately for the two of them, federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months. Alexander Yasevich, an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent, was sent to verify the illegal dealing, and in 1997, Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami.

Is an errand boy for the organization and is the lowest rank in the Russian Mafia. The sixes are assigned to some Avtorityets for support. They also provide an intelligence for the upcoming \"delo\" or on a certain target. They usually stay out of the main actions, although there might be exceptions, depending on circumstances. During a \"delo\" Shestyorkas perform security functions standing on the look out (Shukher \u2013 literally: danger). It is a temporary position and an individual either makes it into the Vor-world or is cast aside. As they are earning their respect and trust in Bratva they may be performing roles of the regular Boyeviks or Byki depending on the necessities and patronage of their Brigadier or Avtorityet.

The honor of becoming a Vor is only given when the recruit shows considerable leadership skills, personal ability, intellect and charisma. A Pakhan or another high-ranking member of an organization can decide if the recruit will receive such title.

This is the highest group that controls both support group and security group.\n# Security group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to make sure the organization keeps running and also keeps the peace between the organizations and other criminal groups and also paying off the right people. This group works with the Elite group and is equal in power with the Support groups. Is in charge of security and in intelligence.\n# Support group \u2013 is led by one of his spies. His job is to watch over the working unit collecting the money while supervising their criminal activities. This group works with the elite group and is equal in power with the Security group. They plan a specific crime for a specialized group or choose who carries out the operation.\n# Working Unit \u2013 There are four Brigadiers running a criminal activity in the working unit. Each Brigade is controlled by a Brigadier. This is the lowest group working with only the Support group.

Unlike the first movement, however (and unlike all of the composer's earlier quartets), there is a certain thematic kinship amongst the sections, with a recurrence of a falling-third figure and the use of pseudo-Indian motifs influenced by [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]'s [[String Quartet No. 12 (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k)|\"American\" Quartet]] {{harv|Tarasti|2009|loc=238}}.\n\n==Discography==\nChronological by date of recording.\n*Heitor Villa-Lobos: Quartet no. 6 in E (Quartetto brasileiro no. 2).

The police are empowered to enforce the law and to effect public and social order, as well as being responsible for [[border control]].<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/docs/handbook-annex_01.pdf |chapter=Annex 1: List of national services responsible for border control |title=Practical Handbook for Border Guards (Schengen Handbook) |date=6 November 2006 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe police of Denmark consists of 12 districts each managed by a director and two minor districts in [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], run by a local chief of police.\nThe district of [[Copenhagen]] is somewhat differently organized due to its size and tasks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nBesides the regular districts other organizations exist that work outside the general police:\n* [[Rigspolitiet]] - a nationwide police force with specialized tasks such as ''Budgets and Accounts'', ''Building Surveying Department'' and the ''Data Investigating Department''\n* [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste]] - the national security intelligence agency of Denmark\n* [[Politiets Aktionsstyrke]] - the special forces unit of the Danish police\n\n==Equipment==\n===Uniform===\nThe common uniform is a light blue shirt with the police insignia on the sleeve. Usually a tie is also worn. Rank-insignia is worn on the shoulders. The trousers are dark blue with reflective patches. Black shoes are also included in the standard uniform. Special tactical suits are made of flame-resistant materials and are worn in situations requiring such equipment. The tactical suit also includes a protective helmet.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} \n\n===Vehicles===\nFor daily duties, the patrol-vehicles are white and dog-patrols are mostly dark blue. They have a blue strobe-light or flashing light and the word \"POLITI\" painted on the side in clear reflective paint. The most commonly used patrol vehicles are [[Ford Mondeo]], [[Volkswagen Passat]] and [[Opel Vectra]], with 2.0 to 2.2 litre engines. In 2009, the 3.6 litre [[\u0160koda Superb]] was added to the fleet. Unmarked cars are usually fitted with engines with a size of around 1.6 to 2.2 litres. In addition a large number of small unmarked cars are used like [[Peugeot 307]], [[Opel Astra]], [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]] and Toyota Yaris - with engine size of around 1.2 to 1.6 litre. The [[Peugeot 607]] is used by a security attachment for cabinet members and the royal court. The [[Toyota Landcruiser]] and VW Touareg are used for special tasks. Small detachments typically use [[Volkswagen Transporter|VW Transporters]], while [[Volkswagen LT|VW LTs]] and [[Ford Transit]] mini-buses are used in larger operations, which require a lot of manpower (demonstrations, football matches and larger civil unrests). In extreme events, a variation of the [[Mercedes-Benz Vario|MB Vario]] is used. It is generally known as the ''Dutchman's vehicle'' (in Danish ''Holl\u00e6ndervogn''). This name derives from the fact that these vehicles are kitted out in the Netherlands as [[Armoured personnel carrier|light APC's]] with reinforced windows, wheels and metal parts and [[Fireproofing|fire-resistant]] coating. They are used both as light APCs in event of demonstrations or public disturbances, and as general transportation of large numbers of detainees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Other vehicles in use are the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] (used by both Central Patrol Leaders, a kind of on-street watch commanders) and [[Nissan Patrol]]s used by the mounted police squads with a horse carrier attached.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe traffic police also use unmarked vans for automatic traffic control. These are primarily VW Transporters, Mercedes Benz Vitos, [[Toyota Hiace]]s, but others are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |title=Fotovogne i Danmark |trans-title=Photo vehicles in Denmark |website=10-20.dk |language=da  |accessdate=7 November 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020021815/http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |archivedate=20 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nSome rural police officers use civilian vehicles with a dismountable magnetic roof beacon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nFor traffic regulation and VIP and ambulance escorts [[motorcycle]]s are also used, primarily [[Yamaha FJR1300]]A, [[Honda ST1300]]a,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politi.dk/da/aktuelt/nyheder/2005/motorcykler_220905.htm |title=Politiet f\u00e5r nye motorcykler |trans-title=Police get new motorcycles |date=22 September 2005 |website=Politi.dk |language=da |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref> [[BMW K1200R]]S and [[BMW K1200GT]] (over time replacing older [[BMW motorcycles#K Series|BMW K1100LT]] and [[BMW motorcycles#R Series|BMW R1100RT]]).\n\n===Weapons===\nThe standard service handgun is the [[Heckler & Koch USP|H&K USP Compact]] 9mm [[pistol]].

The police must promote this purpose through prevention, assistance and enforcement.\"\n\nThe second section states that other areas of police jurisdiction include:\n\n# preventing criminal actions, disturbances of the public peace and order and danger to individual citizens and public safety\n# stopping criminal actions and investigating and prosecuting criminal actions\n# supporting citizens in dangerous situations\n# carrying out checking and inspecting under current rules and regulations\n# supporting other agencies under current rules and regulations\n# performing other tasks under current rules and regulations, as well as handling other tasks which are naturally associated with police duties.\n\nLastly, the third section states:\n\"The police may in other situations than those mentioned in statutory law only interfere with citizens under this Act.\"<ref group=note>Though this may seem obvious, it is a precaution that clearly states that the police may under no circumstances act towards the citizens in ways not stated by law (da: ''hjemlet''). This ensures that the police cannot make their own interpretations of laws or regulations.</ref>\n\n==Ranks and insignia==\nIn Denmark, the local prosecution service is part of the police.

The police are empowered to enforce the law and to effect public and social order, as well as being responsible for [[border control]].<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/e-library/documents/policies/borders-and-visas/schengen/docs/handbook-annex_01.pdf |chapter=Annex 1: List of national services responsible for border control |title=Practical Handbook for Border Guards (Schengen Handbook) |date=6 November 2006 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nThe police of Denmark consists of 12 districts each managed by a director and two minor districts in [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], run by a local chief of police.\nThe district of [[Copenhagen]] is somewhat differently organized due to its size and tasks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nBesides the regular districts other organizations exist that work outside the general police:\n* [[Rigspolitiet]] - a nationwide police force with specialized tasks such as ''Budgets and Accounts'', ''Building Surveying Department'' and the ''Data Investigating Department''\n* [[Politiets Efterretningstjeneste]] - the national security intelligence agency of Denmark\n* [[Politiets Aktionsstyrke]] - the special forces unit of the Danish police\n\n==Equipment==\n===Uniform===\nThe common uniform is a light blue shirt with the police insignia on the sleeve. Usually a tie is also worn. Rank-insignia is worn on the shoulders. The trousers are dark blue with reflective patches. Black shoes are also included in the standard uniform. Special tactical suits are made of flame-resistant materials and are worn in situations requiring such equipment. The tactical suit also includes a protective helmet.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} \n\n===Vehicles===\nFor daily duties, the patrol-vehicles are white and dog-patrols are mostly dark blue. They have a blue strobe-light or flashing light and the word \"POLITI\" painted on the side in clear reflective paint. The most commonly used patrol vehicles are [[Ford Mondeo]], [[Volkswagen Passat]] and [[Opel Vectra]], with 2.0 to 2.2 litre engines. In 2009, the 3.6 litre [[\u0160koda Superb]] was added to the fleet. Unmarked cars are usually fitted with engines with a size of around 1.6 to 2.2 litres. In addition a large number of small unmarked cars are used like [[Peugeot 307]], [[Opel Astra]], [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]] and Toyota Yaris - with engine size of around 1.2 to 1.6 litre. The [[Peugeot 607]] is used by a security attachment for cabinet members and the royal court. The [[Toyota Landcruiser]] and VW Touareg are used for special tasks. Small detachments typically use [[Volkswagen Transporter|VW Transporters]], while [[Volkswagen LT|VW LTs]] and [[Ford Transit]] mini-buses are used in larger operations, which require a lot of manpower (demonstrations, football matches and larger civil unrests). In extreme events, a variation of the [[Mercedes-Benz Vario|MB Vario]] is used. It is generally known as the ''Dutchman's vehicle'' (in Danish ''Holl\u00e6ndervogn''). This name derives from the fact that these vehicles are kitted out in the Netherlands as [[Armoured personnel carrier|light APC's]] with reinforced windows, wheels and metal parts and [[Fireproofing|fire-resistant]] coating. They are used both as light APCs in event of demonstrations or public disturbances, and as general transportation of large numbers of detainees.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} Other vehicles in use are the [[Mercedes-Benz Vito]] (used by both Central Patrol Leaders, a kind of on-street watch commanders) and [[Nissan Patrol]]s used by the mounted police squads with a horse carrier attached.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe traffic police also use unmarked vans for automatic traffic control. These are primarily VW Transporters, Mercedes Benz Vitos, [[Toyota Hiace]]s, but others are used as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |title=Fotovogne i Danmark |trans-title=Photo vehicles in Denmark |website=10-20.dk |language=da  |accessdate=7 November 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020021815/http://www.10-20.dk/fotovogn.htm |archivedate=20 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nSome rural police officers use civilian vehicles with a dismountable magnetic roof beacon.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nFor traffic regulation and VIP and ambulance escorts [[motorcycle]]s are also used, primarily [[Yamaha FJR1300]]A, [[Honda ST1300]]a,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politi.dk/da/aktuelt/nyheder/2005/motorcykler_220905.htm |title=Politiet f\u00e5r nye motorcykler |trans-title=Police get new motorcycles |date=22 September 2005 |website=Politi.dk |language=da |accessdate=7 November 2018}}</ref> [[BMW K1200R]]S and [[BMW K1200GT]] (over time replacing older [[BMW motorcycles#K Series|BMW K1100LT]] and [[BMW motorcycles#R Series|BMW R1100RT]]).\n\n===Weapons===\nThe standard service handgun is the [[Heckler & Koch USP|H&K USP Compact]] 9mm [[pistol]].

The police must promote this purpose through prevention, assistance and enforcement.\"\n\nThe second section states that other areas of police jurisdiction include:\n\n# preventing criminal actions, disturbances of the public peace and order and danger to individual citizens and public safety\n# stopping criminal actions and investigating and prosecuting criminal actions\n# supporting citizens in dangerous situations\n# carrying out checking and inspecting under current rules and regulations\n# supporting other agencies under current rules and regulations\n# performing other tasks under current rules and regulations, as well as handling other tasks which are naturally associated with police duties.\n\nLastly, the third section states:\n\"The police may in other situations than those mentioned in statutory law only interfere with citizens under this Act.\"<ref group=note>Though this may seem obvious, it is a precaution that clearly states that the police may under no circumstances act towards the citizens in ways not stated by law (da: ''hjemlet''). This ensures that the police cannot make their own interpretations of laws or regulations.</ref>\n\n==Ranks and insignia==\nIn Denmark, the local prosecution service is part of the police.
