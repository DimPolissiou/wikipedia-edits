Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues. Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry. Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"patho\" />\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment. Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus initially uses CCR5 as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> \n\nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers such as tissue barriers and the mucus layer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"patho\" /> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Molecular Virology (Sixth Edition) |last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication. An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\n\n\n[[File:Virus lifestyle persistence strategies.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=A graph summarising the various virus \"lifestyle strategies, acute, chronic and latent|The \"lifestyle\" strategies of viruses in host cells. Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can either be acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can induce oncogenic transformation of host cells. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" />\n\n===Damage caused by host immune system===\nSometimes, instead of cell death or cellular dysfunction caused by the virus, the host immune response can mediate disease and excessive [[inflammation]]. The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites. \n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name =\"patho\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus initially uses CCR5 as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> \n\nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers such as tissue barriers and the mucus layer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"patho\" /> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Molecular Virology (Sixth Edition) |last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication. An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\n\n\n[[File:Virus lifestyle persistence strategies.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=A graph summarising the various virus \"lifestyle strategies, acute, chronic and latent|The \"lifestyle\" strategies of viruses in host cells. Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can either be acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can induce oncogenic transformation of host cells. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" />\n\n===Damage caused by host immune system===\nSometimes, instead of cell death or cellular dysfunction caused by the virus, the host immune response can mediate disease and excessive [[inflammation]]. The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites. \n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name =\"patho\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name =\"patho\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDamage caused by the virus", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

The system covers over {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}} in distance and traverses an elevation of over {{convert|135|m|abbr=on}} from bottom to top. It opened in 1993 to provide an improved link between the [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Mid-Levels]] districts on [[Hong Kong Island]].\n\nThe top stage of the escalator system between Robinson Road and Conduit Road has been replaced, and went operational on 11 July 2018. In early 2019, three refurbished  escalators between Mosque Street and Robinson Road went operational. In June 2019, two replaced escalators between Caine Road and Elgin Street opened to the public. The escalator between Gage Street and Wellington Street is currently under refurbishment. \n\nApart from serving as a mode of transportation, the system is also a tourist attraction and is lined with restaurants, bars, and shops.<ref name=\"milelongescalator\">{{cite news|last1=Gold|first1=Anne|title=Hong Kong's Mile-Long Escalator System Elevates the Senses : A Stairway to Urban Heaven|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/06/style/hong-kongs-milelong-escalator-system-elevates-the-senses-a-stairway-to.html|work=The New York Times|date=6 July 2001}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:\u8208\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u767b\u5c71\u96fb\u68af.jpg|thumb|Central\u2013Mid-Levels escalators under construction in the early 1990s]]\n=== Origins ===\nThe project was first publicly mooted in the early 1980s.

The three walkways have inclines of 8.1\u00b0, 11.9\u00b0 and 11.7\u00b0. Eleven of the escalators have a typical 30\u00b0 incline, while the remaining seven have a non-standard 17.5\u00b0 incline.<ref name=\"ICEE\"/>\n\nAll the walkways (except for at-grade road crossings) are covered to protect users from the rain, although the sides are open to the elements.

In 2005, the system saw about 54,000 daily pedestrian trips. This grew to 85,000 trips in 2010. The department noted that the escalator has relieved demand for public transport, but has not led to many motorists giving up driving or reduced traffic congestion, in line with the traffic planning principle of [[induced demand]].<ref name=\"legco\">{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201512/16/P201512160340.htm|title=LCQ10: Hillside escalator links and elevator systems|date=16 December 2015|publisher=Legislative Council}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The system covers over {{convert|800|m}} in distance and traverses an elevation of over {{convert|135|m}} from bottom to top. It opened in 1993 to provide an improved link between the [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Mid-Levels]] districts on [[Hong Kong Island]].\n\nThe top stage of the escalator system between Robinson Road and Conduit Road has been replaced, and went operational on 11 July 2018. In early 2019, three refurbished  escalators between Mosque Street and Robinson Road went operational. In June 2019, two replaced escalators between Caine Road and Elgin Street opened to the public.

The three walkways have inclines of 8.1\u00b0, 11.9\u00b0 and 11.7\u00b0. Eleven of the escalators have a typical 30\u00b0 incline, while the remaining seven have a non-standard 17.5\u00b0 incline.<ref name=\"ICEE\"/>\n\nAll the walkways (except for at-grade road crossings) are covered to protect users from the rain, although the sides are open to the elements.

In 2005, the system saw about 54,000 daily pedestrian trips. This grew to 85,000 trips in 2010. The department noted that the escalator has relieved demand for public transport, but has not led to many motorists giving up driving or reduced traffic congestion, in line with the traffic planning principle of [[induced demand]].<ref name=\"legco\">{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201512/16/P201512160340.htm|title=LCQ10: Hillside escalator links and elevator systems|date=16 December 2015|publisher=Legislative Council}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Matrubhootham also hates Bhuvaneswari's relatives. They have two sons Sarangapani ([[S. V. Shekhar]]), Poovizhirajan ([[Ravi Raghavendra]]) and a daughter Parijatham (Dhivya). Parijatham who works at a type-writing institute, loves the owner of the institute Venkatachalam ([[R. Dilip (Tamil actor)|Dilip]]). Poovizhirajan is a poet, and is physically attracted to Urvasi ([[Pallavi (actress)|Pallavi]]), who is one of his biggest fans, and is the daughter of wealthy businessman Sundaresa Mudaliar ([[Delhi Ganesh]]). \n\nKavisattai Kandhasamy ([[Visu]]) is Bhuvaneswari's brother, and lives with his wife Deivanayagi ([[Vadivukkarasi]]) and daughter Uma ([[Rasi]]). Their family is lower middle class and has little money, as Kandhasamy doesn't work and just roams around the town poking his nose in other people's personal problems. One such incident happens when Kandhasamy resolves the dispute between a husband and a wife on the road. The husband ([[M. S. Bhaskar]]) says that he is dark skinned and so is his wife, but their baby is fair skinned, and hence suspects his wife. Kandhasamy gives him a betel leaf, nut and lime and asks him to chew it. He says that since the ingredients are green, black and white in colour, the husband's mouth should have only one of these three colours. The husband realizes that his mouth will be red after chewing this, and hence apologizes and takes his baby and wife and leaves, having learnt a lesson. Later Kandhasamy receives a letter from Bhuvaneswari's house asking him to visit. Deivanayagi wants Kandhasamy to use this oppurtunity to re-unite the two families, so that Uma can be married off to one of Bhuvaneswari's sons.\n\nThe letter was written by Parijatham who asks Kandhasamy to help her marry Venkatachalam. Kandhasamy meets Venkatachalam's father Sivagnyaanam ([[Venniradai Moorthy]]), and fools him by saying that he is a relative of a freedom fighter named Pathamadai Pattabiraman. Sivagnyaanam who is trying to get his freedom fighter father Aalolasingam ([[Poornam Viswanathan]]) to write the property and wealth in Sivagnyaanam's name sees this alliance as an opportunity to impress Aalolasingam who would definitely like a freedom fighter's relative. Sivagyaanam meets with Bhuvaneswari's family and agree on the wedding. Bhuvaneswari realizes that its not possible to conduct the wedding, as they don't have sufficient money. Bhuvaneswari thinks of a plan. She is friends with the wife of Rajapandi Thevar ([[K. K. Soundar]]), and likes their daughter Neelaveni ([[Rekha (South Indian actress)|Rekha]]). She wants to get Neelaveni married to Sarangapani, so that she can use the dowry from Rajapandi Thevar, to spend on Parijatham's wedding. Sarangapani initially rejects the alliance saying that if he marries Neelaveni, it might cause problems, because Neelaveni was born to a Thevar and Iyengar, and raised by the Thevar's second wife who is a Chettiar, and hence such inter-caste relationships may not go well in the eyes of the society. Instead he tells his mother that he would be willing to marry Kandhasamy's daughter. But Bhuvaneswari tells Kandhasamy that if Sarangapani marries his daughter, then she will not get the money to conduct Parijatham's wedding. Hence she promises her brother that she will fix Poovizhirajan's wedding with his daughter, on the condition that Kandhasamy helps Sarangapani meet Neelaveni and makes him agree to marry her. Kandhasamy agrees to this plan, and plays cupid between Sarangapani and Neelaveni. Sarangapani falls in love with Neelaveni.\n\nMeanwhile Poovizhirajan seduces Urvasi with his romantic and erotic poems, later sleeps with her, and then ditches her. While Aalolasingam and Sivagnyaanam are at Bhuvaneswari's house to receive the wedding invite card, they question Kandhasamy about Pathamadai Pattabiraman, as Aalolasingam is not able to recollect anybody by that name. Matrubhootham happens to meet Rajapandi Thevar at a temple and comes to know that unbeknownst to him, Bhuvaneswari and Kavisattai Kandhasamy have arranged Sarangapani's wedding with Neelaveni. All of them go from the temple to Bhuvaneswari's house. Urvasi also comes to Poovizhirajan's house to seek justice for her. Aalolasingam, Rajapandi Thevar, Urvasi, Kandhasamy and Matrubhootham all get into a commotion and argument at the same time. Matrubhootham asks Kandhasamy to get out of the house, as he is the troublemaker. But Kandhasamy challenges everyone that he will conduct all three weddings of Parijatham, Neelaveni and Urvasi within a week.\n\nKandhasamy and Venkatachalam stage a fake kidnapping of Aalolasingam and put the blame on Matrubhootham and Sivagnyaanam to divert the families' attention from the real marriage issues. Kandhasamy talks to Rajapandi Thevar to recover Bhuvaneswari's jewels and vessels from the pawn broker shop. Kandhasamy asks Sundaresa Mudaliar and Urvasi to setup camp outside Poovizhirajan's house and protest until Poovizhirajan confesses. Matrubhootham and Poovizhirajan talk to Deivanayagi and try to marry Uma to Poovizhirajan, in order to stop Urvasi's protests. Despite the obstacles, Kandhasamy succeeds. At the end of the movie, Matrubhootham and Bhuvaneswari reconcile with each other, Poovizhirajan confesses to have cheated Urvasi and agrees to marry her, Aalolasingam agrees to get his grandson married to Parijatham after being impressed with Kandhasamy's efforts, Sarangapani marries Neelaveni, Deivanayagi leaves her husband Kandhasamy after he fails to get Uma married. The climax shows Kandhasamy and Uma alone, and praying to lord Murugan to help get an alliance for Uma.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Visu]] as Kavisattai Kandhasamy\n*[[S. V.
