L. Austin|John L. Austin]] when he referred to a specific capacity: the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be \"evaluated as true or false\". Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict.<ref name=Cavanaugh/>\n\nInfluenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].<ref name=\"Butler1990\">{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref> This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors, and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.<ref name=Cavanaugh/> This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].<ref>Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis \u2013 Barker & Galasinski</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===J. L. Austin===\n\nThe term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]]. In the 1950s, Austin gave the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words \"I do\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|url=https://archive.org/details/howtodothingswit0000aust|url-access=registration|year=1962|page=[https://archive.org/details/howtodothingswit0000aust/page/5 5]}}</ref> Austin did not use the word ''performativity''.\n\nBreaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a \"performative utterance\" cannot be said to be either true or false as a constative utterance might be: it can only be judged either \"happy\" or \"infelicitous\" depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between \"performative\" and \"constative\" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:\n\n* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) \n* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) \n* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)\n\nFor example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.\n\n==== Influence of Austin ====\nAustin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).\n\nThe concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a \"representational idiom\" to a \"performative idiom\" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).\n\nOther uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define\u2014and break\u2014boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67\u201391), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.\n\n== Judith Butler ==\n{{Main|Gender performativity}}\n\nPhilosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as \"that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\"|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=9780415903660|location=New York|pages=xii|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bodiesthatmatter00butl}}</ref> She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.<ref>This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).</ref>\n\nThe concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|date=2014-05-16|accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).\n\n==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====\n\nButler explains gender as an act. An act that people come to perform in the '''mode''' of '''belief''' which has been rehearsed much like a script. It is further asserted that people make a reality through repetition (just as actors who make a script). Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of \"self-making\" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler's theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  For Butler, a person is merely in a condition of \"doing straightness\" or \"doing queerness\" (Lloyd, 1999).\n\n\"For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by [[hegemonic]] [[social conventions]] and [[ideologies]]\" (Felluga, 2006).\n\n==== Theoretical criticisms ====\n\nThere are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration (Lloyd, 1999).\n\nAnother criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a \"real\" existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)\n\nOthers criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of \"doing\" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.\n\n== Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard ==\nIn ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/postmoderncondit00lyot}}</ref> In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.\n\nLyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: \"be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear\" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth.\n\nLyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize \"audit culture\" and \"global performativity\".\n\nAgainst performativity and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.\n\n== Jacques Derrida ==\nPhilosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language.\n\nIn \"Signature, Event, Context,\" Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker (\"signature\") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.<blockquote>Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called \"normal.\" What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?<ref>{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}</ref></blockquote>Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions.\n\n==John Searle's reformulation==\nIn ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref> Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin's theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: \"In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin's taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|pages=12|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref>\n\nHis last key departure from Austin lies in Searle's claim that four of his universal 'acts' do not need 'extra-linguistic' contexts to succeed.<ref name=\"John1979\">{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|pages=7|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref> As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the \"rules of language\".<ref name=\"John1979\" />\n\n== Various applications ==\n=== Finance and economics ===\nIn economics, the \"performativity thesis\" is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}</ref><ref name=\"doing\">{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}</ref> This theory was developed by Michel Callon in ''The Laws of the Markets'', before being further developed in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &#124; Ivan Boldyrev &#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref> The most important work in the field is that of [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald MacKenzie]] and Yuval Millo<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald|last2=Millo|first2=Yuval|date=2003|title=Constructing a Market, Performing Theory: The Historical Sociology of a Financial Derivatives Exchange|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/374404|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=109|issue=1|pages=107\u2013145|doi=10.1086/374404|issn=0002-9602}}</ref> on the social construction of financial markets. In a seminal article, they showed that the option pricing theory called [[Black\u2013Scholes model|BSM]] (Black-Scholes-Merton) has been successful empirically not because of the discovery of preexisting price regularities, but because participants used it to set option prices, so that it made itself true.\n\nThe thesis of performativity of economics has been extensively criticized by Nicolas Brisset in ''Economics and Performativity''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economics and Performativity|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018}}</ref> Brisset defends the idea that the notion of performativity used by Callonian and Latourian sociologists leads to an overly relativistic view of the social world. Drawing on the work of [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]] and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], Brisset theorizes the idea of limits to performativity.To do this, Brisset considers that a theory, in order to be \"performative\", must become a convection. This requires conditions to be met. To take a convention status, a theory will have to:\n\n* Provide social actors with a representation of their social world allowing them to choose among several actions (\"Empiricity\" condition);\n* Indicate an option considered relevant when the agreement is generalised (\"Self-fulfilling\" condition);\n* Be compatible with all the conventions constituting the social environment (\"Coherency\" condition);<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=2016-04-02|title=Economics is not always performative: some limits for performativity|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1350178X.2016.1172805|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=160\u2013184|doi=10.1080/1350178X.2016.1172805|issn=1350-178X}}</ref>\n\nBased on this framework, Brisset criticized the seminal work of MacKenzie and Millo on the performativity of the Black-Scholes-Merton financial model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=December 2017|title=ON PERFORMATIVITY: OPTION THEORY AND THE RESISTANCE OF FINANCIAL PHENOMENA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-history-of-economic-thought/article/on-performativity-option-theory-and-the-resistance-of-financial-phenomena/5EA4680D1294F9D4593FCAB4FBAB1421#fndtn-metrics|journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=549\u2013569|doi=10.1017/S1053837217000128|issn=1053-8372}}</ref> \n\nMacKenzie's approach was also criticized by Uskali Maki for not using the concept of performativity in accordance with Austin's formulation<ref>{{Citation|last=M\u00e4ki|first=Uskali|title=Performativity: Saving Austin From Mackenzie|date=2013|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MKIPSA|work=EPSA11 Perspectives and Foundational Problems in Philosophy of Science|pages=443\u2013453|editor-last=Karakostas|editor-first=Vassilios|publisher=Springer|access-date=2020-04-14|editor2-last=Dieks|editor2-first=Dennis}}</ref>.

In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: \"The gates of the wall are wide open.\" (\u201eDie Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.\u201d) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubil\u00e4um - der sch\u00f6nste Fehler in 40 Jahren \"Tagesthemen\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}</ref>\n\n===Video art===\n\nTheories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Mu\u00f1oz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, \"The Transformation.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author=Mu\u00f1oz|authorlink=Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz}}</ref>\n\nAlthough historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Austin, J.

L. Austin|John L. Austin]] when he referred to a specific capacity: the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be \"evaluated as true or false\". Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict.<ref name=Cavanaugh/>\n\nInfluenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].<ref name=\"Butler1990\">{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref> This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors, and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.<ref name=Cavanaugh/> This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].<ref>Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis \u2013 Barker & Galasinski</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===J. L. Austin===\n\nThe term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]]. In the 1950s, Austin gave the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words \"I do\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|url=https://archive.org/details/howtodothingswit0000aust|url-access=registration|year=1962|page=[https://archive.org/details/howtodothingswit0000aust/page/5 5]}}</ref> Austin did not use the word ''performativity''.\n\nBreaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a \"performative utterance\" cannot be said to be either true or false as a constative utterance might be: it can only be judged either \"happy\" or \"infelicitous\" depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between \"performative\" and \"constative\" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:\n\n* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) \n* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) \n* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)\n\nFor example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.\n\n==== Influence of Austin ====\nAustin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).\n\nThe concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a \"representational idiom\" to a \"performative idiom\" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).\n\nOther uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define\u2014and break\u2014boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67\u201391), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.\n\n== Judith Butler ==\n{{Main|Gender performativity}}\n\nPhilosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as \"that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\"|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=9780415903660|location=New York|pages=xii|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bodiesthatmatter00butl}}</ref> She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.<ref>This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).</ref>\n\nThe concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|date=2014-05-16|accessdate=29 May 2014}}</ref> The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).\n\n==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====\n\nButler explains gender as an act. An act that people come to perform in the '''mode''' of '''belief''' which has been rehearsed much like a script. It is further asserted that people make a reality through repetition (just as actors who make a script). Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of \"self-making\" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler's theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  For Butler, a person is merely in a condition of \"doing straightness\" or \"doing queerness\" (Lloyd, 1999).\n\n\"For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by [[hegemonic]] [[social conventions]] and [[ideologies]]\" (Felluga, 2006).\n\n==== Theoretical criticisms ====\n\nThere are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration (Lloyd, 1999).\n\nAnother criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a \"real\" existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)\n\nOthers criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of \"doing\" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.\n\n== Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard ==\nIn ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/postmoderncondit00lyot}}</ref> In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.\n\nLyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: \"be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear\" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth.\n\nLyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize \"audit culture\" and \"global performativity\".\n\nAgainst performativity and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.\n\n== Jacques Derrida ==\nPhilosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language.\n\nIn \"Signature, Event, Context,\" Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker (\"signature\") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.<blockquote>Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called \"normal.\" What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?<ref>{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}</ref></blockquote>Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions.\n\n==John Searle's reformulation==\nIn ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref> Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin's theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: \"In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin's taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|pages=12|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref>\n\nHis last key departure from Austin lies in Searle's claim that four of his universal 'acts' do not need 'extra-linguistic' contexts to succeed.<ref name=\"John1979\">{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|last=Searle|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1979|pages=7|authorlink=John Searle}}</ref> As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the \"rules of language\".<ref name=\"John1979\" />\n\n== Various applications ==\n=== Finance and economics ===\nIn economics, the \"performativity thesis\" is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}</ref><ref name=\"doing\">{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}</ref> This theory was developed by Michel Callon in ''The Laws of the Markets'', before being further developed in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &#124; Ivan Boldyrev &#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}</ref> The most important work in the field is that of [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald MacKenzie]] and Yuval Millo<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald|last2=Millo|first2=Yuval|date=2003|title=Constructing a Market, Performing Theory: The Historical Sociology of a Financial Derivatives Exchange|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/374404|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=109|issue=1|pages=107\u2013145|doi=10.1086/374404|issn=0002-9602}}</ref> on the social construction of financial markets. In a seminal article, they showed that the option pricing theory called [[Black\u2013Scholes model|BSM]] (Black-Scholes-Merton) has been successful empirically not because of the discovery of preexisting price regularities, but because participants used it to set option prices, so that it made itself true.\n\nThe thesis of performativity of economics has been extensively criticized by Nicolas Brisset in ''Economics and Performativity''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economics and Performativity|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018}}</ref> Brisset defends the idea that the notion of performativity used by Callonian and Latourian sociologists leads to an overly relativistic view of the social world. Drawing on the work of [[J. L. Austin|John Austin]] and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], Brisset theorizes the idea of limits to performativity.To do this, Brisset considers that a theory, in order to be \"performative\", must become a convection. This requires conditions to be met. To take a convention status, a theory will have to:\n\n* Provide social actors with a representation of their social world allowing them to choose among several actions (\"Empiricity\" condition);\n* Indicate an option considered relevant when the agreement is generalised (\"Self-fulfilling\" condition);\n* Be compatible with all the conventions constituting the social environment (\"Coherency\" condition);<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=2016-04-02|title=Economics is not always performative: some limits for performativity|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1350178X.2016.1172805|journal=Journal of Economic Methodology|volume=23|issue=2|pages=160\u2013184|doi=10.1080/1350178X.2016.1172805|issn=1350-178X}}</ref>\n\nBased on this framework, Brisset criticized the seminal work of MacKenzie and Millo on the performativity of the Black-Scholes-Merton financial model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brisset|first=Nicolas|date=December 2017|title=ON PERFORMATIVITY: OPTION THEORY AND THE RESISTANCE OF FINANCIAL PHENOMENA|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-history-of-economic-thought/article/on-performativity-option-theory-and-the-resistance-of-financial-phenomena/5EA4680D1294F9D4593FCAB4FBAB1421#fndtn-metrics|journal=Journal of the History of Economic Thought|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=549\u2013569|doi=10.1017/S1053837217000128|issn=1053-8372}}</ref> \n\nMacKenzie's approach was also criticized by Uskali Maki for not using the concept of performativity in accordance with Austin's formulation<ref>{{Citation|last=M\u00e4ki|first=Uskali|title=Performativity: Saving Austin From Mackenzie|date=2013|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MKIPSA|work=EPSA11 Perspectives and Foundational Problems in Philosophy of Science|pages=443\u2013453|editor-last=Karakostas|editor-first=Vassilios|publisher=Springer|access-date=2020-04-14|editor2-last=Dieks|editor2-first=Dennis}}</ref>.

In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: \"The gates of the wall are wide open.\" (\u201eDie Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.\u201d) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubil\u00e4um - der sch\u00f6nste Fehler in 40 Jahren \"Tagesthemen\"}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}</ref>\n\n===Video art===\n\nTheories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Mu\u00f1oz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, \"The Transformation.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author=Mu\u00f1oz|authorlink=Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz}}</ref>\n\nAlthough historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*Austin, J.

Less common side effects included other infections such as [[herpes zoster]], [[herpes simplex]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, and [[gastroenteritis]].<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\n== Interactions ==\n\nBeing [[metabolised]] only to a small extent, the substance has a low potential for interactions. In studies, inhibitors of the liver enzymes [[CYP3A4]], [[CYP2C19]] and [[CYP2C9]], as well as the CYP3A4 [[Enzyme inducer|inducer]] [[rifampicin]], had no relevant influence on baricitinib concentrations in the bloodstream.

Via a [[signal transduction]] pathway involving [[STAT protein]]s, this ultimately modulates [[gene expression]] in immunological cells.<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nThe substance is quickly absorbed from the gut with an absolute [[bioavailability]] of 79%. It reaches highest [[blood plasma]] levels after about an hour, in different individuals ranging from 0.5 to 3 hours. Food intake has no relevant influence on the drug's pharmacokinetics. 50% of the circulating baricitinib are bound to blood [[plasma protein]]s.<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\nLess than 10% of the substance is metabolised to four different oxidation products by CYP3A4; the rest is left unchanged.

[[methotrexate]].<ref name=\"EMA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/human/004085/WC500223723.pdf|title=Olumiant: EPAR \u2013 Product

letter indicated that the FDA was unable to approve the application in its current form. Specifically, the FDA indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate doses and that additional data is necessary to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn 23 April, 2018, an FDA Advisory Committee recommended approval of baricitinib 2mg for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but did not recommend the 4mg dose, citing serious adverse events.<ref name=\"FDA\">[https://www.fda.gov/downloads/advisorycommittees/committeesmeetingmaterials/drugs/arthritisadvisorycommittee/ucm605061.pdf FDA Briefing Document \u2014Arthritis Advisory Committee Meeting]</ref> On 31 May 2018 FDA approved Barictinib for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies.<ref name=\"Olumiant FDA label\">{{cite web | title=Olumiant- baricitinib tablet, film coated | website=DailyMed | date=13 November 2019 | url=https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=866e9f35-9035-4581-a4b1-75a621ab55cf | access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Contraindications==\nDuring pregnancy, the use of baricitinib is contraindicated.<ref name=\"EMA\" /><ref name=\"Drugs.com pregnancy\" />\n\n==Side effects==\nIn studies, [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s and high blood [[cholesterol]] levels ([[hypercholesterolemia]]) occurred in more than 10% of patients. Less common side effects included other infections such as [[herpes zoster]], [[herpes simplex]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, and [[gastroenteritis]].<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\n== Interactions ==\n\nBeing [[metabolised]] only to a small extent, the substance has a low potential for interactions. In studies, inhibitors of the liver enzymes [[CYP3A4]], [[CYP2C19]] and [[CYP2C9]], as well as the CYP3A4 [[Enzyme inducer|inducer]] [[rifampicin]], had no relevant influence on baricitinib concentrations in the bloodstream. While it blocks a number of [[transporter protein]]s ''[[in vitro]]'', clinically relevant interactions via this mechanism are considered very unlikely, except perhaps for the cation transporter [[SLC22A1]] (OCT1).<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\nAn additive effect with other [[immunosuppressant]]s cannot be excluded.<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\n==Pharmacology==\n===Mechanism of action===\n{{further|Janus kinase inhibitor#Mechanism of action}}\nBaricitinib reversibly inhibits [[Janus kinase 1]] with a [[half maximal inhibitory concentration]] (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 5.9&nbsp;[[nanomolar|nM]] and [[Janus kinase 2]] with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.7&nbsp;nM.  [[Tyrosine kinase 2]], which belongs to the same enzyme family, is affected less (IC<sub>50</sub> = 53&nbsp;nM), and [[Janus kinase 3]] even much less (IC<sub>50</sub> > 400&nbsp;nM). Via a [[signal transduction]] pathway involving [[STAT protein]]s, this ultimately modulates [[gene expression]] in immunological cells.<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nThe substance is quickly absorbed from the gut with an absolute [[bioavailability]] of 79%. It reaches highest [[blood plasma]] levels after about an hour, in different individuals ranging from 0.5 to 3 hours. Food intake has no relevant influence on the drug's pharmacokinetics. 50% of the circulating baricitinib are bound to blood [[plasma protein]]s.<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\nLess than 10% of the substance is metabolised to four different oxidation products by CYP3A4; the rest is left unchanged. [[Elimination half-life]] is 12.5 hours on average. About 75% is eliminated via the urine, and 20% via the [[faeces]].<ref name=\"EMA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Clinical trials===\n{{as of|2016|8}} 31 clinical trials had been registered for baricitinib of
