He was [[Secretary of State for War]] between 1905 and 1912 during which time the \"[[Haldane Reforms]]\" of the British Army were implemented. Raised to the peerage as [[Viscount Haldane]] in 1911, he was [[Lord Chancellor]] between 1912 and 1915, when he was forced to resign because of false allegations of German sympathies. He later joined the Labour Party and once again served as Lord Chancellor in 1924 in the first ever Labour administration. Apart from his legal and political careers, Haldane was also an influential writer on philosophy, in recognition of which he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1914.\n\n==Background and education==\nHaldane was born at 17 [[Charlotte Square]], Edinburgh, the son of Robert Haldane and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson. He was the grandson of the Scottish evangelist [[James Alexander Haldane]], the brother of respiratory [[physiologist]] [[John Scott Haldane]], [[William Haldane|Sir William Haldane]] and author [[Elizabeth Haldane]], and the uncle of [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Naomi Mitchison]].\n\nHe received his first education at the [[Edinburgh Academy]], and then at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He gained a first and MA at [[University of Edinburgh]]<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\" /> where he received first-class honours in Philosophy and as Gray scholar and Ferguson scholar in philosophy of the four Scottish Universities.\n\nAfter studying law in London, he was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]], in 1879,<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/> and became a successful lawyer. He was taken on at 5 New Square Chambers by [[Horace Davey, Baron Davey|Lord Davey]] in 1882 as the junior.  Haldane's practice was a specialism in [[conveyancing]]; a particular skill for pleadings at appeal and tribunal cases, bringing cases to the privy council and house of Lords.  By 1890 he had become a [[Queen's Counsel]].<ref name=\"LG26018\" /> By 1905 he was earning [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000 per annum at the Bar{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} ({{Inflation|index=UK|currsign=\u00a3|value=20000|start_year=1905|fmt=eq|r=-5}}). He became a [[bencher]] at Lincoln's Inn in 1893.  Amongst his early friends was [[Edmund Gosse]], the scholarly librarian at the inn's law library, whose help made Haldane well known for being fully prepared in court and parliamentary briefs.\n\nHaldane was a deep thinker, an unusual breed: a philosopher-politician.  During his stay at G\u00f6ttingen he expanded an interest in the German philosophers, Schopenauer and Hegel.  He had refused a place at Balliol, but in nodding respect for the Master and philosopher, [[Thomas Hill Green|T H Green]], he dedicated his Schopenauer translation ''The World as Will and Idea'' which he carried through with a friend, [[Peter Hume Brown]], the Scottish historian.\n\n==Early political career==\nA cousin, the Whig politician [[Robert Adam Philips Haldane Haldane-Duncan, 3rd Earl of Camperdown|Lord Camperdown]] encouraged the young barrister into standing as a Liberal at the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|General Election of 1880]]. Although not elected that year Haldane joined the [[Eighty Club]], a political dining and discussion club formed in 1879. Membership was restricted to Liberals under the age of forty. In 1881 Haldane met [[H. H. Asquith]], and they soon became firm friends often meeting the Blue Post Public house on Cork Street. They were founders of the Albert Grey committee, named after Earl Grey, regularly discussing burning social issues, such as education.\n\nIn November 1885 Haldane was elected [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Haddingtonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Haddingtonshire]], a seat he held until 1911.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/><ref name=\"leighrayment.com\" /> The philosopher-politician wrote several articles for the advanced and progressive ''Contemporary Review''.  In October 1888, \"The Liberal Creed\" was published summarising his belief in the direction of New Liberalism.  In the 1890 article  \"The Eight Hours Question\" Haldane rejected the idea of the eight-hour day.  In 1888, he courted Emma Valentine Ferguson, sister of his Liberal party friend, [[Ronald Munro-Ferguson]]; she broke off the engagement and subsequently lampooned him in her novel ''Betsy'' in 1892.  Haldane became firmly ensconced in the Imperialist wing of Liberalism, led by Sir Edward Grey.  At the 1892 General Election, he received a shock when nearly defeated by the Liberal Unionist Master of Polwarth. [[Beatrice Webb]], the socialist who was a close intimate, remarked on how alone Haldane was in the world.{{sfn|Webb|1948|p=98}} Haldane added the preface to [[L T Hobhouse]]'s ''The Labour Movement'' in 1893.  Sadly Emma Ferguson died insane in 1897.  ''He had pathos in his personality'', remarked Webb, ''a successful lawyer tinged with socialism''.{{sfn|Webb|1986|p=345}}\n\n===Liberal Imperialist===\nFocusing on his writings, Haldane was passed over for political office, being the only one of his group left out in the wilderness.  Haldane remained an ally of Asquith and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] in the [[Liberal Imperialist]] wing of the party, followers of Lord Rosebery rather than of Sir William Harcourt. Rosebery admired Haldane's intellect, and the Scotsman urged upon his friend, whom he had known since 1886, an assault on Tory power in the Lords in 1894.<ref name=\"Rosebery\" />  Haldane joined friends at the Articles Club, including Asquith and Grey. Haldane was disappointed having failed to secure the post of Solicitor-General in October 1894. At the time, Asquith wryly remarked, ''A very wrong decision come to upon inadequate grounds.''{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 335}} Haldane was sounded out of the Speakership by Rosebery, but refused it, declaring it to be a political death. The post went eventually to W Gully in 1895.\n\nAt a meeting with [[Beatrice Webb]], the Fabian socialist, Haldane told her he was disconsolate at the condition of the Liberal Party: \"Rot has set in there is no hope now but to be beaten and then reconstruct a new party\".{{efn|Diary of Beatrice Webb, 20 January 1895,<ref name=\"Passfield Papers\" /> cited in {{harvnb|McKinstry|2005|pp= 338-339}} }} The leaders of the party were exasperated and believed Rosebery to lack planning and direction. \"Although Asquith, Grey and I\", wrote Haldane, \"stuck by him... we never knew when he would retire and leave us in the lurch\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Note to his letters}} When Rosebery offered the Speakership, he refused it that March.{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc= Mss NLS 5951}} However, on 11 October 1896, he wrote to Rosebery that he \"was the leader of a revolution in our party\".{{sfn|Matthew|2011}}\n\nOn 11 August 1902, Haldane was admitted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]],<ref name=\"LG27464\" /> following an announcement of the King's intention to make the appointment in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list, published in June that year.<ref name=\"TheTimes1902\" /> The King used his influence and charm to cultivate allies, bringing cross-party groups like [[The Souls]] together in consensual amity.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|p=}} Balfour's administration leant on Haldane's philosophy for educational reforms.\n\nAfter the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Arthur Balfour]] fell in December 1905 there was some speculation that Asquith and his allies Haldane and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] would refuse to serve unless Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. Haldane had suggested involving the King at Balmoral to 'kick CB upstairs'.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=397-398}}However, the plot (called \"[[The Relugas Compact]]\" after Grey's Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Campbell-Bannerman.{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|pp=467-468}}\n\nHaldane wrote, \"One longs for Rosebery had he been coming in to his right place at the head of affairs, we could have gone anywhere with confidence. But it seems now as if this were not to be and we have to do the only thing we can do, which is to resolutely follow a plan of concerted action\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Letter from Lord Haldane to Sir Francis Knollys, Private Secretary to Edward VII on 12 September 1905}}\n\nOn 13 December 1905, Haldane was appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], but he may have been offered the jobs of Attorney-General and Home Secretary.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} (Grey became Foreign Secretary).<ref name=\"LG27862\" /> Unity in the Liberals helped them obtain the largest electoral majority in the party's history in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 476}}\n\n==Secretary of State for War==\nAs early as January 1906 Haldane was persuaded by fellow Liberal Imperialist Edward Grey to begin planning for a Continental war in support of the French against the Germans.{{efn|He invited Colonel Huguet, the French Military Attache to Plan at War Office from Jan 1906.{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} }} However, Haldane's first estimates reduced the Army by 16,600 men and reduced expenditure by \u00a32.6m to \u00a328&nbsp;million, as the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment.{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}} By 1914 Britain spent 3.4% of national income on defence, little more in absolute terms than Austria-Hungary's 6.1%.  Army expenditure was determined according to a formula devised by the Esher Committee. In 1900, during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], army expenditure was \u00a386.8m, by 1910 (a low point, after four years of cuts under the Liberals) it had dropped to \u00a327.6m and by 1914 it had risen back to \u00a329.4m.  In March 1914 effective expenditure on the Army, after allowing for increased pensions and \u00a31m set aside for military aviation, was still less than in 1907\u20138, and \u00a32m less than in 1905-6 (despite a 20% rise in prices since then).{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}}\n\nIn October 1907 Haldane was intimately involved with the negotiations at Windsor with Kaiser Wilhelm. The Germanophile and linguist was thrilled to be summoned at 1&nbsp;am to talk with the Emperor on arms reduction principles over whisky. But the import was the Baghdad-Berlin railway which Germany was hoping to construct with British approval.  A fluent German-speaker, Haldane was lulled into a false sense of security believing 'like a bear with a sore head' that he had won a great deal.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|p=}}{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=414-415}}{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=}} Another such conference took place at Balmoral in September 1909.  The Kaiser arrogantly insisted that only the King was of equal rank.\n\nDespite the budgetary constraints, Haldane implemented a wide-ranging set of reforms of the Army, aimed at preparing the [[British Army|army]] for an Imperial war but with the more likely (and secret) task of a European war. The main element of this was the establishment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} The Official Historian Brigadier Edmonds later wrote that \"in every respect the Expeditionary Force of 1914 was incomparably the best trained, best organised and best equipped British Army ever to leave these shores\"{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=140}}\n\n[[Image:Haldane a West Point.jpg|thumb|left|Haldane at [[West Point]] sometime before the Great War.]]\n\n==Army reforms==\n{{main|Haldane Reforms}}\nHaldane set up the [[Imperial General Staff]]. Before Haldane, there was only the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which met only in emergencies, and the Colonial Defence Committee. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] had recommended the setting up of an Army Council and the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chief, but few of his recommendations had been implemented before the change of government in December 1905.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=138}} Haldane's reforms also created the [[Territorial Force]] of 14 divisions (the original plan was for 28) and 14 mounted Yeomanry brigades at home,{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} the [[Officer Training Corps]] and the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]].\n\nIn all the reforms, Haldane worked closely at the War Office with [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Major-General Haig]]. By coincidence, both men had been born in Charlotte Square, in Edinburgh. [[John Alfred Spender|J. A. Spender]] later wrote of how Haldane got the best work out of an able but verbally-incoherent soldier (thought to refer to Haig) by not scoring verbal points off him, as many politicians would have done.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nUsually critical, Rosebery remarked on Haldane's interest in philosophy, declaring: \"I have read his Secret Memorandum, and that was enough\". In 1907 and 1908, Haldane passed far-reaching reforms to Army management. He was accredited as an efficient bureaucratic leader, notably founding the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in a Second Memorandum. His reforms re-oriented British military policy, revamped army organization along the lines of the German General Staff, upgraded the training of the auxiliary forces, and created an efficient and economically run service. Those reforms enabled Britain to send some 120,000 men to France in fifteen days in August 1914.{{sfn|Bond|1963|pp=33-43}}\n\nHaldane was also instrumental in the creation the [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1909, which provided the fledgling aircraft industry in the United Kingdom with a sound body of science on which to base the development of aircraft for the next seventy years (it was disbanded in 1979).\n\n==Philosopher-politician==\nThroughout his long career and association with the modernisers or 'Limps' Haldane used his considerable intellect to great advantage against economy.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=51-52}} A radical liberal,{{sfn|Tanner|2003|p=45}} Haldane was also, according to historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], one of the \"best supporters\" of David Lloyd George's \"[[People's Budget]].\"{{sfn|Pugh|2014|p=46}} During the constitutional and budget crisis of 1909\u201311, Haldane advised his friend and Prime Minister, Asquith on the legal niceties of his stance towards the monarch, who was outraged at the firebrand speeches from Churchill and Lloyd George. Stumbling from illness to illness, Haldane's own bad health was similar to King Edward's declining fortunes.\n\n[[File:Viscount Haldane LC by Vandyk.jpg|thumb|The Viscount Haldane, Lord Chancellor, 1912]]\nTwo elections ensued, one in January and another in December 1910, before in 1911 he was raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Haldane''', of Cloan in the [[County of Perth]].<ref name=\"LG28480\" /> He became Leader in the Lords, responsible for the passage of the Parliament Act. On [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl of Loreburn|Lord Loreburn's]] retirement in June 1912, Haldane succeeded him as [[Lord Chancellor]],{{sfn|Heuston|1987|pp=166-}} making a self-deprecating speech as to his abilities as a legal expert.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=253}}\n\n==Haldane Mission==\n1912 saw the unsuccessful attempt of the '''Haldane Mission''', an effort to quell the friction between Britain and Germany arising because of [[Anglo-German naval arms race|their naval arms race]].{{sfn|Scott|1918|pp=589\u2013596}} The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a \"naval holiday\" with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where \"Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.\" Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany, even if Germany did not start a war dooming the talks to failure. .{{sfn|Maurer|1992|pp=284\u2013308}}{{sfn|Langhorne|1971|pp= 359\u2013370}} On 19 May 1913 he was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]].\n\n==First World War==\nIn March 1914 Haldane's successor at the War Office, [[Jack Seely]], resigned following the [[Curragh incident]]. Rather than appoint a successor, Asquith decided to take over responsibility for the War Office directly himself. Asquith relied heavily on Haldane as the previous War Secretary and empowered him to carry out tasks at the War Office on his behalf. As the situation in Europe worsened, Asquith kept Haldane abreast of developments with Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office. Haldane was one of the first members of the Cabinet to recognise that war with Germany was inevitable and persuaded Asquith to mobilise by assembly of the Army Council on 3 August.{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}} With war imminent, Asquith was happy for Haldane to continue at the War Office formally as Secretary of State for War, but Haldane persuaded him to appoint [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Kitchener]].{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}}\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War One Haldane was falsely accused of pro-German sympathies, in July 1914, for hosting [[Albert Ballin]], a German shipping magnate and unofficial mediator between Germany and Britain. The accusations were widely believed, even being echoed in a popular music hall song (\"All dressed up and nowhere to go\") in the revue \"Mr Manhattan\". He was harried in particular by [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]]'s ''[[Daily Express]]'', which gave great publicity to the claim by Professor Onkel of Heidelberg that he had said that \"Germany was his spiritual home\". He had in fact said that about Professor [[Hermann Lotze]]'s classroom at G\u00f6ttingen, at a dinner party given by [[Mrs. Humphrey Ward]] in April 1913 to enable him to meet some German professors during his mission.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nIn 1915, Asquith ranked his Cabinet, putting Haldane only sixth of the inner cabinet members.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=}} He also inveigled Kitchener and Haldane to sign the King's Pledge, a vow to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war, which Haldane resented and which Churchill and Asquith himself completely ignored.\n\n==Dismissal from office==\n\nHaldane's dismissal from office in May 1915 is widely regarded by historians as unfair.  Following the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shell crisis]] and the resignation of [[Lord Fisher]] the Liberals were obliged to form a coalition government with the Conservatives who, under the leadership of [[Bonar Law]], insisted on the removal of [[Winston Churchill]] as First Lord of the Admiralty and the dismissal of Haldane.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=188}}{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=360}} Haldane's removal was on account of the popularity of the press's campaign relating to Haldane's alleged pro-German sympathies.{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} Neither the former prime minister [[Arthur Balfour]],  Haldane's closest friend amongst the Conservatives, nor Asquith, the Liberal prime minister of the day and Haldane's closest political ally and friend for over 30 years, did anything to resist Bonar Law's demands.{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp=361-362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} [[Roy Jenkins]] in his biography of Asquith describes the charges as \"absolute nonsense\u201d and [[Max Egremont]] describes Balfour as \"knowing the injustice behind the charges,\u201d and, \u201cbeing privately indignant.\"{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}}\n\nTo the permanent detriment of his previously close relationship with Haldane, Asquith compounded his mistake by not expressing directly to Haldane his feelings on the latter's dismissal and the value of his previous service to the government and country.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|pp=324-328}} Jenkins describes this omission as \u201cthe most uncharacteristic fault of Asquiths whole career\u201d attributing it to Asquith suffering the \"indescribable blow\" of the surprise announcement of the engagement of the woman he loved, [[Venetia Stanley (1887\u20131948)|Venetia Stanley]], to one of his government ministers, [[Edwin Montagu]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp= 362-366}}{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=186}}\n\nFollowing his departure from the government Haldane went to the front to meet his old friend General Haig, and his cousin, General [[Aylmer Haldane]]; but he was exhausted on being ejected from Cabinet.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=268}} Having been awarded the Order of Merit in 1915, in the personal gift of George V, he wrote a Memorandum of Events, 1906\u201315, to defend his reputation. It was published in April 1916. Haldane thought Lloyd George's new government, formed in December 1916, \"very low class\". Haldane told Lord Buckmaster at this time, \"Asquith is a first-class head of a deliberative council. He is versed in precedents, acts on principle, and knows how and when to compromise. Lloyd George knows nothing for precedents and cares for no principles, but he has fire in his belly and that is what we want\".{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=226}}\n\nAs the war progressed Haldane moved increasingly close to the Labour Party, but he was held back by his ties to the Liberal Party and to Asquith. When the [[Irish War of Independence]] broke out in 1919, Haldane was one of the first British politicians to argue that the solution lay in compromise rather than force.\n\n== Contribution to Canadian constitutional law ==\n<!-- Please fix redirects to this section (i.e. (the) wicked stepfather of the Canadian Constitution) if you rename this section. Thanks! -->\nAs Lord Chancellor, Haldane was a member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], at that time the court of last resort for the Empire. He retained the position even when he was no longer Chancellor.  He sat on several cases from Canada dealing with the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments under the [[Canadian Constitution]], particularly the interplay between sections 91 and 92 of the [[British North America Act 1867]]. He gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in several of those cases, and showed a marked tendency to favour the provincial powers at the expense of the federal government.  For instance, in the case of [[Canada v. Alberta|''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'']],<ref>''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'', 1919 [1922] 1 A.C. 191</ref> he gave the decision striking down federal legislation which attempted to regulate the economy, challenging the legality of the Canadian legislature.{{efn|In 1912 Haldane visited the Canadian Bar in Montreal, Quebec Province, described in {{harvnb|Haldane|1914|p=}} }} In doing so, he gave very restrictive readings to both the \"[[peace, order and good government]]\" power of the federal government, as well as the federal [[criminal law power]].  Similarly, in ''[[Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider]]'',<ref>Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, [1925] AC 396.</ref> Lord Haldane struck down a federal statute attempting to regulate industrial disputes, holding that it was not within federal authority under either the peace, order and good government power, nor the federal trade and commerce power. He went so far as to suggest that the trade and commerce power was simply an ancillary federal power, which could not authorise legislation in its own right.  The effects of some of these decisions have subsequently been modified by later decisions of the Judicial Committee and the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but they have had the long-term effect of recognising substantial provincial powers.\n\nHaldane's approach to the division of powers was heavily criticised by some academics and lawyers in Canada, such as [[F. R. Scott]]<ref>F. R. Scott, ''Some Privy Counsel'' (1950), 28 Can. Bar. Rev. 780.</ref> and [[Bora Laskin|Chief Justice Bora Laskin]], as unduly favouring the provinces over the federal government and depriving it of the powers needed to deal with modern economic issues.  More recently, one major study has characterised him as \"the wicked stepfather\" of the Canadian Constitution.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}\n\n==Influence on education==\nIn 1895, Haldane helped the Webbs found the [[London School of Economics]].  A fundamental believer in the power of improving education, he prepared the London University Act 1898.  The philosophy of 'national efficiency' was central feature of the Hegelian complex, and the ideas of Schopenauer, he had learnt on the continent, that accentuated freedom and decentralisation from an historicist's perspective.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}  His moral centrism sought to unify ''The New Liberalism'', as he published it in Contemporary Review.<ref>Contemporary Review, (London 1892),</ref>  From a pan-European perspective he analysed the German character and economic advances towards militarism.  He was largely responsible for the cross-party support for Balfour's Education Act 1902.  He told Rosebery \"a sense of nation is working towards ...a great centre party.\"{{sfn|Matthew|1973|p= 145|ps=: from a letter of 6 October 1902}} He was also involved in the founding of [[Imperial College]] in 1907 and in his honour the University contained the Haldane Recreational Library, now part of the [[Imperial College Central Library|Central Library]].\n\nHaldane was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].  He wrote a biography of Adam Smith, extolling the virtues of free trade.  Unlike Chamberlain, he thought there was no strong connection between fiscal and imperial unity.  He opposed any attempt to protection of British trade.{{sfn|Ashley|1904|loc=Preface}}{{sfn|Matthew|1973|pp= 166\u2013168}}\n\nIn 1904, he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the Club's annual dinner, addressing \"The dedicated life\" to a group of students on 10 January 1907.  He also served as second [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Bristol]] where he made an important address titled \"The Civic University\" outlining his educational philosophy in 1911.  At the end of his life Lord Haldane was elected Chancellor of the [[University of St Andrews]] in June 1928.  Perhaps his greatest speech on education was made in House of Lords on 12 July 1916, at the height of the terrible slaughter on the Western Front.{{sfn|Ashby|Anderson|1970|p=135}}\n\n==Writings==\nHaldane co-translated the first English edition of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', published between 1883 and 1886. He wrote several philosophical works, the best known of which is ''The Reign of Relativity'' (1921), which dealt with the philosophical implications of the [[theory of relativity]]. Haldane published \"The Pathway to Reality\", based on the [[Gifford Lectures]] which he had delivered at the [[University of St Andrews]].{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=136}} Some of his public addresses have also been published, including ''[[s:The future of democracy|The future of democracy]]'' (1918).\n\n* {{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality|date=1903|publisher=John Murray|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/pathwaytorealit03haldgoog}}\n\n*{{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality: Stage the Second|date=1904|publisher=E.

He suffered from bad rheumatism, a stigmata in the eye and in 1909, he had to take bed rest when going blind from iritis. A lifelong walker and cigar smoker, he was diagnosed diabetic. \"The latter is a large, fat man\" was [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]]'s initial impression of a dignified but portly demeanour.  Yet, added Haig, \"One seems to like the man at once.\" Having worked on the Army Regulations of 1909, Haig applauded \"a most clear headed and practical man\u2013\u2013very ready to listen and weigh carefully all that is said to him.\" [[Osbert Sitwell]] described him as \"entering a room with the air of a whole procession\". [[Leo Amery]] said he looked like \"the old-fashioned family butler\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} Another Imperialist, Winston Churchill also respected Haldane, although they were from differing social backgrounds. On promoting Churchill to First Lord of the Admiralty, Asquith advised him to seek Haldane's advice at a meeting held at Archerfield, North Berwick.{{efn|Haldane was impressed by the younger man's public speech at Bradford on 15 July 1898 during his early radicalism.}} From 1907 to 1908, he was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]].\n\nHaldane remained a lifelong bachelor after his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Valentine Ferguson, broke off their engagement. He died suddenly of heart disease at his home in [[Auchterarder]], Scotland, on 19 August 1928, aged 72.<ref name=\"nytimes19280820\" /> The viscountcy became extinct on his death.\n\n==Later years==\nIn December 1918, Lloyd George appointed Haldane chairman of 'The Machinery of Government' committee.<ref name=\"civilservant.org.uk\" /> However, the Armistice had taken all impetus out of the reform agenda.\n\nAt the time of the [[1920 Paisley by-election|Paisley by-election of January 1920]] Haldane was in the process of shifting his sympathies from Liberal to Labour, and was wrongly thought to have endorsed Labour (earning a rebuke from [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]], whom Haldane thought \"tiresome because she is ignorant\", to his aged mother). In fact he favoured Asquith's election on a personal level.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=246-247}}\n\nBeing a fluent German speaker, ascetic philosopher and atheist, he played host to [[Albert Einstein]], when he visited London in 1921.  As President of the Institute of Public Administration, he was a leading intellectual on the philosophy of governance. \"The Reign of Relativity\" combined Haldane's love of all things German expressed by Goethe and his works, with the Hegelian military-industrial complex.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|loc=A Hegelian Army|pp=183-185.}} Haldane admired the fact that Germans were \"trained to obey\".{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} Hegel's aristocratic desire for law and order and defence of property against revolution had a mathematical symmetry. Hegel was a purist: his work attempted to keep science and philosophy apart  The rising tide of New Liberalism and moral realism was for Haldane, Hegel's philological precept to improve behaviour, using the empiricism of scientific data as a proof.{{sfn|Haldane|1922|p=}}{{sfn|Haldane|1926|p=}}\n\nHaldane refused to join the platform for Asquith's speech at [[Westminster Central Hall]] in January 1922.

In speech fluent and even infinite he yielded to no living idealist in the easy coinage of sentimental phraseology. Here, indeed, he was a match for those who distributed the chloroform of Berlin. Do we not remember, for instance, that Germany was his spiritual home? But he none the less prepared himself, and the Empire, to talk when the time came with his spiritual friends in language not in the least spiritual. He devised the Territorial Army, which was capable of becoming the easy nucleus of national conscription, and which unquestionably ought to have been used for that purpose at the outbreak of war. He created the Imperial General Staff. He founded the Officers' Training Corps.\n|source={{citation|author=Lord Birkenhead|author-link=F. E.

He was [[Secretary of State for War]] between 1905 and 1912 during which time the \"[[Haldane Reforms]]\" of the British Army were implemented. Raised to the peerage as [[Viscount Haldane]] in 1911, he was [[Lord Chancellor]] between 1912 and 1915, when he was forced to resign because of false allegations of German sympathies. He later joined the Labour Party and once again served as Lord Chancellor in 1924 in the first ever Labour administration. Apart from his legal and political careers, Haldane was also an influential writer on philosophy, in recognition of which he was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 1914.\n\n==Background and education==\nHaldane was born at 17 [[Charlotte Square]], Edinburgh, the son of Robert Haldane and his wife Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Burdon-Sanderson. He was the grandson of the Scottish evangelist [[James Alexander Haldane]], the brother of respiratory [[physiologist]] [[John Scott Haldane]], [[William Haldane|Sir William Haldane]] and author [[Elizabeth Haldane]], and the uncle of [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and [[Naomi Mitchison]].\n\nHe received his first education at the [[Edinburgh Academy]], and then at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]. He gained a first and MA at [[University of Edinburgh]]<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\" /> where he received first-class honours in Philosophy and as Gray scholar and Ferguson scholar in philosophy of the four Scottish Universities.\n\nAfter studying law in London, he was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by [[Lincoln's Inn]], in 1879,<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/> and became a successful lawyer. He was taken on at 5 New Square Chambers by [[Horace Davey, Baron Davey|Lord Davey]] in 1882 as the junior.  Haldane's practice was a specialism in [[conveyancing]]; a particular skill for pleadings at appeal and tribunal cases, bringing cases to the privy council and house of Lords.  By 1890 he had become a [[Queen's Counsel]].<ref name=\"LG26018\" /> By 1905 he was earning [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000 per annum at the Bar{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} ({{Inflation|index=UK|currsign=\u00a3|value=20000|start_year=1905|fmt=eq|r=-5}}). He became a [[bencher]] at Lincoln's Inn in 1893.  Amongst his early friends was [[Edmund Gosse]], the scholarly librarian at the inn's law library, whose help made Haldane well known for being fully prepared in court and parliamentary briefs.\n\nHaldane was a deep thinker, an unusual breed: a philosopher-politician.  During his stay at G\u00f6ttingen he expanded an interest in the German philosophers, Schopenauer and Hegel.  He had refused a place at Balliol, but in nodding respect for the Master and philosopher, [[Thomas Hill Green|T H Green]], he dedicated his Schopenauer translation ''The World as Will and Idea'' which he carried through with a friend, [[Peter Hume Brown]], the Scottish historian.\n\n==Early political career==\nA cousin, the Whig politician [[Robert Adam Philips Haldane Haldane-Duncan, 3rd Earl of Camperdown|Lord Camperdown]] encouraged the young barrister into standing as a Liberal at the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|General Election of 1880]]. Although not elected that year Haldane joined the [[Eighty Club]], a political dining and discussion club formed in 1879. Membership was restricted to Liberals under the age of forty. In 1881 Haldane met [[H. H. Asquith]], and they soon became firm friends often meeting the Blue Post Public house on Cork Street. They were founders of the Albert Grey committee, named after Earl Grey, regularly discussing burning social issues, such as education.\n\nIn November 1885 Haldane was elected [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament for [[Haddingtonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Haddingtonshire]], a seat he held until 1911.<ref name=\"thepeerage.com\"/><ref name=\"leighrayment.com\" /> The philosopher-politician wrote several articles for the advanced and progressive ''Contemporary Review''.  In October 1888, \"The Liberal Creed\" was published summarising his belief in the direction of New Liberalism.  In the 1890 article  \"The Eight Hours Question\" Haldane rejected the idea of the eight-hour day.  In 1888, he courted Emma Valentine Ferguson, sister of his Liberal party friend, [[Ronald Munro-Ferguson]]; she broke off the engagement and subsequently lampooned him in her novel ''Betsy'' in 1892.  Haldane became firmly ensconced in the Imperialist wing of Liberalism, led by Sir Edward Grey.  At the 1892 General Election, he received a shock when nearly defeated by the Liberal Unionist Master of Polwarth. [[Beatrice Webb]], the socialist who was a close intimate, remarked on how alone Haldane was in the world.{{sfn|Webb|1948|p=98}} Haldane added the preface to [[L T Hobhouse]]'s ''The Labour Movement'' in 1893.  Sadly Emma Ferguson died insane in 1897.  ''He had pathos in his personality'', remarked Webb, ''a successful lawyer tinged with socialism''.{{sfn|Webb|1986|p=345}}\n\n===Liberal Imperialist===\nFocusing on his writings, Haldane was passed over for political office, being the only one of his group left out in the wilderness.  Haldane remained an ally of Asquith and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] in the [[Liberal Imperialist]] wing of the party, followers of Lord Rosebery rather than of Sir William Harcourt. Rosebery admired Haldane's intellect, and the Scotsman urged upon his friend, whom he had known since 1886, an assault on Tory power in the Lords in 1894.<ref name=\"Rosebery\" />  Haldane joined friends at the Articles Club, including Asquith and Grey. Haldane was disappointed having failed to secure the post of Solicitor-General in October 1894. At the time, Asquith wryly remarked, ''A very wrong decision come to upon inadequate grounds.''{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 335}} Haldane was sounded out of the Speakership by Rosebery, but refused it, declaring it to be a political death. The post went eventually to W Gully in 1895.\n\nAt a meeting with [[Beatrice Webb]], the Fabian socialist, Haldane told her he was disconsolate at the condition of the Liberal Party: \"Rot has set in there is no hope now but to be beaten and then reconstruct a new party\".{{efn|Diary of Beatrice Webb, 20 January 1895,<ref name=\"Passfield Papers\" /> cited in {{harvnb|McKinstry|2005|pp= 338-339}} }} The leaders of the party were exasperated and believed Rosebery to lack planning and direction. \"Although Asquith, Grey and I\", wrote Haldane, \"stuck by him... we never knew when he would retire and leave us in the lurch\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Note to his letters}} When Rosebery offered the Speakership, he refused it that March.{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc= Mss NLS 5951}} However, on 11 October 1896, he wrote to Rosebery that he \"was the leader of a revolution in our party\".{{sfn|Matthew|2011}}\n\nOn 11 August 1902, Haldane was admitted to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]],<ref name=\"LG27464\" /> following an announcement of the King\u2032s intention to make the appointment in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list, published in June that year.<ref name=\"TheTimes1902\" /> The King used his influence and charm to cultivate allies, bringing cross-party groups like [[The Souls]] together in consensual amity.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|p=}} Balfour's administration leant on Haldane's philosophy for educational reforms.\n\nAfter the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Arthur Balfour]] fell in December 1905 there was some speculation that Asquith and his allies Haldane and [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] would refuse to serve unless Campbell-Bannerman accepted a peerage, which would have left Asquith as the real leader in the House of Commons. Haldane had suggested involving the King at Balmoral to 'kick CB upstairs'.{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=397-398}}However, the plot (called \"[[The Relugas Compact]]\" after Grey's Scottish lodge where the men met) collapsed when Asquith agreed to serve as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] under Campbell-Bannerman.{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|pp=467-468}}\n\nHaldane wrote, \"One longs for Rosebery had he been coming in to his right place at the head of affairs, we could have gone anywhere with confidence. But it seems now as if this were not to be and we have to do the only thing we can do, which is to resolutely follow a plan of concerted action\".{{sfn|Haldane Papers|loc=Letter from Lord Haldane to Sir Francis Knollys, Private Secretary to Edward VII on 12 September 1905}}\n\nOn 13 December 1905, Haldane was appointed [[Secretary of State for War]], but he may have been offered the jobs of Attorney-General and Home Secretary.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} (Grey became Foreign Secretary).<ref name=\"LG27862\" /> Unity in the Liberals helped them obtain the largest electoral majority in the party's history in the [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906 general election]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2005|p= 476}}\n\n==Secretary of State for War==\nAs early as January 1906 Haldane was persuaded by fellow Liberal Imperialist Edward Grey to begin planning for a Continental war in support of the French against the Germans.{{efn|He invited Colonel Huguet, the French Military Attache to Plan at War Office from Jan 1906.{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} }} However, Haldane's first estimates reduced the Army by 16,600 men and reduced expenditure by \u00a32.6m to \u00a328&nbsp;million, as the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment.{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}} By 1914 Britain spent 3.4% of national income on defence, little more in absolute terms than Austria-Hungary's 6.1%.  Army expenditure was determined according to a formula devised by the Esher Committee. In 1900, during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], army expenditure was \u00a386.8m, by 1910 (a low point, after four years of cuts under the Liberals) it had dropped to \u00a327.6m and by 1914 it had risen back to \u00a329.4m.  In March 1914 effective expenditure on the Army, after allowing for increased pensions and \u00a31m set aside for military aviation, was still less than in 1907-8, and \u00a32m less than in 1905-6 (despite a 20% rise in prices since then).{{sfn|Reid|2006|pp=136-137}}\n\nIn October 1907 Haldane was intimately involved with the negotiations at Windsor with Kaiser Wilhelm. The Germanophile and linguist was thrilled to be summoned at 1&nbsp;am to talk with the Emperor on arms reduction principles over whisky. But the import was the Baghdad-Berlin railway which Germany was hoping to construct with British approval.  A fluent German-speaker, Haldane was lulled into a false sense of security believing 'like a bear with a sore head' that he had won a great deal.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|p=}}{{sfn|Ridley|2012|pp=414-415}}{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=}} Another such conference took place at Balmoral in September 1909.  The Kaiser arrogantly insisted that only the King was of equal rank.\n\nDespite the budgetary constraints, Haldane implemented a wide-ranging set of reforms of the Army, aimed at preparing the [[British Army|army]] for an Imperial war but with the more likely (and secret) task of a European war. The main element of this was the establishment of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] of six infantry divisions and one cavalry division.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} The Official Historian Brigadier Edmonds later wrote that \"in every respect the Expeditionary Force of 1914 was incomparably the best trained, best organised and best equipped British Army ever to leave these shores\"{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=140}}\n\n[[Image:Haldane a West Point.jpg|thumb|left|Haldane at [[West Point]] sometime before the Great War.]]\n\n==Army reforms==\n{{main|Haldane Reforms}}\nHaldane set up the [[Imperial General Staff]]. Before Haldane, there was only the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, which met only in emergencies, and the Colonial Defence Committee. [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Esher]] had recommended the setting up of an Army Council and the abolition of the post of Commander-in-Chief, but few of his recommendations had been implemented before the change of government in December 1905.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=138}} Haldane's reforms also created the [[Territorial Force]] of 14 divisions (the original plan was for 28) and 14 mounted Yeomanry brigades at home,{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=134}} the [[Officer Training Corps]] and the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]].\n\nIn all the reforms, Haldane worked closely at the War Office with [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Major-General Haig]]. By coincidence, both men had been born in Charlotte Square, in Edinburgh. [[John Alfred Spender|J. A. Spender]] later wrote of how Haldane got the best work out of an able but verbally-incoherent soldier (thought to refer to Haig) by not scoring verbal points off him, as many politicians would have done.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nUsually critical, Rosebery remarked on Haldane's interest in philosophy, declaring: \"I have read his Secret Memorandum, and that was enough\". In 1907 and 1908, Haldane passed far-reaching reforms to Army management. He was accredited as an efficient bureaucratic leader, notably founding the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in a Second Memorandum. His reforms re-oriented British military policy, revamped army organization along the lines of the German General Staff, upgraded the training of the auxiliary forces, and created an efficient and economically run service. Those reforms enabled Britain to send some 120,000 men to France in fifteen days in August 1914.{{sfn|Bond|1963|pp=33-43}}\n\nHaldane was also instrumental in the creation the [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1909, which provided the fledgling aircraft industry in the United Kingdom with a sound body of science on which to base the development of aircraft for the next seventy years (it was disbanded in 1979).\n\n==Philosopher-politician==\nThroughout his long career and association with the modernisers or 'Limps' Haldane used his considerable intellect to great advantage against economy.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=51-52}} A radical liberal,{{sfn|Tanner|2003|p=45}} Haldane was also, according to historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], one of the \"best supporters\" of David Lloyd George's \"[[People's Budget]].\"{{sfn|Pugh|2014|p=46}} During the constitutional and budget crisis of 1909\u201311, Haldane advised his friend and Prime Minister, Asquith on the legal niceties of his stance towards the monarch, who was outraged at the firebrand speeches from Churchill and Lloyd George. Stumbling from illness to illness, Haldane's own bad health was similar to King Edward's declining fortunes.\n\n[[File:Viscount Haldane LC by Vandyk.jpg|thumb|The Viscount Haldane, Lord Chancellor, 1912]]\nTwo elections ensued, one in January and another in December 1910, before in 1911 he was raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Haldane''', of Cloan in the [[County of Perth]].<ref name=\"LG28480\" /> He became Leader in the Lords, responsible for the passage of the Parliament Act. On [[Robert Reid, 1st Earl of Loreburn|Lord Loreburn's]] retirement in June 1912, Haldane succeeded him as [[Lord Chancellor]],{{sfn|Heuston|1987|pp=166-}} making a self-deprecating speech as to his abilities as a legal expert.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|p=253}}\n\n==Haldane Mission==\n1912 saw the unsuccessful attempt of the '''Haldane Mission''', an effort to quell the friction between Britain and Germany arising because of [[Anglo-German naval arms race|their naval arms race]].{{sfn|Scott|1918|pp=589\u2013596}} The mission was a failure because the Germans attempted to link a \"naval holiday\" with a British promise to remain neutral if Germany should become engaged in a war where \"Germany could not be said to be the aggressor.\" Essentially, the British reserved the right to join whatever country was attacking Germany, even if Germany did not start a war dooming the talks to failure. .{{sfn|Maurer|1992|pp=284\u2013308}}{{sfn|Langhorne|1971|pp= 359\u2013370}} On 19 May 1913 he was appointed a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]].\n\n==First World War==\nIn March 1914 Haldane's successor at the War Office, [[Jack Seely]], resigned following the [[Curragh incident]]. Rather than appoint a successor, Asquith decided to take over responsibility for the War Office directly himself. Asquith relied heavily on Haldane as the previous War Secretary and empowered him to carry out tasks at the War Office on his behalf. As the situation in Europe worsened, Asquith kept Haldane abreast of developments with Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office. Haldane was one of the first members of the Cabinet to recognise that war with Germany was inevitable and persuaded Asquith to mobilise by assembly of the Army Council on 3 August.{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}} With war imminent, Asquith was happy for Haldane to continue at the War Office formally as Secretary of State for War, but Haldane persuaded him to appoint [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Field Marshal Kitchener]].{{sfn|Maurice|1937|p=355}}\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War One Haldane was falsely accused of pro-German sympathies, in July 1914, for hosting [[Albert Ballin]], a German shipping magnate and unofficial mediator between Germany and Britain. The accusations were widely believed, even being echoed in a popular music hall song (\"All dressed up and nowhere to go\") in the revue \"Mr Manhattan\". He was harried in particular by [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]]'s ''[[Daily Express]]'', which gave great publicity to the claim by Professor Onkel of Heidelberg that he had said that \"Germany was his spiritual home\". He had in fact said that about Professor [[Hermann Lotze]]'s classroom at G\u00f6ttingen, at a dinner party given by [[Mrs. Humphrey Ward]] in April 1913 to enable him to meet some German professors during his mission.{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nIn 1915, Asquith ranked his Cabinet, putting Haldane only sixth of the inner cabinet members.{{sfn|Hobhouse|1977|pp=}} He also inveigled Kitchener and Haldane to sign the King's Pledge, a vow to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war, which Haldane resented and which Churchill and Asquith himself completely ignored.\n\n==Dismissal from office==\n\nHaldane's dismissal from office in May 1915 is widely regarded by historians as unfair.  Following the [[Shell Crisis of 1915|shell crisis]] and the resignation of [[Lord Fisher]] the Liberals were obliged to form a coalition government with the Conservatives who, under the leadership of [[Bonar Law]], insisted on the removal of [[Winston Churchill]] as First Lord of the Admiralty and the dismissal of Haldane.{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=188}}{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=360}} Haldane's removal was on account of the popularity of the press's campaign relating to Haldane's alleged pro-German sympathies.{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} Neither the former prime minister [[Arthur Balfour]],  Haldane's closest friend amongst the Conservatives, nor Asquith, the Liberal prime minister of the day and Haldane's closest political ally and friend for over 30 years, did anything to resist Bonar Law's demands.{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp=361-362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}} [[Roy Jenkins]] in his biography of Asquith describes the charges as \"absolute nonsense\u201d and [[Max Egremont]] describes Balfour as \"knowing the injustice behind the charges,\u201d and, \u201cbeing privately indignant.\"{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|p=362}}{{sfn|Egremont|1980|p=269}}\n\nTo the permanent detriment of his previously close relationship with Haldane, Asquith compounded his mistake by not expressing directly to Haldane his feelings on the latter's dismissal and the value of his previous service to the government and country.{{sfn|Sommer|1960|pp=324-328}} Jenkins describes this omission as \u201cthe most uncharacteristic fault of Asquiths whole career\u201d attributing it to Asquith suffering the \"indescribable blow\" of the surprise announcement of the engagement of the woman he loved, [[Venetia Stanley (1887\u20131948)|Venetia Stanley]], to one of his government ministers, [[Edwin Montagu]].{{sfn|Jenkins|1964|pp= 362-366}}{{sfn|Adams|1999|p=186}}\n\nFollowing his departure from the government Haldane went to the front to meet his old friend General Haig, and his cousin, General [[Aylmer Haldane]]; but he was exhausted on being ejected from Cabinet.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=268}} Having been awarded the Order of Merit in 1915, in the personal gift of George V, he wrote a Memorandum of Events, 1906\u201315, to defend his reputation. It was published in April 1916. Haldane thought Lloyd George's new government, formed in December 1916, \"very low class\". Haldane told Lord Buckmaster at this time, \"Asquith is a first-class head of a deliberative council. He is versed in precedents, acts on principle, and knows how and when to compromise. Lloyd George knows nothing for precedents and cares for no principles, but he has fire in his belly and that is what we want\".{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=226}}\n\nAs the war progressed Haldane moved increasingly close to the Labour Party, but he was held back by his ties to the Liberal Party and to Asquith. When the [[Irish War of Independence]] broke out in 1919, Haldane was one of the first British politicians to argue that the solution lay in compromise rather than force.\n\n== Contribution to Canadian constitutional law ==\n<!-- Please fix redirects to this section (i.e. (the) wicked stepfather of the Canadian Constitution) if you rename this section. Thanks! -->\nAs Lord Chancellor, Haldane was a member of the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], at that time the court of last resort for the Empire. He retained the position even when he was no longer Chancellor.  He sat on several cases from Canada dealing with the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments under the [[Canadian Constitution]], particularly the interplay between sections 91 and 92 of the [[British North America Act 1867]]. He gave the decision for the Judicial Committee in several of those cases, and showed a marked tendency to favour the provincial powers at the expense of the federal government.  For instance, in the case of [[Canada v. Alberta|''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'']],<ref>''In re the Board of Commerce Act, 1919, and the Combines and Fair Prices Act'', 1919 [1922] 1 A.C. 191</ref> he gave the decision striking down federal legislation which attempted to regulate the economy, challenging the legality of the Canadian legislature.{{efn|In 1912 Haldane visited the Canadian Bar in Montreal, Quebec Province, described in {{harvnb|Haldane|1914|p=}} }} In doing so, he gave very restrictive readings to both the \"[[peace, order and good government]]\" power of the federal government, as well as the federal [[criminal law power]].  Similarly, in ''[[Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider]]'',<ref>Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, [1925] AC 396.</ref> Lord Haldane struck down a federal statute attempting to regulate industrial disputes, holding that it was not within federal authority under either the peace, order and good government power, nor the federal trade and commerce power. He went so far as to suggest that the trade and commerce power was simply an ancillary federal power, which could not authorise legislation in its own right.  The effects of some of these decisions have subsequently been modified by later decisions of the Judicial Committee and the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], but they have had the long-term effect of recognising substantial provincial powers.\n\nHaldane's approach to the division of powers was heavily criticised by some academics and lawyers in Canada, such as [[F. R. Scott]]<ref>F. R. Scott, ''Some Privy Counsel'' (1950), 28 Can. Bar. Rev. 780.</ref> and [[Bora Laskin|Chief Justice Bora Laskin]], as unduly favouring the provinces over the federal government and depriving it of the powers needed to deal with modern economic issues.  More recently, one major study has characterised him as \"the wicked stepfather\" of the Canadian Constitution.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}\n\n==Influence on education==\nIn 1895, Haldane helped the Webbs found the [[London School of Economics]].  A fundamental believer in the power of improving education, he prepared the London University Act 1898.  The philosophy of 'national efficiency' was central feature of the Hegelian complex, and the ideas of Schopenauer, he had learnt on the continent, that accentuated freedom and decentralisation from an historicist's perspective.{{sfn|Vaughan|2010|p=}}  His moral centrism sought to unify ''The New Liberalism'', as he published it in Contemporary Review.<ref>Contemporary Review, (London 1892),</ref>  From a pan-European perspective he analysed the German character and economic advances towards militarism.  He was largely responsible for the cross-party support for Balfour's Education Act 1902.  He told Rosebery \"a sense of nation is working towards ...a great centre party.\"{{sfn|Matthew|1973|p= 145|ps=: from a letter of 6 October 1902}} He was also involved in the founding of [[Imperial College]] in 1907 and in his honour the University contained the Haldane Recreational Library, now part of the [[Imperial College Central Library|Central Library]].\n\nHaldane was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].  He wrote a biography of Adam Smith, extolling the virtues of free trade.  Unlike Chamberlain, he thought there was no strong connection between fiscal and imperial unity.  He opposed any attempt to protection of British trade.{{sfn|Ashley|1904|loc=Preface}}{{sfn|Matthew|1973|pp= 166\u2013168}}\n\nIn 1904, he was President of the Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott Club and gave the Toast to Sir Walter at the Club's annual dinner, addressing \"The dedicated life\" to a group of students on 10 January 1907.  He also served as second [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Bristol]] where he made an important address titled \"The Civic University\" outlining his educational philosophy in 1911.  At the end of his life Lord Haldane was elected Chancellor of the [[University of St Andrews]] in June 1928.  Perhaps his greatest speech on education was made in House of Lords on 12 July 1916, at the height of the terrible slaughter on the Western Front.{{sfn|Ashby|Anderson|1970|p=135}}\n\n==Writings==\nHaldane co-translated the first English edition of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', published between 1883 and 1886. He wrote several philosophical works, the best known of which is ''The Reign of Relativity'' (1921), which dealt with the philosophical implications of the [[theory of relativity]]. Haldane published \"The Pathway to Reality\", based on the [[Gifford Lectures]] which he had delivered at the [[University of St Andrews]].{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=136}} Some of his public addresses have also been published, including ''[[s:The future of democracy|The future of democracy]]'' (1918).\n\n* {{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality|date=1903|publisher=John Murray|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/pathwaytorealit03haldgoog}}\n\n*{{cite book|first=Richard Burdon|last=Haldane|ref=harv|display-authors=0|title=The Pathway to Reality: Stage the Second|date=1904|publisher=E.

He suffered from bad rheumatism, a stigmata in the eye and in 1909, he had to take bed rest when going blind from iritis. A lifelong walker and cigar smoker, he was diagnosed diabetic. \"The latter is a large, fat man\" was [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Haig]]'s initial impression of a dignified but portly demeanour.  Yet, added Haig, \"One seems to like the man at once.\" Having worked on the Army Regulations of 1909, Haig applauded \"a most clear headed and practical man\u2013\u2013very ready to listen and weigh carefully all that is said to him.\" [[Osbert Sitwell]] described him as \"entering a room with the air of a whole procession\". [[Leo Amery]] said he looked like \"the old-fashioned family butler\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}} Another Imperialist, Winston Churchill also respected Haldane, although they were from differing social backgrounds. On promoting Churchill to First Lord of the Admiralty, Asquith advised him to seek Haldane's advice at a meeting held at Archerfield, North Berwick.{{efn|Haldane was impressed by the younger man's public speech at Bradford on 15 July 1898 during his early radicalism.}} From 1907 to 1908, he was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]].\n\nHaldane remained a lifelong bachelor after his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Valentine Ferguson, broke off their engagement. He died suddenly of heart disease at his home in [[Auchterarder]], Scotland, on 19 August 1928, aged 72.<ref name=\"nytimes19280820\" /> The viscountcy became extinct on his death.\n\n==Later years==\nIn December 1918, Lloyd George appointed Haldane chairman of 'The Machinery of Government' committee.<ref name=\"civilservant.org.uk\" /> However, the Armistice had taken all impetus out of the reform agenda.\n\nAt the time of the [[1920 Paisley by-election|Paisley by-election of January 1920]] Haldane was in the process of shifting his sympathies from Liberal to Labour, and was wrongly thought to have endorsed Labour (earning a rebuke from [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]], whom Haldane thought \"tiresome because she is ignorant\", to his aged mother). In fact he favoured Asquith's election on a personal level.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=246-247}}\n\nBeing a fluent German speaker, ascetic philosopher and atheist, he played host to [[Albert Einstein]], when he visited London in 1921.  As President of the Institute of Public Administration, he was a leading intellectual on the philosophy of governance. \"The Reign of Relativity\" combined Haldane's love of all things German expressed by Goethe and his works, with the Hegelian military-industrial complex.{{sfn|Haldane|1929|loc=A Hegelian Army|pp=183-185.}} Haldane admired the fact that Germans were \"trained to obey\".{{sfn|Haldane|1920|p=}} Hegel's aristocratic desire for law and order and defence of property against revolution had a mathematical symmetry. Hegel was a purist: his work attempted to keep science and philosophy apart  The rising tide of New Liberalism and moral realism was for Haldane, Hegel's philological precept to improve behaviour, using the empiricism of scientific data as a proof.{{sfn|Haldane|1922|p=}}{{sfn|Haldane|1926|p=}}\n\nHaldane refused to join the platform for Asquith's speech at [[Westminster Central Hall]] in January 1922. He stated that his main interest in public life was now education reform and that the cause was not best served by endorsing the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Koss |1985| p=253-255}} It was not until the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1923]] that Haldane formally sided with Labour, and made several speeches on behalf of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidates.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} When the [[First Labour Government (UK)|Labour government]] was formed by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in early 1924, Haldane was recruited to serve once again as [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref name=\"LG32901\" /> He was also joint Leader of the Labour Peers with [[Charles Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor|Lord Parmoor]]. Haldane was a vital member of the [[Labour Government 1924|Cabinet]] as he was one of only three members who had sat in a cabinet before.<ref name=\"eswsc.com\" />\n\nHaldane was responsible for drafting the London University Act 1926, purchasing properties in Euston. He made some famous speeches at Toynbee Hall for the Annual American Seminar.\n\n==Arms==\n{{Infobox COA wide\n|image = Haldane Achievement.png\n|escutcheon = Quarterly 1st & 4th Argent a saltire engrailed Sable (Haldane); 2nd Argent a saltire between four roses Gules (Lennox); 3rd Or a bend chequy Sable & Argent (Menteith); in the centre of the quarters a crescent Sable, all within a bordure Or.\n|crest = An eagle\u2019s head erased Or.\n|orders = [[Order of the Thistle]] [[Order of Merit]] (not pictured)\n|motto = Suffer <ref>{{cite book|title=Debrett's Peerage |date=1921}}</ref>}}\n\n==Legacy==\nIn November 1923 [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]], the Conservative politician, praised Haldane's contribution to Britain's preparedness for the First World War:\n\n{{quote|In the welter of sentimentality, amid which Great Britain might easily have mouldered into ruin, my valued colleague, Lord Haldane, presented a figure alike interesting, individual, and arresting. In speech fluent and even infinite he yielded to no living idealist in the easy coinage of sentimental phraseology. Here, indeed, he was a match for those who distributed the chloroform of Berlin. Do we not remember, for instance, that Germany was his spiritual home? But he none the less prepared himself, and the Empire, to talk when the time came with his spiritual friends in language not in the least spiritual. He devised the Territorial Army, which was capable of becoming the easy nucleus of national conscription, and which unquestionably ought to have been used for that purpose at the outbreak of war. He created the Imperial General Staff. He founded the Officers' Training Corps.\n|source={{citation|author=Lord Birkenhead|author-link=F. E.

powerful, subtle and encyclopaedic intellects ever devoted to the public service of his country\".{{sfn|Reid|2006|p=132}}\n\nThe military historian [[Correlli Barnett]] claimed that Haldane had \"all-round personal talents far exceeding those of his predecessors\" as [[Secretary of State for War]] and that he was \"a man of first-class intellect and wide

Its studios are located in Northwest Oklahoma City, and the transmitter is on the Northside.\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known format of the station is [[country music]] when it went by the call letters '''KJAK''' under Jack Beasley's Big Chief Broadcasting Co. from 1960-1976. Before Beasley had the allocation, there was a 100.5  '''KIOO''' or K-100 which transmitted from the top of the Oklahoma Biltmore Hotel in downtown OKC, KIOO was started by the two brothers from Northern Kentucky, Steve and Ted Bushelman around 1957.\n\nKLPR 1140 AM, originally started by Byron Ross in the 1940s, with the callsign that represented first letters of his parents' name, was a daytime AM country station in Oklahoma City that was owned by Jack Beasley in the 1960s. Jack, being a musician himself, had MANY ties to the industry. KLPR helped a number of country artists get their start, including Wanda Jackson and Conway Twitty{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. KLPR also owned a short-lived KLPR TV on channel 14 (not to be confused with the former ch19 KLPR-TV that Byron Ross owned before Beasley's 14). KJAK was Jack's FM station at 100.5 FM which much later on became KATT-FM.  When Beasley got older, he owner-financed a sale of the stations (1140 and 100.5) to Ed Sossen. Due to Sossen's financial issues and two suspicious fires, the stations were subject to a bank takeover {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. After the fires, Bill Lacy ran the stations as the GM for the debtor in possession of the stations while a new owner could be found.  The format was changed to rock and soon the call sign was applied for, KATT (100.5). The station began broadcasting as '''KATT''' on September 16, 1976 with a [[rock music|rock]] format.  The station received the official telegram from the FCC at Christmas 1976 authorizing the call sign change to '''KATT-FM''' when KATT (now [[KRMP]]) was established to simulcast the station.  Transmissions facilities and studio facilities for KATT and 1140AM were at the AM tower in a small room in what was a former ch 14 TV transmitter building. The KATT became a nearly overnight success, filling a huge void for underground rock music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} With huge ratings success, the KATT and 1140 AM quickly sold to Sun Broadcasting of Dallas, TX who paid 866,000 for the AM/FM combo properties. Bill Lacey exited at the sale time as the GM.\n\nThe former KATT transmitter site ( at the KLPR-KCNN-KPRW-KVSP 1140 tower) was located near I-240 and I-35.\n\nKATT was named by Ira \"Eye\" Lipson, who also was the programming consultant to KATT, while serving as program director of KZEW The ZOO in Dallas.  Barbara Marullo was the original program director. Air personalities in the early days included Stan Tacker, Traver Hulse, Jim Stafford (Jimbob), Linda (Gabby) Goldfarb, John Michael Scott (now deceased), David Bell (now deceased), Charlie Parker, and Danny Hopper. Stan, Traver, and Jim rotated AM drive duty until Gabby came on board. Then it was Jim & Gabby for about one year. John Michael Scott handled middays, David Bell was on in the evenings. Hopper was the first overnight man later followed by Parker.\n\nThe early days of KATT-FM saw a shift in radio listening for young adults in Oklahoma City, traditionally AM stations had attempted to catch the wave of progressive rock by featuring artists like Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan when necessary to show they were hip.  The explosion of new music heralded acts like the Grateful Dead, Fleetwood Mac, and Bob Seger on a regular basis.  KOFM had played album cuts for years, but only scratched the surface of what a station dedicated to playing the large playlists of groups that only recently had begun receiving the airplay they deserved.  The stations on air personalities renamed the old cow town Zoom City, and played long thematic sets of music that had not been heard.  The concert calendar was filled with acts that got the support they needed to sell out the Myriad, Lloyd Noble arena, and the Fairgrounds on a regular basis.   Gone were the days when hip people had to exchange tapes and records, the KATT was the soundtrack of a new generation.\n\nArbitron ratings went through the roof, and KATT stickers appeared on the rear windows of cars that crowded the parking lots of the Zoo Amphitheatre, and the old downtown Civic Center.  There was even an animated television commercial on late night programs featuring the smiling form of the cartoon cat from the sticker finding his way along the highways of Oklahoma City.\n\nThe KATT now plays a wide range of rock music, both new rock and classic rock. Many other owners have owned KATT including Surrey, Greyhound, and Citadel.  The current owner is Cumulus.  In March 2008 KATT downgraded from a C at 100,000 watts ERP to a C1 at 30,000 watts ERP for the upgrade of WWLS-FM to 98.1 fm.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.katt.com KATT station website]\n{{FM station data|KATT}}\n\n{{Oklahoma City Radio}}\n{{Cumulus Media}}\n\n{{coord|35.560|N|97.486|W|type:landmark_region:US_source:FCC|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Album-oriented rock radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Oklahoma City|ATT-FM]]\n[[Category:Cumulus Media radio stations]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1960]]\n[[Category:1960 establishments in Oklahoma]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox radio station\n | name             = KATT-FM\n | image            = KATT.png\n | image_size       = 200px\n | city             = [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]\n | area             = [[Oklahoma City Metroplex]]\n | branding         = ''ROCK 100.5 The KATT''\n | slogan           = Oklahoma's Pure Rock Station\n | frequency        = 100.5 [[Megahertz|MHz]] \n | airdate          = 1960 (as KJAK)<br>September 16, 1976 (as KATT)\n | format           = [[Mainstream rock]] \n | erp              = 29,000 [[watt]]s\n | haat             = {{convert|470|m|ft|sp=us}}\n | class            = C1\n | facility_id      = 8797\n | callsign_meaning = The '''KATT''' (cat)\n | former_callsigns = KJAK (1960-1976)<br>KATT (9/1976-12/1976)\n | owner            = [[Cumulus Media]]\n | licensee         = Radio License Holding CBC, LLC\n | sister_stations  = [[KQOB]], [[KYIS]], [[KKWD]], [[KWPN (AM)|KWPN]], [[WKY]], [[WWLS-FM]]\n | webcast          = {{listen live|http://www.katt.com}}\n | website          = [http://www.katt.com katt.com]\n}}\n\n'''KATT-FM''' (100.5 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], \"ROCK 100.5 The KATT\") is a [[Mainstream Rock]] [[radio station]] serving the [[Oklahoma City Metroplex|Oklahoma City]] area and is owned by [[Cumulus Media]].

He was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[South Fermanagh (UK Parliament constituency)|South Fermanagh]] from 1885 to 1892, private secretary to the Irish leader [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] from 1880 to 1891, and Town Clerk of Dublin from 1893 to 1920.  Knighted by the British government in January 1921, he was known as \u201cSir Henry Campbell\u201d only in retirement.\n\nSon of Patrick Campbell of Kilcoo, [[County Down|Co. Down]], he began his career as a grocer's apprentice in [[Newry]] and was a member of the Catholic Young Men's Society.  In 1879 he married Jenny Brewis, daughter of R. Brewis of Newcastle upon Tyne.  He succeeded [[Timothy Michael Healy|Timothy Healy]] as Parnell's private secretary in 1880 and in the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]] was elected for the new parliamentary seat of South Fermanagh by 3,574 votes to the Conservative's 2,181.  In the [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886 general election]] he was re-elected against the same opponent by only a slightly smaller majority.  He was a key witness in Parnell's defence before the [[Parnell Commission]] of the late 1880s and indeed for the most part it was Campbell's writing rather than Parnell's which had been forged by [[Richard Pigott]] in the plot to discredit Parnell.\n\nWhen the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] split in December 1890 over the leadership of Parnell following the divorce case involving [[Katharine O'Shea]], Campbell remained loyal to Parnell, and after Parnell's death in October 1891, to the Parnellite party.  However he did not contest the 1892 general election.\n\nIn 1893 the post of Town Clerk of Dublin became vacant.  The Corporation was controlled by Parnellites and Campbell won the post by a large majority over six other candidates on 24 May, in an election which was seen as a tribute to Parnell.\n\nCampbell's local government career ended in political controversy just as his parliamentary career had done.  He was in conflict with [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] members of the Corporation over the question of recording the minutes in Irish.  The breaking point came after Sinn F\u00e9in had taken control of the Corporation.  In 1920 the Sinn F\u00e9in majority passed a resolution instructing the Town Clerk not to submit the Corporation's accounts to the Local Government Board for auditing, the Board being an arm of the British administration which Sinn F\u00e9in had repudiated.  Campbell refused to comply on the ground that the resolution was unlawful.  The Corporation then voted by 26\u201312 on 4 November 1920 to suspend him and his assistant Town Clerk, James Flood, who had declined to act in his place.  Although Campbell tried to maintain his position for a time, on 17 November he resigned.
