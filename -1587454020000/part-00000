The film is based on the play of the same name by [[Enda Walsh]].<ref>[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20232 A Trio of Clips from Hideo Nakata's 'The Chatroom']</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWilliam Collins ([[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]]) is a depressed boy recovering from [[self-harm]] and regularly goes online to chatrooms. One day, he decides to open a chatroom himself and calls it \"Chelsea People!\" and where he meets Jim ([[Matthew Beard (British actor)|Matthew Beard]]), another kid; Eva ([[Imogen Poots]]), a model; Emily ([[Hannah Murray]]), a goody two-shoes; and Mo ([[Daniel Kaluuya]]), a normal kid. There is no real subject matter in \"Chelsea People!\" which instead focuses on the lives of each one as they talk. Even though they only really communicate through text, the film depicts them in an old hotel-like room and actually having contact. \n\nWilliam is a loner who lives with his parents ([[Megan Dodds]] and [[Nicholas Gleaves]]). He hates both his parents, blaming them for his past, and lives his entire life on the internet. Jim is another loner who is suffering from depression following his father leaving him and his mother. Eva is constantly made fun of by her co-workers about her appearance. Emily feels distant from her parents and does not feel like she gets enough attention. Mo thinks he is a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] because he is attracted to his friend's prepubescent sister, Keisha (Rebecca McLintock). William sees it to himself to help them in a crude manner. He [[Photoshop]]s embarrassing pictures of Eva's co-worker and posts them online. He convinces Jim to flush down his anti-depressants to make himself feel more relaxed and to reveal his face behind the depressants, his true identity. He tells Emily to do some dirty work, teaming up with Eva. They come up with ways in which Emily could be more violent and make it look like somebody is harassing her family, which makes her parents try to protect her more. He tells Mo to tell his friend Si the truth but this backfires when Si calls him a pervert and attacks him.\n\nWilliam becomes darker and more menacing and even begins to watch people commit suicide. He then takes it upon himself to coerce Jim into committing suicide. His plans are halted though when his computer and phone are taken away from him by his father, who when looking through William's computer, finds one of the suicide videos. William gets his backup computer and phone and goes after Jim, who meets up with him at London Zoo. Mo and the others find out about William's intended actions and go to stop him, meeting up in person and trying to follow William and Jim around London.\n\nJim makes it to the zoo first but decides to not do it. He tries to leave but William goes right after him. William catches Jim, but he refuses to shoot himself and throws the gun to the floor. When William gets it and comes back, Eva punches him and the rest of the crew comes, followed by the police. William tries to escape but is only able to climb up some crates. He then falls in front of the speeding train behind the crates and is killed. The teens leave without talking to each other; William's account is shut down and the credits roll. The ending scene shows William walking in a chat tunnel while the light is gradually fading.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]] as William Collins\n* [[Imogen Poots]] as Eva\n* [[Matthew Beard (British actor)|Matthew Beard]] as Jim\n* [[Hannah Murray]] as Emily\n* [[Daniel Kaluuya]] as Mo\n* [[Megan Dodds]] as Grace Collins\n* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Rosie\n* [[Nicholas Gleaves]] as Paul Collins\n* [[Jacob Anderson]] as Si\n* [[Tuppence Middleton]] as Candy\n* [[Ophelia Lovibond]] as Charlotte\n* [[Richard Madden]] as Ripley Collins\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] took place in early 2010 at [[Shepperton Studios]] in [[Shepperton]], [[Surrey]],<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37431/trailer-debut-hideo-nakatas-chatroom Trailer Debut: Hideo Nakata's Chatroom]</ref> with some outdoor scenes shot in Camden and Primrose Hill.

Cebuano in this sense applies to all speakers of vernaculars mutually intelligible with the vernaculars of Cebu island, regardless of origin or location, as well as to the language they speak.\n\nThe term ''Cebuano'' (itself part of the Spanish colonial heritage, from \"[[Cebu]]\"+\"''[[:wikt:-anus|ano]]''\", a Latinate calque) has garnered some objections. For example, generations of Cebuano speakers in northern Mindanao ([[Dipolog]], [[Dapitan]], [[Misamis Occidental]] and [[Misamis Oriental]] together with coastal areas of [[Butuan]]) say that their ancestry traces back to Cebuano speakers native to their place and not from immigrants or settlers from the Visayas.

For example, ''dala'' (\"bring\"), becomes ''da'' ({{IPA|/d\u032aa\u02d0/}}); and ''tulod'' (\"push\") becomes ''tud'' ({{IPA|/t\u032au\u02d0d\u032a/}}).<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/> Except if the '''l''' is in between [[closed syllables]] or is in the beginning of the penultimate syllable; in which case, the {{angbr|l}} is dropped along with one of the vowels, and no lengthening occurs. For example, ''kalatkat'', \"climb\", becomes ''katkat'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8katkat/}} not {{IPA|/\u02c8ka\u02d0tkat/}}).\n\nA final {{angbr|l}} can also be replaced with {{angbr|w}} in certain areas in Bohol (e.g. ''tambal'', \"medicine\", becomes ''tambaw''). In very rare cases in Cebu, {{angbr|l}} may also be replaced with {{angbr|y}} in between the vowels {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|e}}/{{angbr|i}} (e.g. ''tingali'', \"maybe\", becomes ''tingayi'').<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/>\n\nIn some parts of Bohol and Southern Leyte, {{IPA|/j/}} {{angbr|y}} is also often replaced with {{IPA|d\u0361\u0292}} {{angbr|j/dy}} when it is in the beginning of a syllable (e.g. ''kalayo'', \"fire\", becomes ''kalajo''). It can also happen even if the {{angbr|y}} is at the final position of the syllable and the word, but only if it is moved to the initial position by the addition of the [[affix]] ''-a''. For example, ''baboy'' (\"pig\") can not become ''baboj'', but ''baboya'' can become ''baboja.''<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\" />\n\nAll of the above substitutions are considered allophonic and do not change the meaning of the word.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/>\n\nIn rarer instances, the consonant {{angbr|d}} might also be replaced with {{angbr|r}} when it is in between two vowels (e.g. Boholano ''ido'' for standard Cebuano ''iro'', \"dog\"), but {{angbr|d}} and {{angbr|r}} are not considered allophones,<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/>  though they may have been in the past.<ref name=\"ver\">{{Cite journal |last=Verstraelen |first=Eugene |year=1961 |title=Some further remarks about the L-feature |url=http://philippinestudies.net/ojs/index.php/ps/article/download/2806/5450 |journal=Philippine Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=72&ndash;77}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\nStress accent is phonemic, so that ''dap\u00edt'' (adverb) means \"near to a place,\" while ''d\u0101pit'' (noun) means \"place.\"\n''d\u016b-ol'' (verb) means \"come near,\" while ''du-\u00f3l'' (adverb) means \"near\" or \"close by.\"\n\n==Grammar==\n{{summarize|from|Cebuano grammar|section=y|date=December 2019}}\n{{Main|Cebuano grammar|Austronesian alignment}}\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{{see also|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation|List of India-related topics in the Philippines}}\nCebuano is  a member of the [[Philippine languages]]. Early trade contact resulted in a large number of older loan words from other languages being embedded in Cebuano, like [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] (e.g. ''sangka'', \"fight\" and ''bahandi'', \"wealth\", from Sanskrit ''sanka'' and ''bh\u0101nda'' respectively), and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (e.g. ''sal\u00e1mat'', \"thanks\"; ''hukom'' or ''hukm'', \"judge\").<ref name=\"kuizon\">{{Cite journal |last=Kuizon |first=Jose G. |date=1964 |title=The Sanskrit Loan-Words in the Cebuano-Bisayan Language |url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/646 |journal=Asian Folklore Studies |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=111\u2013158 |doi=10.2307/1177640 |jstor=1177640}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been influenced by thousands of words from Spanish, such as ''kurus'' [''cruz''] (cross), ''swerte'' [''suerte''] (\"luck\"), ''gwapa'' [''guapa''], (\"beautiful\"), ''merkado'' [''mercado''] (\"market\") and ''brilyante'' [''brillante''] (\"brilliant\"). It has several hundred loan words from English as well, which are altered to conform to the limited phonemic inventory of Cebuano: ''brislit'' (bracelet), ''hayskul'' (high school), ''sy\u00e1ping'' (shopping), ''bakwit'' (evacuate), and ''dr\u00e1yber'' (driver). However, today, it is more common for Cebuanos to spell out those words in their original English form rather than with spelling that might conform to Cebuano standards.\n\n==Phrases==\nA few common phrases in Cebuano include:<ref name=\"omn\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/cebuano.php\n|title=Useful Cebuano phrases\n|publisher=Omniglot\n|accessdate=25 December 2016\n}}</ref>\n* How are you?

It first gained prominence due to its adoption by the [[Catholic Church]] as the standard for written Cebuano. It retains the intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}}.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\" /> In contrast, the Urban Cebuano dialect spoken by people in [[Metro Cebu]] and surrounding areas is characterized by {{IPA|/l/}} elision and heavily contracted words and phrases.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/> For example, ''wal\u00e1y problema'' (\"no problem\") in Standard Cebuano can become ''way 'blema'' in Urban Cebuano. \n\nColloquialisms can also be used to determine the regional origin of the speaker. Cebuano-speaking people from [[Cagayan de Oro]] and [[Dumaguete]], for example, say ''chada'' or ''tsada''/''patsada'' (roughly translated to the English colloquialism \"awesome\")<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/10-fun-facts-about-cagayan-de-oro/ |title=10 Fun Facts about Cagayan de Oro |date=2016-02-05 |website=About Cagayan de Oro |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> and people from [[Davao City]] say ''atchup'' which also translated to the same English context;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ilovedavao.com/2015/01/what-do-you-mean-by-atchup-boulevard.html |title=Atchup Boulevard Explained |website=www.ilovedavao.com |access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> meanwhile Cebuanos from Cebu on the other hand say ''nindot'' or, sometimes, ''an\u00edndot''. However, this word is also commonly used in the same context in other Cebuano-speaking regions, in effect making this word not only limited in use to Cebu.\n\nThere is no standardized orthography for Cebuano, but spelling in print usually follow the pronunciation of Standard Cebuano, regardless of how it is actually spoken by the speaker. For example, ''bal\u00e1y'' (\"house\") is pronounced {{IPA|/ba\u02c8l\u032aa\u026a/}} in Standard Cebuano and is thus spelled \"bal\u00e1y\", even in Urban Cebuano where it is actually pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8ba\u026a/}}.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/>\n\nCebuano is spoken natively over a large area of the Philippines and thus has numerous regional dialects. It can vary significantly in terms of [[lexicon]] and phonology depending on where it is spoken.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/> Increasing usage of spoken English (being the primary language of commerce and education in the Philippines) has also led to the introduction of new pronunciations and spellings of old Cebuano words.

It is also spoken in some parts of [[Siquijor]]. Boholano, especially as spoken in central Bohol, can be distinguished from other Cebuano variants by a few [[phonetic change]]s:\n*The semivowel ''y'' is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}: ''iya'' is pronounced {{IPA|[i\u02c8d\u0292a]}};\n*''Ako'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[a\u02c8ho]}};\n*Intervocalic ''l'' is occasionally pronounced as {{IPA|[w]}} when following ''u'' or ''o'': ''kulang'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u02c8kuwa\u014b]}} (the same as [[Metro Cebu]] dialect).\n\n=== Leyte\u00f1o Cebuano ===\n\n====Southern Kana====\nSouthern Kana is a dialect of southern [[Leyte]] and in [[Southern Leyte]]; it is closest to the Mindanao Cebuano dialect at the southern area and northern Cebu dialect at the northern boundaries. Both North and South Kana are subgroups of [[Leyte\u00f1o dialect]]. Both of these dialects are spoken in western and central Leyte and in the southern province, but the Boholano is more concentrated in [[Maasin City]].\n\nSpeakers of these two dialects can be distinguished by their distinctive modification of {{IPA|/j/}} into {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}, as in the words ayaw (don't) is turned into ajaw; dayon (come in) - dajun; bayad(pay) -bajad.   Like the Mindanao dialects, they are notable for their usage of a vocabulary containing archaic longer words like ''kalatkat'' (\"climb\") instead of ''katkat''.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==== Northern Kana ====\nNorth Kana (found in the northern part of [[Leyte]]), is closest to the variety of the language spoken in northern part of Leyte, and shows significant influence from Waray-Waray, quite notably in its pace which speakers from Cebu find very fast, and its more mellow tone (compared to the urban Cebu City dialect, which Kana speakers find \"rough\"). A distinguishing feature of this dialect is the reduction of {{IPA|/A/}} prominent, but an often unnoticed feature of this dialect is the labialisation of {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} into {{IPA|/m/}}, when these phonemes come before {{IPA|/p/}} {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}, velarisation of {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} into {{IPA|/\u014b/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, and the dentalisation of {{IPA|/\u014b/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} into {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} and sometimes, before vowels and other consonants as well.\n\nThe Northern Kana dialect generally contains less {{IPA|/l/}} sounds than standard Cebuano.{{cn|date=January 2020}} In between vowels {{IPA|/l/}} is removed, and depending on what vowel chain follows, it may create a long vowel or have {{IPA|/y/}} or {{IPA|/w/}} take its place. ([[Elision]])\n\nSome words also hold different meanings, like how the word \"ram\u0101w\"/\"lam\u0101w\" refers to the meat of young coconut suspended in either coconut juice or sugared milk in N. Kana; while in Standard Cebuano, \"lam\u0101w\" means \"rice leftovers\", which is \"bah\u0101w\" in S. Kana and Mindanao Cebuano.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Sugbu\n!Kana\n!Waray\n!English\n|-\n|Kan-on\n|Luto\n|Lut\u00f4\n|Cooked rice\n|-\n|Kini\n|Kiri/kini\n|Ini\n|This\n|-\n|Kana\n|Kara'/kana\n|Iton\n|That\n|-\n|Dinhi/Diri\n|ari/dinhi/diri\n|Didi/Ngadi/Aadi/Dinhi\n|Here\n|-\n|Diha/Dinha\n|Dira/diha/dinha\n|Dida/Ngada/Aada\n|There\n|-\n|Bas/Balas\n|Bas/Balas\n|Baras\n|Soil/Sand\n|-\n|Alsa\n|Arsa\n|Alsa\n|To lift\n|-\n|Bulsa\n|Bursa\n|Bulsa\n|Pocket\n|}\n\n=== Mindanao Cebuano ===\nThis is the variety of Cebuano spoken throughout most of [[Mindanao]] and it is the standard dialect of Cebuano in [[Northern Mindanao]].\n\nLocal historical sources found in Cagayan de Oro indicates the early presence of Cebuano Visayans in the Misamis-Agusan coastal areas and their contacts with the Lumads and peoples of the Rajahnate of Butuan. Lumads refer to these Visayan groups as \"Dumagat\" (\"people of the sea\") as they came in the area seaborne. It became the lingua franca of precolonial Visayan settlers and native Lumads of the area, and particularly of the ancient Rajahnate of Butuan where [[Butuanon language|Butuanon]], a Southern Visayan language, was also spoken. Cebuano influence in Lumad languages around the highlands of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon was furthered with the influx of Cebuano Visayan laborers and conscripts of the Spaniards from Cebuano areas of Visayas (particularly from Bohol) during the colonial period around the present-day region of Northern Mindanao. It has spread west towards the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], east towards the [[Caraga Region]], and south towards [[Bukidnon]], [[Cotabato]] and the [[Davao Region]] in the final years of Spanish colonial rule.\n\nSimilar to the Sialo dialect of southeastern Cebu, it is distinctive in retaining /l/ sounds, long since considered archaic in Urban Cebuano. For example: ''bulan'' instead of ''buwan'' (\"moon\" or \"month\"), ''dalunggan'' instead of ''dunggan'' (ear), and ''halang'' instead of ''hang'' (\"spicy\"). \n\nDue to the influx of migrants (mostly from Western Visayas and Leyte) during the promotion of settlement in the highlands of Central Mindanao in the 1930s, vocabulary from other Visayan languages (predominantly [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]]) have also been incorporated into Mindanao Cebuano. For example, the Hiligaynon ''s\u00e1bat'' (\"reply\") is commonly used alongside Cebuano ''tubag'', ''bulig'' alongside ''t\u00e1bang'' (\"help\"), and Waray ''lut\u00f4'' alongside ''kan-on'' (\"cooked rice\"). Though, these influences are only limited to the speakers along the port area and Hiligaynon-speaking communities.\n\n==== Davaoe\u00f1o Cebuano ====\n{{Distinguish|Chavacano language#Castellano Abakay (Chavacano Davaoe\u00f1o){{!}}Chavacano language: Castellano Abakay (Chabacano de Davao)}}\n\nA branch of Mindanao Cebuano in [[Davao City|Davao]] is also known as Davaoe\u00f1o (not to be confused with the Davao variant of [[Chavacano]] which is called \"Castellano Abakay\"). Like the Cebuano-speakers of Luzon (Luzon Cebuano dialect), it contains some [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] vocabulary to a greater extent. Its grammar is somewhat in between the original Cebuano language and the Luzon Cebuano dialect. However, speakers from Davao City nowadays exhibits stronger Tagalog influence in their speech by substituting most Cebuano words with Tagalog ones. One characteristic is the practice of saying ''at\u00e0'', derived from Tagalog ''yat\u00e0'' to denote uncertainty of a speaker's any aforementioned statements. For instance, ''\"To-a man <u>at\u00e0</u> sa bal\u00e1y si Manuel\"'' instead of ''\"To-a man <u>ting\u00e1li</u> sa bal\u00e1y si Manuel\"''. However, the word ''at\u00e0'' exists in Cebuano though it means \" squid ink\" (<u>at\u00e0 sa nukos</u>).\n\nOther examples include: ''<u>Nibab\u00e2</u> ko sa dyip sa kanto, <u>tapos</u> miul\u00ee ko sa among bal\u00e1y'' (\"I got off the [[jeepney]] at the street corner, and then I went home\") instead of ''<u>Nin\u00e1ug</u> ko sa dyip sa kanto, <u>dayon</u> miul\u00ee ko sa among bal\u00e1y''. The words ''bab\u00e2'' and ''naug'' mean \"to disembark\" or \"to go down\", while ''tapos'' and ''dayon'' mean \"then\"; the former is Tagalog, and the latter Cebuano. It also sometimes add some [[Mansakan languages|Bagobo and Mansakan]] vocabulary, like: ''<u>Madayaw</u> nga adlaw, amigo, kamusta ka?'' (\"<u>Good day</u>, friend, how are you?\", literally \"Good morning/afternoon\") rather than ''\"<u>Maayo</u> nga adlaw, amigo, kamusta ka?\"'' The words ''madayaw'' and ''maayo'' mean \"good\"; the former is Bagobo, and the latter Cebuano.\n\n===Negrense Cebuano===\nThe Cebuano dialect in [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]] is somewhat similar to the Standard Cebuano (spoken by the majority of the provincial areas of Cebu), with distinct [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] influences. It is distinctive in retaining {{IPA|/l/}} sounds and longer word forms as well. It is the primary dialectal language of the entire province of [[Negros Oriental]] and northeastern parts of [[Negros Occidental]] (while the majority of the latter province and its bordered areas speaks Hiligaynon/Ilonggo), as well as some parts of [[Siquijor]]. Examples of Negrense Cebuano's distinction from other Cebuano dialects is the usage of the word ''maot'' instead of ''bat\u00ee'' (\"ugly\"), ''al\u00e1lay'', ''kal\u00e1lag'' instead of ''kalag-kalag'' (Halloween), ''kabal\u00f3/kah\u00edbal\u00f3'' and ''ka\u00e1go/ka\u00e1ntigo'' instead of ''kabaw\u00f3/kah\u00edbaw\u00f3'' (\"know\").\n\n=== Other dialects ===\n\n==== Luzon Cebuano ====\nThere is no specific [[Luzon]] dialect, as speakers of Cebuano in Luzon come from many different regions in Central Visayas and Mindanao. Cebuano-speaking people from Luzon in Visayas can be easily recognized primarily by their vocabulary which incorporates [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] words. Their accents and some aspects of grammar can also sometimes exhibit [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] influence. The dialect is sometimes colloquially known as \"[[Bisalog]]\" (a [[portmanteau]] of Tagalog and Binisaya).\n\n==== ''Saksak Sinagol'' ====\nThe term [[wikt:saksak sinagol|saksak sinagol]] in context means \"a collection of miscellaneous things\" and literally \"inserted mixture\", thus those other few Cebuano-influenced regions that have a variety of regional languages uses this term to refer to their dialect with considerable incorporated Cebuano words. Example of these regions are places likes those in [[Masbate]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Numbers===\nCebuano uses two numeral systems:\n<br/>The '''native system''' (currently) is mostly used in counting the number of things, animate and inanimate, e.g. the number of horses, houses.\n<br/>The '''spanish-derived''' system, on the other hand, is exclusively applied in monetary terminology and is also commonly used in counting from 11 and above.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

''Bisaya'', however, may become a source of confusion as many other [[Visayan languages]] may also be referred to as ''Bisaya'' even though they are not mutually intelligible with speakers of what is referred to by linguists as Cebuano. Cebuano in this sense applies to all speakers of vernaculars mutually intelligible with the vernaculars of Cebu island, regardless of origin or location, as well as to the language they speak.\n\nThe term ''Cebuano'' (itself part of the Spanish colonial heritage, from \"[[Cebu]]\"+\"''[[:wikt:-anus|ano]]''\", a Latinate calque) has garnered some objections. For example, generations of Cebuano speakers in northern Mindanao ([[Dipolog]], [[Dapitan]], [[Misamis Occidental]] and [[Misamis Oriental]] together with coastal areas of [[Butuan]]) say that their ancestry traces back to Cebuano speakers native to their place and not from immigrants or settlers from the Visayas.

When indicated, it is commonly written as a [[hyphen]] or an [[apostrophe]] if the glottal stop occurs in the middle of the word (e.g. ''to-o'' or ''to'o'', \"right\"). More formally, when it occurs at the end of the word, it is indicated by a [[circumflex accent]] if both a stress and a glottal stop occurs at the final vowel (e.g. ''bas\u00e2'', \"wet\"); or a [[grave accent]] if the glottal stop occurs at the final vowel, but the stress occurs at the penultimate syllable (e.g. ''bat\u00e0'', \"child\").<ref name=\"expr\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pilipino-express.com/history-a-culture/in-other-words/1180-basics-of-filipino-pronunciation-part-2.html |title=The basics of Filipino pronunciation: Part 2 of 3 \u2022 accent marks |last=Morrow |first=Paul |date=16 March 2011 |publisher=Pilipino Express |access-date=18 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"nolasco\">{{Cite book |url=http://fhl.digitalsolutions.ph/sites/default/files/grammar-notes.pdf |title=Grammar notes on the national language |last=Nolasco |first=Ricardo M.D. |work=Fhl.digitalsolutions.ph}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"tagalog\">{{Cite book |url=http://www.supadu.com/images/ckfinder/26/pdfs/PIMSLEUR/Tagalog_Phase1-Bklt.pdf |title=Tagalog Reading Booklet |publisher=Simon & Schister's Pimsleur |year=2007 |editor-last=Schoellner |editor-first=Joan |pages=5\u20136 |access-date=16 September 2016 |editor-last2=Heinle |editor-first2=Beverly D. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127030759/http://www.supadu.com/images/ckfinder/26/pdfs/PIMSLEUR/Tagalog_Phase1-Bklt.pdf |archive-date=27 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBelow is a chart of Cebuano consonants with their corresponding letter representation in parentheses:<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/><ref name=\"phon\"/><ref name=\"awl\" /><ref name=\"comp\">{{Citation |last=Bollas |first=Abigail A. |title=Comparative Analysis on the Phonology of Tagalog, Cebuano, and Itawis |url=https://www.academia.edu/4427395 |year=2013 |publisher=University of the Philippines - Diliman}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|- style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n!\n!colspan=2| [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n!colspan=2| [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n!colspan=2| [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!colspan=2| [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!colspan=2| [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!

For example, ''dala'' (\"bring\"), becomes ''da'' ({{IPA|/d\u032aa\u02d0/}}); and ''tulod'' (\"push\") becomes ''tud'' ({{IPA|/t\u032au\u02d0d\u032a/}}).<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/> Except if the '''l''' is in between [[closed syllables]] or is in the beginning of the penultimate syllable; in which case, the {{angbr|l}} is dropped along with one of the vowels, and no lengthening occurs. For example, ''kalatkat'', \"climb\", becomes ''katkat'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8katkat/}} not {{IPA|/\u02c8ka\u02d0tkat/}}).\n\nA final {{angbr|l}} can also be replaced with {{angbr|w}} in certain areas in Bohol (e.g. ''tambal'', \"medicine\", becomes ''tambaw''). In very rare cases in Cebu, {{angbr|l}} may also be replaced with {{angbr|y}} in between the vowels {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|e}}/{{angbr|i}} (e.g. ''tingali'', \"maybe\", becomes ''tingayi'').<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/>\n\nIn some parts of Bohol and Southern Leyte, {{IPA|/j/}} {{angbr|y}} is also often replaced with {{IPA|d\u0361\u0292}} {{angbr|j/dy}} when it is in the beginning of a syllable (e.g. ''kalayo'', \"fire\", becomes ''kalajo''). It can also happen even if the {{angbr|y}} is at the final position of the syllable and the word, but only if it is moved to the initial position by the addition of the [[affix]] ''-a''. For example, ''baboy'' (\"pig\") can not become ''baboj'', but ''baboya'' can become ''baboja.''<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\" />\n\nAll of the above substitutions are considered allophonic and do not change the meaning of the word.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/>\n\nIn rarer instances, the consonant {{angbr|d}} might also be replaced with {{angbr|r}} when it is in between two vowels (e.g. Boholano ''ido'' for standard Cebuano ''iro'', \"dog\"), but {{angbr|d}} and {{angbr|r}} are not considered allophones,<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/>  though they may have been in the past.<ref name=\"ver\">{{Cite journal |last=Verstraelen |first=Eugene |year=1961 |title=Some further remarks about the L-feature |url=http://philippinestudies.net/ojs/index.php/ps/article/download/2806/5450 |journal=Philippine Studies |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=72&ndash;77}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\nStress accent is phonemic, so that ''dap\u00edt'' (adverb) means \"near to a place,\" while ''d\u0101pit'' (noun) means \"place.\"\n''d\u016b-ol'' (verb) means \"come near,\" while ''du-\u00f3l'' (adverb) means \"near\" or \"close by.\"\n\n==Grammar==\n{{summarize|from|Cebuano grammar|section=y|date=December 2019}}\n{{Main|Cebuano grammar|Austronesian alignment}}\n\n==Vocabulary==\n{{see also|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation|List of India-related topics in the Philippines}}\nCebuano is  a member of the [[Philippine languages]].

It has several hundred loan words from English as well, which are altered to conform to the limited phonemic inventory of Cebuano: ''brislit'' (bracelet), ''hayskul'' (high school), ''sy\u00e1ping'' (shopping), ''bakwit'' (evacuate), and ''dr\u00e1yber'' (driver).

It first gained prominence due to its adoption by the [[Catholic Church]] as the standard for written Cebuano. It retains the intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}}.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\" /> In contrast, the Urban Cebuano dialect spoken by people in [[Metro Cebu]] and surrounding areas is characterized by {{IPA|/l/}} elision and heavily contracted words and phrases.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/> For example, ''wal\u00e1y problema'' (\"no problem\") in Standard Cebuano can become ''way 'blema'' in Urban Cebuano. \n\nColloquialisms can also be used to determine the regional origin of the speaker. Cebuano-speaking people from [[Cagayan de Oro]] and [[Dumaguete]], for example, say ''chada'' or ''tsada''/''patsada'' (roughly translated to the English colloquialism \"awesome\")<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aboutcagayandeoro.com/10-fun-facts-about-cagayan-de-oro/ |title=10 Fun Facts about Cagayan de Oro |date=2016-02-05 |website=About Cagayan de Oro |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> and people from [[Davao City]] say ''atchup'' which also translated to the same English context;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ilovedavao.com/2015/01/what-do-you-mean-by-atchup-boulevard.html |title=Atchup Boulevard Explained |website=www.ilovedavao.com |access-date=2018-09-06}}</ref> meanwhile Cebuanos from Cebu on the other hand say ''nindot'' or, sometimes, ''an\u00edndot''. However, this word is also commonly used in the same context in other Cebuano-speaking regions, in effect making this word not only limited in use to Cebu.\n\nThere is no standardized orthography for Cebuano, but spelling in print usually follow the pronunciation of Standard Cebuano, regardless of how it is actually spoken by the speaker. For example, ''bal\u00e1y'' (\"house\") is pronounced {{IPA|/ba\u02c8l\u032aa\u026a/}} in Standard Cebuano and is thus spelled \"bal\u00e1y\", even in Urban Cebuano where it is actually pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8ba\u026a/}}.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/>\n\nCebuano is spoken natively over a large area of the Philippines and thus has numerous regional dialects. It can vary significantly in terms of [[lexicon]] and phonology depending on where it is spoken.<ref name=\"Endriga 2010\"/> Increasing usage of spoken English (being the primary language of commerce and education in the Philippines) has also led to the introduction of new pronunciations and spellings of old Cebuano words.

It is also spoken in some parts of [[Siquijor]]. Boholano, especially as spoken in central Bohol, can be distinguished from other Cebuano variants by a few [[phonetic change]]s:\n*The semivowel ''y'' is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}: ''iya'' is pronounced {{IPA|[i\u02c8d\u0292a]}};\n*''Ako'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[a\u02c8ho]}};\n*Intervocalic ''l'' is occasionally pronounced as {{IPA|[w]}} when following ''u'' or ''o'': ''kulang'' is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u02c8kuwa\u014b]}} (the same as [[Metro Cebu]] dialect).\n\n=== Leyte\u00f1o Cebuano ===\n\n====Southern Kana====\nSouthern Kana is a dialect of southern [[Leyte]] and in [[Southern Leyte]]; it is closest to the Mindanao Cebuano dialect at the southern area and northern Cebu dialect at the northern boundaries. Both North and South Kana are subgroups of [[Leyte\u00f1o dialect]]. Both of these dialects are spoken in western and central Leyte and in the southern province, but the Boholano is more concentrated in [[Maasin City]].\n\nSpeakers of these two dialects can be distinguished by their distinctive modification of {{IPA|/j/}} into {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}, as in the words ayaw (don't) is turned into ajaw; dayon (come in) - dajun; bayad(pay) -bajad.   Like the Mindanao dialects, they are notable for their usage of a vocabulary containing archaic longer words like ''kalatkat'' (\"climb\") instead of ''katkat''.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==== Northern Kana ====\nNorth Kana (found in the northern part of [[Leyte]]), is closest to the variety of the language spoken in northern part of Leyte, and shows significant influence from Waray-Waray, quite notably in its pace which speakers from Cebu find very fast, and its more mellow tone (compared to the urban Cebu City dialect, which Kana speakers find \"rough\"). A distinguishing feature of this dialect is the reduction of {{IPA|/A/}} prominent, but an often unnoticed feature of this dialect is the labialisation of {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} into {{IPA|/m/}}, when these phonemes come before {{IPA|/p/}} {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}, velarisation of {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} into {{IPA|/\u014b/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} {{IPA|/\u0261/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, and the dentalisation of {{IPA|/\u014b/}} and {{IPA|/m/}} into {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} and sometimes, before vowels and other consonants as well.\n\nThe Northern Kana dialect generally contains less {{IPA|/l/}} sounds than standard Cebuano.{{cn|date=January 2020}} In between vowels {{IPA|/l/}} is removed, and depending on what vowel chain follows, it may create a long vowel or have {{IPA|/y/}} or {{IPA|/w/}} take its place. ([[Elision]])\n\nSome words also hold different meanings, like how the word \"ram\u0101w\"/\"lam\u0101w\" refers to the meat of young coconut suspended in either coconut juice or sugared milk in N. Kana; while in Standard Cebuano, \"lam\u0101w\" means \"rice leftovers\", which is \"bah\u0101w\" in S. Kana and Mindanao Cebuano.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Sugbu\n!Kana\n!Waray\n!English\n|-\n|Kan-on\n|Luto\n|Lut\u00f4\n|Cooked rice\n|-\n|Kini\n|Kiri/kini\n|Ini\n|This\n|-\n|Kana\n|Kara'/kana\n|Iton\n|That\n|-\n|Dinhi/Diri\n|ari/dinhi/diri\n|Didi/Ngadi/Aadi/Dinhi\n|Here\n|-\n|Diha/Dinha\n|Dira/diha/dinha\n|Dida/Ngada/Aada\n|There\n|-\n|Bas/Balas\n|Bas/Balas\n|Baras\n|Soil/Sand\n|-\n|Alsa\n|Arsa\n|Alsa\n|To lift\n|-\n|Bulsa\n|Bursa\n|Bulsa\n|Pocket\n|}\n\n=== Mindanao Cebuano ===\nThis is the variety of Cebuano spoken throughout most of [[Mindanao]] and it is the standard dialect of Cebuano in [[Northern Mindanao]].\n\nLocal historical sources found in Cagayan de Oro indicates the early presence of Cebuano Visayans in the Misamis-Agusan coastal areas and their contacts with the Lumads and peoples of the Rajahnate of Butuan. Lumads refer to these Visayan groups as \"Dumagat\" (\"people of the sea\") as they came in the area seaborne. It became the lingua franca of precolonial Visayan settlers and native Lumads of the area, and particularly of the ancient Rajahnate of Butuan where [[Butuanon language|Butuanon]], a Southern Visayan language, was also spoken. Cebuano influence in Lumad languages around the highlands of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon was furthered with the influx of Cebuano Visayan laborers and conscripts of the Spaniards from Cebuano areas of Visayas (particularly from Bohol) during the colonial period around the present-day region of Northern Mindanao. It has spread west towards the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], east towards the [[Caraga Region]], and south towards [[Bukidnon]], [[Cotabato]] and the [[Davao Region]] in the final years of Spanish colonial rule.\n\nSimilar to the Sialo dialect of southeastern Cebu, it is distinctive in retaining /l/ sounds, long since considered archaic in Urban Cebuano. For example: ''bulan'' instead of ''buwan'' (\"moon\" or \"month\"), ''dalunggan'' instead of ''dunggan'' (ear), and ''halang'' instead of ''hang'' (\"spicy\"). \n\nDue to the influx of migrants (mostly from Western Visayas and Leyte) during the promotion of settlement in the highlands of Central Mindanao in the 1930s, vocabulary from other Visayan languages (predominantly [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]]) have also been incorporated into Mindanao Cebuano. For example, the Hiligaynon ''s\u00e1bat'' (\"reply\") is commonly used alongside Cebuano ''tubag'', ''bulig'' alongside ''t\u00e1bang'' (\"help\"), and Waray ''lut\u00f4'' alongside ''kan-on'' (\"cooked rice\"). Though, these influences are only limited to the speakers along the port area and Hiligaynon-speaking communities.\n\n==== Davaoe\u00f1o Cebuano ====\n{{Distinguish|Chavacano language#Castellano Abakay (Chavacano Davaoe\u00f1o){{!}}Chavacano language: Castellano Abakay (Chabacano de Davao)}}\n\nA branch of Mindanao Cebuano in [[Davao City|Davao]] is also known as Davaoe\u00f1o (not to be confused with the Davao variant of [[Chavacano]] which is called \"Castellano Abakay\"). Like the Cebuano-speakers of Luzon (Luzon Cebuano dialect), it contains some [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] vocabulary to a greater extent. Its grammar is somewhat in between the original Cebuano language and the Luzon Cebuano dialect. However, speakers from Davao City nowadays exhibits stronger Tagalog influence in their speech by substituting most Cebuano words with Tagalog ones. One characteristic is the practice of saying ''at\u00e0'', derived from Tagalog ''yat\u00e0'' to denote uncertainty of a speaker's any aforementioned statements. For instance, ''\"To-a man <u>at\u00e0</u> sa bal\u00e1y si Manuel\"'' instead of ''\"To-a man <u>ting\u00e1li</u> sa bal\u00e1y si Manuel\"''. However, the word ''at\u00e0'' exists in Cebuano though it means \" squid ink\" (<u>at\u00e0 sa nukos</u>).\n\nOther examples include: ''<u>Nibab\u00e2</u> ko sa dyip sa kanto, <u>tapos</u> miul\u00ee ko sa among bal\u00e1y'' (\"I got off the [[jeepney]] at the street corner, and then I went home\") instead of ''<u>Nin\u00e1ug</u> ko sa dyip sa kanto, <u>dayon</u> miul\u00ee ko sa among bal\u00e1y''. The words ''bab\u00e2'' and ''naug'' mean \"to disembark\" or \"to go down\", while ''tapos'' and ''dayon'' mean \"then\"; the former is Tagalog, and the latter Cebuano. It also sometimes add some [[Mansakan languages|Bagobo and Mansakan]] vocabulary, like: ''<u>Madayaw</u> nga adlaw, amigo, kamusta ka?'' (\"<u>Good day</u>, friend, how are you?\", literally \"Good morning/afternoon\") rather than ''\"<u>Maayo</u> nga adlaw, amigo, kamusta ka?\"'' The words ''madayaw'' and ''maayo'' mean \"good\"; the former is Bagobo, and the latter Cebuano.\n\n===Negrense Cebuano===\nThe Cebuano dialect in [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]] is somewhat similar to the Standard Cebuano (spoken by the majority of the provincial areas of Cebu), with distinct [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] influences. It is distinctive in retaining {{IPA|/l/}} sounds and longer word forms as well. It is the primary dialectal language of the entire province of [[Negros Oriental]] and northeastern parts of [[Negros Occidental]] (while the majority of the latter province and its bordered areas speaks Hiligaynon/Ilonggo), as well as some parts of [[Siquijor]]. Examples of Negrense Cebuano's distinction from other Cebuano dialects is the usage of the word ''maot'' instead of ''bat\u00ee'' (\"ugly\"), ''al\u00e1lay'', ''kal\u00e1lag'' instead of ''kalag-kalag'' (Halloween), ''kabal\u00f3/kah\u00edbal\u00f3'' and ''ka\u00e1go/ka\u00e1ntigo'' instead of ''kabaw\u00f3/kah\u00edbaw\u00f3'' (\"know\").\n\n=== Other dialects ===\n\n==== Luzon Cebuano ====\nThere is no specific [[Luzon]] dialect, as speakers of Cebuano in Luzon come from many different regions in Central Visayas and Mindanao. Cebuano-speaking people from Luzon in Visayas can be easily recognized primarily by their vocabulary which incorporates [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] words. Their accents and some aspects of grammar can also sometimes exhibit [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] influence. The dialect is sometimes colloquially known as \"[[Bisalog]]\" (a [[portmanteau]] of Tagalog and Binisaya).\n\n==== ''Saksak Sinagol'' ====\nThe term [[wikt:saksak sinagol|saksak sinagol]] in context means \"a collection of miscellaneous things\" and literally \"inserted mixture\", thus those other few Cebuano-influenced regions that have a variety of regional languages uses this term to refer to their dialect with considerable incorporated Cebuano words. Example of these regions are places likes those in [[Masbate]].\n\n==Examples==\n===Numbers===\nCebuano uses two numeral systems:\n<br/>The '''native system''' (currently) is mostly used in counting the number of things, animate and inanimate, e.g. the number of horses, houses.\n<br/>The '''spanish-derived''' system, on the other hand, is exclusively applied in monetary terminology and is also commonly used in counting from 11 and above.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Meanwhile, Chinese troops had also made incursions into Indian-held territory, and tensions between the two reached a new high when Indian forces discovered the road constructed by China in Aksai Chin. After a series of failed negotiations, the [[People's Liberation Army]] attacked Indian Army positions on the Thag La ridge. This move by China caught India by surprise; and on 12 October Nehru gave orders for the Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor co-ordination among various divisions of the Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers, gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India from both the northwest and northeast, and captured large portions of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nAs the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate; however, India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no agreement in sight, China unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed, with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support from the United States, while China stated that it still held territory it had staked a claim on. The dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the [[Line of Actual Control]].\n\nThe poor decisions made by India's military commanders, and the political leadership, raised several questions. The [[Henderson-Brooks Report|Henderson-Brooks and Bhagat committee]] was soon set up by the government of India to determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. Its report criticised the decision not to allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines, out of fear of a Chinese aerial counter-attack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was placed on the then\u2013defence minister, [[Krishna Menon]], who resigned from his post soon after the war ended.

As the operation was fully under way, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in posts that were in the [[Sightline|line-of-sight]]. At many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults, which were slow and took a heavy toll, given the steep ascents that had to be made on peaks as high as {{convert|18000|ft|m}}. Two months into the conflict, Indian troops had slowly retaken most of the ridges they had lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n08/ali_01_.html|title=Tariq Ali \u00b7 Bitter Chill of Winter: Kashmir \u00b7 LRB 19 April 2001|work=London Review of Books|accessdate=4 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001175541/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n08/ali_01_.html|archivedate=1 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Colonel Ravi Nanda | title=Kargil : A Wake Up Call | publisher=Vedams Books | year=1999 | isbn=978-81-7095-074-5}} [https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no14953.htm Online summary of the Book] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055430/https://www.vedamsbooks.com/no14953.htm |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> According to official accounts, an estimated 75%\u201380% of the enemy-occupied area, and nearly all the high ground, was back under Indian control.\n\nFollowing the Washington Accord of 4 July, where Sharif agreed to withdraw Pakistani troops, most of the fighting came to a gradual halt; but some Pakistani forces remained in positions on the Indian side of the LOC.

However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially against insurgencies in [[Kashmir]] and [[Northeast India]]. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its [[special forces]] capabilities. With India's increasing international role, and the requirement to protect its interests in far-off countries becomes important, the Indian Army and Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |title=Army and navy plan to set up a marine brigade |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019211335/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |archivedate=19 October 2010  }}</ref>{{update inline|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations would attack at a point of India's choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role.\n\n==Organisation==\n{{Main|List of serving generals of the Indian Army}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Principal Staff Officers at Headquarters, Indian Army \n!Post\n!Current Holder\n|- \n|[[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]] \n|General [[Manoj Mukund Naravane]], PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, ADC\n|- \n|[[Vice Chief of Army Staff (India)|Vice Chief of Army Staff]]\n|Lieutenant General [[Satinder Kumar Saini]] AVSM,YSM,VSM\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Information Systems & Training)\n|\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Planning & Systems) \n|Lieutenant General Sudharshan Shrikant Hasabnis<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|title='Make in India' not just confined to India anymore, benefitting others: Jitendra Singh|work=Outlook|access-date=10 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910094634/https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant General]] \n|Lieutenant General Ashwani Kumar, AVSM<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|website=uniindia.com|accessdate=12 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707115430/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|title=Lt General Ashwani Kumar assumes charge as Adjutant General|access-date=12 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202223736/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|archive-date=2 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Military Secretary (India)|Military Secretary]] \n|Lieutenant General [[Jaswinder Singh Sandhu (general)|Jaswinder Singh Sandhu]], UYSM, AVSM, VSM<ref name=\"Kashmir News Zone\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|title=Lt Gen A K Bhatt to take over as 15 Corps GOC \u2013 Kashmir News Zone|date=15 December 2017|work=Kashmir News Zone|access-date=29 December 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816105614/http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|archive-date=16 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Master-General of the Ordnance|Master General of Ordnance]] \n|Lieutenant General S K Upadhya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projectyourstate.com/index.php/Home/display/Lt-Gen-S-K-Upadhyay-designated-as-MGO|title=Lt Gen S K Upadhyay designated as MGO|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer-in-Chief]] \n|Lieutenant General [[S.

These include the [[President's Bodyguard]] and [[61st Cavalry (India)|61st Cavalry]] the as well as the following historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier: [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|1st (Skinner's) Horse]], the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]], the [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Cavalry]], the [[4th Duke of Cambridge's Own Hodson's Horse|4th (Hodson's) Horse]], the [[7th Light Cavalry]], the [[8th King George's Own Light Cavalry|8th Light Cavalry]], the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse|9th (Deccan) Horse]], the [[14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse|14th (Scinde) Horse]], the [[The Poona Horse|17th (Poona) Horse]], the [[15th Lancers]], the [[16th Light Cavalry]], the [[18th Cavalry]], the 20th Lancers and the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|21st (Central India) Horse]]. A substantial number of additional units designated as either \"Cavalry\" or \"Armoured\" Regiments have been raised since Independence.\n\n'''[[Mechanised infantry|Mechanised Infantry]]'''\n\nThe Mechanised Infantry is the newest combat arm of the Indian Army. Often referred to as \"tomorrow's arm in today's army\", it is formed of two regiments\u2014[[Brigade of the Guards#Regimental Battalions|The Brigade of the Guards]] and [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment]]\u2014and comprises 48 Mechanised Infantry battalions in all. It is the brainchild of General [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji]] (28 April 1930 \u2013 8 February 1999), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988. During the late 70s, as part of Indian Army modernisation, there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces, which led to the forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action, fire-power, flexibility, and mobility of armoured formations by including ground-holding ability. The Mechanised Infantry regiments were first created with carefully selected existing Infantry battalions, based on their operational performance. As the need for more mechanised battalions grew, the elite Brigade of The Guards were also converted to the mechanised profile. The two regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army's elite \"Mechanised Forces\".\n\n'''Infantry'''\n[[File:Indian Army Gurkha rifles.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army Gorkha Rifles troopers, during a combat simulation in Fort Irwin, California.]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Rajput regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Rajput Regiment]] during a [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day Parade]]]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Sikh Light Infantry regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Sikh Light Infantry]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Madras regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Madras Regiment]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n\nUpon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations. As such, it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.\n\nMost Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as region (for example, the [[Assam Regiment]]), caste/community ([[Jat Regiment]]), or religion ([[Sikh Regiment]]). Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence, some of which have specialised in border defence, in particular the [[Ladakh Scouts]], the [[Arunachal Scouts]], and the [[Sikkim Scouts]].\n\nOver the years there have been fears that troops' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the Indian union as a whole. Thus some \"all India\" or \"all class\" regiments have been created, which recruit troops from all over India, regardless of region, caste, community, or religion: such as the [[Brigade of the Guards]] (which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile) and the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Infantry regiments in the Indian Army<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |title=Infantry Regiments |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007164813/http://bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}</ref>\n!Regiment\n!Regimental Center\n!Raised\n|-\n|[[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]\n|[[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]\n|1945\n|-\n|[[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]]\n|[[Ramgarh Cantonment]], [[Jharkhand]]\n|1761\n|-\n|[[Madras Regiment]]\n|[[Wellington Cantonment]], [[Tamil Nadu]]\n|1758\n|-\n|[[The Grenadiers]]\n|[[Jabalpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Maratha Light Infantry]]\n|[[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n|1768\n|-\n|[[Rajputana Rifles]]\n|[[Delhi Cantonment]], [[New Delhi]]\n|1775\n|-\n|[[Rajput Regiment]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Jat Regiment]]\n|[[Bareilly]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1795\n|-\n|[[Sikh Regiment]]\n|Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand\n|1846\n|-\n|[[Sikh Light Infantry]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[Dogra Regiment]]\n|[[Faizabad]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1877\n|-\n|[[Garhwal Rifles]]\n|[[Lansdowne, India|Lansdowne]], [[Uttarakhand]]\n|1887\n|-\n|[[Kumaon Regiment]]\n|[[Ranikhet]], Uttarakhand\n|1813\n|-\n|[[Assam Regiment]]\n|[[Shillong]], [[Meghalaya]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Bihar Regiment]]\n|[[Danapur Cantonment]], [[Bihar]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Mahar Regiment]]\n|[[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]], Madhya Pradesh\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Jammu & Kashmir Rifles]]\n|Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh\n|1821\n|-\n|[[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry]]\n|[[Avantipur]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]]\n|1947\n|-\n|[[Naga Regiment]]\n|Ranikhet, Uttarakhand\n|1970\n|-\n|[[1 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Sabathu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]\n|1815\n|-\n|[[3 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Varanasi]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1815\n|-\n|[[4 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Sabathu, Himachal Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1858\n|-\n|[[8 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1824\n|-\n|[[9 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh\n|1817\n|-\n|[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Lucknow]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1918\n|-\n|[[Ladakh Scouts]]\n|[[Leh]], Jammu and Kashmir\n|1963\n|-\n|[[Rashtriya Rifles]]\n|\n|1990\n|-\n|[[Arunachal Scouts]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|2010\n|-\n|[[Sikkim Scouts]]\n|\n|2013\n|}\n\n'''Artillery'''\n[[File:The DRDO's Pinaka Launcher system gliding down the Rajpath during the Republic Day Parade - 2006, in New Delhi on January 26, 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher]]s were used during the [[Kargil War]].]]\n\nThe [[Regiment of Artillery]] is the second largest arm of the Indian Army, constituting nearly one sixth of the Army's total strength.

The earliest existing subunit of the Corps (18 Field Company) dates back to 1777, while the Corps officially recognises its birth as 1780, when the senior-most group of the Corps, the Madras Sappers, were raised. The Corps consists of three groups of combat engineers, namely the [[Madras Engineer Group|Madras Sappers]], the [[Bengal Engineer Group|Bengal Sappers]], and the [[Bombay Engineer Group|Bombay Sappers]]. A group is roughly analogous to a regiment of Indian infantry, each group consisting of a number of engineer regiments.

The MI (as it is commonly referred to) was constituted in 1941. It was initially created to check corruption in the Army's own ranks. With time, its role has evolved into cross-border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent groups, and counter-terrorism.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the [[Samba spy scandal]], wherein three Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies. The organisation has since emerged from the scandal as a prime intelligence organisation of the Indian Army.\n\n{{as of|2012}}, the MI has seen many of its roles taken away by the newly created [[National Technical Research Organisation]] and the [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|Defence Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |title=How Indian Army's Military Intelligence Directorate works : Special Report&nbsp;\u2013 India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031141954/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |archivedate=31 October 2012  }}</ref> Since it was set up in 2004 as a premier scientific agency under the National Security Adviser in the Prime Minister's Office, it also includes the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD), which is the first of its kind in Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|title=State govt allots land for NTRO in Borda village|work=IBNLive|accessdate=4 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017235147/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|archivedate=17 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Field formations===\nBelow are the basic field formations of the Indian Army:\n\n*[[Command (military formation)|Command]]: Indian Army has six operational commands and one training command.

This was a temporary measure which became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the [[Second Boer War]] in 1902, did the entire [[British Army]] standardise on [[dun]] for [[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]]. The Indian Army uniform standardises on dun for khaki.\n\nThe Indian Army camouflage uniform consists of shirts, trousers, and cap of a synthetic material. Shirts are buttoned up with two chest pockets with buttoned flaps. Trousers have two pockets, two thigh box pockets, and a back pocket. The Indian Army Jungle [[camouflage]] dress features a jungle camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments. The Indian Army Desert camouflage, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert, and desert areas of [[Rajasthan]] and its vicinity.\n\nThe modern Indian Army wears distinctive parade uniforms characterised by variegated turbans and waist-sashes in regimental colours. The Gurkha and Garwhal Rifles and the Assam, Kumaon, and Naga Regiments wear broad brimmed hats of traditional style. Traditionally, all rifle regiments (the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, the Garhwal Rifles, all Gorkha Rifles, and the Rajputana Rifles) as well as the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry wear [[rank badge]]s, buttons, and wire-embroidered articles in black, instead of the usual brass (or gold) colour, as the original role of the rifle regiments was camouflage and concealment.\n\n===Medals and awards===\n{{Main|Awards and decorations of the Indian Armed Forces}}\n\nThe medals awarded by the President of India for gallantry displayed on the battlefield, in order of precedence, are [[Param Vir Chakra]], [[Maha Vir Chakra]], and [[Vir Chakra]].\n\nThe medals awarded by the President for gallantry displayed away from the battlefield, in order of precedence, are [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]], [[Kirti Chakra]], and [[Shaurya Chakra]].\n\nMany of the recipients of these awards have been Indian Army personnel.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:Dr Seema Rao Woman Commando Trainer at Corps Battle School Northern Command Indian Army.png|alt=|thumb|A female civilian Contractor<ref>https://www.forbesindia.com/article/2019-wpower-trailblazers/dr-seema-rao-indias-first-female-combat-trainer-fighting-stereotypes/52713/1</ref> briefing Indian Army soldiers on firing techniques.]]\n\nThe role of [[Women in Indian Armed Forces#Indian Army|women in the Indian army]] began when the Indian Military Nursing Service was formed in 1888.

China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.\n\nSmall-scale clashes between Indian and Chinese forces broke out as India insisted on the disputed [[McMahon Line]] being regarded as the international border between the two countries. Chinese troops claimed not to have retaliated to the cross-border firing by Indian troops, despite sustaining losses.<ref>Bruce Bueno de Mesquita & David Lalman.

Meanwhile, Chinese troops had also made incursions into Indian-held territory, and tensions between the two reached a new high when Indian forces discovered the road constructed by China in Aksai Chin. After a series of failed negotiations, the [[People's Liberation Army]] attacked Indian Army positions on the Thag La ridge. This move by China caught India by surprise; and on 12 October Nehru gave orders for the Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor co-ordination among various divisions of the Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers, gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India from both the northwest and northeast, and captured large portions of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nAs the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate; however, India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no agreement in sight, China unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed, with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support from the United States, while China stated that it still held territory it had staked a claim on. The dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the [[Line of Actual Control]].\n\nThe poor decisions made by India's military commanders, and the political leadership, raised several questions. The [[Henderson-Brooks Report|Henderson-Brooks and Bhagat committee]] was soon set up by the government of India to determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. Its report criticised the decision not to allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines, out of fear of a Chinese aerial counter-attack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was placed on the then\u2013defence minister, [[Krishna Menon]], who resigned from his post soon after the war ended. Despite frequent calls for its release, the Henderson-Brooks report still remains classified.<ref>Claude Arpi. ''India and her neighbourhood: a French observer's views''.

Pakistani leaders believed that India, which was still recovering from the Sino-Indian War, would be unable to deal with a military thrust and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted swiftly and launched a counter-offensive against Pakistan. In reply, on 1 September Pakistan launched [[Operation Grand Slam]], invading India's Chamb-Jaurian sector. In retaliation, the Indian Army launched a major offensive all along its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as its prime target.\n\n[[File:1965 Indo-Pak War DestroyedShermanTank.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army officer next to a destroyed Pakistani Sherman tank, after the battle of ''Asal Uttar.'']]\n\nInitially, the Indian Army met with considerable success in the northern sector.

Diplomatic tensions eased after the [[Lahore Summit]] was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism was short-lived. In mid-1999, Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the [[Kargil district]] of India. These had been vacated by the Indian Army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were to be reoccupied in spring. The troops that took control of these areas received important support, of both arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital [[Srinagar]]\u2013[[Leh]] Highway ([[National Highway 1 (India)|NH 1A]]), [[Batalik]], and [[Dras]].\n\n[[File:KWM.jpg|thumb|Kargil War Memorial looking at National Highway 1 from the foot of Tololing]]\n\nOnce the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realised, the Indian Army quickly mobilised about 200,000 troops, and [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] was launched. However, since the heights were under Pakistani control, India was at a clear strategic disadvantage. From their [[observation post]]s, the Pakistani forces had a clear line-of-sight to lay down [[indirect fire|indirect artillery fire]] on NH 1A, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians.<ref name=\"NLI\">[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-5-2003_pg7_14 Indian general praises Pakistani valour at Kargil] 5 May 2003 Daily Times, Pakistan {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116123416/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-5-2003_pg7_14 |date=16 January 2009 }}</ref> This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main supply route.<ref>Kashmir in the Shadow of War By Robert Wirsing Published by M.E.

Once the NH 1A area was cleared, the Indian Army turned to driving the invading force back across the Line of Control. The [[Battle of Tololing]], among others, slowly tilted the war in India's favour. Nevertheless, some Pakistani posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140), which fell only later in the war. As the operation was fully under way, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in posts that were in the [[Sightline|line-of-sight]]. At many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults, which were slow and took a heavy toll, given the steep ascents that had to be made on peaks as high as {{convert|18000|ft|m}}.

The exercise is conducted to practice and validate anti-terrorist operations in snowbound and mountainous areas. The first joint exercise was held in India in October 2011 and the second one in September 2013. The theme of the exercise is to conduct joint platoon-level counter-insurgency operations in high-altitude mountainous terrain under the UN Charter, thus emphasising the shared concerns of both countries regarding global terrorism. An added aim of the exercise is to qualitatively enhance knowledge of each other's military procedures, thus increasing the scope for interoperability and the ability to respond to a common threat. The twelve-day exercise with the French Army is scheduled to be conducted in multiple modules in order to achieve complete integration between the two contingents at every stage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |title=Indo-French joint Army exercise Shakti 2013 begins today |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706090958/http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |title=Indo-French Joint Army Exercise \"Shakti 2016\" |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018110057/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Shoorveer'''\n\nFrom the first week of April to the first week of May 2012, the Indian Army launched a massive summer exercise in the Rajasthan desert, involving over 50,000 troops and several hundred artillery pieces and infantry combat vehicles, as part of its efforts to shore up its battle worthiness on the western front, the border with Pakistan. The exercise, code-named \"Shoorveer\", was being conducted by the Jaipur-based South Western Command. This was the largest ever exercise conducted by Indian army since 1947. The collective training started with the honing of basic battle procedures and tactical drills.\n\nA number of field firings were carried out to check the accuracy and lethality of weapon systems. Many innovations, adopted by units and formations to enhance combat power, were tested in the field. The troops built on the training momentum gradually, with increasing combat tempo, to set the stage for a major joint army\u2013air force exercise in the later part of the exercise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |title=Indian Army gears up for war game in Rajasthan desert |publisher=FacenFacts |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605123334/http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |archivedate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Rudra Akrosh'''\n\nIn May 2012, the Indian Army started testing the preparedness level of its units and to validate new-age technology, battle concepts, organizational structures, and networked operations. The army's Western Command conducted its summer training exercises in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Code-named Exercise Rudra Akrosh, the war games were aimed at validating the operational and transformational effectiveness of various formations under the Command. It included various summer training manoeuvres where approximately 20,000 troops tested battle skills with state-of-the-art weapons systems in complete integration with the fighter and transport aircraft provided by the Indian Air Force. The head of Western Command, Lieutenant General S. R. Ghosh, on hand during the exercise's culminating phase, interacted with the soldiers and officers co-ordinating the war games and witnessed various battle manoeuvres by infantry troops, mechanised infantry, tanks, artillery, heli-borne troops, and surveillance equipment. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and attack helicopters were also a part of the operational scenario.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises/997533.html |title=Western Army Command conducts summer training exercises, IBN Live News |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928032748/http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises/997533.html |archivedate=28 September 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2016|reason=failed bot fix, 28 February}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises-112051100459_1.html |title=Western Army Command conducts summer training exercises |date=2012-05-11 |work=Business Standard India |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Nomadic Elephant'''\n\nSince 2004, and every year since, the Indian Army has been conducting training exercises with the [[Mongolian Army]].

However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially against insurgencies in [[Kashmir]] and [[Northeast India]]. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its [[special forces]] capabilities. With India's increasing international role, and the requirement to protect its interests in far-off countries becomes important, the Indian Army and Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |title=Army and navy plan to set up a marine brigade |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019211335/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |archivedate=19 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{update inline|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations would attack at a point of India's choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role.\n\n==Organisation==\n{{Main|List of serving generals of the Indian Army}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Principal Staff Officers at Headquarters, Indian Army \n!Post\n!Current Holder\n|- \n|[[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]] \n|General [[Manoj Mukund Naravane]], PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, ADC\n|- \n|[[Vice Chief of Army Staff (India)|Vice Chief of Army Staff]]\n|Lieutenant General [[Satinder Kumar Saini]] AVSM,YSM,VSM\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Information Systems & Training)\n|\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Planning & Systems) \n|Lieutenant General Sudharshan Shrikant Hasabnis<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|title='Make in India' not just confined to India anymore, benefitting others: Jitendra Singh|work=Outlook|access-date=2018-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910094634/https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant General]] \n|Lieutenant General Ashwani Kumar, AVSM<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|website=uniindia.com|accessdate=2017-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707115430/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|title=Lt General Ashwani Kumar assumes charge as Adjutant General|access-date=12 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202223736/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|archive-date=2 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Military Secretary (India)|Military Secretary]] \n|Lieutenant General [[Jaswinder Singh Sandhu (general)|Jaswinder Singh Sandhu]], UYSM, AVSM, VSM<ref name=\"Kashmir News Zone\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|title=Lt Gen A K Bhatt to take over as 15 Corps GOC - Kashmir News Zone|date=2017-12-15|work=Kashmir News Zone|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816105614/http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|archive-date=16 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Master-General of the Ordnance|Master General of Ordnance]] \n|Lieutenant General S K Upadhya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projectyourstate.com/index.php/Home/display/Lt-Gen-S-K-Upadhyay-designated-as-MGO|title=Lt Gen S K Upadhyay designated as MGO|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer-in-Chief]] \n|Lieutenant General [[S.

These include the [[President's Bodyguard]] and [[61st Cavalry (India)|61st Cavalry]] the as well as the following historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier: [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|1st (Skinner's) Horse]], the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]], the [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Cavalry]], the [[4th Duke of Cambridge's Own Hodson's Horse|4th (Hodson's) Horse]], the [[7th Light Cavalry]], the [[8th King George's Own Light Cavalry|8th Light Cavalry]], the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse|9th (Deccan) Horse]], the [[14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse|14th (Scinde) Horse]], the [[The Poona Horse|17th (Poona) Horse]], the [[15th Lancers]], the [[16th Light Cavalry]], the [[18th Cavalry]], the 20th Lancers and the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|21st (Central India) Horse]]. A substantial number of additional units designated as either \"Cavalry\" or \"Armoured\" Regiments have been raised since Independence.\n\n'''[[Mechanised infantry|Mechanised Infantry]]'''\n\nThe Mechanised Infantry is the newest combat arm of the Indian Army. Often referred to as \"tomorrow's arm in today's army\", it is formed of two regiments\u2014[[Brigade of the Guards#Regimental Battalions|The Brigade of the Guards]] and [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment]]\u2014and comprises 48 Mechanised Infantry battalions in all. It is the brainchild of General [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji]] (28 April 1930 \u2013 8 February 1999), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988. During the late 70s, as part of Indian Army modernisation, there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces, which led to the forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action, fire-power, flexibility, and mobility of armoured formations by including ground-holding ability. The Mechanised Infantry regiments were first created with carefully selected existing Infantry battalions, based on their operational performance. As the need for more mechanised battalions grew, the elite Brigade of The Guards were also converted to the mechanised profile. The two regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army's elite \"Mechanised Forces\".\n\n'''Infantry'''\n[[File:Indian Army Gurkha rifles.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army Gorkha Rifles troopers, during a combat simulation in Fort Irwin, California.]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Rajput regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Rajput Regiment]] during a [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day Parade]]]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Sikh Light Infantry regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Sikh Light Infantry]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Madras regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Madras Regiment]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n\nUpon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations. As such, it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.\n\nMost Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as region (for example, the [[Assam Regiment]]), caste/community ([[Jat Regiment]]), or religion ([[Sikh Regiment]]). Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence, some of which have specialised in border defence, in particular the [[Ladakh Scouts]], the [[Arunachal Scouts]], and the [[Sikkim Scouts]].\n\nOver the years there have been fears that troops' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the Indian union as a whole. Thus some \"all India\" or \"all class\" regiments have been created, which recruit troops from all over India, regardless of region, caste, community, or religion: such as the [[Brigade of the Guards]] (which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile) and the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Infantry regiments in the Indian Army<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |title=Infantry Regiments |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007164813/http://bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}</ref>\n!Regiment\n!Regimental Center\n!Raised\n|-\n|[[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]\n|[[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]\n|1945\n|-\n|[[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]]\n|[[Ramgarh Cantonment]], [[Jharkhand]]\n|1761\n|-\n|[[Madras Regiment]]\n|[[Wellington Cantonment]], [[Tamil Nadu]]\n|1758\n|-\n|[[The Grenadiers]]\n|[[Jabalpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Maratha Light Infantry]]\n|[[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n|1768\n|-\n|[[Rajputana Rifles]]\n|[[Delhi Cantonment]], [[New Delhi]]\n|1775\n|-\n|[[Rajput Regiment]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Jat Regiment]]\n|[[Bareilly]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1795\n|-\n|[[Sikh Regiment]]\n|Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand\n|1846\n|-\n|[[Sikh Light Infantry]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[Dogra Regiment]]\n|[[Faizabad]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1877\n|-\n|[[Garhwal Rifles]]\n|[[Lansdowne, India|Lansdowne]], [[Uttarakhand]]\n|1887\n|-\n|[[Kumaon Regiment]]\n|[[Ranikhet]], Uttarakhand\n|1813\n|-\n|[[Assam Regiment]]\n|[[Shillong]], [[Meghalaya]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Bihar Regiment]]\n|[[Danapur Cantonment]], [[Bihar]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Mahar Regiment]]\n|[[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]], Madhya Pradesh\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Jammu & Kashmir Rifles]]\n|Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh\n|1821\n|-\n|[[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry]]\n|[[Avantipur]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]]\n|1947\n|-\n|[[Naga Regiment]]\n|Ranikhet, Uttarakhand\n|1970\n|-\n|[[1 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Sabathu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]\n|1815\n|-\n|[[3 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Varanasi]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1815\n|-\n|[[4 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Sabathu, Himachal Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1858\n|-\n|[[8 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1824\n|-\n|[[9 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh\n|1817\n|-\n|[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Lucknow]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1918\n|-\n|[[Ladakh Scouts]]\n|[[Leh]], Jammu and Kashmir\n|1963\n|-\n|[[Rashtriya Rifles]]\n|\n|1990\n|-\n|[[Arunachal Scouts]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|2010\n|-\n|[[Sikkim Scouts]]\n|\n|2013\n|}\n\n'''Artillery'''\n[[File:The DRDO's Pinaka Launcher system gliding down the Rajpath during the Republic Day Parade - 2006, in New Delhi on January 26, 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher]]s were used during the [[Kargil War]].]]\n\nThe [[Regiment of Artillery]] is the second largest arm of the Indian Army, constituting nearly one sixth of the Army's total strength.

The earliest existing subunit of the Corps (18 Field Company) dates back to 1777, while the Corps officially recognises its birth as 1780, when the senior-most group of the Corps, the Madras Sappers, were raised. The Corps consists of three groups of combat engineers, namely the [[Madras Engineer Group|Madras Sappers]], the [[Bengal Engineer Group|Bengal Sappers]], and the [[Bombay Engineer Group|Bombay Sappers]]. A group is roughly analogous to a regiment of Indian infantry, each group consisting of a number of engineer regiments.

The corps actively took part in the [[Second World War]], fighting on behalf of the [[British Empire]]. Post-independence, the corps has participated in all the [[wars involving India]], starting with the [[1947 Indo-Pakistani War]], up to the [[1999 Kargil conflict]]. The corps enjoyed autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of Air Defence Artillery from the Army's artillery regiment. A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College (AADC), was established to train its personnel.\n\n'''Para (Special Forces)'''\n\n[[Para (Special Forces)]], commonly known as '''Para SF''', is the [[special operations]] unit of Indian Army.

With time, its role has evolved into cross-border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent groups, and counter-terrorism.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the [[Samba spy scandal]], wherein three Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies.

The Indian Army Jungle [[camouflage]] dress features a jungle camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments. The Indian Army Desert camouflage, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert, and desert areas of [[Rajasthan]] and its vicinity.\n\nThe modern Indian Army wears distinctive parade uniforms characterised by variegated turbans and waist-sashes in regimental colours. The Gurkha and Garwhal Rifles and the Assam, Kumaon, and Naga Regiments wear broad brimmed hats of traditional style. Traditionally, all rifle regiments (the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, the Garhwal Rifles, all Gorkha Rifles, and the Rajputana Rifles) as well as the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry wear [[rank badge]]s, buttons, and wire-embroidered articles in black, instead of the usual brass (or gold) colour, as the original role of the rifle regiments was camouflage and concealment.\n\n===Medals and awards===\n{{Main|Awards and decorations of the Indian Armed Forces}}\n\nThe medals awarded by the President of India for gallantry displayed on the battlefield, in order of precedence, are [[Param Vir Chakra]], [[Maha Vir Chakra]], and [[Vir Chakra]].\n\nThe medals awarded by the President for gallantry displayed away from the battlefield, in order of precedence, are [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]], [[Kirti Chakra]], and [[Shaurya Chakra]].\n\nMany of the recipients of these awards have been Indian Army personnel.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:Dr Seema Rao Woman Commando Trainer at Corps Battle School Northern Command Indian Army.png|alt=|thumb|A female civilian Contractor<ref>https://www.forbesindia.com/article/2019-wpower-trailblazers/dr-seema-rao-indias-first-female-combat-trainer-fighting-stereotypes/52713/1</ref> briefing Indian Army soldiers on firing techniques.]]\n\nThe role of [[Women in Indian Armed Forces#Indian Army|women in the Indian army]] began when the Indian Military Nursing Service was formed in 1888.

The AC nature of the mains power is revealed by the dashed appearance of the traces of moving lights.]]\n\n'''Power''' in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit. In [[alternating current]] circuits, energy storage elements such as [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow.\n\nThe portion of power that, averaged over a complete cycle of the [[AC waveform]], results in net transfer of energy in one direction is known as '''active power''' (more commonly called '''real power''' to avoid ambiguity especially in discussions of loads with non-sinusoidal currents). The portion of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as ''reactive power''.\n\n=={{anchor|Active power|Reactive power|Apparent power|Complex power|Real power}}Active, reactive, and apparent power==\nIn a simple [[alternating current]] (AC) circuit consisting of a source and a linear load, both the current and voltage are [[sine wave|sinusoidal]]. If the load is purely [[resistive]], the two quantities reverse their polarity at the same time. At every instant the product of voltage and current is positive or zero, the result being that the direction of energy flow does not reverse. In this case, only active power is transferred.\n\nIf the load is purely [[Electrical reactance|''reactive'']], then the voltage and current are 90&nbsp;degrees out of phase. For two quarters of each cycle, the product of voltage and current is positive, but for the other two quarters, the product is negative, indicating that on average, exactly as much energy flows into the load as flows back out. There is no net energy flow over each half cycle. In this case, only reactive power flows: There is no net transfer of energy to the load; however, electrical power does flow along the wires and returns by flowing in reverse along the same wires.  The current required for this reactive power flow dissipates energy in the line resistance, even if the ideal load device consumes no energy itself. Practical loads have resistance as well as inductance, or capacitance, so both active and reactive powers will flow to normal loads.\n\nApparent power is the product of the [[root-mean-square|rms]] values of voltage and current. Apparent power is taken into account when designing and operating power systems, because although the current associated with reactive power does no work at the load, it still must be supplied by the power source. Conductors, transformers and generators must be sized to carry the total current, not just the current that does useful work. Failure to provide for the supply of sufficient reactive power in electrical grids can lead to lowered voltage levels and, under certain operating conditions, to the complete collapse of the network or [[Power outage|blackout]]. Another consequence is that adding the apparent power for two loads will not accurately give the total power unless they have the same phase difference between current and voltage (the same [[power factor]]).\n\nConventionally, capacitors are treated as if they generate reactive power, and inductors are treated as if they consume it.  If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' ('generated') by the load. Purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by 90&nbsp;degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by 90&nbsp;degrees. The result of this is that capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://electricalnotes.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/importance-of-reactive-power-for-system/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512200158/https://electricalnotes.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/importance-of-reactive-power-for-system/ |archivedate=2015-05-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cmplxpower.svg|thumb|280px|'''<u>The Power Triangle</u>'''<br>The complex power is the vector sum of active and reactive power.

For two systems transmitting the same amount of active power, the system with the lower power factor will have higher circulating currents due to energy that returns to the source from energy storage in the load. These higher currents produce higher losses and reduce overall transmission efficiency.  A lower power factor circuit will have a higher apparent power and higher losses for the same amount of active power. The power factor is 1.0 when the voltage and current are in [[Phase (waves)|phase]].  It is zero when the current leads or lags the voltage by 90 degrees. When the voltage and current are 180 degrees out of phase, the power factor is negative one, and the load is feeding energy into the source (an example would be a home with solar cells on the roof that feed power into the power grid when the sun is shining). Power factors are usually stated as \"leading\" or \"lagging\" to show the sign of the phase angle of current with respect to voltage. Voltage is designated as the base to which current angle is compared, meaning that current is thought of as either \"leading\" or \"lagging\" voltage. Where the waveforms are purely sinusoidal, the power factor is the cosine of the phase angle (<math>\\varphi</math>) between the current and voltage sinusoidal waveforms. Equipment data sheets and nameplates will often abbreviate power factor as \"<math>\\cos \\phi</math>\" for this reason.\n\nExample: The active power is {{nowrap|700 W}} and the phase angle between voltage and current is 45.6\u00b0. The power factor is {{nowrap|cos(45.6\u00b0) &#61; 0.700}}. The apparent power is then: {{nowrap|700 W / cos(45.6\u00b0) &#61; 1000 VA}}. The concept of power dissipation in AC circuit is explained and illustrated with the example.</ref>\n\nFor instance, a power factor of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 percent of the total current supplied is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and has to be made up by the utility. Usually, utilities do not charge consumers for the reactive power losses, as they do no real work for the consumer. However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer's load source that cause the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacities.\n\n==Reactive power==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\nIn a direct current circuit, the power flowing to the load is proportional to the product of the current through the load and the potential drop across the load.  Energy flows in one direction from the source to the load. In AC power, the voltage and current both vary approximately sinusoidally. When there is inductance or capacitance in the circuit, the voltage and current waveforms do not line up perfectly. The power flow has two components \u2013 one component flows from source to load and can perform work at the load; the other portion, known as \"reactive power\", is due to the delay between voltage and current, known as phase angle, and cannot do useful work at the load. It can be thought of as current that is arriving at the wrong time (too late or too early). To distinguish reactive power from active power, it is measured in units of \"[[volt-amperes reactive]]\", or var. These units can simplify to Watts but are left as var to denote that they represent no actual work output.\n\nEnergy stored in capacitive or inductive elements of the network gives rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique is known as [[flexible AC transmission system|reactive compensation]] is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load, a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor and not have to be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice saves energy because it reduces the amount of energy that is required to be produced by the utility to do the same amount of work. Additionally, it allows for more efficient transmission line designs using smaller conductors or fewer bundled conductors and optimizing the design of transmission towers.\n\n=== Capacitive vs. inductive loads ===\nStored energy in the magnetic or electric field of a load device, such as a motor or capacitor, causes an offset between the current and the voltage waveforms.  A capacitor is an AC device that stores energy in the form of an electric field. As current is driven through the capacitor, charge build-up causes an opposing voltage to develop across the capacitor. This voltage increases until some maximum dictated by the capacitor structure. In an AC network, the voltage across a capacitor is constantly changing. The capacitor opposes this change, causing the current to lead the voltage in phase. Capacitors are said to \"source\" reactive power, and thus to cause a leading power factor.\n\nInduction machines ( i guess you mean induction motors....)are some of the most common types of loads in the electric power system today. These machines use [[inductors]], or large coils of wire to store energy in the form of a magnetic field. When a voltage is initially placed across the coil, the inductor strongly resists this change in a current and magnetic field, which causes a time delay for the current to reach its maximum value. This causes the current to lag behind the voltage in phase. Inductors are said to \"sink\" reactive power, and thus to cause a lagging power factor. [[Induction generator]]s can source or sink reactive power, and provide a measure of control to system operators over reactive power flow and thus voltage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~dolguin/mas961/loads.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025015726/http://web.media.mit.edu/~dolguin/mas961/loads.html |archivedate=2015-10-25 }}</ref> Because these devices have opposite effects on the phase angle between voltage and current, they can be used to \"cancel out\" each other's effects. This usually takes the form of capacitor banks being used to counteract the lagging power factor caused by induction motors.\n\n==Reactive power control==\nTransmission connected generators are generally required to support reactive power flow. For example, on the United Kingdom transmission system, generators are required by the Grid Code Requirements to supply their rated power between the limits of 0.85 power factor lagging and 0.90 power factor leading at the designated terminals. The system operator will perform switching actions to maintain a secure and economical voltage profile while maintaining a reactive power balance equation:\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{Generator\\ MVARs + System\\ gain + Shunt\\ capacitors = MVAR\\ Demand + Reactive\\ losses + Shunt\\ reactors}</math>\n\nThe \u2018[[Ferranti effect|system gain]]\u2019 is an important source of reactive power in the above power balance equation, which is generated by the capacitative nature of the transmission network itself. By making decisive switching actions in the early morning before the demand increases, the system gain can be maximized early on, helping to secure the system for the whole day. To balance the equation some pre-fault reactive generator use will be required. Other sources of reactive power that will also be used include shunt capacitors, shunt reactors, [[static VAR compensator]]s and voltage control circuits.\n\n==Unbalanced polyphase systems==\nWhile active power and reactive power are well defined in any system, the definition of apparent power for unbalanced polyphase systems is considered to be one of the most controversial topics in power engineering.  Originally, apparent power arose merely as a figure of merit.  Major delineations of the concept are attributed to [[William Stanley, Jr.|Stanley]]'s ''Phenomena of Retardation in the Induction Coil'' (1888) and [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz|Steinmetz]]'s ''Theoretical Elements of Engineering'' (1915).  However, with the development of [[three phase]] power distribution, it became clear that the definition of apparent power and the power factor could not be applied to unbalanced [[polyphase systems]].  In 1920, a \"Special Joint Committee of the AIEE and the National Electric Light Association\" met to resolve the issue.  They considered two definitions. \n: <math>S_A = |S_\\mathrm{a}| + |S_\\mathrm{b}| + |S_\\mathrm{c}|</math> \n: <math>\\mathrm{pf}_A = {P_\\mathrm{a} + P_\\mathrm{b} + P_\\mathrm{c} \\over S_A}</math>,\n\nthat is, the arithmetic sum of the phase apparent powers; and \n: <math>S_V = |P_\\mathrm{a} + P_\\mathrm{b} + P_\\mathrm{c} + j(Q_\\mathrm{a} + Q_\\mathrm{b} + Q_\\mathrm{c})|</math>\n: <math>\\mathrm{pf}_V = {P_\\mathrm{a} + P_\\mathrm{b} + P_\\mathrm{c} \\over S_V}</math>,\n\nthat is, the magnitude of total three-phase complex power.\n\nThe 1920 committee found no consensus and the topic continued to dominate discussions.  In 1930, another committee formed and once again failed to resolve the question.  The transcripts of their discussions are the lengthiest and most controversial ever published by the AIEE.<ref name=\"Emanuel_1993\">{{cite journal |last1=Emanuel |first1=Alexander |title=On The Definition of Power Factor and Apparent Power in Unbalanced Polyphase Circuits with Sinusoidal Voltage and Currents |journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery |date=July 1993 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=841\u2013852 |doi=10.1109/61.252612 |ref=Emanuel_1993}}</ref>  Further resolution of this debate did not come until the late 1990s.\n\nA new definition based on [[symmetrical components]] theory was proposed in 1993 by Alexander Emanuel for unbalanced linear load supplied with asymmetrical sinusoidal voltages: \n: <math>S = \\sqrt{ \\left( |V_\\mathrm{a}^2| + |V_\\mathrm{b}^2| + |V_\\mathrm{c}^2| \\right ) \\left ( |I_\\mathrm{a}^2| + |I_\\mathrm{b}^2| + |I_\\mathrm{c}^2| \\right )}</math>\n: <math>\\mathrm{pf} = {P^+ \\over S}</math>,\n\nthat is, the root of squared sums of line voltages multiplied by the root of squared sums of line currents. \n<math>P^+</math> denotes the positive sequence power:\n:<math>P^+ = 3 |V^+| |I^+| cos(arg(V^+) - arg(I^+))</math>\n\n<math>V^+</math> denotes the positive sequence voltage phasor, and \n<math>I^+</math> denotes the positive sequence current phasor.<ref name=\"Emanuel_1993\" />\n\n==Real number formulas==\nA perfect resistor stores no energy; so current and voltage are in phase. Therefore, there is no reactive power and <math>P=S</math>. Therefore, for a perfect resistor\n:<math>P = S = V_\\mathrm{RMS} I_\\mathrm{RMS} = I_\\mathrm{RMS}^2 R = \\frac{V_\\mathrm{RMS}^2} {R}\\,\\!</math>.\n\nFor a perfect capacitor or inductor, there is no net power transfer; so all power is reactive. Therefore, for a perfect capacitor or inductor:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  P &= 0 \\\\\n  Q &= |S| = V_\\mathrm{RMS} I_\\mathrm{RMS} = I_\\mathrm{RMS}^2 |X| = \\frac{V_\\mathrm{RMS}^2}{|X|}\n\\end{align}</math>.\n\nwhere ''X'' is the [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] of the capacitor or inductor.\n\nIf X is defined as being positive for an inductor and negative for a capacitor, then the [[absolute value|modulus]] signs can be removed from S and X and get\n:<math>Q = I_\\mathrm{RMS}^2 X = \\frac{V_\\mathrm{RMS}^2} {X}</math>.\n\nInstantaneous power is defined as:\n:<math>P_\\text{inst}(t) = V(t)\\cdot I(t)</math>,\n\nwhere<math>V(t)</math> and <math>I(t)</math> are the time-varying voltage and current waveforms.\n\nThis definition is useful because it applies to all waveforms, whether they are sinusoidal or not. This is particularly useful in power electronics, where non-sinusoidal waveforms are common.\n\nIn general, engineers are interested in the active power averaged over a period of time, whether it is a low frequency line cycle or a high frequency power converter switching period. The simplest way to get that result is to take the integral of the instantaneous calculation over the desired period:\n:<math>P_\\text{avg} = \\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} V(t)I(t)\\,\\operatorname{d}t</math>.\n\nThis method of calculating the average power gives the active power regardless of [[harmonic content]] of the waveform. In practical applications, this would be done in the digital domain, where the calculation becomes trivial when compared to the use of rms and phase to determine active power:\n:<math> P_\\text{avg} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^n  V[k]I[k] </math>.\n\n==Multiple frequency systems==\nSince an RMS value can be calculated for any waveform, apparent power can be calculated from this. For active power it would at first appear that it would be necessary to calculate many product terms and average all of them. However, looking at one of these product terms in more detail produces a very interesting result.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n       &A\\cos(\\omega_1t+k_1)\\cos(\\omega_2t + k_2) \\\\\n  = {} &\\frac{A}{2}\\cos\\left[\\left(\\omega_1t + k_1\\right) + \\left(\\omega_2t + k_2\\right)\\right] + \\frac{A}{2}\\cos\\left[\\left(\\omega_1t + k_1\\right) - \\left(\\omega_2t + k_2\\right)\\right] \\\\\n  = {} &\\frac{A}{2}\\cos\\left[\\left(\\omega_1 + \\omega_2\\right)t + k_1 + k_2\\right] + \\frac{A}{2}\\cos\\left[\\left(\\omega_1 - \\omega_2\\right)t + k_1 - k_2\\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nHowever, the time average of a function of the form {{nowrap|cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''k'')}} is zero provided that ''\u03c9'' is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if voltage of the mains supply is assumed to be a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic currents]] are a bad thing. They will increase the RMS current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An active [[power factor correction]] circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Energy}}\n* [[War of the currents]]\n* [[Electric power transmission]]\n* [[Transformer]]\n* [[Mains electricity]]\n* [[Deformed power]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.circuit-magic.com/acpower.htm \"AC Power Java Applet\"]\n\n{{Electricity generation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ac Power}}\n[[Category:Electric power]]\n[[Category:AC power| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|power in AC systems|information on utility-supplied AC power|Mains electricity}}\n[[File:City lights in motion.jpg|thumb|250px|The blinking of non-incandescent city lights is shown in this motion-blurred long exposure.

If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' ('generated') by the load.

The result of this is that capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://electricalnotes.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/importance-of-reactive-power-for-system/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512200158/https://electricalnotes.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/importance-of-reactive-power-for-system/ |archivedate=2015-05-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cmplxpower.svg|thumb|280px|'''<u>The Power Triangle</u>'''<br>The complex power is the vector sum of active and reactive power.

For two systems transmitting the same amount of active power, the system with the lower power factor will have higher circulating currents due to energy that returns to the source from energy storage in the load. These higher currents produce higher losses and reduce overall transmission efficiency.  A lower power factor circuit will have a higher apparent power and higher losses for the same amount of active power. The power factor is 1.0 when the voltage and current are in [[Phase (waves)|phase]].  It is zero when the current leads or lags the voltage by 90 degrees. When the voltage and current are 180 degrees out of phase, the power factor is negative one, and the load is feeding energy into the source (an example would be a home with solar cells on the roof that feed power into the power grid when the sun is shining). Power factors are usually stated as \"leading\" or \"lagging\" to show the sign of the phase angle of current with respect to voltage. Voltage is designated as the base to which current angle is compared, meaning that current is thought of as either \"leading\" or \"lagging\" voltage. Where the waveforms are purely sinusoidal, the power factor is the cosine of the phase angle (<math>\\varphi</math>) between the current and voltage sinusoidal waveforms. Equipment data sheets and nameplates will often abbreviate power factor as \"<math>\\cos \\phi</math>\" for this reason.\n\nExample: The active power is {{nowrap|700 W}} and the phase angle between voltage and current is 45.6\u00b0. The power factor is {{nowrap|cos(45.6\u00b0) &#61; 0.700}}. The apparent power is then: {{nowrap|700 W / cos(45.6\u00b0) &#61; 1000 VA}}. The concept of power dissipation in AC circuit is explained and illustrated with the example.</ref>\n\nFor instance, a power factor of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 percent of the total current supplied is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and has to be made up by the utility. Usually, utilities do not charge consumers for the reactive power losses, as they do no real work for the consumer. However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer's load source that cause the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacities.\n\n==Reactive power==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\nIn a direct current circuit, the power flowing to the load is proportional to the product of the current through the load and the potential drop across the load.  Energy flows in one direction from the source to the load. In AC power, the voltage and current both vary approximately sinusoidally. When there is inductance or capacitance in the circuit, the voltage and current waveforms do not line up perfectly. The power flow has two components \u2013 one component flows from source to load and can perform work at the load; the other portion, known as \"reactive power\", is due to the delay between voltage and current, known as phase angle, and cannot do useful work at the load. It can be thought of as current that is arriving at the wrong time (too late or too early). To distinguish reactive power from active power, it is measured in units of \"[[volt-amperes reactive]]\", or var. These units can simplify to Watts but are left as var to denote that they represent no actual work output.\n\nEnergy stored in capacitive or inductive elements of the network gives rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique is known as [[flexible AC transmission system|reactive compensation]] is used to reduce apparent power flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load, a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor and not have to be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice saves energy because it reduces the amount of energy that is required to be produced by the utility to do the same amount of work. Additionally, it allows for more efficient transmission line designs using smaller conductors or fewer bundled conductors and optimizing the design of transmission towers.\n\n=== Capacitive vs. inductive loads ===\nStored energy in the magnetic or electric field of a load device, such as a motor or capacitor, causes an offset between the current and the voltage waveforms.  A capacitor is an AC device that stores energy in the form of an electric field. As current is driven through the capacitor, charge build-up causes an opposing voltage to develop across the capacitor. This voltage increases until some maximum dictated by the capacitor structure. In an AC network, the voltage across a capacitor is constantly changing. The capacitor opposes this change, causing the current to lead the voltage in phase. Capacitors are said to \"source\" reactive power, and thus to cause a leading power factor.\n\nInduction machines are some of the most common types of loads in the electric power system today. These machines use [[inductors]], or large coils of wire to store energy in the form of a magnetic field. When a voltage is initially placed across the coil, the inductor strongly resists this change in a current and magnetic field, which causes a time delay for the current to reach its maximum value. This causes the current to lag behind the voltage in phase. Inductors are said to \"sink\" reactive power, and thus to cause a lagging power factor. [[Induction generator]]s can source or sink reactive power, and provide a measure of control to system operators over reactive power flow and thus voltage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~dolguin/mas961/loads.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025015726/http://web.media.mit.edu/~dolguin/mas961/loads.html |archivedate=2015-10-25 }}</ref> Because these devices have opposite effects on the phase angle between voltage and current, they can be used to \"cancel out\" each other's effects. This usually takes the form of capacitor banks being used to counteract the lagging power factor caused by induction motors.\n\n==Reactive power control==\nTransmission connected generators are generally required to support reactive power flow. For example, on the United Kingdom transmission system, generators are required by the Grid Code Requirements to supply their rated power between the limits of 0.85 power factor lagging and 0.90 power factor leading at the designated terminals. The system operator will perform switching actions to maintain a secure and economical voltage profile while maintaining a reactive power balance equation:\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{Generator\\ MVARs + System\\ gain + Shunt\\ capacitors = MVAR\\ Demand + Reactive\\ losses + Shunt\\ reactors}</math>\n\nThe \u2018[[Ferranti effect|system gain]]\u2019 is an important source of reactive power in the above power balance equation, which is generated by the capacitative nature of the transmission network itself. By making decisive switching actions in the early morning before the demand increases, the system gain can be maximized early on, helping to secure the system for the whole day. To balance the equation some pre-fault reactive generator use will be required. Other sources of reactive power that will also be used include shunt capacitors, shunt reactors, [[static VAR compensator]]s and voltage control circuits.\n\n==Unbalanced polyphase systems==\nWhile active power and reactive power are well defined in any system, the definition of apparent power for unbalanced polyphase systems is considered to be one of the most controversial topics in power engineering.  Originally, apparent power arose merely as a figure of merit.  Major delineations of the concept are attributed to [[William Stanley, Jr.|Stanley]]'s ''Phenomena of Retardation in the Induction Coil'' (1888) and [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz|Steinmetz]]'s ''Theoretical Elements of Engineering'' (1915).  However, with the development of [[three phase]] power distribution, it became clear that the definition of apparent power and the power factor could not be applied to unbalanced [[polyphase systems]].  In 1920, a \"Special Joint Committee of the AIEE and the National Electric Light Association\" met to resolve the issue.  They considered two definitions. \n: <math>S_A = |S_\\mathrm{a}| + |S_\\mathrm{b}| + |S_\\mathrm{c}|</math> \n: <math>\\mathrm{pf}_A = {P_\\mathrm{a} + P_\\mathrm{b} + P_\\mathrm{c} \\over S_A}</math>,\n\nthat is, the arithmetic sum of the phase apparent powers; and \n: <math>S_V = |P_\\mathrm{a} + P_\\mathrm{b} + P_\\mathrm{c} + j(Q_\\mathrm{a} + Q_\\mathrm{b} + Q_\\mathrm{c})|</math>\n: <math>\\mathrm{pf}_V = {P_\\mathrm{a} + P_\\mathrm{b} + P_\\mathrm{c} \\over S_V}</math>,\n\nthat is, the magnitude of total three-phase complex power.\n\nThe 1920 committee found no consensus and the topic continued to dominate discussions.  In 1930, another committee formed and once again failed to resolve the question.  The transcripts of their discussions are the lengthiest and most controversial ever published by the AIEE.<ref name=\"Emanuel_1993\">{{cite journal |last1=Emanuel |first1=Alexander |title=On The Definition of Power Factor and Apparent Power in Unbalanced Polyphase Circuits with Sinusoidal Voltage and Currents |journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery |date=July 1993 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=841\u2013852 |doi=10.1109/61.252612 |ref=Emanuel_1993}}</ref>  Further resolution of this debate did not come until the late 1990s.\n\nA new definition based on [[symmetrical components]] theory was proposed in 1993 by Alexander Emanuel for unbalanced linear load supplied with asymmetrical sinusoidal voltages: \n: <math>S = \\sqrt{ \\left( |V_\\mathrm{a}^2| + |V_\\mathrm{b}^2| + |V_\\mathrm{c}^2| \\right ) \\left ( |I_\\mathrm{a}^2| + |I_\\mathrm{b}^2| + |I_\\mathrm{c}^2| \\right )}</math>\n: <math>\\mathrm{pf} = {P^+ \\over S}</math>,\n\nthat is, the root of squared sums of line voltages multiplied by the root of squared sums of line currents. \n<math>P^+</math> denotes the positive sequence power:\n:<math>P^+ = 3 |V^+| |I^+| cos(arg(V^+) - arg(I^+))</math>\n\n<math>V^+</math> denotes the positive sequence voltage phasor, and \n<math>I^+</math> denotes the positive sequence current phasor.<ref name=\"Emanuel_1993\" />\n\n==Real number formulas==\nA perfect resistor stores no energy; so current and voltage are in phase. Therefore, there is no reactive power and <math>P=S</math>. Therefore, for a perfect resistor\n:<math>P = S = V_\\mathrm{RMS} I_\\mathrm{RMS} = I_\\mathrm{RMS}^2 R = \\frac{V_\\mathrm{RMS}^2} {R}\\,\\!</math>.\n\nFor a perfect capacitor or inductor, there is no net power transfer; so all power is reactive. Therefore, for a perfect capacitor or inductor:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  P &= 0 \\\\\n  Q &= |S| = V_\\mathrm{RMS} I_\\mathrm{RMS} = I_\\mathrm{RMS}^2 |X| = \\frac{V_\\mathrm{RMS}^2}{|X|}\n\\end{align}</math>.\n\nwhere ''X'' is the [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] of the capacitor or inductor.\n\nIf X is defined as being positive for an inductor and negative for a capacitor, then the [[absolute value|modulus]] signs can be removed from S and X and get\n:<math>Q = I_\\mathrm{RMS}^2 X = \\frac{V_\\mathrm{RMS}^2} {X}</math>.\n\nInstantaneous power is defined as:\n:<math>P_\\text{inst}(t) = V(t)\\cdot I(t)</math>,\n\nwhere<math>V(t)</math> and <math>I(t)</math> are the time-varying voltage and current waveforms.\n\nThis definition is useful because it applies to all waveforms, whether they are sinusoidal or not. This is particularly useful in power electronics, where non-sinusoidal waveforms are common.\n\nIn general, engineers are interested in the active power averaged over a period of time, whether it is a low frequency line cycle or a high frequency power converter switching period. The simplest way to get that result is to take the integral of the instantaneous calculation over the desired period:\n:<math>P_\\text{avg} = \\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} V(t)I(t)\\,\\operatorname{d}t</math>.\n\nThis method of calculating the average power gives the active power regardless of [[harmonic content]] of the waveform. In practical applications, this would be done in the digital domain, where the calculation becomes trivial when compared to the use of rms and phase to determine active power:\n:<math> P_\\text{avg} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=1}^n  V[k]I[k] </math>.\n\n==Multiple frequency systems==\nSince an RMS value can be calculated for any waveform, apparent power can be calculated from this. For active power it would at first appear that it would be necessary to calculate many product terms and average all of them. However, looking at one of these product terms in more detail produces a very interesting result.\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n       &A\\cos(\\omega_1t+k_1)\\cos(\\omega_2t + k_2) \\\\\n  = {} &\\frac{A}{2}\\cos\\left[\\left(\\omega_1t + k_1\\right) + \\left(\\omega_2t + k_2\\right)\\right] + \\frac{A}{2}\\cos\\left[\\left(\\omega_1t + k_1\\right) - \\left(\\omega_2t + k_2\\right)\\right] \\\\\n  = {} &\\frac{A}{2}\\cos\\left[\\left(\\omega_1 + \\omega_2\\right)t + k_1 + k_2\\right] + \\frac{A}{2}\\cos\\left[\\left(\\omega_1 - \\omega_2\\right)t + k_1 - k_2\\right]\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nHowever, the time average of a function of the form {{nowrap|cos(''\u03c9t'' + ''k'')}} is zero provided that ''\u03c9'' is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if voltage of the mains supply is assumed to be a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that [[Harmonics (electrical power)|harmonic currents]] are a bad thing. They will increase the RMS current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the active power transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An active [[power factor correction]] circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Energy}}\n* [[War of the currents]]\n* [[Electric power transmission]]\n* [[Transformer]]\n* [[Mains electricity]]\n* [[Deformed power]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.circuit-magic.com/acpower.htm \"AC Power Java Applet\"]\n\n{{Electricity generation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ac Power}}\n[[Category:Electric power]]\n[[Category:AC power| ]]\n", "name_user": "104.218.126.195", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCapacitive vs. inductive loads)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power"}

It chronicles her guitar playing at a very young age, the ambience of her musician father's haunts, and the rural settings of southern Chile in the [[\u00d1uble Province]].\n \nThe film follows Parra in her project of studying Chilean folk music in order to preserve and carry forward in an original way traditional composition styles to form the genre now known as [[Nueva Canci\u00f3n Chilena]] (English: New Chilean music).  It shows her seeking out old musicians and asking them to sing or strum the songs they knew.\n \nIt covers her invitations abroad to Warsaw, Poland and Paris, France.  During this trip Parra also travelled through the Soviet Union and parts of Europe. The movie also portrays the events in Chile leading up to the tragic death of her baby daughter Rosita during her absence.\n \nThe film covers her tumultuous relationship with Swiss flautist, [[Gilbert Favre]] whom she met when he accompanied an anthropologist specializing in Chilean folklore to Chile. It follows the diversification of her artistic output, including her oil painting, and mixed media tapestry called arpilleras or [[Hessian (cloth)]]. The film follows Parra and Favre's stay in Geneva and Paris, portraying her visit to [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]], which resulted in the honor of being the first Latin American woman to have a solo exhibition there.\n \nUpon their return to South America, Favre and Parra broke up, provoked by his desire to live in Bolivia where he was part of a successful Bolivian music act, [[Los Jairas]].  Parra's energy was invested in reviving a unique version of a [[Pe\u00f1a (music)|Pe\u00f1a]], a community center for the arts and political activism. Parra's Pe\u00f1a was a tent (somewhat similar looking to a circus tent) that she set up on a 30 x 30 meter piece of land in the Parque La Quintrala, in today's [[La Reina]] municipality of Santiago, in the area once known as la Ca\u00f1ada.  Her tent hosted musical spectacles and she and her children also lived on the same land. The movie chronicles her dealings with the mayor of the area at the time, Fernando Castillo Velasco, who helped her establish the site. Favre returns with his group, but declines to stay, although a once proud Parra humbly begs him to, because in the meantime he had established a life and married in Bolivia.\n \nThe film depicts the alternating atmosphere of the tent, at times, lively with artists during the day, and music and political activism at night.  Parra was the hostess, cooking beans over an open fire to share, and participating with the other artists.  At other times, however, the tent was desolate, or it was too rainy and cold to be hospitable, and Parra suffered from poverty and loneliness.\n \nThe film concludes with Parra's suicide, on 5 February 1967.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Francisca Gavil\u00e1n]] as [[Violeta Parra]]\n* [[Gabriela Aguilera]] as Hilda Parra\n* [[Daniel Antivilo]] as Sr. Mayer\n* [[Stephania Barbagelata]] as Carmen Luisa\n* [[Eduardo Burl\u00e9]]\n* [[Pablo Costabal]]\n* Juan Quezada as Don Guillermo\n* Sergio Pi\u00f1a as Mario\n* Cristi\u00e1n Quevedo as [[Nicanor Parra]]\n* Francisco Acu\u00f1a as the young Nicanor Parra\n* [[Thomas Durand]] as [[Gilbert Favre]]\n* [[Roberto Far\u00edas]] as Luis Arce\n* [[Vanesa Gonz\u00e1lez]] as Blonde Model\n* [[Luis Mach\u00edn]] as Interviewer\n\n==Production==\nSome parts of the film were shot in Argentina.

It chronicles her guitar playing at a very young age, the ambience of her musician father's haunts, and the rural settings of southern Chile in the [[\u00d1uble Province]].\n \nThe film follows Parra in her project of studying Chilean folk music in order to preserve and carry forward in an original way traditional composition styles to form the genre now known as [[Nueva Canci\u00f3n Chilena]] (English: New Chilean music).  It shows her seeking out old musicians and asking them to sing or strum the songs they knew.\n \nIt covers her invitations abroad to Warsaw, Poland and Paris, France.  During this trip Parra also travelled through the Soviet Union and parts of Europe. The movie also portrays the events in Chile leading up to the tragic death of her baby daughter Rosita during her absence.\n \nThe film covers her tumultuous relationship with Swiss flautist, [[Gilbert Favre]] whom she met when he accompanied an anthropologist specializing in Chilean folklore to Chile. It follows the diversification of her artistic output, including her oil painting, and mixed media tapestry called arpilleras or [[Hessian (cloth)]]. The film follows Parra and Favre's stay in Geneva and Paris, portraying her visit to [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]], which resulted in the honor of being the first Latin American woman to have a solo exhibition there.\n \nUpon their return to South America, Favre and Parra broke up, provoked by his desire to live in Bolivia where he was part of a successful Bolivian music act, [[Los Jairas]].  Parra's energy was invested in reviving a unique version of a [[Pe\u00f1a (music)|Pe\u00f1a]], a community center for the arts and political activism. Parra's Pe\u00f1a was a tent (somewhat similar looking to a circus tent) that she set up on a 30 x 30 meter piece of land in the Parque La Quintrala, in today's [[La Reina]] municipality of Santiago, in the area once known as la Ca\u00f1ada.  Her tent hosted musical spectacles and she and her children also lived on the same land. The movie chronicles her dealings with the mayor of the area at the time, Fernando Castillo Velasco, who helped her establish the site. Favre returns with his group, but declines to stay, although a once proud Parra humbly begs him to, because in the meantime he had established a life and married in Bolivia.\n \nThe film depicts the alternating atmosphere of the tent, at times, lively with artists during the day, and music and political activism at night.  Parra was the hostess, cooking beans over an open fire to share, and participating with the other artists.  At other times, however, the tent was desolate, or it was too rainy and cold to be hospitable, and Parra suffered from poverty and loneliness.\n \nThe film concludes with Parra's suicide, on 5 February 1967.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Francisca Gavil\u00e1n]] as [[Violeta Parra]]\n* [[Gabriela Aguilera]] as Hilda Parra\n* [[Daniel Antivilo]] as Sr. Mayer\n* [[Stephania Barbagelata]] as Carmen Luisa\n* [[Eduardo Burl\u00e9]]\n* [[Pablo Costabal]]\n* Juan Quezada as Don Guillermo\n* Sergio Pi\u00f1a as Mario\n* Cristi\u00e1n Quevedo as [[Nicanor Parra]]\n* Francisco Acu\u00f1a as the young Nicanor Parra\n* [[Thomas Durand]] as [[Gilbert Favre]]\n* [[Roberto Far\u00edas]] as Luis Arce\n* [[Vanesa Gonz\u00e1lez]] as Blonde Model\n* [[Luis Mach\u00edn]] as Interviewer\n\n==Production==\nSome parts of the film were shot in Argentina.

The film follows a professional hitman named Jef Costello who is seen by witnesses and his efforts to provide himself an alibi that drive him further into a corner. The film stars [[Alain Delon]], [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier|Francois Perier]], [[Nathalie Delon]] and [[Cathy Rosier]]. \n\nThe film was released on 25 October 1967, receiving positive reviews with praise for Melville's screenwriting and direction, and Delon's performance and atmosphere. The film grossed over $1.2 million in France and over $0.75m across Spain.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficestory.com/le-samourai-alain-delon-box-office-1967-a125233144|title=LE SAMOURAI - ALAIN DELON BOX OFFICE 1967|website=BOX OFFICE STORY|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Hitman]] Jef Costello (Delon) lives in a single-room Paris apartment whose spartan furnishings include a little bird in a cage. A long opening shot shows him lying on his bed, smoking, when the following (invented) quotation appears on-screen:\n\n{{quote|There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle... Perhaps...|Bushido (Book of the Samurai)}}\n\nCostello's methodical [[modus operandi]] includes airtight [[alibi]]s involving his lover, Jane ([[Nathalie Delon]]). Having carried out a murder contract on a nightclub owner, he is seen leaving the scene by several witnesses, including piano player Val\u00e9rie ([[Cathy Rosier]]). Their statements are inconsistent but the investigating officer ([[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]]) believes Costello is his man based on the witnesses who viewed Costello and his alibi that he was with Jane the whole time.\n\nCostello loses a police tail and gets to a meeting point on a subway overpass to get paid by his employers. There he is shot and wounded by a man sent by his employers. Having bandaged his wound and rested, he returns to the nightclub and goes for a car drive with the piano player. He is grateful to her, but does not understand why she protected him from the police when she was the key witness to the murder. In the meantime, police officers [[electronic surveillance|bug]] his room, which agitates the bird in its cage. Upon returning, Costello notices some loose feathers scattered around the cage and the bird acting strangely. Suspecting an intrusion, he searches his room, finds the bug and deactivates it.\n\nIn the meantime, the police ransack Jane's apartment and offer her a deal: withdraw her alibi for Costello and they will leave her alone. Jane rejects the offer and shows them the door. Back in his apartment Costello finds himself held at gunpoint by the overpass shooter, who gives him money and offers him a new contract. The intended target is not revealed to the audience. Costello overpowers him and forces him to disclose the identity of his boss, Olivier Rey (Jean-Pierre Posier).\n\nFollowing a chase scene in the [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] by several disguised cops and a goodbye visit to Jane, he drives to Rey's home, which turns out to be the house where the piano player lives. Costello kills Rey and drives to the nightclub. This time he makes no attempt to conceal his presence. He even checks his hat but leaves his hat-check ticket on the counter. Having put on his white gloves in full view of everyone, he walks over to the stage where Val\u00e9rie advises him to leave. When he pulls out his gun and points it at her, she quietly asks \"Why, Jef?\" and he replies, \"I was paid to.\" After a moment of tension, the audience hears gunshots, but they are not from his gun. Costello falls to the ground and dies. A junior police officer tells Val\u00e9rie she is lucky the police were there because otherwise Costello would have killed her. But when his boss picks up Costello\u2019s gun, it is revealed that he had removed all the bullets before entering the club.\n\n==Alternative ending==\nIn an interview with Rui Nogueira, Melville indicated that he had shot an alternate version of Costello's death scene. In the alternative ending, which was the original version, Costello meets his death with a picture-perfect grin \u00e0 la Delon. The scene was changed to its current form when Melville angrily discovered that Delon had already used a smiling death scene in another of his films. Still images of the smiling death exist.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alain Delon]] as Jef Costello\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as the Superintendent\n* [[Nathalie Delon]] as Jane Lagrange\n* [[Caty Rosier]] as Val\u00e9rie, the pianist\n* Jacques Leroy as the man in the passageway\n* [[Michel Boisrond]] as Wiener\n* [[Robert Favart]] as the bartender\n* Jean-Pierre Posier as Olivier Rey\n* [[Catherine Jourdan]] as the hatcheck girl\n* Roger Fradet, Carlo Nell and Robert Rondo as police inspectors.\n==Production==\nMeville wrote the film specifically for Delon.<ref>A Samurai in Paris\nNogueira, Rui; TRUCHAUD, FRANCOIS.

The film follows a professional hitman named Jef Costello who is seen by witnesses and his efforts to provide himself an alibi that drive him further into a corner. The film stars [[Alain Delon]], [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier|Francois Perier]], [[Nathalie Delon]] and [[Cathy Rosier]]. \n\nThe film was released on 25 October 1967, receiving positive reviews with praise for Melville's screenwriting and direction, and Delon's performance and atmosphere.

A long opening shot shows him lying on his bed, smoking, when the following (invented) quotation appears on-screen:\n\n{{quote|There is no greater solitude than that of the samurai unless it is that of the tiger in the jungle... Perhaps...|Bushido (Book of the Samurai)}}\n\nCostello's methodical [[modus operandi]] includes airtight [[alibi]]s involving his lover, Jane ([[Nathalie Delon]]). Having carried out a murder contract on a nightclub owner, he is seen leaving the scene by several witnesses, including piano player Val\u00e9rie ([[Cathy Rosier]]). Their statements are inconsistent but the investigating officer ([[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]]) believes Costello is his man based on the witnesses who viewed Costello and his alibi that he was with Jane the whole time.\n\nCostello loses a police tail and gets to a meeting point on a subway overpass to get paid by his employers. There he is shot and wounded by a man sent by his employers. Having bandaged his wound and rested, he returns to the nightclub and goes for a car drive with the piano player. He is grateful to her, but does not understand why she protected him from the police when she was the key witness to the murder. In the meantime, police officers [[electronic surveillance|bug]] his room, which agitates the bird in its cage. Upon returning, Costello notices some loose feathers scattered around the cage and the bird acting strangely. Suspecting an intrusion, he searches his room, finds the bug and deactivates it.\n\nIn the meantime, the police ransack Jane's apartment and offer her a deal: withdraw her alibi for Costello and they will leave her alone. Jane rejects the offer and shows them the door. Back in his apartment Costello finds himself held at gunpoint by the overpass shooter, who gives him money and offers him a new contract (the intended target is not revealed to the audience). Costello overpowers him and forces him to disclose the identity of his boss, Olivier Rey (Jean-Pierre Posier).\n\nFollowing a chase scene in the [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] by several disguised cops and a goodbye visit to Jane, he drives to Rey's home, which turns out to be the house where the piano player lives. Costello kills Rey and drives to the nightclub. This time he makes no attempt to conceal his presence. He even checks his hat but leaves his hat-check ticket on the counter. Having put on his white gloves in full view of everyone, he walks over to the stage where Val\u00e9rie advises him to leave. When he pulls out his gun and points it at her, she quietly asks \"Why, Jef?\" and he replies, \"I was paid to.\" After a moment of tension, the audience hears gunshots, but they are not from his gun. Costello falls to the ground and dies. A junior police officer tells Val\u00e9rie she is lucky the police were there because otherwise Costello would have killed her. But when his boss picks up Costello\u2019s gun, it is revealed that he had removed all the bullets before entering the club.\n\n==Alternative ending==\nIn an interview with Rui Nogueira, Melville indicated that he had shot an alternate version of Costello's death scene. In the alternative ending, which was the original version, Costello meets his death with a picture-perfect grin \u00e0 la Delon. The scene was changed to its current form when Melville angrily discovered that Delon had already used a smiling death scene in another of his films. Still images of the smiling death exist.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alain Delon]] as Jef Costello\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as the Superintendent\n* [[Nathalie Delon]] as Jane Lagrange\n* [[Caty Rosier]] as Val\u00e9rie, the pianist\n* Jacques Leroy as the man in the passageway\n* [[Michel Boisrond]] as Wiener\n* [[Robert Favart]] as the bartender\n* Jean-Pierre Posier as Olivier Rey\n* [[Catherine Jourdan]] as the hatcheck girl\n* Roger Fradet, Carlo Nell and Robert Rondo as police inspectors.\n==Production==\nMeville wrote the film specifically for Delon.<ref>A Samurai in Paris\nNogueira, Rui; TRUCHAUD, FRANCOIS.
