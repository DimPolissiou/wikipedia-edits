In response to this event the first male [[suffrage in Australia]] was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of [[democracy in Australia]]. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]], has become a national symbol and is held at the [[Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka]] in Ballarat.\n\nProclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century, after which its importance relative to both [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and its largest city, as well as a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays. After a narrow popular vote the city merged with the town of [[Ballarat East]] in 1921, ending a long-standing rivalry.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Location==\nWhile officially a part of the Central Highlands of Victoria, Ballarat is part of the Midlands geological region.

The party scaled [[Mount Buninyong]]; among them were Somerville's brother [[Thomas Livingstone Learmonth]], William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson, all three of whom later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.\n\nThe Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille, arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|ha|adj=on}} sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut at Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area \"Ballaarat\". Some claim the name is derived from a local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word for the area, ''balla arat''. The meaning of this word is not certain; however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean \"resting place\". In some dialects, ''balla'' means \"bent elbow\", which is translated to mean reclining or resting and ''arat'' meaning \"place\".<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Ballarat: community profile|url=http://profile.id.com.au/ballarat/about|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> Another claim is that the name derives from Yuille's native Gaelic Baile Ararat (Town of Ararat), alluding to the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The present spelling was officially adopted by the City of Ballarat in 1996.\n\n=== 1850s: Gold rush ===\n[[File:Ballarat 1853-54 von guerard.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Eugene von Guerard]] of Ballarat's tent city in the summer of 1853\u201354]]\n\nThe first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by [[Thomas Hiscock]] on 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south.<ref>Griffiths Peter M, \"Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1737\u20131901\", Ballarat Historical Society pp13</ref> The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851 John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces.<ref name=\"The Courier 1851-11-05\">{{cite news |title = Victoria |date = 5 November 1851 |work = The Courier |page = 2}}</ref> Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings.

In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar-supported verandahs in the CBD, which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.<ref>City of Ballarat Mayors Report 1974 \u2013 1975</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre. The Ballarat West Growth Area Plan was approved by the city and state government in 2010, planning an extensive fringe development consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents including new activity centres and employment zones.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan|accessdate=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723152436/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |accessdate=18 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818045405/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |archivedate=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n====Catholic Church Sexual Abuse====\n{{see also|Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat}}\nThe [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse#Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat|Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] final report published on 15 December 2017 found that 139 people made a claim of child sexual abuse to the Diocese of Ballarat between 1980 and 2015 and that there was 21 alleged perpetrators identified in claims.

Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.\n\nGeologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip, which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location \u2013 http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.\n\nThere are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex. Almost all of the other numerous bodies of water have been created artificially and include several reservoirs, the largest being the White Swan Reservoir and smaller suburban lakes such as Lake Esmond.\n\nThe contiguous urban area of Ballarat covers approximately {{convert|90|km2|0|abbr=on}} of the local government area's {{convert|740|km2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Land Use\">{{cite web |url = http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |title = Ballarat Planning Scheme \u2013 Land Use |accessdate = 14 May 2012 |date = 18 March 2010 |work = City of Ballarat |publisher = City of Ballarat |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420101928/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |archive-date = 20 April 2012 |url-status = dead |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Approximately 90% of the urban area's land use is residential and suburban.<ref name=\"Land Use\"/> From the city centre this area extends approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} north to the hills around Invermay, approximately {{convert|7.5|km|1|abbr=on}} east to Leigh Creek in the foothills of Mount Warrenheip, approximately {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} west along the plains to Lucas and approximately {{convert|8.5|km|1|abbr=on}} south along the Yarrowee River and Canadian Creek valley to the fringe of Buninyong.<ref name=\"HIS 2011-10\"/> The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee River and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs.

In response to this event the first male [[suffrage in Australia]] was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of [[democracy in Australia]]. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]], has become a national symbol and is held at the [[Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka]] in Ballarat.\n\nProclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century, after which its importance relative to both [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and its largest city, as well as a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays. After a narrow popular vote the city merged with the town of [[Ballarat East]] in 1921, ending a long-standing rivalry.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Location==\nWhile officially a part of the Central Highlands of Victoria, Ballarat is part of the Midlands geological region.

The party scaled [[Mount Buninyong]]; among them were Somerville's brother [[Thomas Livingstone Learmonth]], William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson, all three of whom later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.\n\nThe Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille, arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|ha|adj=on}} sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut at Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area \"Ballaarat\". Some claim the name is derived from a local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word for the area, ''balla arat''. The meaning of this word is not certain; however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean \"resting place\". In some dialects, ''balla'' means \"bent elbow\", which is translated to mean reclining or resting and ''arat'' meaning \"place\".<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Ballarat: community profile|url=http://profile.id.com.au/ballarat/about|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> Another claim is that the name derives from Yuille's native Gaelic Baile Ararat (Town of Ararat), alluding to the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The present spelling was officially adopted by the City of Ballarat in 1996.\n\n=== 1850s: Gold rush ===\n[[File:Ballarat 1853-54 von guerard.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Eugene von Guerard]] of Ballarat's tent city in the summer of 1853\u201354]]\n\nThe first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by [[Thomas Hiscock]] on 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south.<ref>Griffiths Peter M, \"Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1737\u20131901\", Ballarat Historical Society pp13</ref> The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851 John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces.<ref name=\"The Courier 1851-11-05\">{{cite news |title = Victoria |date = 5 November 1851 |work = The Courier |page = 2}}</ref> Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings.

The interwar period proved a period of recovery for Ballarat with a number of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system. In 1930, [[Ballarat Airport]] was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city.<ref>Geelong Ousts Ballarat.

In response to an acute housing shortage, significant suburban expansion occurred. An extensive [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] estate was built on the former Ballarat Common (today known as [[Wendouree West, Victoria|Wendouree West]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Wendouree West Profile and History|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|work=Wendouree West Community Renewal|accessdate=19 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709075704/http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|archivedate=9 July 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses.

In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar-supported verandahs in the CBD, which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.<ref>City of Ballarat Mayors Report 1974 \u2013 1975</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century.

Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.\n\nGeologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip, which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location \u2013 http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.\n\nThere are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex.

Some stations play only \"hot AC\", \"soft AC\", or only one of the variety of subgenres. Therefore, it is not usually considered a specific [[genre]] of [[music]]; it is merely an assemblage of selected tracks from [[musician]]s of many different genres.\n\n==History==\n\n===1960s: Early roots; easy listening and soft rock===\n[[File:Johnny Mathis 1960.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Johnny Mathis]] concentrated on romantic readings of jazz and pop standards for the adult contemporary audience of the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-mathis-mn0000246885|title=Johnny Mathis - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=September 30, 1935|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nAdult contemporary traces its roots to the 1960s [[easy listening]] format, which adopted a 70\u201480% instrumental to 20\u201330% vocal mix. A few offered 90% instrumentals, and a handful were entirely instrumental. The easy listening format, as it was first known, was born of a desire by some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to continue playing current hit songs but distinguish themselves from being branded as \"[[rock and roll]]\" stations. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' first published the Easy Listening chart July 17, 1961, with 20 songs; the first number one was \"[[Boll Weevil Song]]\" by [[Brook Benton]]. The chart described itself as \"not too far out in either direction\".<ref name=Trust>Trust, Gary (July 23, 2011). \"Vanilla Is Licking the Competition\". ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Vol. 123, Issue 25.</ref>\n\nInitially, the vocalists consisted of artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Doris Day]], [[Johnny Mathis]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Perry Como]], and others. The custom recordings were usually instrumental versions of current or recent [[rock and roll]] or [[pop music|pop]] hit songs, a move intended to give the stations more mass appeal without [[selling out]]. Some stations would also occasionally play earlier [[big band]]-era recordings from the 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Project MUSE - Lounge Caravan: A Selective Discography |journal=Notes |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1060\u20131083 |doi=10.1353/not.2005.0059 |date=February 23, 2005 |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Melissa Ursula Dawn }}</ref>\n\nAfter 1965, differences between the [[Hot 100]] chart and the Easy Listening chart became more pronounced. Better reflecting what middle of the road stations were actually playing, the composition of the chart changed dramatically. As rock music continued to harden, there was much less crossover between the Hot 100 and Easy Listening chart than there had been in the early half of the 1960s. [[Roger Miller]], [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Bobby Vinton]] were among the chart's most popular performers.<ref name=Trust/>\n\nOne big impetus for the development of the AC radio format was that, when rock and roll music first became popular in the mid-1950s, many more conservative radio stations wanted to continue to play current hit songs while shying away from rock. These [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] (or \"MOR\") stations also frequently included older, pre-rock-era [[adult standards]] and [[big band]] titles to further appeal to adult listeners who had grown up with those songs.\n\nAnother big impetus for the evolution of the AC radio format was the popularity of easy listening or \"[[beautiful music]]\" stations, stations with music specifically designed to be purely [[background music|ambient]]. Whereas most easy listening music was instrumental, created by relatively unknown artists, and rarely purchased (especially as singles, although [[Jackie Gleason]]'s beautiful music albums sold well in the 1950s), AC was an attempt to create a similar \"lite\" format by choosing certain tracks (both hit singles and album cuts) of popular artists.\n\n[[File:Barry Manilow 1979.jpg|right|Manilow in 1979|thumb|180px|In terms of record sales and career longevity, [[Barry Manilow]] is one of the most successful adult contemporary singers ever and the most best-selling of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/barry-manilow-mn0000018977|title=Barry Manilow - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=June 17, 1943|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> ]]\n\n===1970s: Soft rock forms as a radio format===\n{{See also|Soft rock|List of soft rock artists and songs}}\nLate 1960s [[hard rock]] had been established as one of rock genres.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/60smusic.html | title=1960s Music History including Sixties Styles, Bands and Artists}}</ref> From the end of the 1960s, hard rock and soft rock became popular in rock scene,<ref name=\"autogenerated687\"/> with both emerging as major radio formats in the USA.<ref>M.

This evolved into specialized radio stations that played specific genres of music, and generally followed the evolution of artists in those genres.\n\nBy the early 1970s, softer songs by [[The Carpenters]], [[Anne Murray]], [[John Denver]], [[Barry Manilow]], and even Streisand, began to be played more often on \"Top 40\" radio and others were added to the mix on many AC stations. Also, some of these stations even played softer songs by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Elton John]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Billy Joel]], and other rock-based artists.\n\nMuch of the music recorded by [[singer-songwriter]]s such as [[Diana Ross]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Carole King]] and [[Janis Ian]] got as much, if not more, airplay on this format than on Top 40 stations. Easy Listening radio also began including songs by artists who had begun in other genres, such as rock and roll or [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]. In addition, several early disco songs, did well on the Adult Contemporary format.\n\n===1980s: Adult contemporary succeeds as radio format===\n[[File:George Michael.jpeg|right|thumb|180px|\"[[Careless Whisper]]\" stayed at the #1 spot in the adult contemporary chart for 5 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=wham!|chart=all}}|title=Careless Whisper - Wham!|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> The song was [[George Michael]]'s first solo single.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-michael-mn0000545074|title=George Michael - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=June 25, 1963|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nOn April 7, 1979, the Easy Listening chart officially became known as Adult Contemporary,<ref name=Trust/> and those two words have remained consistent in the name of the chart ever since. Adult contemporary music became one of the most popular [[radio format]]s of the 1980s. The growth of AC was a natural result of the [[generation]] that first listened to the more \"specialized\" music of the mid-late 1970s growing older and not being interested in the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hip hop music|rap/hip-hop]] music that a new generation helped to play a significant role in the [[Top 40 chart]]s by the end of the decade.\n\nMainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional AC artists such as [[Barbra Streisand]], the [[The Carpenters|Carpenters]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[John Denver]], and [[Olivia Newton-John]] found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the [[Contemporary Hit Radio]] format, such as [[Richard Marx]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[George Michael]], [[Phil Collins]], and [[Laura Branigan]] began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency. Collins has been described by [[AllMusic]] as \"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/phil-collins-mn0000337119/biography| title= Phil Collins Biography | work=AllMusic | first=William | last=Ruhlmann | accessdate=April 21, 2014}}</ref> However, with the combination of MTV and AC radio, adult contemporary appeared harder to define as a genre, with established soft-rock artists of the past still charting pop hits and receiving airplay alongside mainstream radio fare from newer artists at the time.\n\nThe amount of crossover between the AC chart and the Hot 100 has varied based on how much the passing pop music trends of the times appealed to adult listeners. Not many [[disco]] or [[New wave music|new wave]] songs were particularly successful on the AC chart during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and much of the hip-hop and harder rock music featured on [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] formats later in the decade would have been unacceptable on AC radio.\n\nAlthough dance-oriented, electronic pop and ballad-oriented rock dominated the 1980s, soft rock songs still enjoyed a mild success thanks to [[Sheena Easton]], [[Amy Grant]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amy-grant-mn0000024944|title=Amy Grant - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> [[Lionel Richie]], [[Christopher Cross]], [[Dan Hill]], [[Leo Sayer]], [[Billy Ocean]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-ocean-mn0000089058|title=Billy Ocean - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=January 21, 1950|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Bertie Higgins]], and [[Tommy Page]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fawthrop|first=Peter|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tommy-page-mn0000624184|title=Tommy Page - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=May 24, 1970|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> No song spent more than six weeks at #1 on this chart during the 1980s, with nine songs accomplishing that feat.

The album was certified Triple Platinum in the United States alone and became a major success throughout the globe. The [[Grammy Award]]-winning singles, \"[[Don't Know Much]]\" and \"[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]\", were both long-running #1 Adult Contemporary hits. Several additional singles from the disc made the AC Top 10 as well. The album won over many critics in the need to define AC, and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day to day radio play.\n\n===1990s: Subgenre formations/radio crossovers===\n[[File:Marc Anthony 2009 White House.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Latin artist [[Marc Anthony]]'s self-titled English-language album released in 1999 had singles that crossed over to the AC charts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Craig|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marc-anthony-mn0000673486|title=Marc Anthony - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nThe early 1990s marked the softening of urban R&B in the shape of new jack swing, at the same time alternative rock emerged and traditional pop saw a significant resurgence. This in part led to a widening of the market, not only allowing to cater to more niche markets, but it also became customary for artists to make AC-friendly singles. At the same time, the genre began adopting elements from hard rock as tastes were shifting towards louder music, while AC stations in general began playing more rock acts. \"Softer\" features such as light instrumental music (carried over from the [[beautiful music]] format\u2014many AC stations carried the format until the early 1970s), new age songs and most pre-1964 artists were gradually phased out from AC radio throughout the early-mid 1990s.\n\nUnlike the majority of 1980s mainstream singers, the 1990s mainstream pop/R&B singers such as [[All-4-One]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=all-4-one|chart=all}}|title=All-4-One Album & Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> [[Boyz II Men]], [[Christina Aguilera]],<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mariah carey|chart=all}}|title=Mariah Carey Music News & Info|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Savage Garden]]<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> generally crossed over to the AC charts.

Newer female singer-songwriters such as [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Melissa Etheridge]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] also broke through on the AC chart during this time.<ref name=\"Hyatt\">Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits''.  New York City:  [[Billboard Books]].  {{ISBN|978-0-823-07693-2}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, ''Billboard'' created a new chart called [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks|Adult Top 40]], which reflects programming on radio stations that exists somewhere between \"adult contemporary\" music and \"pop\" music. Although they are sometimes mistaken for each other, the Adult Contemporary chart and the Adult Top 40 chart are separate charts, and songs reaching one chart might not reach the other. In addition, [[Hot adult contemporary|hot AC]] is another subgenre of radio programming that is distinct from the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart as it exists today, despite the apparent similarity in name.\n\nIn response to the pressure on Hot AC, a new kind of AC format cropped up among American radio recently. The ''[[urban adult contemporary]]'' format (a term coined by [[Barry Mayo]]) usually attracts a large number of [[African Americans]] and sometimes [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] listeners through playing a great deal of [[R&B]] (without any form of rapping), [[gospel music]], classic soul and [[dance music]] (including [[disco]]).\n\nAnother format, ''[[rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic AC]]'', in addition to playing all the popular hot and soft AC music, past and present, places a heavy emphasis on [[disco]] as well as 1980s and 1990s dance hits, such as those by [[Amber (performer)|Amber]], [[C&C Music Factory]] and [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]], and includes dance [[remixes]] of pop songs, such as the [[Soul Solution]] mix of [[Toni Braxton]]'s \"Unbreak My Heart\".\n\nIn its early years of existence, the [[smooth jazz]] format was considered to be a form of AC, although it was mainly instrumental, and related a stronger resemblance to the soft AC-styled music. For many years, [[George Benson]], [[Kenny G]] and [[Dave Koz]] had all had crossover hits that were played on both smooth jazz and soft AC stations.\n\n===2000s\u2013present: AC music goes mainstream and mainstream music goes AC===\n[[File:MichaelBubleDanceFeb2011.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A number of [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]]'s singles and albums topped the AC charts in the 2000s and 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Latham|first=Aaron|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-bubl%C3%A9-mn0000885569|title=Michael Bubl\u00e9 - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=September 9, 1975|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>]]\nDuring the 2000s, the AC market gained an increased presence in the music industry, as its radio formats were popular nationwide\u2014Smooth jazz and \"Urban AC\" stations were ubiquitous in the East Coast, while Soft rock and \"adult standards\" stations were common in the Midwest, and pop-oriented \"Hot AC\" and \"world music\"/Hispanic AC stations were easily found in the West Coast and the \"Sun Belt\". This led to the presence of numerous genres on the AC charts, often crossing to the \"pop\" charts, winning over many critics in the need to define AC, and increased the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day-to-day radio play.\n\n[[Josh Groban]]'s single \"[[You Raise Me Up#Josh Groban version|You Raise Me Up]]\" and [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]]'s \"Fever\" are often considered to be key examples of the high production values and ballad-heavy sound that defined 2000s-era AC,<ref name=\"Trust\" /> often dubbed as \"jazz-pop\", heavily carrying classical, jazz and traditional pop influences. Artists such as [[Nick Lachey]], [[James Blunt]], [[Jamie Cullum]], [[John Mayer]], [[Jason Mraz]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Susan Boyle]] also achieved great success during this period. During most of the 2000s, [[country music]]/[[countrypolitan]] musicians such as [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Clay Aiken]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Shania Twain]], [[LeAnn Rimes]] and [[Carrie Underwood]] scored hits on soft AC. A popular trend in the late 1990s and 2000s was remixing [[dance music]] hits into adult contemporary ballads, especially in the US, (for example, the \"Candlelight Mix\" versions of \"[[Heaven (Bryan Adams song)|Heaven]]\" by [[DJ Sammy]], \"Listen To Your Heart\" by [[DHT (band)|D.H.T.]], and \"[[Everytime We Touch (Cascada song)|Everytime We Touch]]\" by [[Cascada]]).\n\nKey to the success of AC in the 2000s was the 25-34 demographic which had outgrown the pop music offerings of the time, most new rock became too [[alternative music|alternative]] and harsh for AC radio and most new pop was now influenced heavily by [[dance-pop]], hip-hop and [[electronic dance music]].<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2007). ''Billboard Top Adult Songs 1961-2006'' (Record Research Inc.), page 373.</ref> At the same time, the music industry also began to focus on older audiences and markets generally considered \"niche\".\n\nDuring the late 2000s, certain pop songs began entering the AC charts instead, generally after the songs had fallen off the Hot 100. Adrian Moreira, senior vice president for adult music for [[RCA Music Group]], said, \"We've seen a fairly tidal shift in what AC will play\". Rather than emphasizing older songs, adult contemporary now began playing many of the same songs as top 40 and [[adult top 40]], but only after the hits had become established.<ref name=\"Trust\" /> An article on [[MTV]]'s website by Corey Moss describes this trend as: \"In other words, AC stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death.

Diminishing physical record sales throughout the 2010s also proved a major blow to the AC genre, and there are concerns that the [[portable people meter]], a device being used to determine radio listenership, may be incompatible with AC songs and may not accurately pick up that a person is listening to an AC station because of the pitches and frequencies used in the style.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-delilah/|title=The Queen of FM Fights for Her Throne|last=Boudway|first=Ira|date=June 14, 2016|website=[[Bloomberg Business Week]]|accessdate=June 15, 2016|quote=It\u2019s destroying radio in general, and especially shows that don\u2019t play for the meter.}}</ref>\n\nKey AC artists of the 2010s include [[Bruno Mars]], [[Adele]] and [[Ed Sheeran]], featuring a mostly pop-influenced sound, faster-paced and more energetic than the typical AC fare of previous years.

In markets where they existed, Smooth AC stations were meant to fill a void for soft music created by the mainstream Adult Contemporary format's overall move toward more uptempo adult Top-40 musical fare.\n\n===Contemporary Christian music===\n''[[Contemporary Christian music]]'' (CCM) has several subgenres, one being \"Christian AC\". ''[[Radio & Records]]'', for instance, lists Christian AC among its format charts. There has been crossover to mainstream and hot AC formats by many of the core artists of the Christian AC genre, notably [[Amy Grant]], [[Michael W.

While these tend mostly to be contemporary seasonal recordings by the same few artists featured under the normal format, most stations will also air some vintage holiday tunes from older pop, [[middle of the road (music)|MOR]], and [[adult standards]] artists \u2013 such as [[Nat King Cole]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Dean Martin]], [[the Carpenters]], [[Percy Faith]], [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Andy Williams]] \u2013 many of whom would never be played on these stations during the rest of the year.\n\nThese Christmas music marathons typically start during the week before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] and end after [[Christmas Day]], or sometimes extending to [[New Year's Day]]. Afterwards, the stations usually resume their normal music fare. Several stations begin the holiday format much earlier, at the beginning of November. The roots of this tradition can be traced back to the [[beautiful music]] and [[easy listening]] stations of the 1960s and 1970s.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Syndicated radio shows and networks carrying the adult contemporary format==\n* ''[[Delilah Rene|Delilah]]'' \u2013 One of the USA's [[List of most-listened-to radio programs|most popular radio shows]], ''Delilah'' airs primarily in the evening.\n* Intelligence for Your Life \u2013 Hosted by [[John Tesh]], this show also airs evenings and also on weekends.\n* ''[[American Top 40]]'' with [[Ryan Seacrest]] \u2013 One version of AT40 airs on USA hot AC stations, which is a little different from its Top-40/CHR counterpart.\n* ''[[Rick Dees Weekly Top 40]]/Weekly Top 30'' \u2013 Began offering Hot AC versions of the popular countdown show in June 1996.

A few offered 90% instrumentals, and a handful were entirely instrumental. The easy listening format, as it was first known, was born of a desire by some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to continue playing current hit songs but distinguish themselves from being branded as \"[[rock and roll]]\" stations. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' first published the Easy Listening chart July 17, 1961, with 20 songs; the first number one was \"[[Boll Weevil Song]]\" by [[Brook Benton]]. The chart described itself as \"not too far out in either direction\".<ref name=Trust>Trust, Gary (July 23, 2011). \"Vanilla Is Licking the Competition\". ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Vol. 123, Issue 25.</ref>\n\nInitially, the vocalists consisted of artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Doris Day]], [[Johnny Mathis]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Perry Como]], and others. The custom recordings were usually instrumental versions of current or recent [[rock and roll]] or [[pop music|pop]] hit songs, a move intended to give the stations more mass appeal without [[selling out]]. Some stations would also occasionally play earlier [[big band]]-era recordings from the 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Project MUSE - Lounge Caravan: A Selective Discography |journal=Notes |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1060\u20131083 |doi=10.1353/not.2005.0059 |date=February 23, 2005 |last1=Goldsmith |first1=Melissa Ursula Dawn }}</ref>\n\nAfter 1965, differences between the [[Hot 100]] chart and the Easy Listening chart became more pronounced. Better reflecting what middle of the road stations were actually playing, the composition of the chart changed dramatically. As rock music continued to harden, there was much less crossover between the Hot 100 and Easy Listening chart than there had been in the early half of the 1960s. [[Roger Miller]], [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Bobby Vinton]] were among the chart's most popular performers.<ref name=Trust/>\n\nOne big impetus for the development of the AC radio format was that, when rock and roll music first became popular in the mid-1950s, many more conservative radio stations wanted to continue to play current hit songs while shying away from rock. These [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] (or \"MOR\") stations also frequently included older, pre-rock-era [[adult standards]] and [[big band]] titles to further appeal to adult listeners who had grown up with those songs.\n\nAnother big impetus for the evolution of the AC radio format was the popularity of easy listening or \"[[beautiful music]]\" stations, stations with music specifically designed to be purely [[background music|ambient]]. Whereas most easy listening music was instrumental, created by relatively unknown artists, and rarely purchased (especially as singles, although [[Jackie Gleason]]'s beautiful music albums sold well in the 1950s), AC was an attempt to create a similar \"lite\" format by choosing certain tracks (both hit singles and album cuts) of popular artists.\n\n[[File:Barry Manilow 1979.jpg|right|Manilow in 1979|thumb|180px|In terms of record sales and career longevity, [[Barry Manilow]] is one of the most successful adult contemporary singers ever and the most best-selling of the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/barry-manilow-mn0000018977|title=Barry Manilow - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=June 17, 1943|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> ]]\n\n===1970s: Soft rock forms as a radio format===\n{{See also|Soft rock|List of soft rock artists and songs}}\nLate 1960s [[hard rock]] had been established as one of rock genres.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/60smusic.html | title=1960s Music History including Sixties Styles, Bands and Artists}}</ref> From the end of the 1960s, hard rock and soft rock became popular in rock scene,<ref name=\"autogenerated687\"/> with both emerging as major radio formats in the USA.<ref>M.

This evolved into specialized radio stations that played specific genres of music, and generally followed the evolution of artists in those genres.\n\nBy the early 1970s, softer songs by [[The Carpenters]], [[Anne Murray]], [[John Denver]], [[Barry Manilow]], and even Streisand, began to be played more often on \"Top 40\" radio and others were added to the mix on many AC stations. Also, some of these stations even played softer songs by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Elton John]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Billy Joel]], and other rock-based artists.\n\nMuch of the music recorded by [[singer-songwriter]]s such as [[Diana Ross]], [[James Taylor]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Carole King]] and [[Janis Ian]] got as much, if not more, airplay on this format than on Top 40 stations. Easy Listening radio also began including songs by artists who had begun in other genres, such as rock and roll or [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]. In addition, several early disco songs, did well on the Adult Contemporary format.\n\n===1980s: Adult contemporary succeeds as radio format===\n[[File:George Michael.jpeg|right|thumb|180px|\"[[Careless Whisper]]\" stayed at the #1 spot in the adult contemporary chart for 5 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=wham!|chart=all}}|title=Careless Whisper - Wham!|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> The song was [[George Michael]]'s first solo single.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/george-michael-mn0000545074|title=George Michael - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=June 25, 1963|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nOn April 7, 1979, the Easy Listening chart officially became known as Adult Contemporary,<ref name=Trust/> and those two words have remained consistent in the name of the chart ever since. Adult contemporary music became one of the most popular [[radio format]]s of the 1980s. The growth of AC was a natural result of the [[generation]] that first listened to the more \"specialized\" music of the mid-late 1970s growing older and not being interested in the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hip hop music|rap/hip-hop]] music that a new generation helped to play a significant role in the [[Top 40 chart]]s by the end of the decade.\n\nMainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional AC artists such as [[Barbra Streisand]], the [[The Carpenters|Carpenters]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[John Denver]], and [[Olivia Newton-John]] found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the [[Contemporary Hit Radio]] format, such as [[Richard Marx]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[George Michael]], [[Phil Collins]], and [[Laura Branigan]] began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency. Collins has been described by [[AllMusic]] as \"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/phil-collins-mn0000337119/biography| title= Phil Collins Biography | work=AllMusic | first=William | last=Ruhlmann | accessdate=April 21, 2014}}</ref> However, with the combination of MTV and AC radio, adult contemporary appeared harder to define as a genre, with established soft-rock artists of the past still charting pop hits and receiving airplay alongside mainstream radio fare from newer artists at the time.\n\nThe amount of crossover between the AC chart and the Hot 100 has varied based on how much the passing pop music trends of the times appealed to adult listeners. Not many [[disco]] or [[New wave music|new wave]] songs were particularly successful on the AC chart during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and much of the hip-hop and harder rock music featured on [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] formats later in the decade would have been unacceptable on AC radio.\n\nAlthough dance-oriented, electronic pop and ballad-oriented rock dominated the 1980s, soft rock songs still enjoyed a mild success thanks to [[Sheena Easton]], [[Amy Grant]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/amy-grant-mn0000024944|title=Amy Grant - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> [[Lionel Richie]], [[Christopher Cross]], [[Dan Hill]], [[Leo Sayer]], [[Billy Ocean]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-ocean-mn0000089058|title=Billy Ocean - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=January 21, 1950|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Bertie Higgins]], and [[Tommy Page]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fawthrop|first=Peter|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tommy-page-mn0000624184|title=Tommy Page - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=May 24, 1970|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> No song spent more than six weeks at #1 on this chart during the 1980s, with nine songs accomplishing that feat. Two of these were by Lionel Richie, \"[[You Are (Lionel Richie song)|You Are]]\" in 1983 and \"[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]\" in 1984, which also reached #1 on the Hot 100.\n\nIn 1989, [[Linda Ronstadt]] released ''[[Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind]]'', described by critics as \"the first true Adult Contemporary album of the decade\", featuring American soul singer [[Aaron Neville]] on several of the twelve tracks. The album was certified Triple Platinum in the United States alone and became a major success throughout the globe. The [[Grammy Award]]-winning singles, \"[[Don't Know Much]]\" and \"[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]\", were both long-running #1 Adult Contemporary hits. Several additional singles from the disc made the AC Top 10 as well. The album won over many critics in the need to define AC, and appeared to change the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day to day radio play.\n\n===1990s: Subgenre formations/radio crossovers===\n[[File:Marc Anthony 2009 White House.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Latin artist [[Marc Anthony]]'s self-titled English-language album released in 1999 had singles that crossed over to the AC charts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Craig|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marc-anthony-mn0000673486|title=Marc Anthony - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nThe early 1990s marked the softening of urban R&B in the shape of new jack swing, at the same time alternative rock emerged and traditional pop saw a significant resurgence. This in part led to a widening of the market, not only allowing to cater to more niche markets, but it also became customary for artists to make AC-friendly singles. At the same time, the genre began adopting elements from hard rock as tastes were shifting towards louder music, while AC stations in general began playing more rock acts. \"Softer\" features such as light instrumental music (carried over from the [[beautiful music]] format\u2014many AC stations carried the format until the early 1970s), new age songs and most pre-1964 artists were gradually phased out from AC radio throughout the early-mid 1990s.\n\nUnlike the majority of 1980s mainstream singers, the 1990s mainstream pop/R&B singers such as [[All-4-One]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=all-4-one|chart=all}}|title=All-4-One Album & Song Chart History|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> [[Boyz II Men]], [[Christina Aguilera]],<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mariah carey|chart=all}}|title=Mariah Carey Music News & Info|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref> [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Savage Garden]]<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> generally crossed over to the AC charts.

Newer female singer-songwriters such as [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]], [[Melissa Etheridge]] and [[Sheryl Crow]] also broke through on the AC chart during this time.<ref name=\"Hyatt\">Hyatt, Wesley (1999). ''The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits''.  New York City:  [[Billboard Books]].  {{ISBN|978-0-823-07693-2}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1996, ''Billboard'' created a new chart called [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks|Adult Top 40]], which reflects programming on radio stations that exists somewhere between \"adult contemporary\" music and \"pop\" music. Although they are sometimes mistaken for each other, the Adult Contemporary chart and the Adult Top 40 chart are separate charts, and songs reaching one chart might not reach the other. In addition, [[Hot adult contemporary|hot AC]] is another subgenre of radio programming that is distinct from the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart as it exists today, despite the apparent similarity in name.\n\nIn response to the pressure on Hot AC, a new kind of AC format cropped up among American radio recently. The ''[[urban adult contemporary]]'' format (a term coined by [[Barry Mayo]]) usually attracts a large number of [[African Americans]] and sometimes [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] listeners through playing a great deal of [[R&B]] (without any form of rapping), [[gospel music]], classic soul and [[dance music]] (including [[disco]]).\n\nAnother format, ''[[rhythmic adult contemporary|rhythmic AC]]'', in addition to playing all the popular hot and soft AC music, past and present, places a heavy emphasis on [[disco]] as well as 1980s and 1990s dance hits, such as those by [[Amber (performer)|Amber]], [[C&C Music Factory]] and [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]], and includes dance [[remixes]] of pop songs, such as the [[Soul Solution]] mix of [[Toni Braxton]]'s \"Unbreak My Heart\".\n\nIn its early years of existence, the [[smooth jazz]] format was considered to be a form of AC, although it was mainly instrumental, and related a stronger resemblance to the soft AC-styled music. For many years, [[George Benson]], [[Kenny G]] and [[Dave Koz]] had all had crossover hits that were played on both smooth jazz and soft AC stations.\n\n===2000s\u2013present: AC music goes mainstream and mainstream music goes AC===\n[[File:MichaelBubleDanceFeb2011.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A number of [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]]'s singles and albums topped the AC charts in the 2000s and 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Latham|first=Aaron|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/michael-bubl%C3%A9-mn0000885569|title=Michael Bubl\u00e9 - Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=AllMusic|date=September 9, 1975|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}</ref>]]\nDuring the 2000s, the AC market gained an increased presence in the music industry, as its radio formats were popular nationwide\u2014Smooth jazz and \"Urban AC\" stations were ubiquitous in the East Coast, while Soft rock and \"adult standards\" stations were common in the Midwest, and pop-oriented \"Hot AC\" and \"world music\"/Hispanic AC stations were easily found in the West Coast and the \"Sun Belt\". This led to the presence of numerous genres on the AC charts, often crossing to the \"pop\" charts, winning over many critics in the need to define AC, and increased the tolerance and acceptance of AC music into mainstream day-to-day radio play.\n\n[[Josh Groban]]'s single \"[[You Raise Me Up#Josh Groban version|You Raise Me Up]]\" and [[Michael Bubl\u00e9]]'s \"Fever\" are often considered to be key examples of the high production values and ballad-heavy sound that defined 2000s-era AC,<ref name=\"Trust\" /> often dubbed as \"jazz-pop\", heavily carrying classical, jazz and traditional pop influences. Artists such as [[Nick Lachey]], [[James Blunt]], [[Jamie Cullum]], [[John Mayer]], [[Jason Mraz]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Susan Boyle]] also achieved great success during this period. During most of the 2000s, [[country music]]/[[countrypolitan]] musicians such as [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Clay Aiken]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Garth Brooks]], [[Shania Twain]], [[LeAnn Rimes]] and [[Carrie Underwood]] scored hits on soft AC. A popular trend in the late 1990s and 2000s was remixing [[dance music]] hits into adult contemporary ballads, especially in the US, (for example, the \"Candlelight Mix\" versions of \"[[Heaven (Bryan Adams song)|Heaven]]\" by [[DJ Sammy]], \"Listen To Your Heart\" by [[DHT (band)|D.H.T.]], and \"[[Everytime We Touch (Cascada song)|Everytime We Touch]]\" by [[Cascada]]).\n\nKey to the success of AC in the 2000s was the 25-34 demographic which had outgrown the pop music offerings of the time, most new rock became too [[alternative music|alternative]] and harsh for AC radio and most new pop was now influenced heavily by [[dance-pop]], hip-hop and [[electronic dance music]].<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2007). ''Billboard Top Adult Songs 1961-2006'' (Record Research Inc.), page 373.</ref> At the same time, the music industry also began to focus on older audiences and markets generally considered \"niche\".\n\nDuring the late 2000s, certain pop songs began entering the AC charts instead, generally after the songs had fallen off the Hot 100. Adrian Moreira, senior vice president for adult music for [[RCA Music Group]], said, \"We've seen a fairly tidal shift in what AC will play\". Rather than emphasizing older songs, adult contemporary now began playing many of the same songs as top 40 and [[adult top 40]], but only after the hits had become established.<ref name=\"Trust\" /> An article on [[MTV]]'s website by Corey Moss describes this trend as: \"In other words, AC stations are where pop songs go to die a very long death.

Diminishing physical record sales throughout the 2010s also proved a major blow to the AC genre, and there are concerns that the [[portable people meter]], a device being used to determine radio listenership, may be incompatible with AC songs and may not accurately pick up that a person is listening to an AC station because of the pitches and frequencies used in the style.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-delilah/|title=The Queen of FM Fights for Her Throne|last=Boudway|first=Ira|date=June 14, 2016|website=[[Bloomberg Business Week]]|accessdate=June 15, 2016|quote=It\u2019s destroying radio in general, and especially shows that don\u2019t play for the meter.}}</ref>\n\nKey AC artists of the 2010s include [[Bruno Mars]], [[Adele]] and [[Ed Sheeran]], featuring a mostly pop-influenced sound, faster-paced and more energetic than the typical AC fare of previous years.

As these stations' playlists have become concentrated towards airing only the current hits at a given time, hot AC airplay can build and sustain a song's popularity over a long-term period.

Easy listening stations had begun shifting to the format out of concern that their existing programming would not appeal to the current generation of listeners.<ref name=\"trib-softac\" />\n\nIn a 1990 article, [[James Warren (journalist)|James Warren]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' characterized soft AC stations as being \"as middle-of-the-road and unthreatening as modern media get\", with [[radio personality|personalities]] that were encouraged to be as inoffensive and \"low-profile\" as possible, and a more conservative music library than hot AC-leaning stations. In particular, Chicago's [[WLIT]] did not have its airstaff talk over the beginning and endings of songs (in contrast to the hot AC-leaning [[WKSC-FM|WFYR]]), and played [[Bob Seger]]'s \"[[We've Got Tonite]]\" but not \"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\" (which was part of [[WTMX]]'s playlist). The director of a soft AC station in Connecticut, [[WEZN-FM]], told Warren that he had barred the reading of top-of-hour news headlines, so that listeners wouldn't be tempted to tune away to an [[All-news radio|all-news]] station to learn more.<ref name=\"trib-softac\" />\n\nSoft AC stations tend to be more selective in their music libraries than other adult contemporary stations, preferring proven songs over current hits.<ref name=\"trib-softac\" /> Upon the onset of the format's popularity, core artists typically included singers such as [[Nat King Cole]], [[Perry Como]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Johnny Mathis]], and [[Barbra Streisand]]. By the 1990s, to improve their appeal among changing demographics, some soft AC stations began to widen their playlist to include selections from contemporary acts such as [[Bon Jovi]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Elton John]], and [[Whitney Houston]]. On the other hand, by 1996, New York's [[WLTW]] had begun to phase out its softer music in favor of a more uptempo direction.<ref name=\"trib-softac\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/20/business/media-business-advertising-wltw-fm-finds-success-with-ever-evolving-definition.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; WLTW-FM finds success with an ever-evolving definition of 'soft' adult contemporary music.|last=Elliott|first=Stuart|access-date=November 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ugkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22wltw%22+%22soft+ac%22|title=Office Radio: No Longer Monolithic|date=November 23, 1996|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XCQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT64&lpg=PT64&dq=%22wltw%22+%22soft+ac%22#v=onepage&q=%22wltw%22%20%22soft%20ac%22&f=false|title=AC Dominates Arbitrons|date=January 18, 1986|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, ''Inside Radio'' reported that soft AC had the third-largest decrease in U.S. stations offering the format over the past decade (at 128), ranking behind only [[adult standards]] and [[oldies]] \u2014 a shift credited to aging demographics and a major boom in the wider-appealing [[classic hits]] format (which saw the largest overall increase over the same period).

While operating near Malta ''Sakaki'' was hit and damaged by [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] [[U-boat]] {{ship|SM|U-27|Austria-Hungary|2}}.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]], the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had a total of two modern destroyers capable of overseas deployment: the {{sclass-|Sakura|destroyer|4}} {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Sakura|1911|2}} and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Tachibana|1912|2}}. It was clear that this force would not enable Japan to fulfill its obligations under the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], so the Japanese government pushed through an Emergency Naval Expansion Budget in fiscal 1914 to allow for the construction of ten new destroyers. As speed was of the essence, the orders were given to both government and civilian shipyards (as was the case with the construction of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] vintage ''Kamikaze''-class). {{sfn|Howarth|1983|p= }}\n\nTwelve more vessels were built by the same shipyards in Japan per an order from the [[French Navy]], where they were designated the [[Arabe-class destroyer|Tribal class]] (or ''Arabe'' class) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/arabe.htm|title=Arabe French destroyer class|publisher=|access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref>  named {{ship|French destroyer|Alg\u00e9rien||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Annamite||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Arabe||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Bambara||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Hova||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Kabyle||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Marocain||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Sakalave||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|S\u00e9n\u00e9galais||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Somali||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Tonkinois||2}}, and {{ship|French destroyer|Touareg||2}}. The ''Arabe'' class were the most advanced destroyers in the French inventory in World War I.{{sfn|Tucker|Mary|2005|p=165}}\n\n== Design ==\nThe ten ''Kaba''-class vessels were built simultaneously at eight different shipyards around Japan. As there was no time to design a new vessel, plans for the previous ''Sakura''-class destroyers were distributed to each shipyard, with the instructions that the power plant was to be a conventional [[coal]]-fired [[steam engine|triple expansion steam engine]], and not a [[turbine engine|steam turbine]].\n\nArmament was the same as that of the ''Sakura'' class, with one [[QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I \u2013 IV]], mounted on the deck forward of the bridge, and four [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|3 inch 12 pounder guns]], mounted one on either side and two towards the stern of the ship, with two [[torpedo]] launchers.\n\n== Operational history ==\nGiven the speed of construction and the fact that eight different shipyards were used, it is a tribute to the Japanese shipbuilders that all ten sister ships of the Sakaki were uniform in appearance and capabilities, and performed reliably in their overseas deployment to the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in combat operations in World War I. {{sfn|Jentschura|Jung|Mickel|1977|p= }} This deployment began with Rear Admiral [[Kozo Sato]] arrived in [[Malta]] in mid-April 1917, with the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Akashi||2}} as his flagship and eight [[Kaba-class destroyer|''Kaba''-class destroyers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyJapanese.htm#dd|title=Japanese Navy, IJN, World War 1|publisher=|access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref> {{sfn|Halpern|1995|p=393}} The Japanese fleet was nominally independent, but carried out operations under the direction of the [[Royal Navy]] command on Malta, primarily in escort operations for transport and troopship convoys and in [[anti-submarine warfare]] operations.{{sfn|Halpern|1995|p=393}}\n\n''Sakaki'' was damaged by the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] [[U-boat]] {{ship|SM|U-27|Austria-Hungary|2}} on 11 June 1917 off of [[Crete]] with the loss of 68{{#tag:ref|Authors Evan & Peattie say that 59 were KIA{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|2015|p=169}}|group=\"A\"}} of her 92 crewmen, including her skipper.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|2015|p=169}} {{sfn|Tucker|Mary|2005|p=1069}} {{sfn|Saxon|2000|p=62}} She was salvaged and repaired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/japanese_destroyers.htm|title=Japanese Destroyers|publisher=|access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyJapanese.htm|title=Japanese Navy, IJN, World War 1|publisher=|access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref> The ashes of the dead Japanese sailors were returned to Japan by the Imperial Japanese Navy.{{sfn|''New-York Tribune'', December 2,|1917|p=4}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Kaba class destroyer}}\n* French [[Arabe-class destroyer]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|group=\"A\"}}\n{{reflist|20em}}\n'''References'''\n*{{cite book |ref=harv|last=Evans|first=David C. |last2=Peattie|first2= Mark | authorlink2=  Mark Peattie| title = Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887\u20131941|year=2015| publisher = [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]]| isbn=978-1-61251-425-3 }}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv|last=Halpern|first=Paul G. | authorlink = Paul G.

It was clear that this force would not enable Japan to fulfill its obligations under the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]], so the Japanese government pushed through an Emergency Naval Expansion Budget in fiscal 1914 to allow for the construction of ten new destroyers. As speed was of the essence, the orders were given to both government and civilian shipyards (as was the case with the construction of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] vintage ''Kamikaze''-class). {{sfn|Howarth|1983|p= }}\n\nTwelve more vessels were built by the same shipyards in Japan per an order from the [[French Navy]], where they were designated the [[Arabe-class destroyer|Tribal class]] (or ''Arabe'' class) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.battleships-cruisers.co.uk/arabe.htm|title=Arabe French destroyer class|publisher=|access-date=21 December 2016}}</ref>  named {{ship|French destroyer|Alg\u00e9rien||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Annamite||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Arabe||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Bambara||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Hova||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Kabyle||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Marocain||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Sakalave||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|S\u00e9n\u00e9galais||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Somali||2}}, {{ship|French destroyer|Tonkinois||2}}, and {{ship|French destroyer|Touareg||2}}.

The band members include, from eldest, Toriano Adryall Jackson, Jr. (also known as Taj), Taryll Adren Jackson and [[T. J. Jackson (singer)|Tito Joe Jackson]] (also known as T. J.). Their uncle, [[Michael Jackson]], mentored the trio and signed them to his label, MJJ Entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===''Brotherhood'' (1995\u20131997)===\n3T released their debut album ''[[Brotherhood (3T album)|Brotherhood]]'' in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international [[chart-topper|hit]] with their debut [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Anything (3T song)|Anything]]\". 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including \"24/7\", \"Why\" (a [[duet (music)|duet]] with their uncle [[Michael Jackson]]), \"[[I Need You (3T song)|I Need You]]\" (with a brief appearance by Michael), \"Tease Me\" and \"Gotta Be You\". In 1996, they were ranked second behind the [[Spice Girls]], as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for [[soundtrack]]s to [[motion pictures|films]] such as ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home]]'', ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' and ''[[Trippin' (film)|Trippin']]''. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album ''Brotherhood'', which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito 'Poppa T') and a surprise performance of the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] hit, \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\".\n\n3T completed an album after the release of ''Brotherhood'', with over 20 songs being recorded and 12 planned to be included on the final track list. The album was never released by Sony due to a strained relationship with [[Michael Jackson]] (MJJ Music), and is considered by many fans to be ''The Lost Album''.\nAlso they are of Dominican ancestry on their moms side.<ref>[http://www.3t.com/music/albums/76-the-lost-album \"The Lost Album\"]. 3T.com. Retrieved: 2014-08-12</ref>\n\n===''Identity'' (2003\u20132005)===\nTaryll and T. J. have written/produced tracks for their aunt [[Janet Jackson]] as well as for [[Lindsay Lohan]] and [[Bruno Mars]]. After signing with the French label TF1/NRJ in [[2003 in music|2003]], 3T continued to perform in [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The group signed with the Dutch label Digidance in 2004 for Dutch releases, appearances and performances. The album titled ''[[Identity (3T album)|Identity]]'' was released on March 23, 2004. Two singles were released: \"[[Stuck on You (Lionel Richie song)#3T version|Stuck On You]]\" (a cover of the [[Lionel Richie]] song) was released in 2003 in France and Belgium and in 2004 in the Netherlands, and \"Sex Appeal\" in 2004. Neither single was released outside of Europe. In 2008, 3T made ''Identity'' available on both [[iTunes]] and [[amazon.com]] worldwide.\n\n===On-and-off appearances (2007\u20132011)===\nThe brothers appeared on the show ''This Is David Gest'' in 2007, including recording the theme tune \"Crazy Kinda Guy\". The show began on April 22, 2007. They appeared in an episode where Gest took cameras for a rare glimpse of the Jackson family house in Encino, California, where he met Tito and 3T as well as matriarch [[Katherine Jackson]], as well as a later episode showing them recording the theme tune.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, the Jackson family (including Tito) stayed at a holiday let (rental) for six weeks in [[Appledore, Torridge, Devon|Appledore]], [[Devon]], [[England]] while searching for a house to buy in the area. The project was filmed for a [[Channel 4]] documentary called ''The Jacksons are Coming'', which was aired in 2008. Taj and T. J. appear with their father, but Taryll did not join them on the trip. The 3 family members also attended a Michael Jackson fan event in Devon as part of their stay, ringing him up during the event which led to Michael talking to the fans over a loudspeaker on the phone.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583492/The-Jacksons-to-hit-reality-TV---in-Devon.html | title=The Jacksons to hit reality TV - in Devon | work=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] | publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] | date=2008-04-02 | accessdate=2009-03-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5247250.ece?openComment=true | title=Last Night's TV: The Jacksons Are Coming | first=Mick | last=Hume | work=[[The Times]] | publisher=[[Times Newspapers]] | date=2008-11-28 | accessdate=2009-03-20 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nAll three of them appeared on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] TV show entitled ''[[The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty]]''.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/12/12/little_reality_in_jacksons_family_dynasty/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Jacksons + reality doesn't compute | first=Matthew | last=Gilbert | date=December 12, 2009}}</ref> They appear with their father Tito, who is trying to convince them to relaunch their career.<ref name=\"Gilbert\"/>\n\nOn January 31, 2010, the three brothers appeared on stage at the 52nd Grammy Awards to support their cousins Prince Michael, Jr. and Paris Michael Katherine Jackson as they accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of their father, Michael Jackson.

The band members include, from eldest, Toriano Adryall Jackson, Jr. (also known as Taj), Taryll Adren Jackson and [[T. J. Jackson (singer)|Tito Joe Jackson]] (also known as T. J.). Their uncle, [[Michael Jackson]], mentored the trio and signed them to his label, MJJ Entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===''Brotherhood'' (1995\u20131997)===\n3T released their debut album ''[[Brotherhood (3T album)|Brotherhood]]'' in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international [[chart-topper|hit]] with their debut [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Anything (3T song)|Anything]]\". 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including \"24/7\", \"Why\" (a [[duet (music)|duet]] with their uncle [[Michael Jackson]]), \"[[I Need You (3T song)|I Need You]]\" (with a brief appearance by Michael), \"Tease Me\" and \"Gotta Be You\". In 1996, they were ranked second behind the [[Spice Girls]], as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for [[soundtrack]]s to [[motion pictures|films]] such as ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home]]'', ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' and ''[[Trippin' (film)|Trippin']]''. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album ''Brotherhood'', which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito 'Poppa T') and a surprise performance of the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] hit, \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\".\n\n3T completed an album after the release of ''Brotherhood'', with over 20 songs being recorded and 12 planned to be included on the final track list. The album was never released by Sony due to a strained relationship with [[Michael Jackson]] (MJJ Music), and is considered by many fans to be ''The Lost Album''.\nAlso they are of Dominican ancestry on their moms side.<ref>[http://www.3t.com/music/albums/76-the-lost-album \"The Lost Album\"]. 3T.com.
