The ride consists of seven freely-spinning cars that hold three or four riders each, which are attached at [[Pivot joint|fixed pivot points]] on a rotating platform. As the platform [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotates]], parts of the platform are raised and lowered, with the resulting [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] and [[Gravity|gravitational]] forces on the revolving cars causing them to spin in different directions and at variable speeds. The [[weight]] of passengers in these cars (as well as the [[weight distribution]]) may intensify or dampen the spinning motion of the cars, adding to the unpredictable nature known as [[Chaos theory|chaotic motion]].\n\nPhysicists Bret M. Huggard and Richard L. Kautz came up with a [[mathematical equation]] that approximates the motion of the Tilt-A-Whirl.<ref>Kautz, R.L., and B.M. Huggard. 1994. Chaos at the amusement park: Dynamics of the Tilt-A-Whirl. American Journal of Physics 62(January):59.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nHerbert Sellner invented the Tilt-A-Whirl in 1926 at his [[Faribault, Minnesota]], home. In 1927, the first 14 Tilt-A-Whirls were built in Herbert's basement and yard. [[Sellner Manufacturing]] opened its factory in Faribault and the ride debuted at the [[Minnesota State Fair]].\n\nThe earliest Tilt-A-Whirls were constructed of [[wood]], powered by [[internal combustion engine|gas motors]], and featured nine cars.{{Verify-inline|date=September 2016}} Modern rides are constructed of [[steel]], [[aluminum]] and [[fiberglass]], and it is powered by seven small [[electric motor]]s, and has seven cars.{{Verify-inline|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn 1995, Tovah Sellner took over Sellner Manufacturing after the loss of her husband Bruce Sellner; her daughter Erin Sellner joined her in 1998 and the two of them ran the business together.\n\n== Modern Tilt-A-Whirls ==\nIn 1927, Sellner started manufacturing Tilt-A-Whirls, and more than a thousand rides were built. Some of the rides produced in the 1940s and 1950s are still in operation. The rides were originally designed and built at the factory in [[Faribault, Minnesota]].\n\nModern Tilt-A-Whirls cost in excess of USD $300,000 to purchase.  A Tilt-A-Whirl package comes with a choice to employ either the famous domed tipkarts (which were introduced back during the 1930s), or Waltzer-style open squat podkarts having headrest bars (that option was introduced by Sellner Manufacturing in 2003).\n\nThe oldest operating Tilt-A-Whirl is a 1927 model, traveling with Tom Evans United Shows in the [[Midwestern United States|US Midwest]]. Between six- and seven hundred Tilt-A-Whirls are in operation.\n\n[[Conneaut Lake Park]] in [[Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania]] still has its original Tilt-A-Whirl from 1949.\n\n[[Bessemer, Alabama]]'s amusement park [[Alabama Splash Adventure]] introduced a Tilt-a-Whirl ride to the public on May 19, 2018.<ref name=\"Holloway 2018\">{{cite web | last=Holloway | first=Seth | title=Alabama Splash Adventure Opening with New Expansions On Saturday May 19, 2018 (Preview Pictures And Videos) | website=The Cutoff News | date=2018-05-19 | url=https://www.thecutoffnews.com/bessemer/alabama-splash-adventure-opening-with-new-expansions-on-saturday-may/article_948454ac-5628-11e8-bba6-4f4a44f7faf8.html | access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref>\n\n== Incidents and accidents ==\nOn September 22, 2018, A Tilt-A-Whirl operated by Thomas Amusements in St. John's, Newfoundland malfunctioned when two of the cars crashed into each other causing the top of one of the cars to fall off and on to the platform.

The first ordinance allows the city manager the abilities to close any city facility in order to ensure the health and safety of city employees and the community, to enter into temporary agreements with bargaining units to ensure continuation of city services and to adjust personnel policies, designate areas for carry-out and curbside pickup from restaurants in the downtown area of the city, and to extend deadlines for licenses issued under the city code.  The ordinance also officially suspends the charging late fees for water and sewer, stopping the disconnection of water and sewer service for non-payment, extension of the payment deadline of the city's food and beverage tax along with the package liquor tax until May 20, extends the motor fuel taxes and hotel/motel taxes until April 30. An additional item that was added was the suspension of the enforcement of the tall grass and weed ordinance.  The second ordinance allowed for a streamlined process of the enforcement of the multiple executive orders issued by Governor Pritzker. Typically these orders would be sent through the [[Jackson County, Illinois|Jackson County Health Department]] and then to the [[Illinois Department of Public Health]] for review and then off to the county state's attorney for enforcement. Instead these orders will be processed by the City of Carbondale and enforced by the Carbondale Police Department by way of fines up to $750 per day and alleviates a \"minor violation from becoming a misdemeanor or felony charge\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Issac |title=Carbondale City Council passes ordinance to declare emergency in response to COVID-19 |url=https://thesouthern.com/news/local/carbondale-city-council-passes-ordinance-to-declare-emergency-in-response-to-covid-19/article_6da6480b-8857-52c6-affe-99bf52cf5521.html |website=The Southern Illinoisian |accessdate=April 12, 2020 |date=April 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== City of Chicago ====\nOn March 12, Chicago Mayor [[Lori Lightfoot]] announced that after meeting with [[Comcast]] executives, the company would \"double internet speeds to low income households nationally.
