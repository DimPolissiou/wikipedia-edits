Italy declared that it wanted to host \"For the Enlargement of the Frontiers of Our Sport\". It was a slogan relevant to the then-current landscape of World Cup rugby, given that 2007 was the first time that the Rugby World Cup was hosted by a primarily non-[[English-speaking country]].\n\nThe Italian bid offered the largest cities and stadiums in the country and promised a fast domestic train system. The [[Italian Rugby Federation]] (FIR) also included the importance of the population and the growth of rugby since Italy joined the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] in 2000 as reasons for hosting a World Cup.

These squads were to be submitted to World Rugby by a deadline of 31 August 2015. Once the squad was submitted, a player could be replaced if injured, but would not be allowed to return to the squad. There was also a stand-down period of 48 hours before the new player was allowed to take the field.

Each pool was a [[round-robin tournament|single round-robin]] of ten games, in which each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams were awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw and none for a defeat. A team scoring four [[Try (rugby)|tries]] in one match scored a bonus point, as did a team that lost by fewer than eight points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|title=Tournament rules|work=rugbyworldcup.com|access-date=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928072157/https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|archive-date=28 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n!width=25%|[[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool A|Pool A]]\n!width=25%|[[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool B|Pool B]]\n!width=25%|[[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool C|Pool C]]\n!width=25%|[[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool D|Pool D]]\n|-\n|\n{{ru|AUS}}<br />\n{{ru|ENG}}<br />\n{{ru|WAL}}<br />\n{{ru|FIJ}}<br />\n{{ru|URU}}\n|\n{{ru|RSA}}<br />\n{{ru|SAM}}<br />\n{{ru|SCO}}<br />\n{{ru|JPN}}<br />\n{{ru|USA}}\n|\n{{ru|NZL}}<br />\n{{ru|ARG}}<br />\n{{ru|TON}}<br />\n{{ru|GEO}}<br />\n{{ru|NAM}}\n|\n{{ru|FRA}}<br />\n{{ru|IRE}}<br />\n{{ru|ITA}}<br />\n{{ru|CAN}}<br />\n{{ru|ROM}}\n|}\n\nThe teams finishing in the top two of each pool would advance to the quarter-finals.

The [[Italian Rugby Federation]] (FIR) also included the importance of the population and the growth of rugby since Italy joined the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] in 2000 as reasons for hosting a World Cup. Rugby had been growing increasingly popular in Italy in recent years, with improved crowds at international matches.\n\nThe [[Stadio Olimpico]] in Rome had been proposed as the venue to host the final and the first match of the tournament. Milan and Naples were included as the other large venues. The entire list was a selection of large stadiums spread across the country. [[Stade V\u00e9lodrome]] in [[Marseille]], France was also included as the tenth proposed venue.\n\n====Japan====\n{{Main article|2019 Rugby World Cup}}\n\nThe [[Japan Rugby Football Union]] officially submitted its tender to the IRB in May 2009.<ref name=\"Japan joins\" /> Japan was seen as a favourite to host after finishing as runner-up in the bidding for the 2011 event.<ref name=\"Japan joins\">[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/08/japan-rugby-world-cup-england-south-africa Japan joins England and South Africa in bidding for Rugby World Cup] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175301/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/may/08/japan-rugby-world-cup-england-south-africa |date=3 March 2016 }}, guardian.co.uk, 8 May 2009</ref> Japan was seen as having a lot to offer rugby's growth in Asia.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Its population of 127&nbsp;million, its large economy, and its ability to place rugby before a new Asian audience made it a front-runner for hosting rights.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Furthermore, rugby in Japan had developed a following, and with 126,000 registered players, Japan had more players than some of the Six Nations.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Japan's [[Top League]] was a showcase for Japanese rugby, and there was excitement about Japan's entry into the RWC.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Japan's experience in co-hosting the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] was also seen as a boost, with Japan already possessing the necessary stadiums and infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====South Africa====\nThe South African Rugby Union (SARU) had confirmed its intent to bid for the 2015 tournament,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mattsports.co.uk/blog/30000-tickets-more-on-sale-for-rugby-wc-2015/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920232501/http://mattsports.co.uk/blog/30000-tickets-more-on-sale-for-rugby-wc-2015/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 September 2015 |title=30,000 Tickets More on Sale for Rugby WC 2015 |work=mattsports.co.uk }}</ref> and in May 2009 South Africa delivered its application to the IRB.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/8037903.stm |title=South Africa bids for World Cup |date=7 May 2009 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=7 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508012256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/8037903.stm |archivedate=8 May 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> South Africa had previously made an unsuccessful bid to host the 2011 RWC.

These squads were to be submitted to World Rugby by a deadline of 31 August 2015. Once the squad was submitted, a player could be replaced if injured, but would not be allowed to return to the squad. There was also a stand-down period of 48 hours before the new player was allowed to take the field.

Each pool was a [[round-robin tournament|single round-robin]] of ten games, in which each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams were awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw and none for a defeat. A team scoring four [[Try (rugby)|tries]] in one match scored a bonus point, as did a team that lost by fewer than eight points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|title=Tournament rules|work=rugbyworldcup.com|access-date=27 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928072157/https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|archive-date=28 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n!width=25%|[[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool A|Pool A]]\n!width=25%|[[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool B|Pool B]]\n!width=25%|[[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool C|Pool C]]\n!width=25%|[[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool D|Pool D]]\n|-\n|\n{{ru|AUS}}<br />\n{{ru|ENG}}<br />\n{{ru|WAL}}<br />\n{{ru|FIJ}}<br />\n{{ru|URU}}\n|\n{{ru|RSA}}<br />\n{{ru|SAM}}<br />\n{{ru|SCO}}<br />\n{{ru|JPN}}<br />\n{{ru|USA}}\n|\n{{ru|NZL}}<br />\n{{ru|ARG}}<br />\n{{ru|TON}}<br />\n{{ru|GEO}}<br />\n{{ru|NAM}}\n|\n{{ru|FRA}}<br />\n{{ru|IRE}}<br />\n{{ru|ITA}}<br />\n{{ru|CAN}}<br />\n{{ru|ROM}}\n|}\n\nThe teams finishing in the top two of each pool would advance to the quarter-finals.

Originally planned to be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, all games were shifted to Australia following a contractual dispute over ground signage rights between the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] and Rugby World Cup Limited. The pre-event favourites were [[England national rugby union team|England]], regarded by many at the time as the best team in the world. [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and defending champions [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] were also expected to make strong showings, with New Zealand being second favourites after victory in the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations championship.\n\nThe tournament began with host nation Australia defeating Argentina 24\u20138 at [[Stadium Australia]] in Sydney. Australia went on to defeat New Zealand 22\u201310 in the semi-final, to play England in the final. Along with a try to [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]], [[Jonny Wilkinson]] kicked four penalties and then a drop-goal in extra time to win the game 20\u201317 for [[Australia national rugby union team|England]], who became the first northern hemisphere team to win the [[Webb Ellis Cup]].\n\n==Qualifying==\n{{main|2003 Rugby World Cup qualifying}}\nThe following 20 teams, shown by region, qualified for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Of the 20 teams, eight of those places were automatically filled by the teams that reached the quarter-final stages in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]], including hosts and world champions [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and did not have to play any qualification matches. A record 81 nations from five continents were involved in the qualification process designed to fill the remaining 12 spots, which began on 23 September 2000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=98%\n|-\n!width=25%|Africa\n!width=25%|Americas\n!width=25%|Europe\n!width=25%|Oceania/Asia\n|-\n|\n*{{ru|NAM}} (Africa)\n*{{ru|RSA}}\n|\n*{{ru|ARG}}\n*{{ru|CAN}} (Americas 1)\n*{{ru|USA}} (Repechage 1)\n*{{ru|URU}} (Americas 2)\n|\n*{{ru|ENG}}\n*{{ru|FRA}}\n*{{ru|IRE}} (Europe 1)\n*{{ru|ITA}} (Europe 2)\n*{{ru|ROU}} (Europe 3)\n*{{ru|SCO}}\n*{{ru|GEO|1990}} (Europe 4)\n*{{ru|WAL}}\n|\n*{{ru|AUS}}\n*{{ru|FIJ}} (Oceania 1)\n*{{ru|NZL}}\n*{{ru|SAM}} (Oceania 2)\n*{{ru|TGA}} (Repechage 2)\n*{{ru|JPN}} (Asia)\n|}\n\n==Host==\n{{See also|Rugby World Cup hosts}}\nAustralia won the right to host the 2003 World Cup without the involvement of New Zealand after a contractual dispute over ground signage rights between the New Zealand Rugby Football Union and Rugby World Cup Limited.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/1861398.stm \"New Zealand loses Cup status\"], BBC, 8 March 2002.</ref> Australia and New Zealand had been expected to co-host \u2013 with New Zealand expected to host 23 of the 48 matches \u2013 but New Zealand's insistence on amending the provisions relating to stadium advertising was unacceptable to the IRB.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/1937084.stm \"NZ loses Rugby World Cup\"], BBC, 18 April 2002.</ref>\n\n==Venues==\nThe overall stadium capacity was 421,311 across 11 venues. This was a reduction from the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] in [[Wales]] (with games also held in [[England]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]]) which had a total capacity of 654,677 across 18 venues.\n\nThe [[Adelaide Oval]] underwent a [[AU$]]20 million redevelopment for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, financed entirely by the [[South Australian Cricket Association]], with two new grandstands built adjacent to the Victor Richardson Gates. Suncorp Stadium in [[Brisbane]] (formerly [[Lang Park]]) was a new A$280 million venue designed specifically for [[rugby league]], rugby union and [[Association football|soccer]], and was opened just prior to the start of the 2003 World Cup with a capacity of 52,500, some 12,000 more than the old Lang Park could hold. The Central Coast Stadium was also a newly built rectangular venue built for union, league and soccer. It was built on the site of the old Grahame Park ground and was opened in February 2000 at a cost of A$30 million.\n\nThe [[Sydney Football Stadium]] was one of two venues in [[Sydney]] that were used for [[association football|football]] during the [[2000 Olympic Games]]. The other venue in Sydney was [[Stadium Australia]], which was the centrepiece of the 2000 Olympic Games. It was built as the main stadium of the 2000 Olympics at a cost of $690 million and with a capacity of 83,500 was the biggest stadium used in the 2003 World Cup (the stadium had an original capacity of 110,000 before undergoing a post-Olympics redevelopment from 2001-2003). The only stadium with a retractable roof used was the [[Docklands Stadium]] in [[Melbourne]]. Although the Docklands Stadium has [[movable seating]] which brings four sections of the lower bowl forward by 18 metres to create a more rectangular surround for the pitch, this was not used during the World Cup as it reduces the seating capacity of the stadium by approximately 3,500.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| [[Sydney]]\n!colspan=\"2\"| [[Melbourne]]\n!

With forty matches to be played in the pool stage on top of the knock-out matches would make the event the largest [[Rugby World Cup]] tournament to be played to date. For the first time, a bonus point system was implemented in pool play. This system is identical to that long used in [[Southern Hemisphere]] tournaments, and was soon adopted in most European competitions (though not in the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] until 2017):\n*4 points for a win\n*2 points for a draw\n*0 points for a loss (before possible bonus points)\n*1 bonus point for scoring 4 or more tries, or a loss by 7 points or fewer\n\nA total of 48 matches (40 pool stage and eight knock-out) were played throughout the tournament over 42 days from 10 October to 22 November 2003.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Pool stage===\n[[File:World Cup Telstra stadium.jpg|thumb|The opening game at [[Stadium Australia]] between Australia and Argentina]]\nThe Australian media criticised the competition early in the tournament as the smaller nations were crushed by the rugby superpowers by 60 points or more, in particular a 142\u20130 victory by the host nation over Namibia, the largest winning margin in Rugby World Cup history. However, some of these smaller, third-tier nations, such as [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]], acquitted themselves well in their opening matches. The South Pacific island countries of [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]] and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] were reported as being handicapped as several of their key players who play abroad being warned by their clubs that their contracts would not be renewed if they played in the competition.\n\nIn the event, the pool stage of the competition played out largely as expected, with some tension as to whether some of the \"developing\" nations would overtake some of the weaker major countries for the second quarter-final qualification place in each pool \u2013 in Pool A, [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] lost to [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] by only one point, which would otherwise have carried them into the quarter-finals in Ireland's place; similarly in Pool B Fiji lost to [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] by only two points, while [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], despite missing the knockout stage, put up a good performance in Pool D with two victories, a performance which will be repeated in the next three World Cups. In Pool C, Samoa gave [[England national rugby union team|England]] a fright with an adventurous approach that allowed them to take an early lead, however England overcame the early deficit and won. This match was marked by controversy, as England fielded 16 players at one point during the game.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Rugby+World+Cup+2003%3A+THE+GREAT+ESCAPE+II%3B+England's+double+let-off.-a0109479573 thefreelibrary.com]</ref>\n\nThe big clashes ran mainly to form. [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] came through the pool in second place, after they lost to England, which meant a quarter-final against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]]. [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], however, only beat Ireland by one point to top their pool, while [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] pushed the All Blacks to the wire, after adopting an outgoing style of play with a fringe selection. [[France national rugby union team|France]] beat Scotland to round out the quarter-finals.\n\n===Knockout stage===\nThe quarter-final stage produced the widely predicted set of semi-finalists, although England again made heavy weather of defeating a resurgent Wales. England were widely rated the world's best team, but they struggled, at least in the first half, against a Welsh side full of belief after their game against New Zealand: although England pulled away in the second half after the tactical substitution of Catt for Tindall, a late Welsh try gave the scoreline the respectability that their first-half performance had deserved. France destroyed an Irish side who had gone into the match hopeful of a win, scoring 31 early points to put the game out of reach. In the other quarter-finals, a disappointing South Africa fell to New Zealand and Australia defeated the Scots.\n\nThe first semi-final produced an upset, when Australia defeated the fancied New Zealand to become the first defending champions to reach the following championship final. Unfortunately, it was probably the last match for Australian star [[Ben Darwin]], who injured his neck in a [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]. Although Darwin never played rugby again, the actions of [[Kees Meeuws]] \u2013 who immediately stopped exerting pressure when he heard the call \"neck neck neck\" \u2013 may well have saved his opponent's life and certainly prevented further injury. The match was decided by a [[Stirling Mortlock]] interception try, after a loose pass from highly rated All Blacks fly-half [[Carlos Spencer]]. [[George Gregan]] taunted his opponents in defeat with the comment, \"Four more years boys, four more years\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65xd81cj7pA youtube.com]</ref><ref name=\"Stuff.co.nz_2398842\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-news/opinion/2398842/Cup-won-t-be-empty-for-three-more-years |title=Cup won't be empty for three more years |last=Devlin |first=Martin |date=10 May 2009 |work=[[Sunday News (New Zealand)|Sunday News]] |accessdate=14 September 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe second semi-final saw France face England. The boot of [[Jonny Wilkinson]] was the difference between the two sides, with England coming out victors in torrential rain: although France scored the game's only try after an early English line-out error, they never seriously threatened the English line otherwise. And with handling being difficult in the wet and windy conditions, England's superior forward pressure and territorial control forced France to concede a slew of penalties, of which Wilkinson kicked five, also adding three drop goals (two off his less-favoured right boot) - a remarkable display considering that the swirling winds made accurate kicking as difficult as the rain and mud made passing and running.\n\n===Final===\n{{main|2003 Rugby World Cup Final}}\nThe final between Australia and England was played at Sydney's Stadium Australia in front of a crowd of 82,957. Australia opened the scoring after they decided to run a penalty instead of kicking for touch. [[Lote Tuqiri]] beat England's right wing, [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]], to a high cross-field kick and went over for the first try, but [[Elton Flatley]] was not able to add the conversion.\n\n[[File:England world cup.jpg|thumb|left|Celebrations in [[Trafalgar Square]]]]\n\nThe rest of the half was a tight affair, with England edging in front from applying pressure and Jonny Wilkinson's boot put them up to a 9\u20135 lead after Australian indiscipline gave away several penalties, but were unable to capitalise on their territory. Towards the end of the first half, England stretched their lead further. [[Lawrence Dallaglio]] made a break and popped the ball inside to [[Jonny Wilkinson]], who drew the defence before putting Robinson away in the corner for a try. The conversion was missed, but England went in at half time leading by 14\u20135.\n\nIn the second half Australia tightened their discipline, and solid play forced mistakes from England. The game swung from end to end, with both sides having try-scoring opportunities, but neither able to take them. Australia managed to get points on the board and [[Elton Flatley]] scored two penalties to make the score 14\u201311 to England. In the 79th minute, Australia were putting pressure on England in their half, and Australia were awarded a penalty right before full-time, with the potential to tie the scores. Flatley converted it to make the score 14\u201314 and take the game into an additional 20 minutes' extra time.\n\nEngland opened the scoring in extra time with another Wilkinson penalty, but with two and a half minutes of extra time remaining Australia were awarded another penalty, which Flatley kicked successfully. With 20 seconds left before sudden death, Wilkinson scored a drop goal to win the match and with it the world championship.\n\n===Post-final===\nAfter the final, Australian Prime Minister John Howard was widely criticised for his behaviour during the presentation ceremony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/excruciating-trophy-presentations-20100313-q5b9.html|title=Excruciating trophy presentations|last=Tate|first=Andrew|date=13 March 2010|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> The offhand manner in which he presented the Webb Ellis Cup to the England captain was seen by many as a graceless piece of bad sportsmanship not befitting such a climactic sporting spectacle.\n\nThree days after the final, the World Cup winning England team landed at [[Heathrow Airport]] in the early hours of the morning, emerging from their plane to a huge reception, despite the time.<ref name=BBCSport1>{{cite news |title=England rugby heroes arrive home |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/3232174.stm |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=25 November 2003 |accessdate=7 June 2006 }}</ref> On 8 December, a national day of celebration took place in the form of a massive victory parade in the streets of London.<ref name=\"visa\">{{cite web |title=Visa International Renews Rugby World Cup Partnership |work=corporate.visa.com |url=http://www.corporate.visa.com/md/nr/press269.jsp |accessdate=25 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427071525/http://www.corporate.visa.com/md/nr/press269.jsp |archivedate=27 April 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Pool stage==\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\"\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"|Qualified for the quarter-finals\n|}\n\n===Pool A===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=165|Team\n!width=40|Pld\n!width=40|W\n!width=40|D\n!width=40|L\n!width=40|PF\n!width=40|PA\n!width=40|BP\n!width=40|Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=left|{{Ru|AUS}}\n|4||4||0||0||273||32||2||'''18'''\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=left|{{Ru|IRE}}\n|4||3||0||1||141||56||3||'''15'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{Ru|ARG}}\n|4||2||0||2||140||57||3||'''11'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{Ru|ROM}}\n|4||1||0||3||65||192||1||'''5'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{Ru|NAM}}\n|4||0||0||4||28||310||0||'''0'''\n|}\n\n{{Rugbybox\n|date=10 October 2003\n|home={{Ru-rt|AUS}}\n|score=24\u20138\n|away={{Ru|ARG}}\n|try1=[[Wendell Sailor|Sailor]] 20'<br />[[Joe Roff|Roff]] 74'\n|con1=[[Elton Flatley|Flatley]]\n|pen1=[[Elton Flatley|Flatley]] (4)\n|try2=[[Ignacio Corleto|Corleto]] 72'\n|pen2=[[Manuel Contepomi|M.

Originally planned to be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, all games were shifted to Australia following a contractual dispute over ground signage rights between the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] and Rugby World Cup Limited. The pre-event favourites were [[England national rugby union team|England]], regarded by many at the time as the best team in the world. [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], [[France national rugby union team|France]], [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and defending champions [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] were also expected to make strong showings, with New Zealand being second favourites after victory in the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations championship.\n\nThe tournament began with host nation Australia defeating Argentina 24\u20138 at [[Stadium Australia]] in Sydney. Australia went on to defeat New Zealand 22\u201310 in the semi-final, to play England in the final. Along with a try to [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]], [[Jonny Wilkinson]] kicked four penalties and then a drop-goal in extra time to win the game 20\u201317 for [[England national rugby union team|England]], who became the first northern hemisphere team to win the [[Webb Ellis Cup]].\n\n==Qualifying==\n{{main|2003 Rugby World Cup qualifying}}\nThe following 20 teams, shown by region, qualified for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Of the 20 teams, eight of those places were automatically filled by the teams that reached the quarter-final stages in [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]], including hosts and world champions [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and did not have to play any qualification matches. A record 81 nations from five continents were involved in the qualification process designed to fill the remaining 12 spots, which began on 23 September 2000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=98%\n|-\n!width=25%|Africa\n!width=25%|Americas\n!width=25%|Europe\n!width=25%|Oceania/Asia\n|-\n|\n*{{ru|NAM}} (Africa)\n*{{ru|RSA}}\n|\n*{{ru|ARG}}\n*{{ru|CAN}} (Americas 1)\n*{{ru|USA}} (Repechage 1)\n*{{ru|URU}} (Americas 2)\n|\n*{{ru|ENG}}\n*{{ru|FRA}}\n*{{ru|IRE}} (Europe 1)\n*{{ru|ITA}} (Europe 2)\n*{{ru|ROU}} (Europe 3)\n*{{ru|SCO}}\n*{{ru|GEO|1990}} (Europe 4)\n*{{ru|WAL}}\n|\n*{{ru|AUS}}\n*{{ru|FIJ}} (Oceania 1)\n*{{ru|NZL}}\n*{{ru|SAM}} (Oceania 2)\n*{{ru|TGA}} (Repechage 2)\n*{{ru|JPN}} (Asia)\n|}\n\n==Host==\n{{See also|Rugby World Cup hosts}}\nAustralia won the right to host the 2003 World Cup without the involvement of New Zealand after a contractual dispute over ground signage rights between the New Zealand Rugby Football Union and Rugby World Cup Limited.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/1861398.stm \"New Zealand loses Cup status\"], BBC, 8 March 2002.</ref> Australia and New Zealand had been expected to co-host \u2013 with New Zealand expected to host 23 of the 48 matches \u2013 but New Zealand's insistence on amending the provisions relating to stadium advertising was unacceptable to the IRB.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/1937084.stm \"NZ loses Rugby World Cup\"], BBC, 18 April 2002.</ref>\n\n==Venues==\nThe overall stadium capacity was 421,311 across 11 venues. This was a reduction from the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] in [[Wales]] (with games also held in [[England]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]]) which had a total capacity of 654,677 across 18 venues.\n\nThe [[Adelaide Oval]] underwent a [[AU$]]20 million redevelopment for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, financed entirely by the [[South Australian Cricket Association]], with two new grandstands built adjacent to the Victor Richardson Gates. Suncorp Stadium in [[Brisbane]] (formerly [[Lang Park]]) was a new A$280 million venue designed specifically for [[rugby league]], rugby union and [[Association football|soccer]], and was opened just prior to the start of the 2003 World Cup with a capacity of 52,500, some 12,000 more than the old Lang Park could hold. The Central Coast Stadium was also a newly built rectangular venue built for union, league and soccer. It was built on the site of the old Grahame Park ground and was opened in February 2000 at a cost of A$30 million.\n\nThe [[Sydney Football Stadium]] was one of two venues in [[Sydney]] that were used for [[association football|football]] during the [[2000 Olympic Games]]. The other venue in Sydney was [[Stadium Australia]], which was the centrepiece of the 2000 Olympic Games. It was built as the main stadium of the 2000 Olympics at a cost of $690 million and with a capacity of 83,500 was the biggest stadium used in the 2003 World Cup (the stadium had an original capacity of 110,000 before undergoing a post-Olympics redevelopment from 2001-2003). The only stadium with a retractable roof used was the [[Docklands Stadium]] in [[Melbourne]]. Although the Docklands Stadium has [[movable seating]] which brings four sections of the lower bowl forward by 18 metres to create a more rectangular surround for the pitch, this was not used during the World Cup as it reduces the seating capacity of the stadium by approximately 3,500.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| [[Sydney]]\n!colspan=\"2\"| [[Melbourne]]\n!

With forty matches to be played in the pool stage on top of the knock-out matches would make the event the largest [[Rugby World Cup]] tournament to be played to date. For the first time, a bonus point system was implemented in pool play. This system is identical to that long used in [[Southern Hemisphere]] tournaments, and was soon adopted in most European competitions (though not in the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] until 2017):\n*4 points for a win\n*2 points for a draw\n*0 points for a loss (before possible bonus points)\n*1 bonus point for scoring 4 or more tries, or a loss by 7 points or fewer\n\nA total of 48 matches (40 pool stage and eight knock-out) were played throughout the tournament over 42 days from 10 October to 22 November 2003.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Pool stage===\n[[File:World Cup Telstra stadium.jpg|thumb|The opening game at [[Stadium Australia]] between Australia and Argentina]]\nThe Australian media criticised the competition early in the tournament as the smaller nations were crushed by the rugby superpowers by 60 points or more, in particular a 142\u20130 victory by the host nation over Namibia, the largest winning margin in Rugby World Cup history. However, some of these smaller, third-tier nations, such as [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]], acquitted themselves well in their opening matches. The South Pacific island countries of [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]] and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] were reported as being handicapped as several of their key players who play abroad being warned by their clubs that their contracts would not be renewed if they played in the competition.\n\nIn the event, the pool stage of the competition played out largely as expected, with some tension as to whether some of the \"developing\" nations would overtake some of the weaker major countries for the second quarter-final qualification place in each pool \u2013 in Pool A, [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] lost to [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] by only one point, which would otherwise have carried them into the quarter-finals in Ireland's place; similarly in Pool B Fiji lost to [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] by only two points, while [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]], despite missing the knockout stage, put up a good performance in Pool D with two victories, a performance which will be repeated in the next three World Cups. In Pool C, Samoa gave [[England national rugby union team|England]] a fright with an adventurous approach that allowed them to take an early lead, however England overcame the early deficit and won. This match was marked by controversy, as England fielded 16 players at one point during the game.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Rugby+World+Cup+2003%3A+THE+GREAT+ESCAPE+II%3B+England's+double+let-off.-a0109479573 thefreelibrary.com]</ref>\n\nThe big clashes ran mainly to form. [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] came through the pool in second place, after they lost to England, which meant a quarter-final against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]]. [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], however, only beat Ireland by one point to top their pool, while [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] pushed the All Blacks to the wire, after adopting an outgoing style of play with a fringe selection. [[France national rugby union team|France]] beat Scotland to round out the quarter-finals.\n\n===Knockout stage===\nThe quarter-final stage produced the widely predicted set of semi-finalists, although England again made heavy weather of defeating a resurgent Wales. England were widely rated the world's best team, but they struggled, at least in the first half, against a Welsh side full of belief after their game against New Zealand: although England pulled away in the second half after the tactical substitution of Catt for Tindall, a late Welsh try gave the scoreline the respectability that their first-half performance had deserved. France destroyed an Irish side who had gone into the match hopeful of a win, scoring 31 early points to put the game out of reach. In the other quarter-finals, a disappointing South Africa fell to New Zealand and Australia defeated the Scots.\n\nThe first semi-final produced an upset, when Australia defeated the fancied New Zealand to become the first defending champions to reach the following championship final. Unfortunately, it was probably the last match for Australian star [[Ben Darwin]], who injured his neck in a [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]. Although Darwin never played rugby again, the actions of [[Kees Meeuws]] \u2013 who immediately stopped exerting pressure when he heard the call \"neck neck neck\" \u2013 may well have saved his opponent's life and certainly prevented further injury. The match was decided by a [[Stirling Mortlock]] interception try, after a loose pass from highly rated All Blacks fly-half [[Carlos Spencer]]. [[George Gregan]] taunted his opponents in defeat with the comment, \"Four more years boys, four more years\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65xd81cj7pA youtube.com]</ref><ref name=\"Stuff.co.nz_2398842\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-news/opinion/2398842/Cup-won-t-be-empty-for-three-more-years |title=Cup won't be empty for three more years |last=Devlin |first=Martin |date=10 May 2009 |work=[[Sunday News (New Zealand)|Sunday News]] |accessdate=14 September 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe second semi-final saw France face England. The boot of [[Jonny Wilkinson]] was the difference between the two sides, with England coming out victors in torrential rain: although France scored the game's only try after an early English line-out error, they never seriously threatened the English line otherwise. And with handling being difficult in the wet and windy conditions, England's superior forward pressure and territorial control forced France to concede a slew of penalties, of which Wilkinson kicked five, also adding three drop goals (two off his less-favoured right boot) - a remarkable display considering that the swirling winds made accurate kicking as difficult as the rain and mud made passing and running.\n\n===Final===\n{{main|2003 Rugby World Cup Final}}\nThe final between Australia and England was played at Sydney's Stadium Australia in front of a crowd of 82,957. Australia opened the scoring after they decided to run a penalty instead of kicking for touch. [[Lote Tuqiri]] beat England's right wing, [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]], to a high cross-field kick and went over for the first try, but [[Elton Flatley]] was not able to add the conversion.\n\n[[File:England world cup.jpg|thumb|left|Celebrations in [[Trafalgar Square]]]]\n\nThe rest of the half was a tight affair, with England edging in front from applying pressure and Jonny Wilkinson's boot put them up to a 9\u20135 lead after Australian indiscipline gave away several penalties, but were unable to capitalise on their territory. Towards the end of the first half, England stretched their lead further. [[Lawrence Dallaglio]] made a break and popped the ball inside to [[Jonny Wilkinson]], who drew the defence before putting Robinson away in the corner for a try. The conversion was missed, but England went in at half time leading by 14\u20135.\n\nIn the second half Australia tightened their discipline, and solid play forced mistakes from England. The game swung from end to end, with both sides having try-scoring opportunities, but neither able to take them. Australia managed to get points on the board and [[Elton Flatley]] scored two penalties to make the score 14\u201311 to England. In the 79th minute, Australia were putting pressure on England in their half, and Australia were awarded a penalty right before full-time, with the potential to tie the scores. Flatley converted it to make the score 14\u201314 and take the game into an additional 20 minutes' extra time.\n\nEngland opened the scoring in extra time with another Wilkinson penalty, but with two and a half minutes of extra time remaining Australia were awarded another penalty, which Flatley kicked successfully. With 20 seconds left before sudden death, Wilkinson scored a drop goal to win the match and with it the world championship.\n\n===Post-final===\nAfter the final, Australian Prime Minister John Howard was widely criticised for his behaviour during the presentation ceremony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/excruciating-trophy-presentations-20100313-q5b9.html|title=Excruciating trophy presentations|last=Tate|first=Andrew|date=13 March 2010|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> The offhand manner in which he presented the Webb Ellis Cup to the England captain was seen by many as a graceless piece of bad sportsmanship not befitting such a climactic sporting spectacle.\n\nThree days after the final, the World Cup winning England team landed at [[Heathrow Airport]] in the early hours of the morning, emerging from their plane to a huge reception, despite the time.<ref name=BBCSport1>{{cite news |title=England rugby heroes arrive home |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/3232174.stm |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=25 November 2003 |accessdate=7 June 2006 }}</ref> On 8 December, a national day of celebration took place in the form of a massive victory parade in the streets of London.<ref name=\"visa\">{{cite web |title=Visa International Renews Rugby World Cup Partnership |work=corporate.visa.com |url=http://www.corporate.visa.com/md/nr/press269.jsp |accessdate=25 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427071525/http://www.corporate.visa.com/md/nr/press269.jsp |archivedate=27 April 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Pool stage==\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\"\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"|Qualified for the quarter-finals\n|}\n\n===Pool A===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=165|Team\n!width=40|Pld\n!width=40|W\n!width=40|D\n!width=40|L\n!width=40|PF\n!width=40|PA\n!width=40|BP\n!width=40|Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=left|{{Ru|AUS}}\n|4||4||0||0||273||32||2||'''18'''\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=left|{{Ru|IRE}}\n|4||3||0||1||141||56||3||'''15'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{Ru|ARG}}\n|4||2||0||2||140||57||3||'''11'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{Ru|ROM}}\n|4||1||0||3||65||192||1||'''5'''\n|-\n|align=left|{{Ru|NAM}}\n|4||0||0||4||28||310||0||'''0'''\n|}\n\n{{Rugbybox\n|date=10 October 2003\n|home={{Ru-rt|AUS}}\n|score=24\u20138\n|away={{Ru|ARG}}\n|try1=[[Wendell Sailor|Sailor]] 20'<br />[[Joe Roff|Roff]] 74'\n|con1=[[Elton Flatley|Flatley]]\n|pen1=[[Elton Flatley|Flatley]] (4)\n|try2=[[Ignacio Corleto|Corleto]] 72'\n|pen2=[[Manuel Contepomi|M.

She is one of several characters in the film who was introduced in the 1940s in the comic, along with 88 Keyes and Sam Catchem.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1993|p=281}}</ref> Breathless Mahoney also disguises herself in the film as a villain known as \"The Blank\", wearing a mask that makes her appear to have no face.

While Tracy fights to protect the city from evil, Breathless is only concerned with her own future and, like Big Boy Caprice, with her desire to \"own\" the city.\"<ref name=\"Lukinbeal\" /> The song \"More\", which Breathless sings at a nightclub, is symbolic of her plans to own the city, according to writer Steve Swayne. On the surface, it sounds like a song about a flirtatious woman who can never get enough, but Swayne said it in fact symbolizes her secret plan to trap Big Boy Caprice and take over his criminal operation. The fact that Breathless continues to sing the song unabated in the nightclub while Big Boy's men engage in a shootout with the police, due to events Breathless herself put into motion, only further underscore this.<ref name=\"Swayne\">{{cite journal |last1=Swayne |first1=Steve |title=So Much \"More\": The Music of \"Dick Tracy\" (1990) |journal=American Music |date=Spring 2004 |volume=22 |issue=1 |page=60 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3592966?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=breathless&searchText=mahoney&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dbreathless%2Bmahoney%26amp%3Bacc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3Ad26d76fa5aebfbc1c465608314c636ff&seq=11#metadata_info_tab_contents |accessdate=28 February 2020}}</ref> Breathless is portrayed as Dick Tracy's temptress in the film, providing as a stark contrast against his girlfriend Tess Truehart, who represents the more pure and clean-cut choice.<ref name=\"Sandow0525\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Malburne-Wade|2019|p=78}}</ref>\n\nIn the book ''The Encyclopedia of Sexism in American Films'', Meredith M.

However, Malburne-Wade also notes that both Breathless and Tess are \"largely constrained by masculinity and by love\" in the film,<ref name=\"Malburne-Wade79\" /> and that Breathless has little control herself over the direction of her own life, which is instead dictated by the actions of gangsters like Lips Manlis and Big Boy Caprice, the latter of whom is physically abusive toward her.<ref name=\"Malburne-Wade80\">{{Harvnb|Malburne-Wade|2019|p=80}}</ref> She writes: \"The fact that her sexuality is her only bargaining chip \u2013 and one that is as likely to get her beaten as it is to get her kissed \u2013 suggests a brutally patriarchal world.\"<ref name=\"Malburne-Wade80\" /> The only time she holds power over her own destiny is when she disguises herself as a man: The Blank.<ref name=\"Malburne-Wade80\" /> In the book ''Madonna as Postmodern Myth'', Georges-Claude Guilbert writes that in ''Dick Tracy'', Madonna's Breathless Mahoney \"is a bad girl because in a macho world, women in power are disturbing\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=100}}</ref>\n\nGaryn G.

However, on 5 February 2011 a Federal High court declared that Izunaso was the candidate of the party for the senatorial seat since Uzodinma had not been cleared by the PDP's electoral panel headed by Orji Nwafor-Orizu.. The judge ordered the PDP to submit Izunaso's name to the [[Independent National Electoral Commission]] (INEC) as the candidate who had received the most votes among those qualified to run. A Court of Appeal issued a stay of execution on 17 March 2011 while the case was being decided, leaving Uzodinma free to campaign. On 5 April 2011 the Court of Appeal upheld 5 February high court judgement and declared that Uzodinma was not qualified to run and should not present himself as a candidate. Uzodinma appealed this decision at the Supreme Court.\n\nOn 9 April, 2011 elections, Uzodinma received 85,042 votes, ahead of former Imo Governor [[Achike Adenwa]] of the [[Action Congress of Nigeria]] (ACN) with 64,228 votes and Rajis Okpalan Benedicta of the [[All Progressives Grand Alliance]] with 57,110 votes. On 5 May, 2011 the Supreme Court overturned the earlier decisions and declared that Uzodinma was the valid candidate and therefore had been elected. The decision was influenced by the minutes of a 5 January 2011 meeting of the PDP's [[National Working Committee]] that was attached to the April appeal to the Supreme Court. The meeting had overruled Nwafor-Orizu's decision to disqualify Uzodinma and rejected the December 2010 petition, saying \"there was no evidence that Chief Hope Uzodinma has been convicted for murder, armed-robbery, obtaining money by false pretence and or for bankruptcy\".\n\n=== Senate (2011\u20132019) ===\nOn 29 May 2011, Uzodinma was sworn-in as a [[Senate of Nigeria|Senator]] of the [[Nigeria|Federal Republic of Nigeria]], representing [[Imo State]] (West Senatorial District).
