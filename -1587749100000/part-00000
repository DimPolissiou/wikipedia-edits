The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] through its [[Department of Health (Northern Ireland)|Department of Health]] is responsible for its funding, while the '''Public Health Agency''' is the executive agency responsible for the provision of [[public health]] and social care services across Northern Ireland. It is free of charge to all citizens of Northern Ireland and the rest of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nFor services such as [[Emergency department|A&E]], patients simply walk in, state their name and date of birth, are given treatment and then leave. Patients are unaware of costs incurred by them using the service. It is sometimes called the \"[[National Health Service|NHS]]\", as in England, Scotland and Wales, but differs from the NHS in England and Wales in that it provides not only health care but social care too (the NHS in [[Scotland]] also includes social care). Social services are provided by local councils. The Health and Social Care service was created by the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in 1948 after the [[Beveridge Report]].\n\n== Organisation ==\nHospitals in the region were managed by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority and hospital management committees from 1948 to 1974, and then transferred to four health and social services boards, along with responsibility for social care.  The pattern of local government in the region was of 26 single-tier local authorities which, apart from [[Belfast]], covered small populations ranging from 13,000 to 90,000 and were not considered an adequate base for the provision of personal social services.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS|date=1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0 10 176150 3|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-16-2/|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2009/1/contents |title=Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009 |format= |work= |accessdate=10 June 2016}}</ref> led to a reorganisation of health and social care delivery in [[Northern Ireland]], reducing the number of organisations involved. This Act established the [[Health and Social Care Board]] and five Health and Social Care Trusts which are responsible for the delivery of primary, secondary and community health care. The act also established five local commissioning groups which work in parallel with the health and social care trusts.\n\nThe Department of Health is now organised under a [[Permanent Secretary]] into several groups and one agency. These are the Planning and Resources Group, Strategic Planning and Modernisation Group and Primary, Secondary and Community Care Group and the five professional groups. The department's executive agency responsible for the oversight, coordination and overall provision of health and social care services is the Public Health Agency.<ref>[http://www.publichealth.hscni.net Public Health Service home page].

It is difficult to get resources out of acute care without closing buildings, which is a political problem particularly in rural areas. Information technology systems may not be compatible and patient confidentiality hinders the sharing of information. Health services are free but social care is means tested.

The [[Northern Ireland Executive]] through its [[Department of Health (Northern Ireland)|Department of Health]] is responsible for its funding, while the '''Public Health Agency''' is the executive agency responsible for the provision of [[public health]] and social care services across Northern Ireland. It is free of charge to all citizens of Northern Ireland and the rest of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nFor services such as [[Emergency department|A&E]], patients simply walk in, state their name and date of birth, are given treatment and then leave. Patients are unaware of costs incurred by them using the service. It is sometimes called the \"[[National Health Service|NHS]]\", as in England, Scotland and Wales, but differs from the NHS in England and Wales in that it provides not only health care but social care too (the NHS in [[Scotland]] also includes social care). Social services are provided by local councils. The Health and Social Care service was created by the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in 1948 after the [[Beveridge Report]].\n\n== Organisation ==\nHospitals in the region were managed by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority and hospital management committees from 1948 to 1974, and then transferred to four health and social services boards, along with responsibility for social care.  The pattern of local government in the region was of 26 single-tier local authorities which, apart from [[Belfast]], covered small populations ranging from 13,000 to 90,000 and were not considered an adequate base for the provision of personal social services.<ref>{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS|date=1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0 10 176150 3|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-16-2/|accessdate=12 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nia/2009/1/contents |title=Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009 |format= |work= |accessdate=10 June 2016}}</ref> led to a reorganisation of health and social care delivery in [[Northern Ireland]], reducing the number of organisations involved. This Act established the [[Health and Social Care Board]] and five Health and Social Care Trusts which are responsible for the delivery of primary, secondary and community health care. The act also established five local commissioning groups which work in parallel with the health and social care trusts.\n\nThe Department of Health is now organised under a [[Permanent Secretary]] into several groups and one agency. These are the Planning and Resources Group, Strategic Planning and Modernisation Group and Primary, Secondary and Community Care Group and the five professional groups. The department's executive agency responsible for the oversight, coordination and overall provision of health and social care services is the Public Health Agency.<ref>[http://www.publichealth.hscni.net Public Health Service home page].

Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Mexicans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Outlaw (stock character)#American Western|outlaws]], [[gambling|gamblers]], soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk).

Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]</ref> \n\nClassic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.\n\n[[File:The Great Train Robbery (1903) - yt.webm|alt=|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903)]]\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.

Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

''[[Call of Juarez: The Cartel]]'' is an example of a Neo-Western video game. Likewise, the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', which takes place in modern times, features many examples of Western archetypes. According to creator [[Vince Gilligan]], \"After the first ''Breaking Bad'' episode, it started to dawn on me that we could be making a contemporary western.

Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|title=Quick Gun Murugan: Channel V comes up with funny, irreverent and slightly crazy film|last=November 30|first=AMIT AGARWAL|last2=October 15|first2=1999 ISSUE DATE|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15|last3=July 24|first3=1994UPDATED|last4=Ist|first4=2013 12:00|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403110409/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|archive-date=2019-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil. [[Laal Kaptaan]] (2019) is an Indo western starring [[Saif Ali Khan]] which is set during of rise of [[British Empire]] in India.\n\n====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]].

It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html|title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2015-12-13|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.<ref>Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland & Company, 1995)</ref> Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955-1962), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).

(editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''</ref> Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]].

American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]</ref> \n\nClassic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.\n\n[[File:The Great Train Robbery (1903) - yt.webm|alt=|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903)]]\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.

Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining [[B Westerns]]. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

''[[Call of Juarez: The Cartel]]'' is an example of a Neo-Western video game. Likewise, the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', which takes place in modern times, features many examples of Western archetypes. According to creator [[Vince Gilligan]], \"After the first ''Breaking Bad'' episode, it started to dawn on me that we could be making a contemporary western.

Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|title=Quick Gun Murugan: Channel V comes up with funny, irreverent and slightly crazy film|last=November 30|first=AMIT AGARWAL|last2=October 15|first2=1999 ISSUE DATE|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15|last3=July 24|first3=1994UPDATED|last4=Ist|first4=2013 12:00|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403110409/https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/society-the-arts/story/19941015-channel-v-film-funny-irreverent-and-slightly-crazy-809809-1999-11-30|archive-date=2019-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil. [[Laal Kaptaan]] (2019) is an Indo western starring [[Saif Ali Khan]] which is set during of rise of [[British Empire]] in India.\n\n====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]].

It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/cover_story/2015/12/star_wars_is_a_pastiche_how_george_lucas_combined_flash_gordon_westerns.html|title=Star Wars Is a Postmodern Masterpiece|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|date=2015-12-13|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-14|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.<ref>Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland & Company, 1995)</ref> Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955-1962), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).

(editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''</ref> Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]]. Originally aired on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] network from 2012 to 2014 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] in 2015 until the show's conclusion in 2017. \n\n[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|\"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared.

American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

The iron balustrade and stanchion marks the south-west corner of the roof terrace.]]\nKnown as ''The Artist's Cottage'', Charles Rennie Mackintosh's ''An Artist's Cottage and Studio'' was built in the village of Farr by [[Inverness]] on an area of land to the south west of Achnabechan.\nThe building consists of a two-storey cube with a single-storey wing enclosing a 'secret' walled garden. Excluding the east wing gable, all external walls have a 1.5 degree batter (incline on the outer face of the built wall). The plan footprint covers 230 square metres accommodating five en-suite bedrooms, a north-lit studio occupying half the first floor, a large roof terrace and public rooms appropriate for the scale of the building.

Exterior elements too, such as the artist blacksmith-work for the studio balcony and roof terrace, were fabricated to Mackintosh's specifications for other buildings, and applied to his elevations of vertical chimney stacks set against battered walls punctured by deeply pierced openings (illus). The sculptural form of the completed building has been compared to some of Mackintosh's contemporary and later drawings and watercolours, such as ''The Castle, Holy Island, 1901'' and ''Le Fort Maillert, 1927''.<ref name=\"nic\">Macintyre, Robert Hamilton (Spring 1992). \"An Artist's Cottage and Studio\".

Coincidentally, MacMillan was consultant for another Charles Rennie Mackintosh design, ''The House for an Art Lover'' (1902), presently under construction at [[Bellahouston Park]], Glasgow, a project initiated by Glasgow civil engineer, Graham Roxburgh. Macintyre, who studied at the [[Mackintosh School of Architecture]], Glasgow School of Art (and began his career in the Glasgow offices of ''Keppie, Henderson and Partners'', the successors to Mackintosh's practice), later worked for ''Gillespie, Kidd and Coia'' alongside Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein.\n\nThe Artist's Cottage was completed in 1992 to some considerable interest, with articles published by the CRM Society,<ref name=\"nic\" /> [[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]<ref>Hall, Michael (26 November 1992). \"The Artist's Cottage, Inverness\".

In France, the \u00c9cole Royale du G\u00e9nie at [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]] was founded in 1748, followed by a non-technical academy in 1751, the [[\u00c9cole Militaire|\u00c9cole Royale Militaire]] offering a general military education to the nobility. French military academies were widely copied in [[Prussia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and even minor powers, including [[Turin]] and the [[Kingdom of Savoy]], in the late 18th century.\n\nBy the turn of the century, under the impetus of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the strain that the armies of Europe subsequently came under, military academies for the training of commissioned officers of the army were set up in most of the combatant nations. These military schools had two functions: to provide instruction for serving officers in the functions of the efficient staff-officer, and to school youngsters before they gained an officer's commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usafa.edu/df/dfh/docs/Harmon22.pdf|title=Perspectives in the History of Military Education and Professionalism|author=Richard A Harmon}}</ref> The [[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]] in Prussia was founded in 1801 and the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] was created by order of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as a replacement for the \u00c9cole Royale Militaire of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] (the institution that Napoleon himself had graduated from).\n\nThe [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in England was the brainchild of [[John Le Marchant (British Army cavalry officer)|John Le Marchant]] in 1801,<ref>[https://da.mod.uk/colleges/jscsc/jscsc-library/artwork/major-general-john-gaspard-le-marchant-1766-1812 Major-General John Gaspard Le Marchant (1766-1812)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323125835/http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/jscsc/jscsc-library/artwork/major-general-john-gaspard-le-marchant-1766-1812 |date=2012-03-23 }} Defence Academy</ref> who established schools for the military instruction of officers at [[High Wycombe]] and [[Great Marlow]], with a grant of \u00a330,000 from [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

West Point rose to prominence after the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846-1848). Notable alumni include astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]], American presidents [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Dwight D.

Patton]].\n\n==Types==\n===Pre-collegiate institutions===\n{{See also|Military high school}}\nA military school teaches children of various ages (elementary school, [[middle school]] or high school) in a military environment which includes training in military aspects, such as drill. Many military schools are also [[boarding school]]s, and others are simply [[magnet school]]s in a larger school system. Many are privately run institutions, though some are public and are run either by a public school system (such as the [[Chicago Public Schools]]) or by a state.\n\nA common misconception results because some states have chosen to house their juvenile criminal populations in higher-security boarding schools that are run in a manner similar to military boarding schools. These are also called [[reform school]]s, and are functionally a combination of school and prison. They attempt to emulate the environment of military boarding schools in the belief that a strict structured environment can reform these children. This may or may not be true. However, their environment and target population are different from those of military schools.<ref>Linton Hall Cadet, Linton Hall Military School Memories: One cadet's memoir, Arlington, Virginia.: Scrounge Press, 2014 {{ISBN|978-1-4959-3196-3}} describes a military school for boys ages 6-16.</ref>\n\nPopular culture sometimes shows parents sending or threatening to send unruly children off to military school (or [[boarding school]]) to teach them good behavior (e.g. in the \"[[Army of One (The Sopranos)|Army of One]]\" episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] and [[Carmela Soprano]] consider sending their son, [[AJ Soprano|AJ]], to the Hudson Military Institute; a similar situation appears in ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]''), while other fictional depictions don't show military academies as threats or punishment (e.g. ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'' and ''[[The Presidio]]'').\n\n===Adult institutions===\nA college-level '''military academy''' is an institute of higher learning of things military. It is part of a larger system of [[military education and training]] institutions. The primary educational goal at military academies is to provide a high quality education that includes significant coursework and training in the fields of [[military tactics]] and [[military strategy]]. The amount of non-military coursework varies by both the institution and the country, and the amount of practical military experience gained varies as well.\n\nMilitary academies may or may not grant university degrees.  In the U.S., graduates have a major field of study, earning a [[Bachelor's degree]] in that subject just as at other universities.  However, in British academies, the graduate does not achieve a university degree, since the whole of the one-year course (nowadays undertaken mainly but not exclusively by university graduates) is dedicated to military training.\n\nThere are two types of military academies: national (government-run) and state/private-run.\n*Graduates from national academies are typically commissioned as officers in the country's military. The new officers usually have an obligation to serve for a certain number of years. In some countries (e.g. Britain) all military officers train at the appropriate academy, whereas in others (e.g. the United States) only a percentage do and the service academies are seen as institutions which supply service-specific officers within the forces (about 15 percent of US military officers).\n*State or private-run academy graduates have no requirement to join the military after graduation, although some schools have a high rate of graduate military service. Today, most of these schools have ventured away from their military roots and now enroll both military and civilian students. The only exception in the United States is the [[Virginia Military Institute]] which remains all-military.\n\n==List of military academies by countries==\n===Afghanistan===\n[[File:Cornerstone Laying ceremony of the National Military Academy of Afghanistan (4496292883).jpg|thumb|Cadets of the [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]] stand in formation awaiting dignitaries.

The only true military academy is the ''F\u00fchrungsakademie der Bundeswehr'' where mainly future staff officers and general staff officers are further trained.\n\nThe standard education in military leadership is the task of the ''Offizierschulen'' (officers' schools) run by the three branches.

There they also have to pass an officer exam to become commissioned later on.\n\nMoreover, there exist so called ''Waffenschulen'' (school of weapons) like infantry school or artillery school. There the officers learn to deal with the typical tasks of their respective corps.\n\nA specialty of the German concept of officer formation is the academic education. Germany runs two ''[[University of the German Federal Armed Forces|Universities of the German Federal Armed Forces]]'' where almost every future officer has to pass non-military studies and achieve a bachelor's or master's degree.

The Indonesian Naval Academy also educates and forms officers to serve in the [[Indonesian Marine Corps]]. In existence since 1951. \n* ''[[Indonesian Air Force Academy]]'' \u2013 \"A.A.U.\" (''Akademi Angkatan Udara'' abbreviated AAU), located in [[Yogyakarta]], is under the supervision of the [[Indonesian Air Force Chief of Staff]]. The academy has three majorings which are: electronics, engineering, and administration. Following graduation, students who are selected as Pilot and Navigator conduct further training in the Pilot and Navigator Flight School prior bearing the Pilot/Navigator designation. Active since 1945, but also inherits the traditions of former Dutch military aviation schools.\n\nEach service academy is headed by a two-star general, and his/her deputy is a one-star officer. All the students (cadets/midshipman) are recruited from senior high school graduates from all over Indonesia. Shortly after graduation, they are commissioned as ''Letnan Dua'' ([[Second Lieutenant]]) in their respective services and get the ''Diploma IV'' (Associate degree, 4th Grade) comparable to civil academies or universities. The length term is now 4 years and is divided into 5 grades of cadet's rank, starting from the lowest:\n\n* ''Prajurit Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet Private), 1st year (4 months)\n* ''Kopral Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet Corporal), 1st year (8 months)\n* ''Sersan Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet Sergeant), 2nd year\n* ''Sersan Mayor Dua Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet Second Sergeant Major), 3rd year\n* ''Sersan Mayor Satu Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet First Sergeant Major), 4th year\n\n''Taruna'' refers to cadets in the Military Academy, ''Kadet'' refers to cadets in the Naval Academy, and ''Karbol'' refers to cadets in the Air Force Academy, respectively.\n\nUntil 1999, before the [[Indonesian National Police]] officially separated from the armed forces, the [[Police academy#Indonesia|Indonesian Police Academy]] (\"AKPOL\") also stood under the National Armed Forces Academy but now has separated from the Military and is under the auspices of the President of Indonesia controlled by the National Police Headquarters (''Mabes Polri''), where in the other hand the Armed Forces (Army, Naval, and Air Force) Academies of Indonesia is under the auspices of the Ministry of Defense controlled by the Armed Forces General Headquarters (''Mabes TNI''). Presently, the Police Academy is located in [[Semarang]] ([[Central Java]]), and is supervised under the supervision of the Chief of Indonesian National Police (''Kapolri'').\n\nAll 3 academies and the Police Academy have a joint 4th class cadet training program since 2008, after completing it the cadets go to their respective academies to continue with the 3 remaining years of study before commissioning.\n\nAs of July 2019, Rear Admiral  Aan Kurnia is the Commanding General, INAF Academy System, with Air Vice Marshal Sri Pulung as the assistant commander. The Academies System was founded on 16 December 1965.\n\n=== Iran ===\n[[Imam Ali Officers' Academy|Imam Ali Officers' University]] ([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u06af\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0641\u0633\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0644\u06cc; [[acronym]]:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parsine.com/fa/news/180156/%25D8%25A7%25D8%25B3%25D9%2585-%25D9%2587%25D8%25A7%25D9%258A-%25D9%2585%25D8%25AE%25D9%2581%25D9%2581-%25D8%25AF%25D8%25B1-%25D9%2586%25D9%258A%25D8%25B1%25D9%2588%25D9%2587%25D8%25A7%25D9%258A-%25D9%2585%25D8%25B3%25D9%2584%25D8%25AD|title=\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0647\u0627\u064a \u0645\u062e\u0641\u0641 \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u064a\u0631\u0648\u0647\u0627\u064a \u0645\u0633\u0644\u062d|website=www.parsine.com|language=fa-IR|access-date=2016-09-11}}</ref> ''\u062f\u0627 \u0627\u0641, D\u0100\u02bfAF), '' formerly known as Officers' School ''([[Persian language|Persian]]: \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634\u06a9\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0641\u0633\u0631\u06cc)'' is the military academy of [[Ground Forces of Islamic Republic of Iran Army]], located in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]].

It was formerly named as the Philippine Constabulary School but was renamed before the 1930s. during the American era, U.S. Army Cavalry Officers established the school for the professionalization of the defunct [[Philippine Constabulary]] enlisted personnel. In 1992, PMA stopped producing constabulary cadets after the creation of the Republic Act 6975 which as a result the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police were officially merged and renamed as The Philippine National Police.

People sponsored under the [[Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme]] will join one of the four Support Units attached to universities participating in DTUS. There is a requirement for bursars of DTUS to join the military for 3 years after completion of their degree, there no requirement for students of any other organisation to join the military after they finish their degree programs; and the great majority have no further contact with the armed forces.

It may also mean a [[middle school]], high school, or college, whether public or private, which instructs its students in military-style education, discipline and tradition.  Students at such civilian institutions can earn a commission in the U.S. military through the successful completion of a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] program along with their college or university's academic coursework.\n\n*The term '''military school''' primarily refers to pre-collegiate [[Military high school|secondary-school-level military institutions]], which were more common before the 1970s and 1980s.\n*The term '''military academy''' commonly refers to a pre-collegiate, collegiate, and post-collegiate institution, especially the U.S. military-run academies.\n* The term '''[[US military staff colleges]]''' refers to separate [[graduate school]]s catering to officers on [[active duty]] .\n\nMost [[U.S. state|state-level]] military academies maintain both a civilian student body and a traditional [[Cadet Corps|corps of cadets]].

In U.S. [[usage]], the [[United States Military Academy]] and the [[United States Naval Academy]] are both [[United States service academies|service academies]].\n\n==History==\nThe first military academies were established in the 18th century to provide future officers for technically specialized corps, such as [[military engineer|engineers]] and [[artillery]], with scientific training.\n\nThe [[Royal Danish Naval Academy]] was set up in 1701, making it the oldest military academy in existence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Danish Naval Academy|url=http://www.fak.dk/om/organisation/Pages/Soev%C3%A6rnetsOfficersskole.aspx|website=Royal Danish Defence College|accessdate=7 January 2016|language=Danish}}</ref>  The [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] was set up in 1741, after a false start in 1720 because of a lack of funds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woolwichcentral.com/location-and-lifestyle/woolwich-history/|title=Woolwich History|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806030832/http://www.woolwichcentral.com/location-and-lifestyle/woolwich-history/|archivedate=2013-08-06}}</ref> as the earliest military academy in Britain. Its original purpose was to train cadets entering the [[Royal Artillery]] and [[Royal Engineers]]. In France, the \u00c9cole Royale du G\u00e9nie at [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res|M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]] was founded in 1748, followed by a non-technical academy in 1751, the [[\u00c9cole Militaire|\u00c9cole Royale Militaire]] offering a general military education to the nobility. French military academies were widely copied in [[Prussia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and even minor powers, including [[Turin]] and the [[Kingdom of Savoy]], in the late 18th century.\n\nBy the turn of the century, under the impetus of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the strain that the armies of Europe subsequently came under, military academies for the training of commissioned officers of the army were set up in most of the combatant nations. These military schools had two functions: to provide instruction for serving officers in the functions of the efficient staff-officer, and to school youngsters before they gained an officer's commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usafa.edu/df/dfh/docs/Harmon22.pdf|title=Perspectives in the History of Military Education and Professionalism|author=Richard A Harmon}}</ref> The [[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]] in Prussia was founded in 1801 and the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] was created by order of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 as a replacement for the \u00c9cole Royale Militaire of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] (the institution that Napoleon himself had graduated from).\n\nThe [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], in England was the brainchild of [[John Le Marchant (British Army cavalry officer)|John Le Marchant]] in 1801,<ref>[https://da.mod.uk/colleges/jscsc/jscsc-library/artwork/major-general-john-gaspard-le-marchant-1766-1812 Major-General John Gaspard Le Marchant (1766-1812)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323125835/http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/jscsc/jscsc-library/artwork/major-general-john-gaspard-le-marchant-1766-1812 |date=2012-03-23 }} Defence Academy</ref> who established schools for the military instruction of officers at [[High Wycombe]] and [[Great Marlow]], with a grant of \u00a330,000 from [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. The two original departments were later combined and moved to Sandhurst.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Military Academy]] (USMA) located in West Point, New York was founded on March 16, 1802 and is one of five [[United States service academies|service academies]] in the nation. West Point rose to prominence after the [[Mexican-American War]] (1846-1848). Notable alumni include astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]], American presidents [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and several American and Confederate generals such as [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], [[Robert E. Lee]], [[Stonewall Jackson]], [[John J. Pershing]], [[Douglas MacArthur]] and [[George S. Patton]].\n\n==Types==\n===Pre-collegiate institutions===\n{{See also|Military high school}}\nA military school teaches children of various ages (elementary school, [[middle school]] or high school) in a military environment which includes training in military aspects, such as drill. Many military schools are also [[boarding school]]s, and others are simply [[magnet school]]s in a larger school system. Many are privately run institutions, though some are public and are run either by a public school system (such as the [[Chicago Public Schools]]) or by a state.\n\nA common misconception results because some states have chosen to house their juvenile criminal populations in higher-security boarding schools that are run in a manner similar to military boarding schools. These are also called [[reform school]]s, and are functionally a combination of school and prison. They attempt to emulate the environment of military boarding schools in the belief that a strict structured environment can reform these children. This may or may not be true. However, their environment and target population are different from those of military schools.<ref>Linton Hall Cadet, Linton Hall Military School Memories: One cadet's memoir, Arlington, Virginia.: Scrounge Press, 2014 {{ISBN|978-1-4959-3196-3}} describes a military school for boys ages 6-16.</ref>\n\nPopular culture sometimes shows parents sending or threatening to send unruly children off to military school (or [[boarding school]]) to teach them good behavior (e.g. in the \"[[Army of One (The Sopranos)|Army of One]]\" episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', [[Tony Soprano|Tony]] and [[Carmela Soprano]] consider sending their son, [[AJ Soprano|AJ]], to the Hudson Military Institute; a similar situation appears in ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]''), while other fictional depictions don't show military academies as threats or punishment (e.g. ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'' and ''[[The Presidio]]'').\n\n===Adult institutions===\nA college-level '''military academy''' is an institute of higher learning of things military. It is part of a larger system of [[military education and training]] institutions. The primary educational goal at military academies is to provide a high quality education that includes significant coursework and training in the fields of [[military tactics]] and [[military strategy]]. The amount of non-military coursework varies by both the institution and the country, and the amount of practical military experience gained varies as well.\n\nMilitary academies may or may not grant university degrees.  In the U.S., graduates have a major field of study, earning a [[Bachelor's degree]] in that subject just as at other universities.  However, in British academies, the graduate does not achieve a university degree, since the whole of the one-year course (nowadays undertaken mainly but not exclusively by university graduates) is dedicated to military training.\n\nThere are two types of military academies: national (government-run) and state/private-run.\n*Graduates from national academies are typically commissioned as officers in the country's military. The new officers usually have an obligation to serve for a certain number of years. In some countries (e.g. Britain) all military officers train at the appropriate academy, whereas in others (e.g. the United States) only a percentage do and the service academies are seen as institutions which supply service-specific officers within the forces (about 15 percent of US military officers).\n*State or private-run academy graduates have no requirement to join the military after graduation, although some schools have a high rate of graduate military service. Today, most of these schools have ventured away from their military roots and now enroll both military and civilian students. The only exception in the United States is the [[Virginia Military Institute]] which remains all-military.\n\n==List of military academies by countries==\n===Afghanistan===\n[[File:Cornerstone Laying ceremony of the National Military Academy of Afghanistan (4496292883).jpg|thumb|Cadets of the [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]] stand in formation awaiting dignitaries.

Establishment of the military school was very important for the identity of a new democratic nation-state. The school was abolished after Soviet occupation of Georgia in 1921.\n\n\"Davit Aghmashenebeli National Defense Academy of Georgia\" was founded on May 28, 1993. The length of studies at the Academy had been defined for 4 years. In 2005, due to the need of the growth of the personnel strength of the Georgian Armed Forces (GAF), the system of the Academy has been transformed to retain only the 18-month-long officer training courses. A bachelor's degree has been defined as a prerequisite for the admission of the cadets.\n\n'''In 2010''', the NDA has undergone a new wave of the reforms to include entire officer education system. As a result, in 2011, Cadet Bachelor School, Junior Officer Basic School, Aviation and Air Defense Officer Basic School, Medical Officer School, Captain Career School, Command and General Staff School, School of Advance Defense Studies and Language Training School were included within the NDA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eta.mod.gov.ge/index.php?page=home&lang=1|title=\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10d7\u10d0\u10d5\u10d3\u10d0\u10ea\u10d5\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10e0\u10dd|website=eta.mod.gov.ge}}</ref>\n\nUpon entry into NDA, cadets sign a contract with the MoD for 10 years of military service, of which 4 years are dedicated to studies and 6 years&nbsp;\u2013 to consequent military service.

It provides post-secondary education to military personnel and civilians.]]\n\nGermany has a unique system for civil and military education. The only true military academy is the ''F\u00fchrungsakademie der Bundeswehr'' where mainly future staff officers and general staff officers are further trained.\n\nThe standard education in military leadership is the task of the ''Offizierschulen'' (officers' schools) run by the three branches. The contents differ from branch to branch. In the army all officers are at least trained to lead a platoon. There they also have to pass an officer exam to become commissioned later on.\n\nMoreover, there exist so called ''Waffenschulen'' (school of weapons) like infantry school or artillery school. There the officers learn to deal with the typical tasks of their respective corps.\n\nA specialty of the German concept of officer formation is the academic education. Germany runs two ''[[University of the German Federal Armed Forces|Universities of the German Federal Armed Forces]]'' where almost every future officer has to pass non-military studies and achieve a bachelor's or master's degree. During their studies (after at least three years of service) the candidates become commissioned ''Leutnant'' (second lieutenant).\n\nThe three officer's schools are:\n\n* The [[German Navy]] supervises:\n** [[Naval Academy at M\u00fcrwik]], located in [[Flensburg]]-[[M\u00fcrwik]]\n* The [[German Army]] supervises:\n** ''Offizierschule des Heeres'', located in [[Dresden]]\n* The [[German Air Force]] supervises:\n** ''Offizierschule der Luftwaffe'', located in [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck]]\n\nAcademic and [[Staff (military)|staff]] education:\n\n* [[University of the German Federal Armed Forces|Universities of the German Federal Armed Forces]]\n** [[Helmut Schmidt University]], located in [[Hamburg]]\n** [[Bundeswehr University Munich]], located in [[Munich]]\n* [[F\u00fchrungsakademie der Bundeswehr]], located in Hamburg\n\n===Greece===\n[[File:20081004-Piraeus-HNA A233-0033.jpg|thumb|A [[sloop]] of the [[Hellenic Naval Academy]] sails past with a crew of naval cadet officers.

In existence since 1951. \n* ''[[Indonesian Air Force Academy]]'' \u2013 \"A.A.U.\" (''Akademi Angkatan Udara'' abbreviated AAU), located in [[Yogyakarta]], is under the supervision of the [[Indonesian Air Force Chief of Staff]]. The academy has three majorings which are: electronics, engineering, and administration. Following graduation, students who are selected as Pilot and Navigator conduct further training in the Pilot and Navigator Flight School prior bearing the Pilot/Navigator designation. Active since 1945, but also inherits the traditions of former Dutch military aviation schools.\n\nEach service academy is headed by a two-star general, and his/her deputy is a one-star officer. All the students (cadets/midshipman) are recruited from senior high school graduates from all over Indonesia. Shortly after graduation, they are commissioned as ''Letnan Dua'' ([[Second Lieutenant]]) in their respective services and get the ''Diploma IV'' (Associate degree, 4th Grade) comparable to civil academies or universities. The length term is now 4 years and is divided into 5 grades of cadet's rank, starting from the lowest:\n\n* ''Prajurit Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet Private), 1st year (4 months)\n* ''Kopral Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet Corporal), 1st year (8 months)\n* ''Sersan Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet Sergeant), 2nd year\n* ''Sersan Mayor Dua Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet Second Sergeant Major), 3rd year\n* ''Sersan Mayor Satu Taruna/Kadet/Karbol'' (Cadet First Sergeant Major), 4th year\n\n''Taruna'' refers to cadets in the Military Academy, ''Kadet'' refers to cadets in the Naval Academy, and ''Karbol'' refers to cadets in the Air Force Academy, respectively.\n\nUntil 1999, before the [[Indonesian National Police]] officially separated from the armed forces, the [[Police academy#Indonesia|Indonesian Police Academy]] (\"AKPOL\") also stood under the National Armed Forces Academy but now has separated from the Military and is under the auspices of the President of Indonesia controlled by the National Police Headquarters (''Mabes Polri''), where in the other hand the Armed Forces (Army, Naval, and Air Force) Academies of Indonesia is under the auspices of the Ministry of Defense controlled by the Armed Forces General Headquarters (''Mabes TNI''). Presently, the Police Academy is located in [[Semarang]] ([[Central Java]]), and is supervised under the supervision of the Chief of Indonesian National Police (''Kapolri'').\n\nAll 3 academies and the Police Academy have a joint 4th class cadet training program since 2008, after completing it the cadets go to their respective academies to continue with the 3 remaining years of study before commissioning.\n\nAs of July 2019, Rear Admiral  Aan Kurnia is the Commanding General, INAF Academy System, with Air Vice Marshal Sri Pulung as the assistant commander.

People sponsored under the [[Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme]] will join one of the four Support Units attached to universities participating in DTUS.

It may also mean a [[middle school]], high school, or college, whether public or private, which instructs its students in military-style education, discipline and tradition.  Students at such civilian institutions can earn a commission in the U.S. military through the successful completion of a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] program along with their college or university's academic coursework.\n\n*The term '''military school''' primarily refers to pre-collegiate [[Military high school|secondary-school-level military institutions]], which were more common before the 1970s and 1980s.\n*The term '''military academy''' commonly refers to a pre-collegiate, collegiate, and post-collegiate institution, especially the U.S. military-run academies.\n* The term '''[[US military staff colleges]]''' refers to separate [[graduate school]]s catering to officers on [[active duty]] .\n\nMost [[U.S. state|state-level]] military academies maintain both a civilian student body and a traditional [[Cadet Corps|corps of cadets]].

Jurisdictions that regulate access to firearms typically restrict access to only certain categories of firearms and then to restrict the categories of persons who will be granted a license to have access to a firearm. In some countries such as the United States, gun control may be legislated at either a federal level or a local state level.\nTerminology and context   \n[[File:Clothes.jpg|thumb|[[History of clothing and textiles|Clothing in history]], showing (from top) Egyptians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Franks, and 13th through 15th century Europeans.]]\n[[File:KangaSiyu1.jpg|thumb|A [[kanga (African garment)|kanga]], worn throughout the [[African Great Lakes]] region.]]\n\n'''Clothing''' (also known as '''clothes''', '''apparel''' and '''attire''') is items worn on the body. Clothing is typically made of fabrics or [[textile]]s but over time has included garments made from [[animal skin]] or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.\n\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].\n\nWearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]]. In most parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be considered [[indecent exposure]].\n\n== Origin of clothing ==\n{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000. No single estimate is widely accepted.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser & Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414\u20131417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|title=Molecular Evolution of Pediculus humanus and the Origin of Clothing|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=24|page=2309|year=2004|last1=Kittler|first1=Ralf|last2=Kayser|first2=Manfred|last3=Stoneking|first3=Mark|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toups |first1=Melissa A. |display-authors=et al |title=Origin of Clothing Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use by Anatomically Modern Humans in Africa |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq234 |pmid=20823373 |pmc=3002236 |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=January 2011 |pages=29\u201332}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Reed\n|first=David\n|display-authors=et al.\n|title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: The evolutionary history of Anthropoid primate lice\n|journal=BMC Biology\n|year=2007\n|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-7\n|pmid=17343749\n|volume=5 |issue=7\n|pages=7\n|pmc=1828715\n}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Well-clothed baby.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|A [[Infant|baby]] wearing many items of [[winter]] clothing: [[headband]], [[cap]], fur-lined [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], [[scarf]] and [[sweater]].]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Black Boater Hat, Floral Print Dress, and Bronze Sandals (17250719875) (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = Polka Dot Sleeveless Top, Maroon H&M Skater Skirt, Cutout Ankle Boots, and a Black Lace Purse (22061303870).jpg\n| image3 = Strapless Polka Dot Peplum Romper, White Sandals, and a Tan Straw Hat (19335873624).jpg\n| image4 = Green Scalloped Shorts, Baby Blue Top, and White Sandals (17396821965) (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Four types of women's clothing which end above the knees: (clockwise from top) [[minidress]], [[miniskirt]], [[shorts]] and [[romper]], all worn by the same model.\n}}\nThe most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the elements. In hot weather, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage. In the cold it offers [[thermal insulation]]. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.\n\nClothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.<ref name=\"Flugel1930\">{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press.

Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\n\nClothing has been made from a very wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and [[fur]]s to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fabrics]]. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing.\n\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances.\n\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider [[fashion]] in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.<ref>Baradel, Lacey. \"Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson\u2019s The Tramp.\" American Art 28.2 (2014): 26\u201349</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.<ref name=\"Jeffreys1858\">e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing  in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C.

The man is in [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] and the woman is wearing a [[gown]].\n</gallery>\n\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\n\nIn Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for women. Men are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\n\nIn some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as \"modest\" varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].\n\nMen may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\n\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.\n\n===Social status===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|''[[Achkan]]'' [[sherwani]] and ''[[churidar]]'' (lower body) worn by [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] and his kin during a [[Hindu wedding]] in [[Rajasthan, India]].

In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Category:Religious clothing}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes.

Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.\n\nFor example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\n\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in some religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.\n\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\n\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187).\n\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. {{Explain|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Clergy#Christianity|Christian clergy]] members wear religious [[vestments]] during [[liturgy|liturgical]] services and may wear specific [[clerical clothing|non-liturgical clothing]] at other times.\n\n==Origin and history==\n{{Main|History of clothing and textiles}}\n{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}\n\n===Early use===\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body.

Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reed |display-authors=et al | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}</ref> For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\n\n===Making clothing===\n{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Going for Pooja.jpg|alt=Sari|thumb|[[Hindu]] Indian lady wearing [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]\nSome human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].\n\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&nbsp;\u2013 with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&nbsp;\u2013 during the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.\n\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\n\nModern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.\n\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].\n\n==Contemporary clothing==\n{{POV section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Western dress codes}}\n\n=== Western dress code ===\n{{main|Western dress code}}\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of \"stylish\".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.\n\nJeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\n\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\n\n=== Spread of western styles ===\n[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in the US.]]\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===\nPeople may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].\n\n===Sport and activity===\n{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}\n\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track & field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.\n[[File:E1275480 (4315537281).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest trends in clothing [[fashion]]s.

Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.<ref>Simon Bliss, \"'L\u2019intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5\u201326.</ref>  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.<ref>Steven Zdatny,  \"The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].  [[Fashion show]]s are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.\n\n==Political issues==\n\n===Working conditions in the garments industry===\n{{further|Garment industry}}\n[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|Garments factory in [[Bangladesh]].]]\n[[File:Safety garb for women workers.

[[Mass-produced]] clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in [[developing countries]], clothes made in [[industrialized nation]]s may also be manufactured similarly.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nCoalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.\n\n[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labour Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nDespite the strong reactions that \"sweatshops\" evoked among [[Anti-globalization movement|critics of globalization]]{{which|date=March 2020}}, the [[textile industry|production of textiles]] has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations, providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to millions of people.<ref>European Parliamentary Research Service. \u201cWorkers' Conditions in the Textile and Clothing Sector: Just an Asian Affair?\u201d ''European Parliment'', Aug. 2014.

It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.\n\n==Life cycle==\n\n===Clothing maintenance===\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).\n\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.\n\nHowever, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).\n\n=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.\n\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\n\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\n\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the [[Black carpet beetle]] and [[Clothing Moth|Clothing moths]]. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cedar-closets/|title=Cedar Closets 101|date=2017-09-08|website=Bob Vila|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as [[Lavandula#Other uses|Lavender]] or [[mothball]]s. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may also deter insect pest damage to clothing materials.\n\n===Non-iron===\n{{main|Permanent press}}\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.<ref>[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.</ref>\n\n===Mending===\n{{see also|Darning}}\nWhen the raw material&nbsp;\u2013 cloth&nbsp;\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.\n\n===Recycling===\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.  Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion<ref>{{cite news|last1=Minter|first1=Adam|title=No One Wants Your Used Clothes Anymore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-15/no-one-wants-your-used-clothes-anymore|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View|Bloomberg View]]|date=15 January 2018}}</ref> with the US as the leading exporter at $575 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Banigan|first1=Melissa|title=East Africa Doesn't Want Your Hand-Me-Downs|url=https://www.racked.com/2018/1/25/16923226/east-africa-used-clothing-ban|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=Racked|publisher=[[Vox Media#Racked|Vox Media]]|date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are many concerns about the life cycle of synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals.{{Weasel inline|date=September 2009}} Unlike natural fibers, their source is not renewable and they are not biodegradable.<ref>[http://sweatshirtstation.com/articles/the-textile-materials-eco-battle-between-natural-and-synthetic-fabrics/ The Textile Materials Eco Battle Between Natural and Synthetic Fabrics] \"Steven E.

Clothing is typically made of fabrics or [[textile]]s but over time has included garments made from [[animal skin]] or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.\n\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].\n\nWearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]]. In most parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be considered [[indecent exposure]].\n\n== Origin of clothing ==\n{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000.

In hot weather, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage. In the cold it offers [[thermal insulation]]. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.\n\nClothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.<ref name=\"Flugel1930\">{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press.

Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\n\nClothing has been made from a very wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and [[fur]]s to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fabrics]]. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing.\n\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances.\n\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider [[fashion]] in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.<ref>Baradel, Lacey. \"Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson\u2019s The Tramp.\" American Art 28.2 (2014): 26\u201349</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.<ref name=\"Jeffreys1858\">e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing  in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C.

The man is in [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] and the woman is wearing a [[gown]].\n</gallery>\n\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\n\nIn Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for women. Men are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\n\nIn some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as \"modest\" varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].\n\nMen may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\n\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.\n\n===Social status===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|''[[Achkan]]'' [[sherwani]] and ''[[churidar]]'' (lower body) worn by [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] and his kin during a [[Hindu wedding]] in [[Rajasthan, India]].

In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Category:Religious clothing}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes.

Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.\n\nFor example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\n\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in some religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.\n\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\n\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187).\n\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. {{Explain|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Clergy#Christianity|Christian clergy]] members wear religious [[vestments]] during [[liturgy|liturgical]] services and may wear specific [[clerical clothing|non-liturgical clothing]] at other times.\n\n==Origin and history==\n{{Main|History of clothing and textiles}}\n{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}\n\n===Early use===\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts.

Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reed |display-authors=et al | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}</ref> For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\n\n===Making clothing===\n{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Going for Pooja.jpg|alt=Sari|thumb|[[Hindu]] Indian lady wearing [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]\nSome human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].\n\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&nbsp;\u2013 with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&nbsp;\u2013 during the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.\n\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\n\nModern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.\n\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].\n\n==Contemporary clothing==\n{{POV section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Western dress codes}}\n\n=== Western dress code ===\n{{main|Western dress code}}\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of \"stylish\".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.\n\nJeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\n\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\n\n=== Spread of western styles ===\n[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in the US.]]\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===\nPeople may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].\n\n===Sport and activity===\n{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}\n\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track & field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.\n[[File:E1275480 (4315537281).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest trends in clothing [[fashion]]s.

Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.<ref>Simon Bliss, \"'L\u2019intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5\u201326.</ref>  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.<ref>Steven Zdatny,  \"The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].

It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.\n\n==Life cycle==\n\n===Clothing maintenance===\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).\n\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.\n\nHowever, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).\n\n=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.\n\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\n\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\n\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the [[Black carpet beetle]] and [[Clothing Moth|Clothing moths]]. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cedar-closets/|title=Cedar Closets 101|date=2017-09-08|website=Bob Vila|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as [[Lavandula#Other uses|Lavender]] or [[mothball]]s. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may also deter insect pest damage to clothing materials.\n\n===Non-iron===\n{{main|Permanent press}}\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.<ref>[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.</ref>\n\n===Mending===\n{{see also|Darning}}\nWhen the raw material&nbsp;\u2013 cloth&nbsp;\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.\n\n===Recycling===\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.  Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion<ref>{{cite news|last1=Minter|first1=Adam|title=No One Wants Your Used Clothes Anymore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-15/no-one-wants-your-used-clothes-anymore|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View|Bloomberg View]]|date=15 January 2018}}</ref> with the US as the leading exporter at $575 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Banigan|first1=Melissa|title=East Africa Doesn't Want Your Hand-Me-Downs|url=https://www.racked.com/2018/1/25/16923226/east-africa-used-clothing-ban|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=Racked|publisher=[[Vox Media#Racked|Vox Media]]|date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are many concerns about the life cycle of synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals.{{Weasel inline|date=September 2009}} Unlike natural fibers, their source is not renewable and they are not biodegradable.<ref>[http://sweatshirtstation.com/articles/the-textile-materials-eco-battle-between-natural-and-synthetic-fabrics/ The Textile Materials Eco Battle Between Natural and Synthetic Fabrics] \"Steven E.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight [[Story arc|story arcs]], each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 127 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 2020.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a [[vampire]]. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}.

Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight [[Story arc|story arcs]], each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 127 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 2020.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

In the early 13th century, as various peoples fled from the advancing [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] onslaught, the highlands were once again disturbed by the migrations of the [[Karluks|Karluk]] and [[Khwarazm|Kharizmian]] peoples. The Mongols, who did not distinguish between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], reached the highlands in 1235. With their arrival, Armenia became part of \"the East\" in its entirety for the first time since the territory was partitioned during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars]]. Considered the successors of the [[Abbasids]], [[Sassanids]]s and Seljuks, the Mongols eventually converted to Islam and established their dynasty in [[Azerbaijan]].<ref name=gomidas />\n\nIn 1410 the area was ruled by [[Kara Koyunlu]] who ruled until 1468. The [[pastoral]] culture of the Kara Koyunlu Turks undermined agricultural practices in Armenia. In 1468, the [[Ak Koyunlu]] Turks assumed power; their reign lasted until 1502 when the [[Safavids]] place Armenia under Iranian rule. The [[Ottoman Turks]] don't take control of the highland region until 1514, several decades after Armenians in the [[Ottoman Empire]] are given ''[[millet]]'' status. The highlands come under Ottoman control following the defeat of the Safavids at the [[Battle of Chalderon]]; they appointed [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] tribesman to rule over the highlands' local administrative affairs.
