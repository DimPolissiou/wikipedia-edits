The soundtrack is one of only two Bond soundtracks to be nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]. The other score nominated was ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012).\n\n==Theme song==\nThe theme song \"[[Nobody Does It Better]]\" was composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] with lyrics by [[Carole Bayer Sager]] and was performed by [[Carly Simon]]. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] but lost to \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\".  It was one of five Bond theme songs to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. The other four were \"[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]\" in 1973, \"[[For Your Eyes Only (song)|For Your Eyes Only]]\" in 1981, \"[[Skyfall (Adele song)|Skyfall]]\", and \"[[Writing's on the Wall (Sam Smith song)|Writing on the Wall]]\". \"Skyfall\" went on to win the award in 2013 and \"Writing on the Wall\" won in 2016.\n\nIt was the first theme song with a title different from the film's, although the phrase \"the spy who loved me\" is in the lyrics. Hamlisch states in the documentary on the film's DVD that the song's opening bars were influenced by a riff in a [[Mozart]] tune. The driving disco rhythm to \"Bond '77\" is very similar to the [[Bee Gees]]' 1976 single \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\".\n\nThe theme song became a hit that is still popular today and has been featured in numerous films including ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]), ''[[Little Black Book]]'' ([[2004 in film|2004]]), ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' and ''[[Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)|Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason]]'' (2004). In 2004, the song was honoured by the [[American Film Institute]] as the 67th greatest film song as part of their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs|100 Years...100 Songs]] countdown.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]], who filled in for usual Bond composer [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], as Barry was unavailable for work in the [[United Kingdom]] due to tax reasons. The soundtrack, in comparison to other Bond films of the time, is more [[disco]]-oriented and included a new disco rendition of the \"[[James Bond Theme]]\", titled \"Bond 77\" which Hamlisch admitted was somewhat influenced by \"[[You Should Be Dancing]]\" by [[The Bee Gees]] <ref>[http://marvinhamlisch.us/reviews/film-the-spy-who-loved-me-1977/]</ref>\n\nAn element of the Barry style remains in the suspenseful film sequence in which Bond and Amasova try to track down Jaws at an antiquated site in Egypt. The accompanying Hamlisch music echoes Barry's \"Stalking,\" from the pre-credit fantasy sequence of ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'', featuring Bond ([[Sean Connery]]) and villain Red Grant ([[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]]).\n\nA large percentage of the music in the film was re-recorded for the soundtrack album and, therefore, does not sound exactly like the music in the film, the track \"Bond '77\" being the most obvious. It is a cue that was recorded several times specifically for different moments of the film (the opening ski chase, the car chase on land, then underwater and the gun battle with the troops on the Liparus). The soundtrack album uses a different 'medley' version, slower in pace, which features aspects of most of the variations of the track used throughout the film, compiled into one song. This version was also released as a 7\" single on [[United Artists]] records (the track \"Ride to Atlantis\" was the B-Side). The main theme by Simon also differs in the film; it has a fade out on the album/single but in the film's opening titles, it has a more abrupt ending, finishing with a long electronic note. The track \"Anya\" on the album does not feature in the film. There are also many cues used in the film that have yet to appear on any soundtrack release.\n\nThe \"Bond '77\" recordings featuring in the film are the soundtrack's most disco-influenced part. The [[For Your Eyes Only (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the 1981 Bond film ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' by [[Bill Conti]] is far more disco-oriented, featuring funky guitars, bongos and a lot of electronic synthesizers.\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"[[Nobody Does It Better]] (Main Title)\" \u2013 [[Carly Simon]] \u2013 3:29\n# \"Bond 77\" \u2013 4:19\n# \"Ride to Atlantis\" \u2013 3:28\n# \"Mojave Club\" \u2013 2:13\n# \"Nobody Does It Better (Instrumental)\" \u2013 4:43\n# \"Anya\" \u2013 3:19\n# \"The Tanker\" \u2013 4:24\n# \"The Pyramids\" \u2013 1:37\n# \"Eastern Lights\" \u2013 3:22\n# \"Conclusion\" \u2013 1:37\n# \"Nobody Does It Better (End Title)\" \u2013 Carly Simon \u2013 3:25\n\nIn addition, Hamlisch incorporates into his score several pieces of classical music. As Stromberg feeds his duplicitous secretary to a shark, the villain plays [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s \"[[Air on the G String]]\". He then plays the second movement's opening string section, Andante, of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 21 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 21]] as Atlantis rises from the sea.\n\n\"[[Nocturnes Op. 27|Nocturne No. 8 in D-Flat, Op. 27 No. 2]]\" by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] crops up later, when Bond first meets Stromberg, as reportedly does an excerpt from [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]' \"The Aquarium\" from ''The Carnival of the Animals''.\n\nFinally, Hamlisch cheekily segues his score into an excerpt from that of [[David Lean]]'s 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' when Bond and Anya Amasova are wandering through the desert; according to a documentary on the DVD, this idea was originally a joke by one of the film editors who played the music over the [[dailies]] of the scene.

The Agra-Delhi chord is part of Delhi-Mumbai line and [[Delhi-Chennai line]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[East Indian Railway Company]] initiated efforts to develop a railway line from Howrah to Delhi in the mid nineteenth century.

In the [[1942\u201343 Serbian League|1942\u201343]] season the club finished 4th, a remarkable achievement because they finished in front of several favourites like [[SK Jedinstvo Beograd|Jedinstvo Belgrade]] or [[FK BASK|BASK]].<ref>[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 Miroslav Milovanovi\u0107: \"Na\u0161 Plavi Bukvar\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512115722/http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 |date=12 May 2012 }}, pag. 85</ref>\n\nIn that period there was a popular domestic tournament named ''Letnji Pehar'' (Summer Trophy), where the best clubs competed like [[OFK Beograd|BSK]], [[SK Jugoslavija|SK 1903]], [[FK Obili\u0107|Obili\u0107 Belgrade]] and so also \u010cSK. Finally, the club defeated ''SK Banovac'' in the quarter-finals (2\u20131, 0\u20131), but lost against SK 1903 in the semi-finals (0\u20132, 0\u20132).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 1943\u201344 Belgrade First League season was formed by 10 clubs however after 8 rounds it was interrupted with \u010cSK placed as 6th. By the end of the war the club did not play under its name, only restoring its name in 1948 as FK \u010cukari\u010dki, now part of the \u010cukari\u010dki Sports Association.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /><ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\n===From the subclass to the first league (1944\u20132003)===\n[[File:Milan Dudic.JPG|thumb|Ex-national player [[Milan Dudi\u0107]] started his professional career at \u010cukari\u010dki and played from 1999 to 2002 for the club.]]\nIn 1948, playing in the Belgrade Second League, which was the 6th tier of the newly formed league system of the [[Socialist Yugoslavia]], the club finished 4th. It was coached by Jovan Veselinovi\u0107 and the squad was formed mostly by experienced older players. In 1950\u201351 with an already renovated squad, it finishes third and qualified to the Belgrade First League where it also finished third achieving promotion to the 1953\u201354 Belgrade Podsavezna League, the national fourth tier, where they finished third, again. Led by the coach \u017dikica Spasojevi\u0107 and striker Petar Popovi\u0107 they archived the promotion to the 1954\u201355 Serbian League, the third tier.\n\nIn summer 1955, Vule Radosavljevi\u0107 was made the main coach, however the club ended the first half of the season at bottom. Radosavljevi\u0107 was replaced by Dragomir Kojadinovi\u0107 and there were also changes at club direction board which may have contributed to a comeback with the team finishing the season in 8th place. This earned them participation in the pley-off for the [[Yugoslav Second League]], however they failed to qualify. In 1955\u201356 many players left the club, and led by coach Brana A\u0107imovi\u0107 they finished 2nd in the Belgrade Podsavezna League. 1956 is the year of the beginning of the fall as many important club players retired in that period.\n\nAlso, numerous club directions and coaches succeeded. So, the club played constantly in Belgrade leagues. Great achievement was brought on to the club ten years later in the 1966\u201367 season when they finished first in the Second Belgrade League and won the Belgrade Cup the same year.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> They were promoted to the Serbian League where they were constantly on top.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> So, these seasons, the club competed for promotion to the Yugoslav Second league, which he reached as a champion of the 1971\u201372 season. There, \u010cukari\u010dki held for several years, but did not succeed to promotion to the [[Yugoslav First League]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\nIn the early 1990s, the club played again in the third tier and between 1993 and 1995 in the second league of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> In the 1994\u201395 season, the club managed finally for the first time in its history the promotion to the first league, where they played until 1998.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> In the [[Yugoslav Cup]] in 1995, \u010cukari\u010dki came into the quarterfinals and also competed in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 1996|1996]] and [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 1997|1997]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> Their biggest success during this period came in the 1999\u201300 season, when they finished 6th in the first league, in which 21 teams participated.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The club remained till 2003 in the first division.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\n===From insolvency to privatization (2003\u2013present)===\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0448 \u041d\u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b.jpg|thumb|[[Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107]], here as a player of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], came from the youth school of the club and played three years as professional for \u010cukari\u010dki.]]\nAfter four years in the first league, \u010cukari\u010dki relegate in 2003. Although succeeded in 2004 as champion of the group West the direct re-promotion, the club relegated again in 2005. \u010cukari\u010dki was renamed in the early 2000s, as the Serbian company ''Stankom'' dedicated as the main sponsor and funder. Therefore, the club was known for a long time under the name ''\u010cukari\u010dki Stankom''. By the arrival of Stankom the club was stabilized. So, they improved the organization, increased the stadium capacity to 7,000 and also brought a better financial situation. In 2007, \u010cukari\u010dki finally reached the top division, the [[Serbian SuperLiga]].\n\n[[File:Aleksandar Kolarov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleksandar Kolarov]], here in the jersey of [[Manchester City]], played from 2003 to 2006 for the club and is regarded as the most famous player who ever played for \u010cukari\u010dki.]]\nFrom August 2007 to December 2008 the former [[Bundesliga]] manager [[Dragoslav Stepanovi\u0107]] coached the club. After seven defeats in a row and the time between last place in the 2008\u201309 season, he was relieved of his duties. At the end of the season, the team made the 9th place in the table under coach [[Dejan \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107]] and remained in the league.\n\nThe 2009\u201310 season ended for \u010cukari\u010dki with the 13th place and escaped with three points ahead of [[Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] barely the relegation. This happiness the team should does not have anymore in the 2010\u201311 season. The club could not win a single one of its thirty league matches and finished with just five points on the last place and relegated in the [[Serbian First League]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\nAlso in the Second League, \u010cukari\u010dki was not very successful. With 41 points they were equal on points with [[Banat Zrenjanin]] and [[Radni\u010dki Sombor]]. Because of the direct comparison between all three teams only Radni\u010dki Sombor had to join the 3rd league as 15th of the final table. The club was in a very difficult financial situation and was on the verge of [[bankruptcy]], however, the year 2011 marked a turning point, as the construction and wholesale company ADOC, which operates in the [[pharmacy]], [[diagnostics]] and [[construction industry]], bought up \u010cukari\u010dki and immediately invested in the club, making \u010cukari\u010dki the first professional football club in [[Serbia]], which was privatized, and also one of the few clubs in [[Southeast Europe]], which are privately owned.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka1\" />\n\nThrough the privatization, the financial and organizational situation of the club improved significantly, but also in the infrastructure and the squad has been invested.<ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka1\" /> In the 2012\u201313 season the club then managed the runner-up of the second league and the return to the first league. In the following 2013\u201314 season, the upswing of the club continued, so \u010cukari\u010dki was able to secure a surprising 5th place in the league.\n\n==European record==\n\n===Matches===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-!

[[\u010cukarica]], more precisely in the working-class neighborhood of the Belgrade municipality, which is located on the right bank of the [[Sava|Sava River]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The club was formed on 4 July 1926 during a meeting that took place in a restaurant named ''Majdan'', where the club got its official name, ''\u010cSK''\u2013''\u010cukari\u010dki sport klub'', and the decision was made that the club colors should be black and white, a tradition which is still present.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The first president was Milo\u0161 Ili\u0107, known as the first Serbian aviator respectively combat pilots of the 1st class, and by that time a reservist of the [[Yugoslav Royal Air Force]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The first players of the club were amateurs, which organized the pitch, made their own jerseys and nets.\n\n\u010cSK started in the third league of the Belgrade League system, but in 1928 managed to promoted to the second Belgrade League, where the club was able to keep several seasons.<ref name=\"85 godina\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pageflip-flap.com/read?r=tOqdiQoYQtfej3f5jl|title=85 godina SD Cukaricki_za CIP|access-date=19

1931\u201332, \u010cSK became champion and thus played from the next season in the Belgrad B-League, which they gained finally in 1935.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> So, the club celebrated its first decade of existence with championship success. During this first period of success, especially striker [[Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107 (footballer born 1914)|Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107]], called ''Pikavac'', was one of the most important figures of the club.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> Coming from [[FK Palilulac Beograd|Palilulac Belgrade]] in 1932, he played in \u010cSK until 1936, when he was transferred to [[SK Jugoslavija]], one of the major national clubs.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> As a member of the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav national team]], he is remembered as one of the best dribblers of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\nIn 1936, \u010cSK entered to the [[Belgrade Football Subassociation|Belgrade First A-League]], which was one of the [[Yugoslav Second League]]\u00b4s at that time, but relegated after two years.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> The generational change in the squad is considered to be the reason for such a bad season, but after only one year, the club was back and won immediately the championship.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> However, in that season the club was merged with ''FK Istra'', a move that was not supported by many members of the direction board, and much less among the players.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> Because of this, local popularity fell and the vast majority of the players moved to neighbouring clubs ''Banovac'', ''Maki\u0161'' and ''\u0160e\u0107eranac''.<ref name=\"85 godina\" /> This made a stagnation in the club and during the following seasons the club did not compete in any level until 1942.<ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\n===The club during the World War II (1942\u20131944)===\nDuring the [[World War II]], the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded in April 1941 by the [[Axis powers]] and divided. Parts of Serbia fell to the [[Independent State of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], or were under [[Nazi-Germany]] administration, among Belgrade, which was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht]]. Under difficult circumstances, it was permitted for certain clubs to play football, including \u010cSK. Already after the invasion, the club returned 1942 after six years of abstinence successfully in the competition and won the First Belgrade League, thus played next season in the [[Serbian Football League (1940\u20131944)|Serbian League]], the top national tier during the war. In the [[1942\u201343 Serbian League|1942\u201343]] season the club finished 4th, a remarkable achievement because they finished in front of several favourites like [[SK Jedinstvo Beograd|Jedinstvo Belgrade]] or [[FK BASK|BASK]].<ref>[http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 Miroslav Milovanovi\u0107: \"Na\u0161 Plavi Bukvar\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512115722/http://www.ofkbeograd.net/index.php?id=199 |date=12 May 2012 }}, pag. 85</ref>\n\nIn that period there was a popular domestic tournament named ''Letnji Pehar'' (Summer Trophy), where the best clubs competed like [[OFK Beograd|BSK]], [[SK Jugoslavija|SK 1903]], [[FK Obili\u0107|Obili\u0107 Belgrade]] and so also \u010cSK. Finally, the club defeated ''SK Banovac'' in the quarter-finals (2\u20131, 0\u20131), but lost against SK 1903 in the semi-finals (0\u20132, 0\u20132).{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The 1943\u201344 Belgrade First League season was formed by 10 clubs however after 8 rounds it was interrupted with \u010cSK placed as 6th. By the end of the war the club did not play under its name, only restoring its name in 1948 as FK \u010cukari\u010dki, now part of the \u010cukari\u010dki Sports Association.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /><ref name=\"85 godina\" />\n\n===From the subclass to the first league (1944\u20132003)===\n[[File:Milan Dudic.JPG|thumb|Ex-national player [[Milan Dudi\u0107]] started his professional career at \u010cukari\u010dki and played from 1999 to 2002 for the club.]]\nIn 1948, playing in the Belgrade Second League, which was the 6th tier of the newly formed league system of the [[Socialist Yugoslavia]], the club finished 4th. It was coached by Jovan Veselinovi\u0107 and the squad was formed mostly by experienced older players. In 1950\u201351 with an already renovated squad, it finishes third and qualified to the Belgrade First League where it also finished third achieving promotion to the 1953\u201354 Belgrade Podsavezna League, the national fourth tier, where they finished third, again. Led by the coach \u017dikica Spasojevi\u0107 and striker Petar Popovi\u0107 they archived the promotion to the 1954\u201355 Serbian League, the third tier.\n\nIn summer 1955, Vule Radosavljevi\u0107 was made the main coach, however the club ended the first half of the season at bottom. Radosavljevi\u0107 was replaced by Dragomir Kojadinovi\u0107 and there were also changes at club direction board which may have contributed to a comeback with the team finishing the season in 8th place. This earned them participation in the pley-off for the [[Yugoslav Second League]], however they failed to qualify. In 1955\u201356 many players left the club, and led by coach Brana A\u0107imovi\u0107 they finished 2nd in the Belgrade Podsavezna League. 1956 is the year of the beginning of the fall as many important club players retired in that period.\n\nAlso, numerous club directions and coaches succeeded. So, the club played constantly in Belgrade leagues. Great achievement was brought on to the club ten years later in the 1966\u201367 season when they finished first in the Second Belgrade League and won the Belgrade Cup the same year.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> They were promoted to the Serbian League where they were constantly on top.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> So, these seasons, the club competed for promotion to the Yugoslav Second league, which he reached as a champion of the 1971\u201372 season. There, \u010cukari\u010dki held for several years, but did not succeed to promotion to the [[Yugoslav First League]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\nIn the early 1990s, the club played again in the third tier and between 1993 and 1995 in the second league of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> In the 1994\u201395 season, the club managed finally for the first time in its history the promotion to the first league, where they played until 1998.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> In the [[Yugoslav Cup]] in 1995, \u010cukari\u010dki came into the quarterfinals and also competed in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 1996|1996]] and [[UEFA Intertoto Cup 1997|1997]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> Their biggest success during this period came in the 1999\u201300 season, when they finished 6th in the first league, in which 21 teams participated.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /> The club remained till 2003 in the first division.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\n===From insolvency to privatization (2003\u2013present)===\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0448 \u041d\u0438\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b.jpg|thumb|[[Milo\u0161 Ninkovi\u0107]], here as a player of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], came from the youth school of the club and played three years as professional for \u010cukari\u010dki.]]\nAfter four years in the first league, \u010cukari\u010dki relegate in 2003. Although succeeded in 2004 as champion of the group West the direct re-promotion, the club relegated again in 2005. \u010cukari\u010dki was renamed in the early 2000s, as the Serbian company ''Stankom'' dedicated as the main sponsor and funder. Therefore, the club was known for a long time under the name ''\u010cukari\u010dki Stankom''. By the arrival of Stankom the club was stabilized. So, they improved the organization, increased the stadium capacity to 7,000 and also brought a better financial situation. In 2007, \u010cukari\u010dki finally reached the top division, the [[Serbian SuperLiga]].\n\n[[File:Aleksandar Kolarov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aleksandar Kolarov]], here in the jersey of [[Manchester City]], played from 2003 to 2006 for the club and is regarded as the most famous player who ever played for \u010cukari\u010dki.]]\nFrom August 2007 to December 2008 the former [[Bundesliga]] manager [[Dragoslav Stepanovi\u0107]] coached the club. After seven defeats in a row and the time between last place in the 2008\u201309 season, he was relieved of his duties. At the end of the season, the team made the 9th place in the table under coach [[Dejan \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107]] and remained in the league.\n\nThe 2009\u201310 season ended for \u010cukari\u010dki with the 13th place and escaped with three points ahead of [[Napredak Kru\u0161evac]] barely the relegation. This happiness the team should does not have anymore in the 2010\u201311 season. The club could not win a single one of its thirty league matches and finished with just five points on the last place and relegated in the [[Serbian First League]].<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" />\n\nAlso in the second league, \u010cukari\u010dki was not very successful. With 41 points they were equal on points with [[Banat Zrenjanin]] and [[Radni\u010dki Sombor]]. Because of the direct comparison between all three teams only Radni\u010dki Sombor had to join the 3rd league as 15th of the final table. The club was in a very difficult financial situation and was on the verge of [[bankruptcy]], however, the year 2011 marked a turning point, as the construction and wholesale company ADOC, which operates in the [[pharmacy]], [[diagnostics]] and [[construction industry]], bought up \u010cukari\u010dki and immediately invested in the club, making \u010cukari\u010dki the first professional football club in [[Serbia]], which was privatized, and also one of the few clubs in [[Southeast Europe]], which are privately owned.<ref name=\"Istorijat kluba\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka1\" />\n\nThrough the privatization, the financial and organizational situation of the club improved significantly, but also in the infrastructure and the squad has been invested.<ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka\" /><ref name=\"\u010cukari\u010dka Bajka1\" /> In the 2012\u201313 season the club then managed the runner-up of the second league and the return to the first league.
