He is recognized for his use of the narrative sequence, his expressive portraiture, and his intensely personal, subjective approach to photography.\n\nHe grew up in [[Montr\u00e9al]], where he participated in the visual arts scene of the city during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and published numerous photo-essays for newspapers and magazines. He also maintained close ties to the American photography scene.\n\nMax was championed during the 1960s and 1970s by the [[National Film Board of Canada]], through its [[National Film Board of Canada#Still Photography Division|Still Photography Division]], and the [[National Gallery of Canada]], through a variety of exhibition and publication projects. Gradually abandoning photojournalism during the 1960s, he focused his work on photographic art exhibitions and publications. His best-known work, ''Open Passport'' (exhibited 1972\u20131976; published 1973) is a long sequence that combined photographs from diverse sources shot over the span of a decade into a unified, poetical narrative.\n\nFollowing a long trip to [[Japan]] (1974\u20131978) that resulted in his deportation and the loss of many rolls of films, he became less visible than before on the arts scene in Canada. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, he benefitted from a regain of interest in his work, before his death in 2011.\n\nThe work of John Max has been recognized by a number of critics, curators, artists, and photographers in Canada and abroad. It has also been the source of a number of responses and homages.

He is recognized for his use of the narrative sequence, his expressive portraiture, and his intensely personal, subjective approach to photography.\n\nHe grew up in [[Montr\u00e9al]], where he participated in the visual arts scene of the city during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and published numerous photo-essays for newspapers and magazines. He also maintained close ties to the American photography scene.\n\nMax was championed during the 1960s and 1970s by the [[National Film Board of Canada]], through its [[National Film Board of Canada#Still Photography Division|Still Photography Division]], and the [[National Gallery of Canada]], through a variety of exhibition and publication projects. Gradually abandoning photojournalism during the 1960s, he focused his work on photographic art exhibitions and publications. His best-known work, ''Open Passport'' (exhibited 1972\u20131976; published 1973) is a long sequence that combined photographs from diverse sources shot over the span of a decade into a unified, poetical narrative.\n\nFollowing a long trip to [[Japan]] (1974\u20131978) that resulted in his deportation and the loss of many rolls of films, he became less visible than before on the arts scene in Canada. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, he benefitted from a regain of interest in his work, before his death in 2011.\n\nThe work of John Max has been recognized by a number of critics, curators, artists, and photographers in Canada and abroad. It has also been the source of a number of responses and homages.

The images were synchronized with interviews, and together they draw a portrait of three Indigenous communities in Alberta ([[University nuhelot\u02bc\u012fne thaiyots\u02bc\u012f nistameyim\u00e2kanak Blue Quills|Blue Quills College]], [[Frog Lake, Alberta|Frog Lake]], and [[Robert Smallboy#Smallboy Camp or Mountain Cree Camp|Smallboy Camp]]) during a tense moment in their relationships with the [[Canadian government]] about their [[Indian Register|Indian]] status, self-government, and revendications.<ref>{{cite web |title=The White Paper, 1969 |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/the-white-paper-1969 |website=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]}}</ref>\n\nFinally, in 1972 the exhibition ''Open Passport = Un passeport infini'' opened at the Photo Gallery of the NFB in [[Ottawa]].<ref name=\"NGC-OP\">{{cite web |title=Open Passport = Un passeport infini |url=http://library.gallery.ca/record=b1262304~S4 |website=Library and Archives \u2014 Catalogue |publisher=National Gallery of Canada}}</ref> A sequence of 161 black and white photographs culled from Max\u2019s archives, some dating as early as 1960, ''Open Passport'' is widely considered his most important work.<ref name=\"NGC-report\" /> The photographs are mainly portraits, of Max\u2019s family (his wife and son) and friends, many of which were established artists and personalities. Among those portrayed are [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Sam Tata]], Fran\u00e7ois Dallegret, [[Vittorio Fiorucci]], Guy Borremans, Sylvain P. [Henri] Cousineau, [[Lorraine Monk]], [[Jean-Claude Germain]], [[Moondog]], [[Arthur Lipsett]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Gail Zappa]], Henry Zemel, Gordon Sheppard, [[Nina Raginsky]], [[Judith Eglington]], Charles Gagnon, [[Dennis Stock]], [[Martin Lavut]], [[Grace Slick]], and [[Michio Kushi]].<ref name=\"OP_BOOK\">{{cite book |last1=Max |first1=John |title=Open Pasport |date=1973 |publisher=IMPRESSIONS |location=Toronto |oclc=1118991051}}</ref>\n\nMax unified the selection for ''Open Passport'' by organizing the images according to a narrative progression, by grouping images in grids, using repetitions and a variety of sequencing strategies that can recall large-scale photographic exhibitions such as ''[[The Family of Man]]''. The underlying story is that of a couple confronting the arrival of a child: whilst the mother experiences an increasing toll on her sanity and her energy, the father confronts a dilemma between his artistic career and his family. The conflict is ultimately resolved by his departure, but this resolution is not considered a happy ending by those involved.<ref name=\"FakingDeath\">{{cite book |last1=Cousineau-Levine |first1=Penny |author1-link=Penny Cousineau-Levine |title=Faking Death: Canadian Art Photography and the Canadian Imagination |date=2003 |publisher=McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press |location=Montr\u00e9al and Kingston |isbn=0773525262 |url=https://www.mqup.ca/faking-death-products-9780773528260.php}}</ref><ref name=\"MHV-Uhl\">{{cite book |last1=Hardy-Vall\u00e9e |first1=Michel |editor1-last=Uhl |editor1-first=Magali |title=Les r\u00e9cits visuels de soi : Mises en r\u00e9cit artistiques et nouvelles sc\u00e9nographies de l\u2019intime |date=2015 |publisher=Presses universitaires de Paris ouest |language=French |location=Paris |isbn=9782840162285 |pages=197\u2013206 |url=https://presses.parisnanterre.fr/?p=2688 |chapter=Open Passport : Le r\u00e9cit photographique et le langage universel de John Max}}</ref>\n\n''Open Passport'' was accompanied by a slide show of the photographs at its opening in Ottawa and Montr\u00e9al,<ref name=\"White\">{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Michael |title=John Max: Photographs Born of a Beat Generation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NIMuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qqEFAAAAIBAJ&hl=fr&pg=909%2C2693835 |work=The Gazette |date=10 February 1973}}</ref> and it traveled to multiple venues in Canada until 1976.<ref name=\"NGC-OP\" /> It was printed as a [[Photo-book|photobook]] by the [[Toronto]]-based magazine ''IMPRESSIONS'' as its special issue No. 6 and 7 in late 1973.<ref name=\"OP_BOOK\" /> [[A.

[[Lorenzo de Medici|Lorenzo ''the Magnificent'' de Medici]] was the greatest Florentine patron of the Renaissance and supporter of the Italic League. He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] and during the [[Siege of Otranto|aborted invasion of Italy]] by the Turks. However, the military campaign of [[Charles VIII of France]] in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the [[Italian Wars]] between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the [[High Renaissance]] of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521) and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) opposed the [[Protestant reformation]] and [[Caterina de Medici|advanced the interests of their family]]. The end of the wars ultimately left [[northern Italy]] indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs and [[Southern Italy]] under direct Spanish Habsburg rule.\n\nThe Papacy remained independent and launched the [[Counter-reformation]]. Key events of the period include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563); the excommunication of [[Elizabeth I]] (1570) and the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), both occurring during the pontificate of [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]]; the construction of the [[Gregorian Tower|Gregorian observatory]], the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the [[Jesuit China mission]] of [[Matteo Ricci]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; the [[Long Turkish War]] and the execution of [[Giordano Bruno]] in 1600, under [[Pope Clement VIII]]; the birth  of the [[Lyncean Academy]] of the [[Papal States]], of which the main figure was [[Galileo Galilei]] (later put [[Galileo affair|on trial]]); the final phases of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) during the pontificates of [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]]; and the formation of the last [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] by [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] during the [[Great Turkish War]]\n\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons and the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria.

A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement.

[[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day |title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day |date=17 March 2017|access-date=17 July 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.\n\nIn 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome.

The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.\n\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]] in Rome, a national symbol of Italy celebrating the first king of the unified country, and resting place of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Italy)|Unknown Soldier]] since the end of World War I]]\n\nStarting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing under its rule [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]] in East Africa, [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in North Africa (later unified in the colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]]) and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] islands.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), p. 49.)</ref> From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China; on 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\n\nItaly, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" top Allied powers. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99'', all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] and in a series of battles on the [[Battle of Monte Grappa|Piave river]]. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory<ref>Burgwyn, H.

Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as \"[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]\". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\n=== Fascist regime ===\n{{Main|Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini 1930 (cropped).png|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]]]\nThe [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]  named the \"[[March on Rome]]\" which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]] and eastern fronts, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Soviet Union]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].\n\n[[File:Italy's colonial empire.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Italian Empire]] at its maximum extent, with colonies in light green and protectorates or occupied areas during [[World War II]] in grey]]\n\nThe [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions.

Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.\n\nIn the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the [[Italian Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. As result, the country descended into [[Italian Civil War|civil war]]. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the ''[[Resistenza]]'', which fought a guerilla war against the German and RSI forces.

In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.<ref>Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.</ref><ref>Thomas A.

Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to\n{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south.

The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943\u20131946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205\u2013222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}</ref>\n\n=== Government ===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| caption_align = center\n| image1   = Presidente Mattarella.jpg\n| width1   = 143\n| caption1 = [[Sergio Mattarella]]<br /><small>[[President of Italy]]<br />since 2015</small>\n| image2   = Giuseppe Conte Official.jpg\n| width2   = 137\n| caption2 = [[Giuseppe Conte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of Italy]]<br />since 2018</small>\n}}\n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]\n\nThe prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]&nbsp;\u2013 which holds effective executive power&nbsp;\u2013 and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].\n\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |title=About us \u2013 Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica |website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |archivedate=29 March 2015|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nA peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]].

During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475\u20131564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].\n\nOther astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625\u20131712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835\u20131910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736\u20131813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u20131576) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901\u20131954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] (1905\u20131989) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905\u20131993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]].<ref>Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141\u2013181. {{jstor|27757806}}</ref>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]). [[Antonio Meucci]] is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first [[telephone]].<ref>Wheen, Andrew.

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline.

Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto onwards, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. The two are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's David 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.9|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501\u20131504), [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], Florence]]\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]].\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484\u20131486), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence]]\nIn the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]]. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.\n\nIn the 19th century, major Italian [[Romantic painting|Romantic]] painters were [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]] and [[Francesco Podesti]].

In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture.

The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Theatre and Drama in the Making |last=Gassner |first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books |year=1992 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]].

[[Lorenzo de Medici|Lorenzo ''the Magnificent'' de Medici]] was the greatest Florentine patron of the Renaissance and supporter of the Italic League. He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] and during the [[Siege of Otranto|aborted invasion of Italy]] by the Turks. However, the military campaign of [[Charles VIII of France]] in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the [[Italian Wars]] between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the [[High Renaissance]] of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521) and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) opposed the [[Protestant reformation]] and [[Caterina de Medici|advanced the interests of their family]]. The end of the wars ultimately left [[northern Italy]] indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs and [[Southern Italy]] under direct Spanish Habsburg rule.\n\nThe Papacy remained independent and launched the [[Counter-reformation]]. Key events of the period include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563); the excommunication of [[Elizabeth I]] (1570) and the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), both occurring during the pontificate of [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]]; the construction of the [[Gregorian Tower|Gregorian observatory]], the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the [[Jesuit China mission]] of [[Matteo Ricci]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; the [[Long Turkish War]] and the execution of [[Giordano Bruno]] in 1600, under [[Pope Clement VIII]]; the birth  of the [[Lyncean Academy]] of the [[Papal States]], of which the main figure was [[Galileo Galilei]] (later put [[Galileo affair|on trial]]); the final phases of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) during the pontificates of [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]]; and the formation of the last [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] by [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] during the [[Great Turkish War]]\n\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons and the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria.

A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement.

[[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day |title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day |date=17 March 2017|access-date=17 July 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.\n\nIn 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome.

The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.\n\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]] in Rome, a national symbol of Italy celebrating the first king of the unified country, and resting place of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Italy)|Unknown Soldier]] since the end of World War I]]\n\nStarting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing under its rule [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]] in East Africa, [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in North Africa (later unified in the colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]]) and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] islands.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), p. 49.)</ref> From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China; on 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\n\nItaly, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" top Allied powers. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99'', all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] and in a series of battles on the [[Battle of Monte Grappa|Piave river]]. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory<ref>Burgwyn, H.

Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as \"[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]\". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\n=== Fascist regime ===\n{{Main|Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini 1930 (cropped).png|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]]]\nThe [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]  named the \"[[March on Rome]]\" which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]] and eastern fronts, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Soviet Union]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].\n\n[[File:Italy's colonial empire.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Italian Empire]] at its maximum extent, with colonies in light green and protectorates or occupied areas during [[World War II]] in grey]]\n\nThe [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions.

Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.\n\nIn the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the [[Italian Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. As result, the country descended into [[Italian Civil War|civil war]]. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the ''[[Resistenza]]'', which fought a guerilla war against the German and RSI forces.

In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.<ref>Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.</ref><ref>Thomas A.

Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to\n{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south.

The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943\u20131946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205\u2013222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}</ref>\n\n=== Government ===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| caption_align = center\n| image1   = Presidente Mattarella.jpg\n| width1   = 143\n| caption1 = [[Sergio Mattarella]]<br /><small>[[President of Italy]]<br />since 2015</small>\n| image2   = Giuseppe Conte Official.jpg\n| width2   = 137\n| caption2 = [[Giuseppe Conte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of Italy]]<br />since 2018</small>\n}}\n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]\n\nThe prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]&nbsp;\u2013 which holds effective executive power&nbsp;\u2013 and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].\n\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |title=About us \u2013 Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica |website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |archivedate=29 March 2015|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nA peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]].

During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475\u20131564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].\n\nOther astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625\u20131712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835\u20131910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736\u20131813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u20131576) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901\u20131954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] (1905\u20131989) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905\u20131993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]].<ref>Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141\u2013181. {{jstor|27757806}}</ref>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]). [[Antonio Meucci]] is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first [[telephone]].<ref>Wheen, Andrew.

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline.

Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto onwards, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. The two are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's David 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.9|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501\u20131504), [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], Florence]]\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]].\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484\u20131486), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence]]\nIn the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]]. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.\n\nIn the 19th century, major Italian [[Romantic painting|Romantic]] painters were [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]] and [[Francesco Podesti]].

In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture.

The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Theatre and Drama in the Making |last=Gassner |first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books |year=1992 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]].
