He is the son of former [[Champ Car]] racer, [[Steve Krisiloff]], the nephew of [[Tony George]], and the grandson of [[Mari Hulman George]]. He became the youngest [[BMX]] rider in the United States, when he began racing BMX bicycles at just three years old. He raced quarter midgets from 1995 to 1999, winning over 320 features and nine Grand National Championships.\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:Kyle Krisiloff2006Truck.jpg|thumb|left|Krisiloff's 2006 truck at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]]]]\nBorn in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Krisiloff made his home in [[Carmel, Indiana]]. In 2000, Krisiloff raced in [[Superkarts USA]] competition, winning two races and two pole positions. In 2001, he competed in twenty-two SCCA Formula Ford events, winning six races, six poles, and national championship at the historic SCCA Runoffs (The youngest ever at 14 years of age). In 2002, he competed in [[Toyota Atlantic]] for the last six races of the year. He ran the full season in 2003, placing 10th in points. His best finish was a second at the Milwaukee Mile, which made him the youngest driver to score a podium finish in Toyota Atlantics as well as the fastest Toyota Atlantic driver ever setting a speed over {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at the Milwaukee Mile.\n\nIn 2004, Krisiloff signed a [[driver development contract]] with [[Hendrick Motorsports]]<ref>[http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news_detail.asp?id=1118 Hendrick PR]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327030715/http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news_detail.asp?id=1118 |date=2006-03-27 }}</ref> and ran three [[ARCA Re/Max Series]] races with [[Bobby Gerhart Racing]] and ten [[American Speed Association|ASA]] races as part of the agreement. He started 3rd and finished 9th in his ARCA series debut at Lake Erie Speedway, and then finished 2nd at [[Nashville Superspeedway]], before winning at [[Chicagoland Speedway]] in only his third series start. In ten ASA starts, he recorded a single top ten finish with a 4th at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]].  He ran fourteen ARCA races in [[2005 ARCA Re/Max Series|2005]], recording three top fives, five top tens, and two poles. He also competed in three [[NASCAR Busch Series]] races in the No. 5 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet. After leaving Hendrick Motorsports in 2005, Krisiloff moved to the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] in [[2006 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2006]], driving for [[Billy Ballew Motorsports]], before parting ways due to financial conflicts.\n\nIn January 2007, a partnership including [[Carl Haas]], [[Travis Carter]], [[Mari Hulman George]], and [[Michael T. Lanigan]] announced that it was purchasing [[ppc Racing]] and would field the No. 14 [[Ford Fusion (North American)|Ford Fusion]] in the Busch Series with Krisiloff as the driver.  The car was to be sponsored by [[Clabber Girl]], which is part of the Hulman-George family holdings, but later gained sponsorship from [[Walgreens]] and [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. His best finishes were 5th at Talladega and 6th at Montreal. In [[2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2008]], he drove six races for [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] in the No. 41 [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[Dodge]], earning a best finish of 24th at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]].\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n===SCCA National Championship Runoffs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

He is the son of former [[Champ Car]] racer, [[Steve Krisiloff]], the nephew of [[Tony George]], and the grandson of [[Mari Hulman George]]. He became the youngest [[BMX]] rider in the United States, when he began racing BMX bicycles at just three years old. He raced quarter midgets from 1995 to 1999, winning over 320 features and nine Grand National Championships.\n\n==Racing career==\n[[File:Kyle Krisiloff2006Truck.jpg|thumb|left|Krisiloff's 2006 truck at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]]]]\nBorn in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], Krisiloff made his home in [[Carmel, Indiana]]. In 2000, Krisiloff raced in [[Superkarts USA]] competition, winning two races and two pole positions. In 2001, he competed in twenty-two SCCA Formula Ford events, winning six races, six poles, and national championship at the historic SCCA Runoffs (The youngest ever at 14 years of age). In 2002, he competed in [[Toyota Atlantic]] for the last six races of the year. He ran the full season in 2003, placing 10th in points. His best finish was a second at the Milwaukee Mile, which made him the youngest driver to score a podium finish in Toyota Atlantics as well as the fastest Toyota Atlantic driver ever setting a speed over {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at the Milwaukee Mile.\n\nIn 2004, Krisiloff signed a [[driver development contract]] with [[Hendrick Motorsports]]<ref>[http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news_detail.asp?id=1118 Hendrick PR]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327030715/http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news_detail.asp?id=1118 |date=2006-03-27 }}</ref> and ran three [[ARCA Re/Max Series]] races with [[Bobby Gerhart Racing]] and ten [[American Speed Association|ASA]] races as part of the agreement. He started 3rd and finished 9th in his ARCA series debut at Lake Erie Speedway, and then finished 2nd at [[Nashville Superspeedway]], before winning at [[Chicagoland Speedway]] in only his third series start. In ten ASA starts, he recorded a single top ten finish with a 4th at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]].  He ran fourteen ARCA races in [[2005 ARCA Re/Max Series|2005]], recording three top fives, five top tens, and two poles. He also competed in three [[NASCAR Busch Series]] races in the No. 5 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet. After leaving Hendrick Motorsports in 2005, Krisiloff moved to the [[Craftsman Truck Series]] in [[2006 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2006]], driving for [[Billy Ballew Motorsports]], before parting ways due to financial conflicts.\n\nIn January 2007, a partnership including [[Carl Haas]], [[Travis Carter]], [[Mari Hulman George]], and [[Michael T. Lanigan]] announced that it was purchasing [[ppc Racing]] and would field the No. 14 [[Ford Fusion (North American)|Ford Fusion]] in the Busch Series with Krisiloff as the driver.  The car was to be sponsored by [[Clabber Girl]], which is part of the Hulman-George family holdings, but later gained sponsorship from [[Walgreens]] and [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. His best finishes were 5th at Talladega and 6th at Montreal. In [[2008 NASCAR Nationwide Series|2008]], he drove six races for [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] in the No. 41 [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] [[Dodge]], earning a best finish of 24th at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]].\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n===SCCA National Championship Runoffs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

First, curved designs, such as that found in Calatrava's [[Turning Torso]] in [[Malm\u00f6, Sweden]], tend to add to the strength of a structure.<ref name=YBuildingStand>{{cite book|author=Salvadori, Mario|year=1982|title=Why Buildings Stand Up: The Strength of Architecture|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill}}</ref>  A similar principle has been used in the past with curved stadium roofs.  In addition to structural support, the curved face of the exterior would minimize wind forces.  In rectangular buildings, a fluid wind flow puts pressure on the windward face of the building; while air moves around it, a suction is applied to the leeward face.  This often causes a sway in tall buildings usually counteracted, at least partially, by stiffening the structure or by using a [[Tuned mass damper|dynamic wind damper]].<ref name=YBuildingStand />  Since the curved design of the Chicago Spire would not completely negate wind forces, a tapering concrete core and twelve [[shear wall]]s radiating from it were planned to counteract the remaining wind load.<ref name=Hampton />\n\nAdditionally, the Chicago Spire was designed with world-class [[sustainable engineering]] practices to meet [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Gold recognition.  Sustainable features included recycled rainwater, river water used for cooling, ornithologically-sensitive glass to protect migratory birds, intelligent building and management systems, waste storage and recycling management, and monitored outdoor air delivery.<ref name=092707Matlock />\n\n== Construction ==\nFollowing the city approval, it was announced that construction of the Chicago Spire was to begin in the summer of 2007, with [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] work scheduled to begin as early as June 2007.<ref name=AP05102007a>{{cite web|url=http://www.chestertontribune.com/Northwest%20Indiana/5102%20city_council_oks_plan_for_chicag.htm |author=Associated Press |date=2007-05-10 |title=City council OKs plan for Chicago Spire building, would be nation's tallest |publisher=Chesterton Tribune |accessdate=2009-07-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623222749/http://www.chestertontribune.com/Northwest%20Indiana/5102%20city_council_oks_plan_for_chicag.htm |archivedate=2009-06-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> DuSable Park was designated as a [[Staging area (construction site)|staging area]] for the construction of the tower.<ref name=05092007bChicagoTribune>{{cite web|url=http://www.archicentral.com/chicago-spire-usa-santiago-calatrava-7546/|title=Chicago Spire // USA // Santiago Calatrava|publisher=ArchiCentral|date=2009-03-06|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref> The [[sales center]] for the Chicago Spire opened on January 14, 2008.<ref name=Crains011408>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=27745&seenIt=1|author=Baeb, Eddie|date=2008-01-14|title=Spire sales office opens today|publisher=Crain Communications|work=Chicago Business|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>\n\nOn September 19, 2008, a spokeswoman for the developer announced that construction was continuing on the building, but that the pace of construction would be slowed until the financial markets recovered from the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].<ref name=091908SunTimes>{{cite news|author=Roeder, David|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2008-09-19|title=Business briefs: Economic upheaval causes delays in building of Spire|page=44}}</ref> Kelleher promised that he still had financial backing,<ref name=091908SunTimes /> although analysts questioned the ability of the project to survive the current economic decline.<ref name=091008ChicagoTribune>{{cite news|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2008/09/chicago-spire-m.html|date=2008-09-10|title=Chicago Spire: Modest beginnings for a skyline icon|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref>  A contractor to build the building's [[superstructure]] had not yet been named.<ref name=091008ChicagoTribune />  The October 1, 2008 edition of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said that the building foundation was complete and the [[above ground construction]] would not continue until the markets recover.<ref>{{cite news|title=Businesses Pressure Congress on Bailout Plan|author1=Sharma, Amol |author2=Jennifer Saranow |author3=Ilan Brat |author4=Lauren Etter |last-author-amp=yes |date=2008-10-01|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122281874953692447|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref> The Spire has remained a fenced-off hole in the ground at 400 N.

First, curved designs, such as that found in Calatrava's [[Turning Torso]] in [[Malm\u00f6, Sweden]], tend to add to the strength of a structure.<ref name=YBuildingStand>{{cite book|author=Salvadori, Mario|year=1982|title=Why Buildings Stand Up: The Strength of Architecture|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill}}</ref>  A similar principle has been used in the past with curved stadium roofs.  In addition to structural support, the curved face of the exterior would minimize wind forces.  In rectangular buildings, a fluid wind flow puts pressure on the windward face of the building; while air moves around it, a suction is applied to the leeward face.  This often causes a sway in tall buildings usually counteracted, at least partially, by stiffening the structure or by using a [[Tuned mass damper|dynamic wind damper]].<ref name=YBuildingStand />  Since the curved design of the Chicago Spire would not completely negate wind forces, a tapering concrete core and twelve [[shear wall]]s radiating from it were planned to counteract the remaining wind load.<ref name=Hampton />\n\nAdditionally, the Chicago Spire was designed with world-class [[sustainable engineering]] practices to meet [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Gold recognition.  Sustainable features included recycled rainwater, river water used for cooling, ornithologically-sensitive glass to protect migratory birds, intelligent building and management systems, waste storage and recycling management, and monitored outdoor air delivery.<ref name=092707Matlock />\n\n== Construction ==\nFollowing the city approval, it was announced that construction of the Chicago Spire was to begin in the summer of 2007, with [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] work scheduled to begin as early as June 2007.<ref name=AP05102007a>{{cite web|url=http://www.chestertontribune.com/Northwest%20Indiana/5102%20city_council_oks_plan_for_chicag.htm |author=Associated Press |date=2007-05-10 |title=City council OKs plan for Chicago Spire building, would be nation's tallest |publisher=Chesterton Tribune |accessdate=2009-07-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623222749/http://www.chestertontribune.com/Northwest%20Indiana/5102%20city_council_oks_plan_for_chicag.htm |archivedate=2009-06-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> DuSable Park was designated as a [[Staging area (construction site)|staging area]] for the construction of the tower.<ref name=05092007bChicagoTribune>{{cite web|url=http://www.archicentral.com/chicago-spire-usa-santiago-calatrava-7546/|title=Chicago Spire // USA // Santiago Calatrava|publisher=ArchiCentral|date=2009-03-06|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref> The [[sales center]] for the Chicago Spire opened on January 14, 2008.<ref name=Crains011408>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=27745&seenIt=1|author=Baeb, Eddie|date=2008-01-14|title=Spire sales office opens today|publisher=Crain Communications|work=Chicago Business|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>\n\nOn September 19, 2008, a spokeswoman for the developer announced that construction was continuing on the building, but that the pace of construction would be slowed until the financial markets recovered from the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].<ref name=091908SunTimes>{{cite news|author=Roeder, David|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=2008-09-19|title=Business briefs: Economic upheaval causes delays in building of Spire|page=44}}</ref> Kelleher promised that he still had financial backing,<ref name=091908SunTimes /> although analysts questioned the ability of the project to survive the current economic decline.<ref name=091008ChicagoTribune>{{cite news|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2008/09/chicago-spire-m.html|date=2008-09-10|title=Chicago Spire: Modest beginnings for a skyline icon|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref>  A contractor to build the building's [[superstructure]] had not yet been named.<ref name=091008ChicagoTribune />  The October 1, 2008 edition of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said that the building foundation was complete and the [[above ground construction]] would not continue until the markets recover.<ref>{{cite news|title=Businesses Pressure Congress on Bailout Plan|author1=Sharma, Amol |author2=Jennifer Saranow |author3=Ilan Brat |author4=Lauren Etter |last-author-amp=yes |date=2008-10-01|publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]]|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122281874953692447|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref> The Spire has remained a fenced-off hole in the ground at 400 N.
