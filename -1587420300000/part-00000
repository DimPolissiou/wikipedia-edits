A total of [[#Overview|twenty teams]] have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen teams competing in 2015; the [[2019 Cricket World Cup|recent 2019 tournament]] only had ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] twice each, while [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] and [[England national cricket team|England]] have won it once each.

The efficient implementation of [[logic function]]s in the form of [[logic gate]] circuits (such that no more logic gates are used than are necessary) is necessary to minimize production costs, and/or maximize a device's performance.\n\n=== Designing digital logic circuits ===\nAll digital systems are composed of two elementary functions: [[Flip-flop_(electronics)|memory elements]] for storing information, and [[combinational logic|combinational circuit]]s that transform that information. [[State machine]]s, like counters, are a combination of memory elements and [[combinational logic]] circuits. Since memory elements are standard logic circuits they are selected out of a limited set of alternative circuits; so designing digital functions comes down to designing the combinational gate circuits and interconnecting them.\n\nIn general the instantiation of logic circuits from high-level abstraction is referred to as [[logic synthesis]], which can be carried out by hand, but usually some formal method by computer is applied. In this article the design methods for combinational logic circuits are briefly summarized.\n\nThe starting point for the design of a digital logic circuit is its desired functionality, having derived from the analysis of the system as a whole, the logic circuit is to make part of. The description can be stated in some algorithmic form or by logic equations, but may be summarized in the form of a table as well. The below example shows a part of such a table for a [[7-segment display]] driver that translates the binary code for the values of a decimal digit into the signals that cause the respective segments of the display to light up.\n\n<pre>\n  Digit  Code        Segments\n                   A B C D E F G\n    0    0000      1 1 1 1 1 1 0          -A-\n    1    0001      0 1 1 0 0 0 0         |   |\n    2    0010      1 1 0 1 1 0 1         F   B\n    3    0011      1 1 1 1 0 0 1         |   |\n    4    0100      0 1 1 0 0 1 1          -G-\n    5    0101      1 0 1 1 0 1 1         |   |\n    6    0110      1 0 1 1 1 1 1         E   C\n    7    0111      1 1 1 0 0 0 0         |   |\n    8    1000      1 1 1 1 1 1 1          -D-\n    9    1001      1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n</pre>\n\nThe implementation process starts with a ''logic minimization'' phase, to be described below, in order to simplify the function table by combining the separate terms into larger ones containing fewer variables.\n\nNext, the minimized result may be split up in smaller parts by a factorization procedure and is eventually mapped onto the available basic logic cells of the target technology. This operation is commonly referred to as [[logic optimization]].<ref name=\"Micheli_1994\"/>\n\n=== Classical minimization methods ===\nMinimizing [[Boolean function]]s by hand using the classical [[Karnaugh maps]] is a laborious, tedious and error prone process. It isn't suited for more than six input variables and practical only for up to four variables, while product term sharing for multiple output functions is even harder to carry out.<ref name=\"Lewin_1985\"/> Moreover, this method doesn't lend itself to be automated in the form of a computer program. However, since modern logic functions are generally not constrained to such a small number of variables, while the cost as well as the risk of making errors is prohibitive for manual implementation of logic functions, the use of computers became indispensable.\n\nThe first alternative method to become popular was the tabular method developed by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard Quine]] and [[Edward J. McCluskey|Edward McCluskey]]. Starting with the [[truth table]] for a set of logic functions, by combining the [[minterm]]s for which the functions are active (the [[ON-cover]]) or for which the function value is irrelevant (the [[Don't-care (logic)|Don't-Care]]-cover or [[DC-cover]]) a set of [[prime implicant]]s is composed. Finally, a systematic procedure is followed to find the smallest set of prime implicants the output functions can be realised with.<ref name=\"Katz_1994\"/><ref name=\"Lala_1996\"/>\n\nAlthough this [[Quine&ndash;McCluskey algorithm]] is very well suited to be implemented in a computer program, the result is still far from efficient in terms of processing time and memory usage. Adding a variable to the function will roughly double both of them, because the truth table length increases [[exponential function|exponential]]ly with the number of variables. A similar problem occurs when increasing the number of output functions of a [[combinational function]] block. As a result the Quine&ndash;McCluskey method is practical only for functions with a limited number of input variables and output functions.\n\n=== Espresso algorithm ===\nA radically different approach to this issue is followed in the Espresso algorithm, developed by Brayton et al. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"Brayton_1984\"/><ref name=\"RK-Brayton-Berkeley\"/> Rather than expanding a logic function into minterms, the program manipulates \"cubes\", representing the product terms in the ON-, DC- and [[OFF-cover]]s iteratively. Although the minimization result is not guaranteed to be the [[global minimum]], in practice this is very closely approximated, while the solution is always free from [[Logic redundancy|redundancy]]. Compared to the other methods, this one is essentially more efficient, reducing memory usage and computation time by several orders of magnitude. Its name reflects the way of instantly making a cup of fresh coffee. There is hardly any restriction to the number of variables, output functions and product terms of a combinational function block. In general, e.g. tens of variables with tens of output functions are readily dealt with.\n\nThe input for Espresso is a function table of the desired functionality; the result is a minimized table, describing either the ON-cover or the OFF-cover of the function, depending on the selected options. By default, the product terms will be shared as much as possible by the several output functions, but the program can be instructed to handle each of the output functions separately. This allows for efficient implementation in [[two-level logic]] arrays such as a [[Programmable Logic Array|PLA]] (Programmable Logic Array) or a [[Programmable Array Logic|PAL]] (Programmable Array Logic).\n\nThe Espresso algorithm proved so successful that it has been incorporated as a standard logic function minimization step into virtually any contemporary [[logic synthesis]] tool. For implementing a function in [[multi-level logic]], the minimization result is optimized by factorization and mapped onto the available basic logic cells in the target technology, whether this concerns an [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) or an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC).\n\n== Software ==\n\n=== Espresso ===\nThe original ''Espresso'' program is available as [[C (programming language)|C]] source code from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] website.  The last release was version 2.3 dated 1988.<ref name=\"Espresso\"/>  The ''Espresso-ab'' and ''eqntott'' (equation to truth table) program, an updated version of Espresso for modern [[POSIX]] systems, is available in [[Debian]] [[Linux distribution]] (.deb) file format as well the C source code.  The last release was version 9.0 dated 2008.<ref name=\"Espresso-eb\"/>\n\n=== Logic Friday ===\n<!-- Note: section title used in redirects -->\n''Logic Friday'' is a free [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] program that provides a graphical interface to Espresso, as well as to misII, another module in the Berkeley Octtools package. With Logic Friday users can enter a logic function as a truth table, equation, or gate diagram, minimize the function, and then view the results in both of the other two representations.  The last release was version 1.1.4 dated 2012.<ref name=\"Logic_Friday\"/>\n\n=== Minilog ===\n''Minilog'' is a free Windows program that provides logic minimization exploiting this Espresso algorithm. It is able to generate a two-level gate implementation for a combinational function block with up to 40 inputs and outputs or a [[Finite-state machine|synchronous state machine]] with up to 256 states. It is part of the ''Publicad'' educational design package.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Hayes_1993\">{{cite book |author-first=John Patrick |author-last=Hayes |author-link=John Patrick Hayes (computer scientist) |title=Digital Logic Design |publisher=[[Addison Wesley]] |date=1993 |isbn=0-201-15461-7}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"RK-Brayton-Berkeley\">{{cite web |title=Robert K.

Finally, a systematic procedure is followed to find the smallest set of prime implicants the output functions can be realised with.<ref name=\"Katz_1994\"/><ref name=\"Lala_1996\"/>\n\nAlthough this [[Quine&ndash;McCluskey algorithm]] is very well suited to be implemented in a computer program, the result is still far from efficient in terms of processing time and memory usage. Adding a variable to the function will roughly double both of them, because the truth table length increases [[exponential function|exponential]]ly with the number of variables. A similar problem occurs when increasing the number of output functions of a [[combinational function]] block. As a result the Quine&ndash;McCluskey method is practical only for functions with a limited number of input variables and output functions.\n\n=== Espresso algorithm ===\nA radically different approach to this issue is followed in the Espresso algorithm, developed by Brayton et al. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=\"Brayton_1984\"/><ref name=\"RK-Brayton-Berkeley\"/> Rather than expanding a logic function into minterms, the program manipulates \"cubes\", representing the product terms in the ON-, DC- and [[OFF-cover]]s iteratively. Although the minimization result is not guaranteed to be the [[global minimum]], in practice this is very closely approximated, while the solution is always free from [[Logic redundancy|redundancy]]. Compared to the other methods, this one is essentially more efficient, reducing memory usage and computation time by several orders of magnitude. Its name reflects the way of instantly making a cup of fresh coffee. There is hardly any restriction to the number of variables, output functions and product terms of a combinational function block. In general, e.g. tens of variables with tens of output functions are readily dealt with.\n\nThe input for Espresso is a function table of the desired functionality; the result is a minimized table, describing either the ON-cover or the OFF-cover of the function, depending on the selected options. By default, the product terms will be shared as much as possible by the several output functions, but the program can be instructed to handle each of the output functions separately. This allows for efficient implementation in [[two-level logic]] arrays such as a [[Programmable Logic Array|PLA]] (Programmable Logic Array) or a [[Programmable Array Logic|PAL]] (Programmable Array Logic).\n\nThe Espresso algorithm proved so successful that it has been incorporated as a standard logic function minimization step into virtually any contemporary [[logic synthesis]] tool. For implementing a function in [[multi-level logic]], the minimization result is optimized by factorization and mapped onto the available basic logic cells in the target technology, whether this concerns an [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) or an [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC).\n\n== Software ==\n\n=== Espresso ===\nThe original ''Espresso'' program is available as [[C (programming language)|C]] source code from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] website.  The last release was version 2.3 dated 1988.<ref name=\"Espresso\"/>  The ''Espresso-ab'' and ''eqntott'' (equation to truth table) program, an updated version of Espresso for modern [[POSIX]] systems, is available in [[Debian]] [[Linux distribution]] (.deb) file format as well the C source code.  The last release was version 9.0 dated 2008.<ref name=\"Espresso-eb\"/>\n\n=== Logic Friday ===\n<!-- Note: section title used in redirects -->\n''Logic Friday'' is a free [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] program that provides a graphical interface to Espresso, as well as to misII, another module in the Berkeley Octtools package. With Logic Friday users can enter a logic function as a truth table, equation, or gate diagram, minimize the function, and then view the results in both of the other two representations.  The last release was version 1.1.4 dated 2012.<ref name=\"Logic_Friday\"/>\n\n=== Minilog ===\n''Minilog'' is a free Windows program that provides logic minimization exploiting this Espresso algorithm. It is able to generate a two-level gate implementation for a combinational function block with up to 40 inputs and outputs or a [[Finite-state machine|synchronous state machine]] with up to 256 states. It is part of the ''Publicad'' educational design package.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Hayes_1993\">{{cite book |author-first=John Patrick |author-last=Hayes |author-link=John Patrick Hayes (computer scientist) |title=Digital Logic Design |publisher=[[Addison Wesley]] |date=1993 |isbn=0-201-15461-7}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"RK-Brayton-Berkeley\">{{cite web |title=Robert K.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man.<ref>This sentence is phrased awkwardly.\n\n1. \"Parker's Back\" doesn't take place in Georgia. The setting of \"Parker's Back\" is in Georgia. (This adds clarity to the sentence).\n\n<br /></ref>Later, he developes a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker dislikes Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt the wonder and awe he desired; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decided that they were worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos: He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare area for a tattoo was on his back. Even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, resulting in a fire that destroys both machine and tree. Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith.\" Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to help tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965, in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

He runs into the tattoo salon and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it; however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks. While the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice and that he would have recommended something different, Parker goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Parker knocks on the door and begs for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. O'Connor is known to use irony throughout her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of getting a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to help tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are reflections of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "GinaleeJimenez", "label": "safe", "comment": "period goes inside the quotation marks.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}

{"title_page": "Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text_new": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{US Constitution article series}}\nThe '''Sixth Amendment''' ('''Amendment VI''') to the [[United States Constitution]] sets forth rights related to criminal prosecutions. It was ratified in 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applied]] most of the protections of this amendment to the states through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\nThe Sixth Amendment grants criminal defendants the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial [[Juries in the United States|jury]] consisting of jurors from the state and district in which the crime was alleged to have been committed. Under the impartial jury requirement, jurors must be unbiased, and the jury must consist of a representative cross-section of the community. The right to a jury applies only to offenses in which the penalty is imprisonment for longer than six months. In ''[[Barker v. Wingo]]'', the Supreme Court articulated a [[balancing test]] to determine whether a defendant's right to a speedy trial had been violated, and held that any delay of longer than a year would be \"presumptively\" (but not absolutely) prejudicial. The Supreme Court has held that the requirement of a public trial is not absolute, and that both the government and the defendant can in some cases request a closed trial.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment requires that criminal defendants be given [[notice]] of the nature and cause of accusations against them. The amendment's [[Confrontation Clause]] gives criminal defendants the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, while the [[Compulsory Process Clause]] gives criminal defendants the right to call their own witnesses and, in some cases, compel witnesses to testify. The [[Assistance of Counsel Clause]] grants criminal defendants the right to be assisted by counsel. In ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' and subsequent cases, the Supreme Court held that a [[Public defender (United States)|public defender]] must be provided to criminal defendants unable to afford an attorney in all trials where the defendant faces the possibility of imprisonment.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his <!--\n THIS IS THE CORRECT BRITISH SPELLING USED IN THE ACTUAL CONSTITUTION!\n-->defence<!--\n PLEASE *DO NOT* \"correct\" IT TO \"defense\"!\n-->.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html#6|title=Bill of Rights Transcript|publisher=Archives.gov|accessdate=2011-06-09}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb|The Bill of Rights in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\n{{wide image|Amendment_6.jpg|1999px|The hand-written copy of the proposed Bill of Rights, 1789, cropped to show the text that would later be ratified as the Sixth Amendment}}\n\n==Rights secured==\n===Speedy trial===\n{{Main|Speedy Trial Clause}}\nCriminal defendants have the right to a speedy trial. In ''[[Barker v. Wingo]]'', {{ussc|407|514|1972}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] laid down a four-part case-by-case [[balancing test]] for determining whether the defendant's speedy trial right has been violated. The four factors are:\n*''Length of delay''. A delay of a year or more from the date on which the speedy trial right \"attaches\" (the date of [[arrest]] or [[indictment]], whichever first occurs) was termed \"presumptively prejudicial,\" but the Court has never explicitly ruled that any absolute time limit applies.\n*''Reason for the delay''. The prosecution may not excessively delay the trial for its own advantage, but a trial may be delayed to secure the presence of an absent witness or other practical considerations (e.g., [[change of venue]]).\n*''Time and manner in which the defendant has asserted his right''. If a defendant agrees to the delay when it works to his own benefit, he cannot later claim that he has been unduly delayed.\n*''Degree of prejudice to the defendant which the delay has caused''.\n\nIn ''Strunk v. United States'', {{ussc|412|434|1973}}, the Supreme Court ruled that if the reviewing court finds that a defendant's right to a speedy trial was violated, then the indictment must be dismissed and/or the conviction overturned. The Court held that, since the delayed trial is the state action which violates the defendant's rights, no other remedy would be appropriate. Thus, a reversal or dismissal of a criminal case on speedy trial grounds means that no further prosecution for the alleged offense can take place.\n\n===Public trial===\n{{Main|Public trial}}\nIn ''[[Sheppard v. Maxwell]]'', {{ussc|384|333|1966}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the right to a public trial is not absolute. In cases where excess publicity would serve to undermine the defendant's right to due process, limitations can be put on public access to the proceedings. According to ''Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court'', {{ussc|478|1|1986}}, trials can be closed at the behest of the government if there is \"an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\" The accused may also request a closure of the trial; though, it must be demonstrated that \"first, there is a substantial probability that the defendant's right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent, and second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant's right to a fair trial.\"\n\n===Impartial jury===\n{{Main|Juries in the United States}}\nThe right to a jury has always depended on the nature of the offense with which the defendant is charged. Petty offenses&mdash;those punishable by imprisonment for no more than six months&mdash;are not covered by the jury requirement.<ref>''[[District of Columbia v. Clawans]]'', {{ussc|300|617|1937}} and ''[[Baldwin v. New York]]'', {{ussc|399|66|1970}}</ref> Even where multiple petty offenses are concerned, the total time of imprisonment possibly exceeding six months, the right to a jury trial does not exist.<ref>''[[Lewis v. United States]]'', {{ussc|518|322|1996}}</ref> Also, in the United States, except for serious offenses (such as [[murder]]), [[Minor (law)|minors]] are usually tried in a [[juvenile court]], which lessens the sentence allowed, but forfeits the right to a jury.\n\nOriginally, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial indicated a right to \"a trial by jury as understood and applied at [[common law]], and includes all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and [[England]] when the Constitution was adopted.\"<ref>''Patton v. United States'', {{ussc|281|276|1930}}</ref> Therefore, it was held that juries had to be composed of twelve persons and that verdicts had to be unanimous, as was customary in England.\n\nWhen, under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], the Supreme Court extended the right to a trial by jury to defendants in state courts, it re-examined some of the standards. It has been held that twelve came to be the number of jurors by \"historical accident,\" and that a jury of six would be sufficient,<ref>''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', {{ussc|399|78|1970}}</ref> but anything less would deprive the defendant of a right to trial by jury.<ref>''[[Ballew v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|435|223|1978}}</ref> In ''[[Ramos v. Louisiana]]'' (2020), the Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment mandates unanimity in all federal and state criminal jury trials.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/04/opinion-analysis-with-debate-over-adherence-to-precedent-justices-scrap-nonunanimous-jury-rule/|title=Opinion analysis: With debate over adherence to precedent, justices scrap nonunanimous jury rule|last=Howe|first=Amy|date=April 20, 2020|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Impartiality====\nThe Sixth Amendment requires juries to be impartial. Impartiality has been interpreted as requiring individual jurors to be unbiased. At ''[[voir dire]],'' each side may question potential jurors to determine any bias, and challenge them if the same is found; the court determines the validity of these challenges for cause. Defendants may not challenge a conviction because a challenge for cause was denied incorrectly if they had the opportunity to use [[peremptory challenge]]s.\n\nIn ''[[Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez v. Colorado]]'' (2017), the Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment requires a court in a criminal trial to investigate whether a jury's guilty verdict was based on racial bias. For a guilty verdict to be set aside based on the racial bias of a juror, the defendant must prove that the racial bias \"was a significant motivating factor in the juror's vote to convict.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/opinion-analysis-divided-court-rules-defendant-juror-bias-case/|title=Opinion analysis: Divided court rules for defendant in juror-bias case|last=Howe|first=Amy|date=March 6, 2017|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Venire of juries====\nAnother factor in determining the impartiality of the jury is the nature of the panel, or venire, from which the jurors are selected. Venires must represent a fair cross-section of the community; the defendant might establish that the requirement was violated by showing that the allegedly excluded group is a \"distinctive\" one in the community, that the representation of such a group in venires is unreasonable and unfair in regard to the number of persons belonging to such a group, and that the under-representation is caused by a systematic exclusion in the selection process. Thus, in ''[[Taylor v. Louisiana]]'', {{ussc|419|522|1975}}, the Supreme Court invalidated a state law that exempted women who had not made a declaration of willingness to serve from jury service, while not doing the same for men.\n\n====Sentencing====\nIn ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', {{ussc|530|466|2000}}, and ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|542|296|2004}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that a criminal defendant has a right to a jury trial not only on the question of guilt or innocence, but also regarding any fact used to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the maximum otherwise allowed by statutes or sentencing guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlrg.com/legal-content/the-lawletter/bid/72724/Criminal-Fines-Applicability-of-Apprendi-v-New-Jersey|title=Criminal Fines - Applicability of Apprendi v. New Jersey|last=Plank|first=Doug|date=December 20, 2011|publisher=National Legal Research Group|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref> In ''[[Alleyne v. United States]]'', 11-9335 (2013), the Court expanded on ''Apprendi'' and ''Blakely'' by ruling that a defendant's right to a jury applies to any fact that would increase a defendant's sentence beyond the minimum otherwise required by statute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/reconciling-ceilings-and-floors-alleyne-v-united-states/|title=Reconciling ceilings and floors: Alleyne v. United States|last=Gottlieb|first=Mike|date=June 17, 2013|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref> In ''[[United States v. Haymond]]'' (2019), the Court will decide whether jury fact finding is also required if a [[federal supervised release]] revocation would carry a mandatory minimum prison sentence.\n\n===Vicinage===\n{{main|Vicinage Clause}}\n[[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury|Article III, Section 2]] of the Constitution requires defendants be tried by juries and in the state in which the crime was committed. The Sixth Amendment requires the jury to be selected from judicial districts ascertained by statute. In ''[[Beavers v. Henkel]]'', {{ussc|194|73|1904}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the place where the offense is charged to have occurred determines a trial's location. Where multiple districts are alleged to have been locations of the crime, any of them may be chosen for the trial. In cases of offenses not committed in any state (for example, offenses committed at sea), the place of trial may be determined by the Congress.\n\n===Notice of accusation===\n{{Main|Notice}}\nA criminal defendant has the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. Therefore, an [[indictment]] must allege all the ingredients of the crime to such a degree of precision that it would allow the accused to assert [[double jeopardy]] if the same charges are brought up in subsequent prosecution.<ref>''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'', {{ussc|92|542|1876}}</ref> The Supreme Court held in ''[[United States v. Carll]]'', {{ussc|105|611|1881}}, that \"in an indictment... it is not sufficient to set forth the offense in the words of the statute, unless those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.\" Vague wording, even if taken directly from a statute, does not suffice. However, the government is not required to hand over written copies of the indictment free of charge.<ref>''[[United States v. Van Duzee]]'', {{ussc|140|169|1891}}</ref>\n\n===Confrontation===\n{{Main|Confrontation Clause}}\nThe Confrontation Clause relates to the common law rule preventing the admission of [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]], that is to say, testimony by one witness as to the statements and observations of another person to prove that the statement or observation was true. The rationale was that the defendant had no opportunity to challenge the credibility of and cross-examine the person making the statements. Certain exceptions to the hearsay rule have been permitted; for instance, admissions by the defendant are admissible, as are dying declarations.<ref>''[[Kirby v. United States]]'', {{ussc|174|47|1899}} (\"It is scarcely necessary to say that\u2026the admission of dying declarations...was well established before the adoption of the constitution, and was not intended to be abrogated.\")</ref> Nevertheless, in ''[[California v. Green]]'', {{ussc|399|149|1970}}, the Supreme Court has held that the hearsay rule is not the same as the Confrontation Clause. Hearsay is admissible under certain circumstances. For example, in ''[[Bruton v. United States]]'', 391 U.S. 123 (1968), the Supreme Court ruled that while a defendant's out of court statements were admissible in proving the defendant's guilt, they were inadmissible hearsay against another defendant. Hearsay may, in some circumstances, be admitted though it is not covered by one of the long-recognized exceptions. For example, prior testimony may sometimes be admitted if the witness is unavailable. However, in ''[[Crawford v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|541|36|2004}}, the Supreme Court increased the scope of the Confrontation Clause by ruling that \"testimonial\" out-of-court statements are inadmissible if the accused did not have the opportunity to cross-examine that accuser and that accuser is unavailable at trial. In ''[[Davis v. Washington]]'' {{ussc|547|813|2006}}, the Court ruled that \"testimonial\" refers to any statement that an objectively reasonable person in the declarant's situation would believe likely to be used in court. In ''[[Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts]]'', 557 U.S. 305 (2009), and ''[[Bullcoming v. New Mexico]]'', 564 U.S. 647 (2011), the Court ruled that admitting a [[Chemist|lab chemist's]] analysis into evidence, without having him testify, violated the Confrontation Clause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2009/06/analysis-law-need-not-bow-to-chemistry/|title=Analysis: Law need not bow to chemistry|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|date=June 25, 2009|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://federalevidence.com/evidence-resources/sixth-amendment-confrontation-clause/bullcoming-v-new-mexico|title=Bullcoming v. New Mexico Resource Page|publisher=Federal Evidence Review|accessdate=September 8, 2011}}</ref> In ''[[Michigan v. Bryant]]'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-150.ZO.html] 562 U.S. 344 (2011), the Court ruled that the \"primary purpose\" of a shooting victim's statement as to who shot him, and the police's reason for questioning him, each had to be [[Reasonable person|objectively]] determined. If the \"primary purpose\" was for dealing with an \"ongoing emergency\", then any such statement was not testimonial and so the Confrontation Clause would not require the person making that statement to testify in order for that statement to be admitted into evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joshblackman.com/blog/?p=6221|title=Instant Analysis of Michigan v. Bryant: The Confrontation of Social Cost|last=Blackman|first=Josh|date=February 28, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe right to confront and cross-examine witnesses also applies to physical evidence; the prosecution must present physical evidence to the jury, providing the defense ample opportunity to cross-examine its validity and meaning. Prosecution generally may not refer to evidence without first presenting it.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century this clause became an issue in the use of the [[silent witness rule]].<ref>{{cite journal |ssrn=1125459|title=The Muted Rise of the Silent Witness Rule in National Security Litigation|author=Johnathan M. Lamb |journal=[[Pepperdine Law Review]] |volume=36 |page=213|year=2008|publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]]}}</ref>\n\n===Compulsory process===\n{{Main|Compulsory Process Clause}}\nThe Compulsory Process Clause gives any criminal defendant the right to call witnesses in his favor. If any such witness refuses to testify, that witness may be compelled to do so by the court at the request of the defendant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/compulsory-process-clause.html|title=Compulsory Process Clause|work=Revolutionary War and Beyond}}</ref><ref>''[[United States v. Cooper]]'', {{ussc|Source=j|4|341|1800|Dallas|4}}</ref> However, in some cases the court may refuse to permit a defense witness to testify. For example, if a defense lawyer fails to notify the prosecution of the identity of a witness to gain a tactical advantage, that witness may be precluded from testifying.<ref>''[[Taylor v. Illinois]]'', {{ussc|484|400|1988}}</ref>\n\n===Assistance of counsel===\n{{Main|Assistance of Counsel Clause}}\nA criminal defendant has the right to be assisted by counsel.\n\nIn ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', {{ussc|287|45|1932}}, the Supreme Court ruled that \"in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel, and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him.\" In ''[[Johnson v. Zerbst]]'', {{ussc|304|458|1938}}, the Supreme Court ruled that in all federal cases, counsel would have to be appointed for defendants who were too poor to hire their own.\n\nIn 1961, the Court extended the rule that applied in federal courts to state courts. It held in ''[[Hamilton v. Alabama (1961)|Hamilton v. Alabama]]'', {{ussc|368|52|1961}}, that counsel had to be provided at no expense to defendants in capital cases when they so requested, even if there was no \"ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like.\" ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}, ruled that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony cases, overruling ''[[Betts v. Brady]]'', {{ussc|316|455|1942}}, in which the Court ruled that state courts had to appoint counsel only when the defendant demonstrated \"special circumstances\" requiring the assistance of counsel. Under ''[[Argersinger v. Hamlin]]'', {{ussc|407|25|1972}}, counsel must be appointed in any case resulting in a sentence of actual imprisonment. Regarding sentences not immediately leading to imprisonment, the Court in ''[[Scott v. Illinois]]'', {{ussc|440|367|1979}}, ruled that counsel did not need to be appointed, but in ''[[Alabama v. Shelton]]'', {{ussc|535|654|2002}}, the Court held that a [[suspended sentence]] that may result in incarceration can not be imposed if the defendant did not have counsel at trial.\n\nAs stated in ''[[Brewer v. Williams]]'', {{ussc|430|387|1977}}, the right to counsel \"[means] at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him, whether by formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"<ref>430 U.S. at 398</ref> ''Brewer'' goes on to conclude that once adversary proceedings have begun against a defendant, he has a right to legal assistance when the government interrogates him<ref>430 U.S. at 401, citing ''[[Massiah v. United States]]'', {{ussc|377|201|1964}}</ref> and that when a defendant is arrested, \"arraigned on [an arrest] warrant before a judge\", and \"committed by the court to confinement\", \"[t]here can be no doubt that judicial proceedings ha[ve] been initiated.\"\n\n====Self-representation====\n{{Main|Pro se legal representation in the United States}}\nA criminal defendant may represent himself, unless a court deems the defendant to be incompetent to waive the right to counsel.\n\nIn ''[[Faretta v. California]]'', {{ussc|422|806|1975}}, the Supreme Court recognized a defendant's right to ''pro se'' representation. However, under ''[[Godinez v. Moran]]'', {{ussc|509|389|1993}}, a court that believes the defendant is less than fully competent to represent himself can require that defendant to be assisted by counsel. In ''[[Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California]]'', {{ussc|528|152|2000}}, the Supreme Court ruled the right to ''pro se'' representation did not apply to appellate courts. In ''[[Indiana v. Edwards]]'', 554 U.S. 164 (2008), the Court ruled that a criminal defendant could be simultaneously competent to stand trial, but not competent to represent himself.\n\nIn ''[[Bounds v. Smith]]'', {{ussc|430|817|1977}}, the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right of \"meaningful access to the courts\" can be satisfied by counsel or access to legal materials.

It was ratified in 1791 as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applied]] most of the protections of this amendment to the states through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Due Process Clause|Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment]].\n\nThe Sixth Amendment grants criminal defendants the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial [[Juries in the United States|jury]] consisting of jurors from the state and district in which the crime was alleged to have been committed. Under the impartial jury requirement, jurors must be unbiased, and the jury must consist of a representative cross-section of the community. The right to a jury applies only to offenses in which the penalty is imprisonment for longer than six months. In ''[[Barker v. Wingo]]'', the Supreme Court articulated a [[balancing test]] to determine whether a defendant's right to a speedy trial had been violated, and held that any delay of longer than a year would be \"presumptively\" (but not absolutely) prejudicial. The Supreme Court has held that the requirement of a public trial is not absolute, and that both the government and the defendant can in some cases request a closed trial.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment requires that criminal defendants be given [[notice]] of the nature and cause of accusations against them. The amendment's [[Confrontation Clause]] gives criminal defendants the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, while the [[Compulsory Process Clause]] gives criminal defendants the right to call their own witnesses and, in some cases, compel witnesses to testify. The [[Assistance of Counsel Clause]] grants criminal defendants the right to be assisted by counsel. In ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' and subsequent cases, the Supreme Court held that a [[Public defender (United States)|public defender]] must be provided to criminal defendants unable to afford an attorney in all trials where the defendant faces the possibility of imprisonment.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his <!--\n THIS IS THE CORRECT BRITISH SPELLING USED IN THE ACTUAL CONSTITUTION!\n-->defence<!--\n PLEASE *DO NOT* \"correct\" IT TO \"defense\"!\n-->.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html#6|title=Bill of Rights Transcript|publisher=Archives.gov|accessdate=2011-06-09}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Bill of Rights Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb|The Bill of Rights in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]\n{{wide image|Amendment_6.jpg|1999px|The hand-written copy of the proposed Bill of Rights, 1789, cropped to show the text that would later be ratified as the Sixth Amendment}}\n\n==Rights secured==\n===Speedy trial===\n{{Main|Speedy Trial Clause}}\nCriminal defendants have the right to a speedy trial. In ''[[Barker v. Wingo]]'', {{ussc|407|514|1972}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] laid down a four-part case-by-case [[balancing test]] for determining whether the defendant's speedy trial right has been violated. The four factors are:\n*''Length of delay''. A delay of a year or more from the date on which the speedy trial right \"attaches\" (the date of [[arrest]] or [[indictment]], whichever first occurs) was termed \"presumptively prejudicial,\" but the Court has never explicitly ruled that any absolute time limit applies.\n*''Reason for the delay''. The prosecution may not excessively delay the trial for its own advantage, but a trial may be delayed to secure the presence of an absent witness or other practical considerations (e.g., [[change of venue]]).\n*''Time and manner in which the defendant has asserted his right''. If a defendant agrees to the delay when it works to his own benefit, he cannot later claim that he has been unduly delayed.\n*''Degree of prejudice to the defendant which the delay has caused''.\n\nIn ''Strunk v. United States'', {{ussc|412|434|1973}}, the Supreme Court ruled that if the reviewing court finds that a defendant's right to a speedy trial was violated, then the indictment must be dismissed and/or the conviction overturned. The Court held that, since the delayed trial is the state action which violates the defendant's rights, no other remedy would be appropriate. Thus, a reversal or dismissal of a criminal case on speedy trial grounds means that no further prosecution for the alleged offense can take place.\n\n===Public trial===\n{{Main|Public trial}}\nIn ''[[Sheppard v. Maxwell]]'', {{ussc|384|333|1966}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the right to a public trial is not absolute. In cases where excess publicity would serve to undermine the defendant's right to due process, limitations can be put on public access to the proceedings. According to ''Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court'', {{ussc|478|1|1986}}, trials can be closed at the behest of the government if there is \"an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\" The accused may also request a closure of the trial; though, it must be demonstrated that \"first, there is a substantial probability that the defendant's right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent, and second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant's right to a fair trial.\"\n\n===Impartial jury===\n{{Main|Juries in the United States}}\nThe right to a jury has always depended on the nature of the offense with which the defendant is charged. Petty offenses&mdash;those punishable by imprisonment for no more than six months&mdash;are not covered by the jury requirement.<ref>''[[District of Columbia v. Clawans]]'', {{ussc|300|617|1937}} and ''[[Baldwin v. New York]]'', {{ussc|399|66|1970}}</ref> Even where multiple petty offenses are concerned, the total time of imprisonment possibly exceeding six months, the right to a jury trial does not exist.<ref>''[[Lewis v. United States]]'', {{ussc|518|322|1996}}</ref> Also, in the United States, except for serious offenses (such as [[murder]]), [[Minor (law)|minors]] are usually tried in a [[juvenile court]], which lessens the sentence allowed, but forfeits the right to a jury.\n\nOriginally, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial indicated a right to \"a trial by jury as understood and applied at [[common law]], and includes all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and [[England]] when the Constitution was adopted.\"<ref>''Patton v. United States'', {{ussc|281|276|1930}}</ref> Therefore, it was held that juries had to be composed of twelve persons and that verdicts had to be unanimous, as was customary in England.\n\nWhen, under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], the Supreme Court extended the right to a trial by jury to defendants in state courts, it re-examined some of the standards. It has been held that twelve came to be the number of jurors by \"historical accident,\" and that a jury of six would be sufficient,<ref>''[[Williams v. Florida]]'', {{ussc|399|78|1970}}</ref> but anything less would deprive the defendant of a right to trial by jury.<ref>''[[Ballew v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|435|223|1978}}</ref> The Sixth Amendment mandates unanimity in all federal and state jury trials.<ref>''[[Ramos v. Louisiana]]'' (2020), https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/supreme-court-bolsters-unanimous-jury-rule-in-louisiana-case</ref>\n\n====Impartiality====\nThe Sixth Amendment requires juries to be impartial. Impartiality has been interpreted as requiring individual jurors to be unbiased. At ''[[voir dire]],'' each side may question potential jurors to determine any bias, and challenge them if the same is found; the court determines the validity of these challenges for cause. Defendants may not challenge a conviction because a challenge for cause was denied incorrectly if they had the opportunity to use [[peremptory challenge]]s.\n\nIn ''[[Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez v. Colorado]]'' (2017), the Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment requires a court in a criminal trial to investigate whether a jury's guilty verdict was based on racial bias. For a guilty verdict to be set aside based on the racial bias of a juror, the defendant must prove that the racial bias \"was a significant motivating factor in the juror's vote to convict.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/03/opinion-analysis-divided-court-rules-defendant-juror-bias-case/|title=Opinion analysis: Divided court rules for defendant in juror-bias case|last=Howe|first=Amy|date=March 6, 2017|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=March 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Venire of juries====\nAnother factor in determining the impartiality of the jury is the nature of the panel, or venire, from which the jurors are selected. Venires must represent a fair cross-section of the community; the defendant might establish that the requirement was violated by showing that the allegedly excluded group is a \"distinctive\" one in the community, that the representation of such a group in venires is unreasonable and unfair in regard to the number of persons belonging to such a group, and that the under-representation is caused by a systematic exclusion in the selection process. Thus, in ''[[Taylor v. Louisiana]]'', {{ussc|419|522|1975}}, the Supreme Court invalidated a state law that exempted women who had not made a declaration of willingness to serve from jury service, while not doing the same for men.\n\n====Sentencing====\nIn ''[[Apprendi v. New Jersey]]'', {{ussc|530|466|2000}}, and ''[[Blakely v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|542|296|2004}}, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that a criminal defendant has a right to a jury trial not only on the question of guilt or innocence, but also regarding any fact used to increase the defendant's sentence beyond the maximum otherwise allowed by statutes or sentencing guidelines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nlrg.com/legal-content/the-lawletter/bid/72724/Criminal-Fines-Applicability-of-Apprendi-v-New-Jersey|title=Criminal Fines - Applicability of Apprendi v. New Jersey|last=Plank|first=Doug|date=December 20, 2011|publisher=National Legal Research Group|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref> In ''[[Alleyne v. United States]]'', 11-9335 (2013), the Court expanded on ''Apprendi'' and ''Blakely'' by ruling that a defendant's right to a jury applies to any fact that would increase a defendant's sentence beyond the minimum otherwise required by statute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/06/reconciling-ceilings-and-floors-alleyne-v-united-states/|title=Reconciling ceilings and floors: Alleyne v. United States|last=Gottlieb|first=Mike|date=June 17, 2013|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref> In ''[[United States v. Haymond]]'' (2019), the Court will decide whether jury fact finding is also required if a [[federal supervised release]] revocation would carry a mandatory minimum prison sentence.\n\n===Vicinage===\n{{main|Vicinage Clause}}\n[[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury|Article III, Section 2]] of the Constitution requires defendants be tried by juries and in the state in which the crime was committed. The Sixth Amendment requires the jury to be selected from judicial districts ascertained by statute. In ''[[Beavers v. Henkel]]'', {{ussc|194|73|1904}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the place where the offense is charged to have occurred determines a trial's location. Where multiple districts are alleged to have been locations of the crime, any of them may be chosen for the trial. In cases of offenses not committed in any state (for example, offenses committed at sea), the place of trial may be determined by the Congress.\n\n===Notice of accusation===\n{{Main|Notice}}\nA criminal defendant has the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. Therefore, an [[indictment]] must allege all the ingredients of the crime to such a degree of precision that it would allow the accused to assert [[double jeopardy]] if the same charges are brought up in subsequent prosecution.<ref>''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'', {{ussc|92|542|1876}}</ref> The Supreme Court held in ''[[United States v. Carll]]'', {{ussc|105|611|1881}}, that \"in an indictment... it is not sufficient to set forth the offense in the words of the statute, unless those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished.\" Vague wording, even if taken directly from a statute, does not suffice. However, the government is not required to hand over written copies of the indictment free of charge.<ref>''[[United States v. Van Duzee]]'', {{ussc|140|169|1891}}</ref>\n\n===Confrontation===\n{{Main|Confrontation Clause}}\nThe Confrontation Clause relates to the common law rule preventing the admission of [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]], that is to say, testimony by one witness as to the statements and observations of another person to prove that the statement or observation was true. The rationale was that the defendant had no opportunity to challenge the credibility of and cross-examine the person making the statements. Certain exceptions to the hearsay rule have been permitted; for instance, admissions by the defendant are admissible, as are dying declarations.<ref>''[[Kirby v. United States]]'', {{ussc|174|47|1899}} (\"It is scarcely necessary to say that\u2026the admission of dying declarations...was well established before the adoption of the constitution, and was not intended to be abrogated.\")</ref> Nevertheless, in ''[[California v. Green]]'', {{ussc|399|149|1970}}, the Supreme Court has held that the hearsay rule is not the same as the Confrontation Clause. Hearsay is admissible under certain circumstances. For example, in ''[[Bruton v. United States]]'', 391 U.S. 123 (1968), the Supreme Court ruled that while a defendant's out of court statements were admissible in proving the defendant's guilt, they were inadmissible hearsay against another defendant. Hearsay may, in some circumstances, be admitted though it is not covered by one of the long-recognized exceptions. For example, prior testimony may sometimes be admitted if the witness is unavailable. However, in ''[[Crawford v. Washington]]'', {{ussc|541|36|2004}}, the Supreme Court increased the scope of the Confrontation Clause by ruling that \"testimonial\" out-of-court statements are inadmissible if the accused did not have the opportunity to cross-examine that accuser and that accuser is unavailable at trial. In ''[[Davis v. Washington]]'' {{ussc|547|813|2006}}, the Court ruled that \"testimonial\" refers to any statement that an objectively reasonable person in the declarant's situation would believe likely to be used in court. In ''[[Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts]]'', 557 U.S. 305 (2009), and ''[[Bullcoming v. New Mexico]]'', 564 U.S. 647 (2011), the Court ruled that admitting a [[Chemist|lab chemist's]] analysis into evidence, without having him testify, violated the Confrontation Clause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2009/06/analysis-law-need-not-bow-to-chemistry/|title=Analysis: Law need not bow to chemistry|last=Denniston|first=Lyle|date=June 25, 2009|publisher=[[SCOTUSblog]]|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://federalevidence.com/evidence-resources/sixth-amendment-confrontation-clause/bullcoming-v-new-mexico|title=Bullcoming v. New Mexico Resource Page|publisher=Federal Evidence Review|accessdate=September 8, 2011}}</ref> In ''[[Michigan v. Bryant]]'', [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-150.ZO.html] 562 U.S. 344 (2011), the Court ruled that the \"primary purpose\" of a shooting victim's statement as to who shot him, and the police's reason for questioning him, each had to be [[Reasonable person|objectively]] determined. If the \"primary purpose\" was for dealing with an \"ongoing emergency\", then any such statement was not testimonial and so the Confrontation Clause would not require the person making that statement to testify in order for that statement to be admitted into evidence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joshblackman.com/blog/?p=6221|title=Instant Analysis of Michigan v. Bryant: The Confrontation of Social Cost|last=Blackman|first=Josh|date=February 28, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe right to confront and cross-examine witnesses also applies to physical evidence; the prosecution must present physical evidence to the jury, providing the defense ample opportunity to cross-examine its validity and meaning. Prosecution generally may not refer to evidence without first presenting it.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st century this clause became an issue in the use of the [[silent witness rule]].<ref>{{cite journal |ssrn=1125459|title=The Muted Rise of the Silent Witness Rule in National Security Litigation|author=Johnathan M. Lamb |journal=[[Pepperdine Law Review]] |volume=36 |page=213|year=2008|publisher=[[Social Science Research Network]]}}</ref>\n\n===Compulsory process===\n{{Main|Compulsory Process Clause}}\nThe Compulsory Process Clause gives any criminal defendant the right to call witnesses in his favor. If any such witness refuses to testify, that witness may be compelled to do so by the court at the request of the defendant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.revolutionary-war-and-beyond.com/compulsory-process-clause.html|title=Compulsory Process Clause|work=Revolutionary War and Beyond}}</ref><ref>''[[United States v. Cooper]]'', {{ussc|Source=j|4|341|1800|Dallas|4}}</ref> However, in some cases the court may refuse to permit a defense witness to testify. For example, if a defense lawyer fails to notify the prosecution of the identity of a witness to gain a tactical advantage, that witness may be precluded from testifying.<ref>''[[Taylor v. Illinois]]'', {{ussc|484|400|1988}}</ref>\n\n===Assistance of counsel===\n{{Main|Assistance of Counsel Clause}}\nA criminal defendant has the right to be assisted by counsel.\n\nIn ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'', {{ussc|287|45|1932}}, the Supreme Court ruled that \"in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel, and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him.\" In ''[[Johnson v. Zerbst]]'', {{ussc|304|458|1938}}, the Supreme Court ruled that in all federal cases, counsel would have to be appointed for defendants who were too poor to hire their own.\n\nIn 1961, the Court extended the rule that applied in federal courts to state courts. It held in ''[[Hamilton v. Alabama (1961)|Hamilton v. Alabama]]'', {{ussc|368|52|1961}}, that counsel had to be provided at no expense to defendants in capital cases when they so requested, even if there was no \"ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like.\" ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}, ruled that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony cases, overruling ''[[Betts v. Brady]]'', {{ussc|316|455|1942}}, in which the Court ruled that state courts had to appoint counsel only when the defendant demonstrated \"special circumstances\" requiring the assistance of counsel. Under ''[[Argersinger v. Hamlin]]'', {{ussc|407|25|1972}}, counsel must be appointed in any case resulting in a sentence of actual imprisonment. Regarding sentences not immediately leading to imprisonment, the Court in ''[[Scott v. Illinois]]'', {{ussc|440|367|1979}}, ruled that counsel did not need to be appointed, but in ''[[Alabama v. Shelton]]'', {{ussc|535|654|2002}}, the Court held that a [[suspended sentence]] that may result in incarceration can not be imposed if the defendant did not have counsel at trial.\n\nAs stated in ''[[Brewer v. Williams]]'', {{ussc|430|387|1977}}, the right to counsel \"[means] at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him, whether by formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\"<ref>430 U.S. at 398</ref> ''Brewer'' goes on to conclude that once adversary proceedings have begun against a defendant, he has a right to legal assistance when the government interrogates him<ref>430 U.S. at 401, citing ''[[Massiah v. United States]]'', {{ussc|377|201|1964}}</ref> and that when a defendant is arrested, \"arraigned on [an arrest] warrant before a judge\", and \"committed by the court to confinement\", \"[t]here can be no doubt that judicial proceedings ha[ve] been initiated.\"\n\n====Self-representation====\n{{Main|Pro se legal representation in the United States}}\nA criminal defendant may represent himself, unless a court deems the defendant to be incompetent to waive the right to counsel.\n\nIn ''[[Faretta v. California]]'', {{ussc|422|806|1975}}, the Supreme Court recognized a defendant's right to ''pro se'' representation. However, under ''[[Godinez v. Moran]]'', {{ussc|509|389|1993}}, a court that believes the defendant is less than fully competent to represent himself can require that defendant to be assisted by counsel. In ''[[Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California]]'', {{ussc|528|152|2000}}, the Supreme Court ruled the right to ''pro se'' representation did not apply to appellate courts. In ''[[Indiana v. Edwards]]'', 554 U.S. 164 (2008), the Court ruled that a criminal defendant could be simultaneously competent to stand trial, but not competent to represent himself.\n\nIn ''[[Bounds v. Smith]]'', {{ussc|430|817|1977}}, the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right of \"meaningful access to the courts\" can be satisfied by counsel or access to legal materials. ''Bounds'' has been interpreted by several [[United States courts of appeals]] to mean a ''pro se'' defendant does not have a constitutional right to access a prison law library to research his defense when access to the courts has been provided through appointed counsel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/law/LawArticleFriendly.jsp?id=900005540691|title=2nd Circuit: Having a Lawyer Satisfies Test for Court Access|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607111643/https://www.law.com/jsp/law/LawArticleFriendly.jsp?id=900005540691|archivedate=June 7, 2011|publisher=Law.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Trial in absentia|Trial ''in absentia'']]\n* [[United States constitutional criminal procedure]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081211012558/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/browse.html Kilman, Johnny and George Costello (Eds).

He directed more than 20 campaigns and won 65 [[pitched battle]]s, during which he conquered or overran more territory than any other commander in history.<ref>Ch 1 Great Captains Unveiled Liddell Hart {{ISBN|0-8369-0618-7}}</ref> He gained victory by means of imaginative and sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that were hundreds of kilometers away from each other. Subutai is well known for his expedition from central Asia to the Russian steppe and into Europe. \n\n==Early life==\nHistorians believe Subutai was born in the year 1175,<ref>Gabriel, Richard. \"Genghis Khan's Greatest General Subotai the Valiant\". University of Oklahoma Press, 2004, p. 6.</ref> probably just west of the upper [[Onon River]] in what is now [[Mongolia]]. He belonged to the [[Uriankhai]] clan, known as the reindeer people, a group of Siberian forest-dwellers who did not live like the plains Mongols to their south. As a result of his upbringing, Subutai lacked the natural horsemanship training from birth that all Mongols possessed, making him an outsider among them.<ref>Gabriel, 6-8.</ref> Subutai's family had been associated with the family of Temujin (future Genghis Khan) for many generations. Subutai's great-great grandfather, Nerbi, was supposedly an ally of the Mongol Khan Tumbina Sechen. Subutai's father, Jarchigudai, supposedly supplied food to Temujin and his followers when they were in dire straits at lake Baljuna, and Subutai's elder brother [[Jelme]] also served as a general in the Mongol army and was a close companion of Temujin. Jelme rescued a severely wounded Temujin (hit by an arrow from [[Jebe]], then an enemy) in the process of unification of the Mongolian plateau. Another brother, Chaurkhan (also romanized as Ca'urqan) is mentioned in the [[The Secret History of the Mongols|Secret History of the Mongols]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tsendiin Damdins\u00fcren |first= |year=1970 |title=\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0443\u0443\u0446 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0447\u043e\u043e |edition=1st |language=Mongolian |trans-title=[[The Secret History of the Mongols]] |chapter=120 (III)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Subutai's biography in the [[History of Yuan]]Subutai's father was once driving a herd of sheep in order to present them to his overlord, Taizu (Genghis Khan). Encountering robbers, he was seized. Huluhun (Subutai's brother) and Subutai arrived in good time, and with their lances stabbed some of the robbers. Horses and men fell together, and the remainder of the band withdrew and departed. Consequently, they relieved their father's difficulty, and the sheep were able to attain the emperor's station.<ref>Yuanshi, 121, 1a-5a</ref>\n\nDespite this close family association, some consider Subutai's career proof that the [[Mongol Empire]] was a [[meritocracy]]. He was a commoner by birth, the son of Jarchigudai, who was supposedly a [[blacksmith]]. When he was 14 years old, Subutai left his clan to join Temujin's army, following in the footsteps of his older brother Jelme who had joined when he was 17 years old, and he rose to the very highest command available to one who was not a blood relative to Genghis.<ref>Gabriel 2004, pp. 1, 3.</ref>  Within a decade he rose to become a general, in command of one of 4 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] operating in the vanguard. During the invasion of Northern China in 1211, Subutai was partnered with the senior Mongol general Jebe, an apprentice and partnership they would maintain until Jebe's death in 1223. In 1212 he took Huan by storm, the first major independent exploit mentioned in the sources. Genghis Khan is reported to have called him one of his \"dogs of war,\" who were 4 of his 8 top lieutenants, in ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'':<ref>Cummins, Joseph.

These four dogs are [[Jebe]], and Kublai (different than [[Kublai Khan]]), [[Jelme]], and Subotai.|The Secret History of the Mongols}}\n\nAppointed to the prestigious post of Genghis Khan's ger (yurt) door guard during his teen years, Mongol histories say that Subutai said to [[Genghis Khan]], \"I will ward off your enemies as felt cloth protects one from the wind.\"<ref name=Saunders>Saunders, J. J. (1971). ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. {{ISBN|0-8122-1766-7}}</ref> This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere around his late teens and early twenties.<ref>Gabriel, 10</ref> Throughout most of Genghis Khan's lifetime, Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite [[Jebe]] (1211\u201312, 1213\u201314, 1219\u201323) and [[Muqali]] (1213\u201314), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219).\n\nSubutai's first chance at independent command came in 1197 during action against the [[Merkit]], when he was just 22 years old.  Subutai's role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan's offer for extra elite troops, and instead traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals.<ref>Gabriel, 12-13.</ref>  He also served as a commander of the vanguard with distinction in the 1204 battle against the Naiman that gave the Mongols total control over Mongolia.\n\n==As a general==\nSubutai was a major innovator in the art of war. In the invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated large forces often separated by large distances.  Subutai's maneuvers were designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and [[Scorched earth|devastated the surrounded agriculture]] so that the remaining people would starve if they remained within fortified walls.<ref>Gabriel, Chapter 8; Carl Svedrup, Sube`etei Ba`atur, Anonymous Strategist.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the [[battle of Carrhae]] or the [[battle of Manzikert]], Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the [[battle of the Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.<ref>Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015), 157-159.</ref>\n\nSubutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of engineers in [[siege warfare]]. Even in field battles he made use of [[siege engine]]s. In the [[Battle of Mohi]], the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. Subutai ordered huge [[Lithobolos|stonethrower]]<nowiki/>s to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more akin to the [[Barrage (artillery)|creeping barrage]] of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right before an attack.<ref>Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War.</ref> \n\nLike Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity.  \n\n==Central Asian campaigns (1217\u20131220)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Central Asia}}\nIn 1217, Genghis Khan sent Subutai to hunt down the hated [[Merkit]]s and their allies, the [[Cumania|Cuman-Kipchak confederation]], in modern-day central Kazakhstan. Subutai defeated them on the [[Chu River]] in 1217 and again in 1219 in [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchak]] territory. Before the battle of the Chem River in 1219, Subutai had his vanguard carry children's toys and leave them behind, as if they were a group of families fleeing from the Merkit. As a result of this deception, Subutai's army was able to surprise, encircle, and capture of all the Merkit/Kipchak leadership.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2975-76.</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Mohammad II]] of [[Khwarizm]] attacked Subutai shortly afterwards along the Irghiz River. Despite being outnumbered three to one against the Sultan's elite forces which had conquered much of Central Asia, Subutai held him off after a fierce battle and retreated during the night. According to Persian sources, this battle seems to have eroded Mohammed's confidence in his ability to defeat the Mongols in pitched battle, since Subutai only commanded a small 20,000 man force and did not want to even fight him. Supposedly the Mongol army had destroyed his left wing, and nearly broken his center and captured him, until reinforcements from his son arrived and the battlefield turned dark.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 370\u2013371.</ref> Because of this battle, Mohammed was unable to take advantage of the upheaval in the [[Kara-Khitai]] Empire (simultaneously being conquered by the Mongolian general Jebe), like he had in earlier wars.\n\nGenghis Khan led the Mongol army westwards in late 1219 to invade [[Khwarazm|Khwarizm]] as retaliation for the execution of Mongol ambassadors. With roughly 100,000 armed men, the Mongol army was numerically inferior to the forces of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarizim Empire]], but through deception and rapid maneuver, the Mongols defeated the isolated Khwarezm armies in detail before they could react. Serving as the Mongol equivalent of Genghis Khan's Chief of Staff, Subutai marched with the Khan's army through the deadly [[Kyzylkum Desert]] to emerge behind the Khwarezm defense network at Bukhara.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 373\u2013385.</ref> After the rapid capture of the Khwarezm center of defense, Samarkand, Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 30,000 men to hunt the Khwarezm Shah and prevent him from rallying the other Khwarezm armies. Shah Mohammad attempted to save himself by fleeing into central [[Persia]], but while he eluded capture, the relentless chase meant he could not rally his forces. As a result, the several hundred thousand man Khwarezm forces in reserve remained divided and were easily destroyed piecemeal by Genghis Khan's main army.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'',  375\u2013410.</ref> Drained by the fierce pursuit, Mohammed fell ill and died at a fishing village on an island in the Caspian Sea in early 1221, an ignominious end for the man who styled himself the 'Second Alexander'.\n\n==Great Cavalry Raid (1220\u20131223)==\nSubutai and Jebe spent part of the 1219 winter in [[Azerbaijan]] and Iran, raiding and looting while preventing the western Khwarezm forces from assisting the rest of the empire to the east. Here he conceived the idea of conducting the most audacious reconnaissance-in-force in history, which was described by Edward Gibbon as [an expedition] \"which has never been attempted, and has never been repeated\": 20,000 Mongol forces would circle the [[Caspian Sea]] through the Caucasus Mountains to fall on the rear of the Wild [[Kipchaks]] and [[Cumans]].<ref>''In the Service of the Khans'', 19.</ref>\n\nAfter destroying resistance in Persia and submitting Azerbaijan, the Mongols invaded the Christian Kingdom of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Though the Georgian king was reluctant to actually commit to battle, Subutai and Jebe forced his hand by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. Subutai and Jebe then defeated a powerful Georgian army with many thousands of knights at the [[Battle of Caucasus Mountain|Battle of the Caucasus Mountains]], by luring the knights away from their infantry with a feigned retreat, then enveloping the knights. After destroying them, the Mongols encircled and crushed the Georgian army. Subutai, who was identified by the Georgians as being in command, originally lured the Georgians into thinking his army was a friendly ally by having his men in front parade crosses, and using spies to start false rumors that the Mongols were actually Christian wonder-workers who had come to assist the Georgians.<ref>Kirakos Gandzaketsi, History of the Armenians, 166\u2013167.</ref> This Mongol reconnaissance mission may have inadvertently altered the history of the Crusades, as Georgia had planned on sending their now destroyed army to join the [[Fifth Crusade]]. Instead, King George's sister Rusudan had to write to the Pope to explain that they could not assist the Crusade because their whole army had been disintegrated.<ref>Oliver of Paderborn, \"The Capture of Damietta\", trans. Joseph J. Gavigan, ''Christian Society and the Crusades, 1198\u20131229'', ed. Edward Peters (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 90, 123\u2013124.</ref> Though Georgia lay defenseless after these catastrophic defeats, the Mongol mission was to raid and scout, not conquer.\n\nAfter ravaging Georgia, the Mongols cut across the [[Caucasus Mountains]] during the winter to get around the [[Derbent]] Pass. The Mongols were tricked by their guides into taking a [[Wikt:perilous#Adjective|perilous]] route and emerged from the mountains exhausted, only to be confronted with a far larger steppe coalition army. Using clever diplomacy, Subutai isolated and defeated the [[Alans]], [[Circassians]], and Don Kipchaks/Cumans in detail. After plundering the southern Russian steppes, the Russian princes united with the retreating Cuman confederacy to defeat the Mongols with an 80,000 man host. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Subutai sacrificed the 1,000 men of his rear guard to induce the coalition army to recklessly pursue him and become separated. After 9 days of pursuit, Jebe and Subutai suddenly turned and crushed the combined [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and [[Cuman]] army at the [[Battle of the Kalka River|Kalka]] (31 May 1223). The Volga Bulgars claimed that they had ambushed Subutai's army, but historians have doubted this account in light of the Mongols seeking out and defeating the Qangli Turks in southern Russia shortly afterward.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 607\u2013613.</ref>\n\n==Invasions of the Xi Xia and Jin Chinese (1207, 1209, 1211\u20131215, 1226\u201327)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nIn the initial invasion of the Jin in 1211, Subutai served with Jebe's army that attacked the Chinese forts around the eastern edge of the Great Wall (not the Ming [[Great Wall]]). In late 1211 he was the first to scale the walls of the key fortress of Huan-Chou, and took part in the ambush of a major Jin army at Wu Sha Pao and the climactic [[battle of Yehuling]]. In 1212, he may have served with Jebe during the latter's daring capture of Liaoyang, and in 1213 he served with Muqali and Jebe in a great raid in Shandong.<ref>''In the Service of the Khan'', Paul Buell, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nSubutai played a key part in the campaign against the Tanguts of [[Xi Xia]] in 1226, serving as commander of the flank army to strike the Tanguts in the rear. While Genghis invaded the Xi Xia by a more traditional northern route, Subutai unexpectedly attacked from the west over the mountains and inhospitable deserts in modern Turkestan, causing Tangut resistance to collapse. The Tangut Empire was cut in two: with Genghis preventing reinforcements being sent west, Subutai subdued resistance in the west and joined with Genghis's main army to conquer the east. In 1227, he conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] districts along the upper [[Wei River]], and even raided the Kingdom of Tibet.<ref>Buell, 20.</ref> Though the Mongols conquered Xi Xia, Mongol operations against Jin China were interrupted by the death of Genghis Khan in 1227. Genghis Khan was succeeded by his son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] in 1229.\n\n===Conquest of Jin China (1231\u20131235)===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nAfter a humiliating defeat by the resurgent Jin in 1230\u20131231, \u00d6gedei personally led the main Mongol army against the Jin (in Central [[China]]) and appointed Subutai to salvage the situation. Subutai had originally been assigned to conquer the Kipchak Turks in central Russia in 1229,<ref>Rashid al-Din, ''Annals of Ogedei Khan'', 33.</ref> but was hurriedly recalled to China in 1229\u20131230 after the Mongolian general Dolqolqu suffered a major defeat.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31.</ref> Against Subutai, the Jin generals retreated from Shaanxi and implemented a scorched earth policy to hold the fortified Tongguan Pass and block any access to the Jin stronghold of Henan. They calculated that the scorched earth policies would deny the Mongols the ability to sustain a lengthy siege, and their lines of fortifications and difficult terrain would prevent the Mongols from outmaneuvering them.\n\nSubutai initially attempted to outflank the Jin by feinting an attack at the fortified location of Weizhou and maneuvering through an unguarded side corridor. Though the Jin were fooled by the feint, they moved with great alacrity once Subutai's main advance was discovered, and the attempt to break into the plains of [[Henan]] ended in failure after Subutai's advanced raiding parties were checked at Shan-ch\u2019e-hui. The Mongols defeated a relieving force and captured Fengxiang, a secondary target, by concentrating 400 trebuchets at a corner of the wall. However, the overall campaign seemed to have reached a stalemate.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 1231\u20131232 Subutai made another attempt to outmaneuver the Jin fortified lines by using a similar highly audacious approach that they had employed in Khwarezm (1219) and Xi Xia (1226). The Mongols divided into three armies, one to attack Henan from the North in the center of the Yellow River, another to attempt to cross the Yellow River in Shandong in the east, and the last, under Subutai and [[Tolui]], invading the [[Song Empire]] and attacking Henan from the more exposed south.<ref>Atwood, 34.</ref> The Song initially refused to allow the Mongols passage through the rugged Qinling mountains, so Subutai dodged their forces and isolated the mountain citadels one by one. Disheartened by the ease of the Mongol advance against their strong fortifications, the Song agreed to supply guides.<ref>Yuan Shi, 115.2885-6.</ref> This time Subutai was able to outmaneuver the Jin armies and cross the Han River to invade Henan from the south.\n\nThe main Jin army promptly marched to intercept Subutai's army at Mount Yu. Its commander, Wan Yen Heda attempted to ambush the Mongols, but the ambush was detected. In turn, the Mongols attempted to draw him into their own ambush with a feigned retreat, but he held his strong position. After a full day of fierce fighting that resulted in a stalemate, the Mongols retreated under darkness and attempted to hide their trail and outflank the Jin. Wan Yen Heda had retreated towards the city of Tengzhou in order to obtain supplies. Changing tracks, Subutai, identifying that the Jin were vulnerable to attrition, used a feint attack to temporarily divert the Jin forces away from their supply train, which he promptly seized with a hidden force.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Rather than continually attempting to attack the vigilant Jin during their retreat, Subutai instead dispersed his army into several detachments to target supplies in the area. 3,000 men masked the Mongol dispersion and occupied the Jin's attention, while other Mongol forces slowly slipped away from the field in small numbers to hide their movements towards the Jin capital of Kaifeng, the route that Wan Yen Heda was retreating along.<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube'etei Ba'atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nWith part of his force harassing the Jin army's foragers, the other units marched around the flanks in a wide arc and emerged ahead of the Jin army, aiming to destroy or steal the supplies of nearby villages along the Jin's line of retreat. Ogedei Khan had been able to cross the Yellow River after the Jin army blocking him had to march south to help Wan Yan Heda. With Subutai's army having maneuvered along the Jin rear, Ogedei was able to send reinforcements to Subutai, bringing the total Mongol strength to 50,000 men. After these reinforcements arrived and with the Jin army's food supplies severely depleted over the past three weeks, Subutai forced a battle on his terms and won a decisive victory at the [[battle of Sanfeng Mountain]] (9 February 1232), capturing Wan Yen Heda and annihilating the main Jin army which had nowhere safe to retreat to. He then made forced marches and eliminated the other Jin armies holding the other fronts at the battles of Yangyi (24 February 1232), and T\u2019iehling (1 March 1232).<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube`etei Ba`atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nThe heavily fortified city of Kaifeng required an eight month long siege. Subutai was forced to construct lines of [[Wikt:circumvallate#Verb|circumvallation]] that had a perimeter stretching {{convert|54|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the Jin began to employ a cutting edge gunpowder weapon called \"Thunder Crash Bombs\", which made it very difficult for the Mongols to get close enough for more concentrated fire. After cutting off Kaifeng from any outside help, Subutai alternated intense bombardments using a mixture of Muslim trebuchets, [[mangonel]]<nowiki/>s, and captured gunpowder with periods of rest and plundering the countryside. The Mongol dispersion helped them avoid contagion by the plague that devastated Kaifeng, and after being stretched to the limit, the Emperor fled and the city surrendered. Subutai originally wanted to execute everyone in Kaifeng to punish them for their [[Wikt:intransigence|intransigence]] and extremely long resistance. However, \u00d6gedei intervened and ordered Subutai to treat them fairly. <ref>McLynn, 407\u2013410.</ref>  With assistance from the Song Dynasty, the last Jin stronghold of Caizhou fell in 1234.\n\nHowever, it did not take the Song long to fall out with the Mongols. Two Song armies seized [[Kaifeng]] and [[Luoyang]] during the summer of 1234 during Subutai's absence. Subutai returned, destroyed the three Song armies by isolating and defeating them , and retook the cities. He then made a preemptive raid into Song territory to force them to adopt a defensive position.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Though war had begun between the Mongols and Song, Subutai was recalled to the west. Still, Subutai's victories had taught the Song a lesson they would heed: no Song army would dare venture north to attack Mongol territory afterward.\n\n==Conquest of Russia (1236\u20131240)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'}}\n\u00d6gedei decided to send a major part of the army into the western regions to finally crush the [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchaks]] and [[Bulgars]]. Subutai was tasked to direct the operations (under the overall command of prince [[Batu Khan|Batu]]). This mission was more than just a typical invasion: \u00d6gedei sent many of the next generation of Mongol princes, including the heirs of each of the four families, most likely to be trained by Subutai before he died.<ref>McLynn, 435.</ref> In order to crush the Volga Bulgars, who had previously defeated Batu in 1232, Subutai launched another giant encirclement campaign. The Mongols marched up the Volga river in a wide arc on the west side. However, this force was just to occupy their attention, for he sent a secondary army to surprise the Bulgars from the east by crossing the Ural mountains.<ref>Svedrup, 43\u201344.</ref> After squashing the Bulgar armies, he defeated the guerrilla leader [[Bachman Khan|Bachman]] on the north side of the Caspian Sea. Bachman had [[Wikt:ensconce|ensconced]] himself on an island, and taunted the Mongols. However, they constructed a mini-navy of 200 boats, trapped Bachman within a limited area, and gradually closed the 'net'.<ref>McLynn, 436\u2013437.</ref>\n\nUnlike in 1222\u201323 when the majority of the Rus' states allied against Subutai and Jebe, this time the Mongols apparently struck with such speed that the Russians were either too paralyzed, or possibly too bitter or distracted to ally. In late 1237, Subutai attacked [[Ryazan]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], operating with three columns (attacking as the Mongols usually did during the winter, when the rivers froze over). The [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] forces were defeated in 3 separate engagements and their cities were taken in quick succession. The Mongols spent the summer of 1238 resting along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. Columns were sent out to subjugate the various tribes living in the plains around the [[Black Sea]]. In 1239, the Rus' state of [[Chernigov]] was defeated and their cities were taken. The Mongols were spared the need to conquer [[Novgorod]] when the principality surrendered, agreed to pay tribute in the future, and gave the Mongols a large bribe.<ref>Frank McLynn, 434\u2013441.</ref>\n\nThe most notable encounter of the campaign was the [[battle of the Sit River]] in 1238. The Grand Duke Yuri of Vladimir, the most prominent of the Rus leaders, had left Vladimir to raise an army and defeat the Mongols before they reached his city. However, the Mongols evaded his army and captured Vladimir before he even knew what had happened. When Yuri sent out a strong reconnaissance force to penetrate the Mongol scouting screen, his lieutenant told him in horror that his army was already entirely surrounded. Not surprisingly, Yuri and his army were easily defeated.<ref>''The Chronicle of Novgorod'' (1914), 83.</ref> The Mongols had made a treaty with Galich-Vladimir, whose prince was therefore taken by surprise when the Mongols suddenly attacked in December 1240. [[Kiev]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], and other cities were quickly taken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Invasion of Central Europe (1241\u20131242)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\nThe attack on Europe was planned and carried out by Subutai, who achieved his lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of [[Jochi]], was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against [[Kievan Rus']]. He personally commanded the central column that moved against the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and likely gave detailed instructions to his subordinates.\n\nThough the Mongol methods of warfare were mostly a mystery in the west, the King of Hungary, [[Bela IV]], was well-informed of the Mongol invasion of Russia and prepared as well as the fractured relations of Europe would allow him to.<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat''.</ref> Though Bela was unable to obtain help from the Holy Roman Empire or the Pope, he did at least have the support of his cousins in Poland. Once again, Subutai invaded during winter, when they would be least expected. The Mongol invasion of Europe was a five-pronged attack. Kaidu and Orda Khan ravaged Northern Poland, Baidar Southern Poland, while Shiban attacked through the rugged terrain in northeastern Hungary, Subutai and Batu invaded central Hungary, and Guyuk marched south through Transylvania. The Mongols dispersed their forces in order to confuse the Europeans as to their ultimate objectives, and defeat the European armies piecemeal before they could mass into a central force. After a series of sweeping victories [[Baidar]] and [[Kadan]] regrouped their northern force and defeated the main Polish army at the [[Battle of Legnica]], right before it could merge with the Bohemian Army a days march away. While [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]]'s army triumphed in [[Transylvania]], a day after Legnica, Subutai was waiting for the Hungarian army on the Hungarian plain. Though the Hungarian King [[Bela IV]] had effectively blocked the Carpathian passes using felled trees, ditches, traps, and other natural obstacles, in addition to the general disrepair or simple nonexistence of roads in eastern Hungary, Subutai's force still managed an astonishing pace of {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} a day despite several feet of snow. The Mongols retained a pioneer corps capable of efficiently clearing pathways through the forest, and were unfazed by Bela's obstacles.<ref>McLynn, 465\u2013466.</ref>\n\nOnly one day after the smaller Mongol army in [[Poland]] had won the [[Battle of Legnica]], Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the [[Battle of Mohi]] during the night of 10 April 1241. At Mohi, the Mongols fixated the Hungarian attention in the center by assaulting the lone bridge and attempting to ford to the north and around the bridge. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so [[catapult]]s were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. Meanwhile, Subutai in secret created a pontoon bridge to the south, where the river was too deep to be forded, and crossed the river in secret with a large force. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south, and a third from the north. The threat of now reassembled Mongol force, enveloping the Hungarian army on the far side of the Sajo river, forced the Hungarians to retreat into their wagon laager camp, a traditional tool of fighting against nomadic armies. However, the Mongols surrounded the fortified Hungarian camp, and bombarded it with trebuchets, gunpowder weapons, and flaming arrows.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2978.</ref> Hungarian cavalry charges were lured further away from their camp and encircled.\n\nThe result was complete panic; and to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the [[Mongols]] left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai's classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The apparent gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this 'hole' in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus more than 10,000 fighting men.<ref>Denis Sinor, ''[http://deremilitari.org/2014/07/the-mongols-in-the-west/ The Mongols in the West]'' (1999).</ref> In one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, but Mongol casualties in the center had been higher than normal: in addition to anywhere from many hundreds to many thousands of regular soldiers, Batu lost 30 of his 4,000 strong [[Baghatur|ba'aaturs]] (heavily armored bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants (Bagatu/Bakatu), which caused tension later in the camp.<ref>Yuan Shi, 121, 1a\u20135a</ref>\n\n===Mongol subjugation of Hungary===\n{{Main|First Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\nIn addition to defeating the enemy, Subutai also had to spend substantial energy keeping the egos of the Mongol princes in check during the Hungarian campaign. During the battle, Subutai had to shame Batu into continuing the fight after the first failed attack on the bridge. Batu first blamed Subutai for taking too long to ford the river, but Subutai rebuffed him by saying that they knew fording the river would take time, and Batu had launched his attack preempetively. In the end Batu apologized to Subutai.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> This was not the first time that Subutai had to bail Batu out of a mistake: during the invasion of Russia, Batu had struggled for weeks to conquer the fortress of Torzhok, launching several failed assaults. Subutai had to divert his movements, take command, and conquered the fortress in three days with ease.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> Either at this feast or another one shortly after, Batu got into a heated argument with the Mongol princes [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|Guyuk]] and [[B\u00fcri|Buri]].<ref>Hodong Kim, ''A Reappraisal of G\u00fcy\u00fcg Khan'', 319\u2013320.</ref> Guyuk and Buri, jealous of Batu, accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai's coattails. This resulted in Guyuk and Batu, and possibly some of their men being sent home to \u00d6gedei Khan for judgment, causing further rifts in the Mongol army.<ref>Urgunge Onon, ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', 270.</ref>\n\nDespite these obstacles, the Mongols still attempted to solidify their control over Hungary.  From Rogerius' writings it would seem that scattered resistance by the peasantry was attempted, but it never really got off the ground, perhaps in part due to the flat open plains of central Hungary allowing scant opportunity for ambush or withdrawal. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Mohi, Subutai used a stolen royal seal to issue bogus decrees across the country, leaving many unassuming inhabitants at his mercy.<ref>McLynn, 472\u2013479; Thomas of Spalato, ''Historia''; Rogerius of Apulia, ''Carmen Miserabile super Destructione Regni Hungariae per Tartaro''.</ref>\n\nIn order to keep the pressure on Bela, Subutai split his forces into several detachments. A light cavalry force under Kadan was sent to chase King Bela along the Adriatic Coast, while the main army with its siege engines under Subutai and Batu attempted to pacify Hungary proper. Other Mongol forces raided outside the borders of Hungary, even reaching Austria before being repulsed in a skirmish near Wiener Neustadt. The Mongols successfully besieged several cities, including the fortified city at [[Oradea]], the castle of [[Saint Martin|St. Martin]] of [[Pannonia]], and the capital [[Esztergom]], though the latter's stone citadel held out, though not all sieges proved successful.\n\nBy early 1242, Subutai was discussing plans to invade the [[Holy Roman Empire]], when news came of the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] and a revolt by the Cumans in Russia.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, ''The Story of the Mongols whom we call the Tartars''.</ref> Carpini alleges that, over the objections of Subutai, the Mongol princes withdrew the army to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan. It should be noted however that this account of events is disputed, with Rashid al-Din specifically noting that Batu and Subutai only heard of the Khan's death after they had already begun the withdrawal.<ref>Timothy May, ''The Mongol Art of War and the Tsunami Strategy''.</ref> However, the death of Ogedei and the turmoil immediately after it prevented the Mongols from returning to Europe for decades. Still, the devastation had been immense. Subutai had devastated the agriculture of any area that was resisting. Though some of the civilians had escaped capture or death by hiding in castles, forests, or marshes, they returned to their ruined fields only to starve. Some historians have claimed that a quarter to a half of Hungary's population may have died from the invasion.<ref>McLynn, 479; ''Carmen Miserabile''.</ref><ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat'', 49.</ref> Even in 1250, eight years after the Mongols had left, Hungarian King Bela wrote to [[Pope Innocent IV]] that Hungary could not withstand another invasion and would have to surrender to the Mongols if they returned.<ref>King Belas IV's letter to the Pope, 310.</ref>{{full citation needed|reason=What's the source for this letter?|date=May 2019}}<ref>Laszlovszky, J\u00f3zsef & Pow, Stephen & Romh\u00e1nyi, Beatrix & Ferenczi, Laszlo & Pinke, Zsolt.

Subutai insisted that Batu attend the kurultai to elect the successor of Ogedei in Mongolian heartland. Batu declined to come and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] was elected after three years, with Subutai's support. G\u00fcy\u00fck had no love for Batu and wanted the best of the Mongol generals unavailable to Batu if the feud between them came to open war. The new Khagan placed Subutai in charge at the age of 71 of the campaign against the [[Song dynasty]] for 1246\u20131247. The Papal envoy [[Plano Carpini]] saw him when he was in [[Karakorum]], Mongolia. He said Subutai was well respected among the Mongols and called Knight/Valiant/Hero (translation of Baghatur). Subutai returned to Mongolia from the Song campaign in 1248 and spent the rest of his life at his home in the vicinity of the [[Tuul River]] (near modern [[Ulaanbaatar]]), dying there at the age of 72.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A folk legend claimed that Subutai wished to die by his son Uriyangkhadai by the banks of the [[Danube|Danube river]].<ref name=\"weatherford\">{{cite book |title=Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom |last=Weatherford |first=Jack |publisher=Penguin |year=2017 |isbn=0735221170 |page=286}}</ref>\n\nSubutai's descendants such as [[Uriyangkhadai]] and [[Aju]] would serve the [[Great Khans]] for the next three decades as commanders. Uriyangkhadai would successfully conquer the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], invade [[Dai Viet]] and obtain their submission, and achieve great success invading the Song from the southwest in the 1258 invasion of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]. Aju fought with his father, and then later led the successful five-year Mongol siege of the pivotal dual fortress of Xiangyang-Fancheng in the [[battle of Xiangyang]], which opened up a gateway into the heart of the Song and enabled their total conquest six years later in 1279.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{quote|\"No Mongol general played a greater role than Subotei Ba'atur in establishing and maintaining the early Mongol Empire.

When he first entered the service of Temujin, the later Cinggis Qan, the realm of that minor Mongol chieftain comprised only a few families.

Even though Subutai had devastated the armies of Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin Constantinople in a series of one-sided campaigns, Western military leaders, historians, and theorists completely ignored him until the 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 110.</ref> The Mongols did not operate as one distinct mass, but instead moved along 3\u20135 axes of approach, often 500\u20131000&nbsp;km apart, and threatened numerous objectives simultaneously. Like Napoleon, Subutai (and Genghis Khan) would disperse their forces along a wide frontage and rapidly coalesce at decisive points to defeat the enemy in detail.  Their methods were aligned to completely crush the enemy state's will to fight.<ref>Gabriel, 113.</ref> Subutai has been credited as the first general to operate campaigns using the modern organizational methods of command and control.<ref>LTC Sean Slappy, ''Command and Control Began with Subotai Bahadur'' (2010).</ref>\n\nThough unknown to the west for many centuries, Subutai's exploits were featured by the British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart in his book ''Great Captains Unveiled'' after World War I. Liddell Hart used the example of the Mongols under Genghis and Subutai to demonstrate how a mechanized army could fight using the principles of mobility, dispersion and surprise.

University of Oklahoma Press, 2004, p. 6.</ref> probably just west of the upper [[Onon River]] in what is now [[Mongolia]]. He belonged to the [[Uriankhai]] clan, known as the reindeer people, a group of Siberian forest-dwellers who did not live like the plains Mongols to their south. As a result of his upbringing, Subutai lacked the natural horsemanship training from birth that all Mongols possessed, making him an outsider among them.<ref>Gabriel, 6-8.</ref> Subutai's family had been associated with the family of Temujin (future Genghis Khan) for many generations. Subutai's great-great grandfather, Nerbi, was supposedly an ally of the Mongol Khan Tumbina Sechen. Subutai's father, Jarchigudai, supposedly supplied food to Temujin and his followers when they were in dire straits at lake Baljuna, and Subutai's elder brother [[Jelme]] also served as a general in the Mongol army and was a close companion of Temujin. Jelme rescued a severely wounded Temujin (hit by an arrow from [[Jebe]], then an enemy) in the process of unification of the Mongolian plateau. Another brother, Chaurkhan (also romanized as Ca'urqan) is mentioned in the [[The Secret History of the Mongols|Secret History of the Mongols]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tsendiin Damdins\u00fcren |first= |year=1970 |title=\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0443\u0443\u0446 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0447\u043e\u043e |edition=1st |language=Mongolian |trans-title=[[The Secret History of the Mongols]] |chapter=120 (III)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Subutai's biography in the [[History of Yuan]]Subutai's father was once driving a herd of sheep in order to present them to his overlord, Taizu (Genghis Khan). Encountering robbers, he was seized. Huluhun (Subutai's brother) and Subutai arrived in good time, and with their lances stabbed some of the robbers. Horses and men fell together, and the remainder of the band withdrew and departed. Consequently, they relieved their father's difficulty, and the sheep were able to attain the emperor's station.<ref>Yuanshi, 121, 1a-5a</ref>\n\nDespite this close family association, some consider Subutai's career proof that the [[Mongol Empire]] was a [[meritocracy]]. He was a commoner by birth, the son of Jarchigudai, who was supposedly a [[blacksmith]]. When he was 14 years old, Subutai left his clan to join Temujin's army, following in the footsteps of his older brother Jelme who had joined when he was 17 years old, and he rose to the very highest command available to one who was not a blood relative to Genghis.<ref>Gabriel 2004, pp. 1, 3.</ref>  Within a decade he rose to become a general, in command of one of 4 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] operating in the vanguard. During the invasion of Northern China in 1211, Subutai was partnered with the senior Mongol general Jebe, an apprentice and partnership they would maintain until Jebe's death in 1223. In 1212 he took Huan by storm, the first major independent exploit mentioned in the sources. Genghis Khan is reported to have called him one of his \"dogs of war,\" who were 4 of his 8 top lieutenants, in ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'':<ref>Cummins, Joseph.

J. (1971). ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. {{ISBN|0-8122-1766-7}}</ref> This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere around his late teens and early twenties.<ref>Gabriel, 10</ref> Throughout most of Genghis Khan's lifetime, Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite [[Jebe]] (1211\u201312, 1213\u201314, 1219\u201323) and [[Muqali]] (1213\u201314), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219).\n\nSubutai's first chance at independent command came in 1197 during action against the [[Merkit]], when he was just 22 years old.  Subutai's role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan's offer for extra elite troops, and instead traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals.<ref>Gabriel, 12-13.</ref>  He also served as a commander of the vanguard with distinction in the 1204 battle against the Naiman that gave the Mongols total control over Mongolia.\n\n==As a general==\nSubutai was a major innovator in the art of war. In the invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated large forces often separated by large distances.  Subutai's maneuvers were designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and [[Scorched earth|devastated the surrounded agriculture]] so that the remaining people would starve if they remained within fortified walls.<ref>Gabriel, Chapter 8; Carl Svedrup, Sube`etei Ba`atur, Anonymous Strategist.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the [[battle of Carrhae]] or the [[battle of Manzikert]], Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the [[battle of the Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.<ref>Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015), 157-159.</ref>\n\nSubutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of engineers in [[siege warfare]]. Even in field battles he made use of [[siege engine]]s. In the [[Battle of Mohi]], the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. Subutai ordered huge [[Lithobolos|stonethrower]]<nowiki/>s to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more akin to the [[Barrage (artillery)|creeping barrage]] of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right before an attack.<ref>Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War.</ref> \n\nLike Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity.  \n\n==Central Asian campaigns (1217\u20131220)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Central Asia}}\nIn 1217, Genghis Khan sent Subutai to hunt down the hated [[Merkit]]s and their allies, the [[Cumania|Cuman-Kipchak confederation]], in modern-day central Kazakhstan. Subutai defeated them on the [[Chu River]] in 1217 and again in 1219 in [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchak]] territory. Before the battle of the Chem River in 1219, Subutai had his vanguard carry children's toys and leave them behind, as if they were a group of families fleeing from the Merkit. As a result of this deception, Subutai's army was able to surprise, encircle, and capture of all the Merkit/Kipchak leadership.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2975-76.</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Mohammad II]] of [[Khwarizm]] attacked Subutai shortly afterwards along the Irghiz River. Despite being outnumbered three to one against the Sultan's elite forces which had conquered much of Central Asia, Subutai held him off after a fierce battle and retreated during the night. According to Persian sources, this battle seems to have eroded Mohammed's confidence in his ability to defeat the Mongols in pitched battle, since Subutai only commanded a small 20,000 man force and did not want to even fight him. Supposedly the Mongol army had destroyed his left wing, and nearly broken his center and captured him, until reinforcements from his son arrived and the battlefield turned dark.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 370\u2013371.</ref> Because of this battle, Mohammed was unable to take advantage of the upheaval in the [[Kara-Khitai]] Empire (simultaneously being conquered by the Mongolian general Jebe), like he had in earlier wars.\n\nGenghis Khan led the Mongol army westwards in late 1219 to invade [[Khwarazm|Khwarizm]] as retaliation for the execution of Mongol ambassadors. With roughly 100,000 armed men, the Mongol army was numerically inferior to the forces of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarizim Empire]], but through deception and rapid maneuver, the Mongols defeated the isolated Khwarezm armies in detail before they could react. Serving as the Mongol equivalent of Genghis Khan's Chief of Staff, Subutai marched with the Khan's army through the deadly [[Kyzylkum Desert]] to emerge behind the Khwarezm defense network at Bukhara.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 373\u2013385.</ref> After the rapid capture of the Khwarezm center of defense, Samarkand, Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 30,000 men to hunt the Khwarezm Shah and prevent him from rallying the other Khwarezm armies. Shah Mohammad attempted to save himself by fleeing into central [[Persia]], but while he eluded capture, the relentless chase meant he could not rally his forces. As a result, the several hundred thousand man Khwarezm forces in reserve remained divided and were easily destroyed piecemeal by Genghis Khan's main army.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'',  375\u2013410.</ref> Drained by the fierce pursuit, Mohammed fell ill and died at a fishing village on an island in the Caspian Sea in early 1221, an ignominious end for the man who styled himself the 'Second Alexander'.\n\n==Great Cavalry Raid (1220\u20131223)==\nSubutai and Jebe spent part of the 1219 winter in [[Azerbaijan]] and Iran, raiding and looting while preventing the western Khwarezm forces from assisting the rest of the empire to the east. Here he conceived the idea of conducting the most audacious reconnaissance-in-force in history, which was described by Edward Gibbon as [an expedition] \"which has never been attempted, and has never been repeated\": 20,000 Mongol forces would circle the [[Caspian Sea]] through the Caucasus Mountains to fall on the rear of the Wild [[Kipchaks]] and [[Cumans]].<ref>''In the Service of the Khans'', 19.</ref>\n\nAfter destroying resistance in Persia and submitting Azerbaijan, the Mongols invaded the Christian Kingdom of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Though the Georgian king was reluctant to actually commit to battle, Subutai and Jebe forced his hand by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. Subutai and Jebe then defeated a powerful Georgian army with many thousands of knights at the [[Battle of Caucasus Mountain|Battle of the Caucasus Mountains]], by luring the knights away from their infantry with a feigned retreat, then enveloping the knights. After destroying them, the Mongols encircled and crushed the Georgian army. Subutai, who was identified by the Georgians as being in command, originally lured the Georgians into thinking his army was a friendly ally by having his men in front parade crosses, and using spies to start false rumors that the Mongols were actually Christian wonder-workers who had come to assist the Georgians.<ref>Kirakos Gandzaketsi, History of the Armenians, 166\u2013167.</ref> This Mongol reconnaissance mission may have inadvertently altered the history of the Crusades, as Georgia had planned on sending their now destroyed army to join the [[Fifth Crusade]]. Instead, King George's sister Rusudan had to write to the Pope to explain that they could not assist the Crusade because their whole army had been disintegrated.<ref>Oliver of Paderborn, \"The Capture of Damietta\", trans. Joseph J. Gavigan, ''Christian Society and the Crusades, 1198\u20131229'', ed. Edward Peters (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 90, 123\u2013124.</ref> Though Georgia lay defenseless after these catastrophic defeats, the Mongol mission was to raid and scout, not conquer.\n\nAfter ravaging Georgia, the Mongols cut across the [[Caucasus Mountains]] during the winter to get around the [[Derbent]] Pass. The Mongols were tricked by their guides into taking a [[Wikt:perilous#Adjective|perilous]] route and emerged from the mountains exhausted, only to be confronted with a far larger steppe coalition army. Using clever diplomacy, Subutai isolated and defeated the [[Alans]], [[Circassians]], and Don Kipchaks/Cumans in detail. After plundering the southern Russian steppes, the Russian princes united with the retreating Cuman confederacy to defeat the Mongols with an 80,000 man host. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Subutai sacrificed the 1,000 men of his rear guard to induce the coalition army to recklessly pursue him and become separated. After 9 days of pursuit, Jebe and Subutai suddenly turned and crushed the combined [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and [[Cuman]] army at the [[Battle of the Kalka River|Kalka]] (31 May 1223). The Volga Bulgars claimed that they had ambushed Subutai's army, but historians have doubted this account in light of the Mongols seeking out and defeating the Qangli Turks in southern Russia shortly afterward.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 607\u2013613.</ref>\n\n==Invasions of the Xi Xia and Jin Chinese (1207, 1209, 1211\u20131215, 1226\u201327)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nIn the initial invasion of the Jin in 1211, Subutai served with Jebe's army that attacked the Chinese forts around the eastern edge of the Great Wall (not the Ming [[Great Wall]]). In late 1211 he was the first to scale the walls of the key fortress of Huan-Chou, and took part in the ambush of a major Jin army at Wu Sha Pao and the climactic [[battle of Yehuling]]. In 1212, he may have served with Jebe during the latter's daring capture of Liaoyang, and in 1213 he served with Muqali and Jebe in a great raid in Shandong.<ref>''In the Service of the Khan'', Paul Buell, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nSubutai played a key part in the campaign against the Tanguts of [[Xi Xia]] in 1226, serving as commander of the flank army to strike the Tanguts in the rear. While Genghis invaded the Xi Xia by a more traditional northern route, Subutai unexpectedly attacked from the west over the mountains and inhospitable deserts in modern Turkestan, causing Tangut resistance to collapse. The Tangut Empire was cut in two: with Genghis preventing reinforcements being sent west, Subutai subdued resistance in the west and joined with Genghis's main army to conquer the east. In 1227, he conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] districts along the upper [[Wei River]], and even raided the Kingdom of Tibet.<ref>Buell, 20.</ref> Though the Mongols conquered Xi Xia, Mongol operations against Jin China were interrupted by the death of Genghis Khan in 1227. Genghis Khan was succeeded by his son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] in 1229.\n\n===Conquest of Jin China (1231\u20131235)===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nAfter a humiliating defeat by the resurgent Jin in 1230\u20131231, \u00d6gedei personally led the main Mongol army against the Jin (in Central [[China]]) and appointed Subutai to salvage the situation. Subutai had originally been assigned to conquer the Kipchak Turks in central Russia in 1229,<ref>Rashid al-Din, ''Annals of Ogedei Khan'', 33.</ref> but was hurriedly recalled to China in 1229\u20131230 after the Mongolian general Dolqolqu suffered a major defeat.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31.</ref> Against Subutai, the Jin generals retreated from Shaanxi and implemented a scorched earth policy to hold the fortified Tongguan Pass and block any access to the Jin stronghold of Henan. They calculated that the scorched earth policies would deny the Mongols the ability to sustain a lengthy siege, and their lines of fortifications and difficult terrain would prevent the Mongols from outmaneuvering them.\n\nSubutai initially attempted to outflank the Jin by feinting an attack at the fortified location of Weizhou and maneuvering through an unguarded side corridor. Though the Jin were fooled by the feint, they moved with great alacrity once Subutai's main advance was discovered, and the attempt to break into the plains of [[Henan]] ended in failure after Subutai's advanced raiding parties were checked at Shan-ch\u2019e-hui. The Mongols defeated a relieving force and captured Fengxiang, a secondary target, by concentrating 400 trebuchets at a corner of the wall. However, the overall campaign seemed to have reached a stalemate.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 1231\u20131232 Subutai made another attempt to outmaneuver the Jin fortified lines by using a similar highly audacious approach that they had employed in Khwarezm (1219) and Xi Xia (1226). The Mongols divided into three armies, one to attack Henan from the North in the center of the Yellow River, another to attempt to cross the Yellow River in Shandong in the east, and the last, under Subutai and [[Tolui]], invading the [[Song Empire]] and attacking Henan from the more exposed south.<ref>Atwood, 34.</ref> The Song initially refused to allow the Mongols passage through the rugged Qinling mountains, so Subutai dodged their forces and isolated the mountain citadels one by one. Disheartened by the ease of the Mongol advance against their strong fortifications, the Song agreed to supply guides.<ref>Yuan Shi, 115.2885-6.</ref> This time Subutai was able to outmaneuver the Jin armies and cross the Han River to invade Henan from the south.\n\nThe main Jin army promptly marched to intercept Subutai's army at Mount Yu. Its commander, Wan Yen Heda attempted to ambush the Mongols, but the ambush was detected. In turn, the Mongols attempted to draw him into their own ambush with a feigned retreat, but he held his strong position. After a full day of fierce fighting that resulted in a stalemate, the Mongols retreated under darkness and attempted to hide their trail and outflank the Jin. Wan Yen Heda had retreated towards the city of Tengzhou in order to obtain supplies. Changing tracks, Subutai, identifying that the Jin were vulnerable to attrition, used a feint attack to temporarily divert the Jin forces away from their supply train, which he promptly seized with a hidden force.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Rather than continually attempting to attack the vigilant Jin during their retreat, Subutai instead dispersed his army into several detachments to target supplies in the area. 3,000 men masked the Mongol dispersion and occupied the Jin's attention, while other Mongol forces slowly slipped away from the field in small numbers to hide their movements towards the Jin capital of Kaifeng, the route that Wan Yen Heda was retreating along.<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube'etei Ba'atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nWith part of his force harassing the Jin army's foragers, the other units marched around the flanks in a wide arc and emerged ahead of the Jin army, aiming to destroy or steal the supplies of nearby villages along the Jin's line of retreat. Ogedei Khan had been able to cross the Yellow River after the Jin army blocking him had to march south to help Wan Yan Heda. With Subutai's army having maneuvered along the Jin rear, Ogedei was able to send reinforcements to Subutai, bringing the total Mongol strength to 50,000 men. After these reinforcements arrived and with the Jin army's food supplies severely depleted over the past three weeks, Subutai forced a battle on his terms and won a decisive victory at the [[battle of Sanfeng Mountain]] (9 February 1232), capturing Wan Yen Heda and annihilating the main Jin army which had nowhere safe to retreat to. He then made forced marches and eliminated the other Jin armies holding the other fronts at the battles of Yangyi (24 February 1232), and T\u2019iehling (1 March 1232).<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube`etei Ba`atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nThe heavily fortified city of Kaifeng required an eight month long siege. Subutai was forced to construct lines of [[Wikt:circumvallate#Verb|circumvallation]] that had a perimeter stretching {{convert|54|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the Jin began to employ a cutting edge gunpowder weapon called \"Thunder Crash Bombs\", which made it very difficult for the Mongols to get close enough for more concentrated fire. After cutting off Kaifeng from any outside help, Subutai alternated intense bombardments using a mixture of Muslim trebuchets, [[mangonel]]<nowiki/>s, and captured gunpowder with periods of rest and plundering the countryside. The Mongol dispersion helped them avoid contagion by the plague that devastated Kaifeng, and after being stretched to the limit, the Emperor fled and the city surrendered. Subutai originally wanted to execute everyone in Kaifeng to punish them for their [[Wikt:intransigence|intransigence]] and extremely long resistance. However, \u00d6gedei intervened and ordered Subutai to treat them fairly. <ref>McLynn, 407\u2013410.</ref>  With assistance from the Song Dynasty, the last Jin stronghold of Caizhou fell in 1234.\n\nHowever, it did not take the Song long to fall out with the Mongols. Two Song armies seized [[Kaifeng]] and [[Luoyang]] during the summer of 1234 during Subutai's absence. Subutai returned, destroyed the three Song armies by isolating and defeating them , and retook the cities. He then made a preemptive raid into Song territory to force them to adopt a defensive position.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Though war had begun between the Mongols and Song, Subutai was recalled to the west. Still, Subutai's victories had taught the Song a lesson they would heed: no Song army would dare venture north to attack Mongol territory afterward.\n\n==Conquest of Russia (1236\u20131240)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'}}\n\u00d6gedei decided to send a major part of the army into the western regions to finally crush the [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchaks]] and [[Bulgars]]. Subutai was tasked to direct the operations (under the overall command of prince [[Batu Khan|Batu]]). This mission was more than just a typical invasion: \u00d6gedei sent many of the next generation of Mongol princes, including the heirs of each of the four families, most likely to be trained by Subutai before he died.<ref>McLynn, 435.</ref> In order to crush the Volga Bulgars, who had previously defeated Batu in 1232, Subutai launched another giant encirclement campaign. The Mongols marched up the Volga river in a wide arc on the west side. However, this force was just to occupy their attention, for he sent a secondary army to surprise the Bulgars from the east by crossing the Ural mountains.<ref>Svedrup, 43\u201344.</ref> After squashing the Bulgar armies, he defeated the guerrilla leader [[Bachman Khan|Bachman]] on the north side of the Caspian Sea. Bachman had [[Wikt:ensconce|ensconced]] himself on an island, and taunted the Mongols. However, they constructed a mini-navy of 200 boats, trapped Bachman within a limited area, and gradually closed the 'net'.<ref>McLynn, 436\u2013437.</ref>\n\nUnlike in 1222\u201323 when the majority of the Rus' states allied against Subutai and Jebe, this time the Mongols apparently struck with such speed that the Russians were either too paralyzed, or possibly too bitter or distracted to ally. In late 1237, Subutai attacked [[Ryazan]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], operating with three columns (attacking as the Mongols usually did during the winter, when the rivers froze over). The [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] forces were defeated in 3 separate engagements and their cities were taken in quick succession. The Mongols spent the summer of 1238 resting along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. Columns were sent out to subjugate the various tribes living in the plains around the [[Black Sea]]. In 1239, the Rus' state of [[Chernigov]] was defeated and their cities were taken. The Mongols were spared the need to conquer [[Novgorod]] when the principality surrendered, agreed to pay tribute in the future, and gave the Mongols a large bribe.<ref>Frank McLynn, 434\u2013441.</ref>\n\nThe most notable encounter of the campaign was the [[battle of the Sit River]] in 1238. The Grand Duke Yuri of Vladimir, the most prominent of the Rus leaders, had left Vladimir to raise an army and defeat the Mongols before they reached his city. However, the Mongols evaded his army and captured Vladimir before he even knew what had happened. When Yuri sent out a strong reconnaissance force to penetrate the Mongol scouting screen, his lieutenant told him in horror that his army was already entirely surrounded. Not surprisingly, Yuri and his army were easily defeated.<ref>''The Chronicle of Novgorod'' (1914), 83.</ref> The Mongols had made a treaty with Galich-Vladimir, whose prince was therefore taken by surprise when the Mongols suddenly attacked in December 1240. [[Kiev]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], and other cities were quickly taken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Invasion of Central Europe (1241\u20131242)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\nThe attack on Europe was planned and carried out by Subutai, who achieved his lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of [[Jochi]], was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against [[Kievan Rus']]. He personally commanded the central column that moved against the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and likely gave detailed instructions to his subordinates.\n\nThough the Mongol methods of warfare were mostly a mystery in the west, the King of Hungary, [[Bela IV]], was well-informed of the Mongol invasion of Russia and prepared as well as the fractured relations of Europe would allow him to.<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat''.</ref> Though Bela was unable to obtain help from the Holy Roman Empire or the Pope, he did at least have the support of his cousins in Poland. Once again, Subutai invaded during winter, when they would be least expected. The Mongol invasion of Europe was a five-pronged attack. Kaidu and Orda Khan ravaged Northern Poland, Baidar Southern Poland, while Shiban attacked through the rugged terrain in northeastern Hungary, Subutai and Batu invaded central Hungary, and Guyuk marched south through Transylvania. The Mongols dispersed their forces in order to confuse the Europeans as to their ultimate objectives, and defeat the European armies piecemeal before they could mass into a central force. After a series of sweeping victories [[Baidar]] and [[Kadan]] regrouped their northern force and defeated the main Polish army at the [[Battle of Legnica]], right before it could merge with the Bohemian Army a days march away. While [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]]'s army triumphed in [[Transylvania]], a day after Legnica, Subutai was waiting for the Hungarian army on the Hungarian plain. Though the Hungarian King [[Bela IV]] had effectively blocked the Carpathian passes using felled trees, ditches, traps, and other natural obstacles, in addition to the general disrepair or simple nonexistence of roads in eastern Hungary, Subutai's force still managed an astonishing pace of {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} a day despite several feet of snow. The Mongols retained a pioneer corps capable of efficiently clearing pathways through the forest, and were unfazed by Bela's obstacles.<ref>McLynn, 465\u2013466.</ref>\n\nOnly one day after the smaller Mongol army in [[Poland]] had won the [[Battle of Legnica]], Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the [[Battle of Mohi]] during the night of 10 April 1241. At Mohi, the Mongols fixated the Hungarian attention in the center by assaulting the lone bridge and attempting to ford to the north and around the bridge. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so [[catapult]]s were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. Meanwhile, Subutai in secret created a pontoon bridge to the south, where the river was too deep to be forded, and crossed the river in secret with a large force. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south, and a third from the north. The threat of now reassembled Mongol force, enveloping the Hungarian army on the far side of the Sajo river, forced the Hungarians to retreat into their wagon laager camp, a traditional tool of fighting against nomadic armies. However, the Mongols surrounded the fortified Hungarian camp, and bombarded it with trebuchets, gunpowder weapons, and flaming arrows.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2978.</ref> Hungarian cavalry charges were lured further away from their camp and encircled.\n\nThe result was complete panic; and to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the [[Mongols]] left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai's classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The apparent gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this 'hole' in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus more than 10,000 fighting men.<ref>Denis Sinor, ''[http://deremilitari.org/2014/07/the-mongols-in-the-west/ The Mongols in the West]'' (1999).</ref> In one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, but Mongol casualties in the center had been higher than normal: in addition to anywhere from many hundreds to many thousands of regular soldiers, Batu lost 30 of his 4,000 strong [[Baghatur|ba'aaturs]] (heavily armored bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants (Bagatu/Bakatu), which caused tension later in the camp.<ref>Yuan Shi, 121, 1a\u20135a</ref>\n\n===Mongol subjugation of Hungary===\n{{Main|First Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\nIn addition to defeating the enemy, Subutai also had to spend substantial energy keeping the egos of the Mongol princes in check during the Hungarian campaign. During the battle, Subutai had to shame Batu into continuing the fight after the first failed attack on the bridge. Batu first blamed Subutai for taking too long to ford the river, but Subutai rebuffed him by saying that they knew fording the river would take time, and Batu had launched his attack preempetively. In the end Batu apologized to Subutai.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> This was not the first time that Subutai had to bail Batu out of a mistake: during the invasion of Russia, Batu had struggled for weeks to conquer the fortress of Torzhok, launching several failed assaults. Subutai had to divert his movements, take command, and conquered the fortress in three days with ease.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> Either at this feast or another one shortly after, Batu got into a heated argument with the Mongol princes [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|Guyuk]] and [[B\u00fcri|Buri]].<ref>Hodong Kim, ''A Reappraisal of G\u00fcy\u00fcg Khan'', 319\u2013320.</ref> Guyuk and Buri, jealous of Batu, accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai's coattails. This resulted in Guyuk and Batu, and possibly some of their men being sent home to \u00d6gedei Khan for judgment, causing further rifts in the Mongol army.<ref>Urgunge Onon, ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', 270.</ref>\n\nDespite these obstacles, the Mongols still attempted to solidify their control over Hungary.  From Rogerius' writings it would seem that scattered resistance by the peasantry was attempted, but it never really got off the ground, perhaps in part due to the flat open plains of central Hungary allowing scant opportunity for ambush or withdrawal. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Mohi, Subutai used a stolen royal seal to issue bogus decrees across the country, leaving many unassuming inhabitants at his mercy.<ref>McLynn, 472\u2013479; Thomas of Spalato, ''Historia''; Rogerius of Apulia, ''Carmen Miserabile super Destructione Regni Hungariae per Tartaro''.</ref>\n\nIn order to keep the pressure on Bela, Subutai split his forces into several detachments. A light cavalry force under Kadan was sent to chase King Bela along the Adriatic Coast, while the main army with its siege engines under Subutai and Batu attempted to pacify Hungary proper. Other Mongol forces raided outside the borders of Hungary, even reaching Austria before being repulsed in a skirmish near Wiener Neustadt. The Mongols successfully besieged several cities, including the fortified city at [[Oradea]], the castle of [[Saint Martin|St. Martin]] of [[Pannonia]], and the capital [[Esztergom]], though the latter's stone citadel held out, though not all sieges proved successful.\n\nBy early 1242, Subutai was discussing plans to invade the [[Holy Roman Empire]], when news came of the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] and a revolt by the Cumans in Russia.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, ''The Story of the Mongols whom we call the Tartars''.</ref> Carpini alleges that, over the objections of Subutai, the Mongol princes withdrew the army to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan. It should be noted however that this account of events is disputed, with Rashid al-Din specifically noting that Batu and Subutai only heard of the Khan's death after they had already begun the withdrawal.<ref>Timothy May, ''The Mongol Art of War and the Tsunami Strategy''.</ref> However, the death of Ogedei and the turmoil immediately after it prevented the Mongols from returning to Europe for decades. Still, the devastation had been immense. Subutai had devastated the agriculture of any area that was resisting. Though some of the civilians had escaped capture or death by hiding in castles, forests, or marshes, they returned to their ruined fields only to starve. Some historians have claimed that a quarter to a half of Hungary's population may have died from the invasion.<ref>McLynn, 479; ''Carmen Miserabile''.</ref><ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat'', 49.</ref> Even in 1250, eight years after the Mongols had left, Hungarian King Bela wrote to [[Pope Innocent IV]] that Hungary could not withstand another invasion and would have to surrender to the Mongols if they returned.<ref>King Belas IV's letter to the Pope, 310.</ref>{{full citation needed|reason=What's the source for this letter?|date=May 2019}}<ref>Laszlovszky, J\u00f3zsef & Pow, Stephen & Romh\u00e1nyi, Beatrix & Ferenczi, Laszlo & Pinke, Zsolt.

Subutai insisted that Batu attend the kurultai to elect the successor of Ogedei in Mongolian heartland. Batu declined to come and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] was elected after three years, with Subutai's support. G\u00fcy\u00fck had no love for Batu and wanted the best of the Mongol generals unavailable to Batu if the feud between them came to open war. The new Khagan placed Subutai in charge at the age of 71 of the campaign against the [[Song dynasty]] for 1246\u20131247. The Papal envoy [[Plano Carpini]] saw him when he was in [[Karakorum]], Mongolia. He said Subutai was well respected among the Mongols and called Knight/Valiant/Hero (translation of Baghatur). Subutai returned to Mongolia from the Song campaign in 1248 and spent the rest of his life at his home in the vicinity of the [[Tuul River]] (near modern [[Ulaanbaatar]]), dying there at the age of 72.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A folk legend claimed that Subutai wished to die by his son Uriyangkhadai by the banks of the [[Danube|Danube river]].<ref name=\"weatherford\">{{cite book |title=Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom |last=Weatherford |first=Jack |publisher=Penguin |year=2017 |isbn=0735221170 |page=286}}</ref>\n\nSubutai's descendants such as [[Uriyangkhadai]] and [[Aju]] would serve the [[Great Khans]] for the next three decades as commanders. Uriyangkhadai would successfully conquer the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], invade [[Dai Viet]] and obtain their submission, and achieve great success invading the Song from the southwest in the 1258 invasion of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]. Aju fought with his father, and then later led the successful five-year Mongol siege of the pivotal dual fortress of Xiangyang-Fancheng in the [[battle of Xiangyang]], which opened up a gateway into the heart of the Song and enabled their total conquest six years later in 1279.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{quote|\"No Mongol general played a greater role than Subotei Ba'atur in establishing and maintaining the early Mongol Empire. Trusted commander and retainer of Cinggis, later highly respected servant of Ogodei and Guyuk, Subotei served with great distinction in every phase of Mongolian national development during the first four decades of empire. When he first entered the service of Temujin, the later Cinggis Qan, the realm of that minor Mongol chieftain comprised only a few families. In his old age, Subotei saw a mighty dominion stretching from the borders of Hungary to the Sea of Japan, from the outskirts of Novgorod to the Persian Gulf and the Yangtze River.

Even though Subutai had devastated the armies of Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin Constantinople in a series of one-sided campaigns, Western military leaders, historians, and theorists completely ignored him until the 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 110.</ref> The Mongols did not operate as one distinct mass, but instead moved along 3\u20135 axes of approach, often 500\u20131000&nbsp;km apart, and threatened numerous objectives simultaneously. Like Napoleon, Subutai (and Genghis Khan) would disperse their forces along a wide frontage and rapidly coalesce at decisive points to defeat the enemy in detail.  Their methods were aligned to completely crush the enemy state's will to fight.<ref>Gabriel, 113.</ref> Subutai has been credited as the first general to operate campaigns using the modern organizational methods of command and control.<ref>LTC Sean Slappy, ''Command and Control Began with Subotai Bahadur'' (2010).</ref>\n\nThough unknown to the west for many centuries, Subutai's exploits were featured by the British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart in his book ''Great Captains Unveiled'' after World War I. Liddell Hart used the example of the Mongols under Genghis and Subutai to demonstrate how a mechanized army could fight using the principles of mobility, dispersion and surprise.  In particular, [[Erwin Rommel]] and [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] were avid students of Mongol campaigns.<ref>James C. Bradford, ed., ''International Encyclopedia of Military History''.</ref>\n\n==='Deep Battle' theory===\n{{Main|Deep Battle}}\nRussia derived the most use out of a careful study of the Mongol campaigns. Their closer proximity to the steppe gave them greater interest and access to the Mongolian campaigns, first analyzed by the Russian General [[Mikhail Ivanin]] in the 19th century, which became a recommended text in the Russian military academies up until the mid 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 111.</ref> Ivanin's work became used in the [[Deep Battle]] doctrine developed by Soviet Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Mikhail Frunze]], and [[G. S. Isserson]]. Deep Battle doctrine bore a heavy resemblance to Mongol strategic methods, substituting tanks, motorized troop carriers, artillery, and airplanes for Mongol horse archers, lancers, and field artillery. The Red Army even went so far as to copy Subutai's use of smokescreens on the battlefield to cover troop movements.<ref>Gabriel, 112\u2013118.</ref> Later in the 20th century, American military theorist [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]] and some of his followers used Genghis Khan and Subutai's campaigns as examples of maneuver warfare.<ref>LTC Joe E.
