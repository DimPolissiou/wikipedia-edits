The ''Technical Assistance Group'' is responsible for the protection of archaeological sites and artifacts on all lands owned or controlled by the state. This group also provides technical assistance for state agencies (including [[List of Tennessee state parks|State Parks]]), law enforcement, municipalities, development communities, and the general public. Assistance is offered to public and private entities on legal and technical aspects of prehistoric Native American cemetery relocation and related concerns. This group also conducts research and publishes reports on archaeological subjects, some of which are available for free download via the Division of Archaeology website.  ''The Site File and Review Group'' maintains accurate records on all known archaeological sites in the state, and coordinates with state agencies to assess impacts of proposed activities on known or suspected sites. This group also provides expertise to the [[Tennessee Historical Commission|State Historic Preservation Office]] by reviewing all federally funded projects within Tennessee to determine their impact on archaeological resources. The TDOA presently employs eight [[archaeologists]], a site files coordinator, and an administrative secretary at the Nashville location. An auxiliary storage facility is located at [[Pinson Mounds]] State Park near [[Jackson, Tennessee]].\n\nEach January, the TDOA, in conjunction with the [[Middle Tennessee State University]] Department of Sociology and Anthropology, co-sponsors the ''Current Research in Tennessee Archaeology'' meeting. The meeting is open to the public and features presentations by both professional and avocational archaeologists.\n\n== History of the TDOA ==\nPrior to the creation of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology (TDOA) in 1970, there had been State Archaeologists, but no state organization that was tasked with watching over Tennessee's archaeology sites. The first official State Archaeologist was Parmenio E. Cox , who was appointed to the role by [[Austin Peay|Governor Austin Peay]] in 1924 after the death of William Edward Myer, who had served as the unofficial state archaeologist. \u00a0Cox held the role until he died in 1932.\n\nThe TDOA was established in 1970 under the Department of Conservation through the \"Tennessee Antiquities Act\" (TCA 11-6-101-121), and the first staff members were hired in 1972, with Mack S. Prichard being appointed to the role of State Archaeologist in 1971. The TDOA had a very small budget when it was first created, which only allowed for the hiring of an assistant, which was Patti Coats. Prichard was able to secure additional funds and then hired three regional archaeologists and a Historical Archaeologist in 1972. These included Brian Butler (who oversaw the eastern part of the state,) \u00a0[[John Broster]] (who oversaw the west), Carl Kuttruff (who oversaw Middle Tennessee), and Joe Benthall (who served as the first Historical Archaeologist).\n\nBenthall became the state archaeologist after Mack Prichard retired in 1973 and Sam Smith was then hired to take over as the Historical Archaeologist. Patti Coats was also moved into the new position of Site Files Curator during this time. The Division experienced some structural changes during the late 1970s, which merged them with the TN State Parks Department. The position of State Archaeologist was eliminated at this time and Joseph Benthall was moved to a regional archaeologist position. Historical Archaeologist Sam Smith served as the acting State Archaeologist during this period. This merger was short-lived, however, with the TDOA again becoming its own Division in 1983 with the appointment of a new State Archaeologist, Nick Fielder, by Commissioner Charles A. Howell. Fielder had been serving as the first State Historic Preservation Office Archaeologist since 1976. He served as State Archaeologist until 2007, when he retired. Mike Moore then became the State Archaeologist in 2007 and still holds the position today. In 1991, the Department of Conservation merged with the Environment side of the former Department of Health and Environment to become the [[Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation|Department of Environment and Conservation]] (TDEC). The TDOA is still a Division of TDEC.\n\nState-wide field projects have comprised an important Division mandate since the beginning.\u00a0 Significant investigations on state-owned properties include [[Mound Bottom]], Sellars Farm, [[Pinson Mounds]], [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]], Ft. Pillow, Riverbend Prison, SR-42 (Algood), [[Great Hiwassee|Hiwassee Old Town]], Sandbar Village, Carter House (Williamson County), Spencer Youth Center, Special Needs Prison, Middle TN Veterans Cemetery, Bicentennial Mall, and [[Roper's Knob Fortifications|Ropers Knob]].\u00a0 Select site investigations on non-state lands include Brick Church Pike Mound, Fort Southwest Point, First Hermitage, Yearwood, Penitentiary Branch, Fort Blount, Brandywine Pointe, [[Coats-Hines Site|Coats-Hines Mastodon]], Johnson, Old Town, Gordontown, Austin Cave, Carson-Conn-Short, Rutherford-Kizer, Brentwood Library, Moss-Wright and collaborative investigations along the Cumberland River near Nashville following the 2010 floods.\u00a0 Thematic historic site surveys (such as potteries, gunmaking, Highland Rim iron industry, Civil War, World War II, Rosenwald Schools, and Trail of Tears) have also been an important component of TDOA research.\u00a0 Reconnaissance surveys for prehistoric sites have been conducted within the Obion, Duck, Cumberland, Harpeth, Caney Fork, Collins, Calfkiller, and Hiwassee/Ocoee River watersheds.\n\nThe Division\u2019s ability to perform larger-scale site excavations has significantly diminished over the years due to the same position reductions experienced by other state agencies. Division positions have been cut roughly 70% over the past 25 years, from about 35 positions during the mid-1980s to the current 10 positions.\u00a0Most of the eliminated positions were part-time/seasonal posts used to employ project field crews.\u00a0As a result, the TDOA now focuses on smaller-scale survey and site investigations, and also responds to emergency situations as possible.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of archaeological sites in Tennessee]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tennessee.gov/environment/section/arch-archaeology The Tennessee Division of Archaeology website]\n*{{Facebook|TNArchaeology|The Tennessee Division of Archaeology}}\n*[https://www.tn.gov/environment/program-areas/arch-archaeology/archaeology-publications.html Archaeological publications by the Tennessee Division of Archaeology]\n*[https://www.tn.gov/environment/program-areas/arch-archaeology/current-research-in-tennessee-archaeology--crita-.html Current Research in Tennessee Archaeology annual meeting]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tennessee Division Of Archaeology}}\n[[Category:Archaeology of the United States]]\n[[Category:Archaeological organizations]]\n[[Category:State agencies of Tennessee]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox government agency\n|agency_name     = '''Tennessee Division of Archaeology'''\n|nativename      = TDOA\n|abbreviation    = TDOA\n|logo            = TN Archaeology Logo.jpg\n|logo_width      = 160px\n|logo_caption    =\n|formed          = 1972\n|jurisdiction    = [[State of Tennessee]]\n|headquarters    = [[Nashville, Tennessee]]\n|chief1_name     = [[State Archaeologist]]\n|chief1_position = [[Michael C.

The band took their name from the famous [[Beatles]] record ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' released in 1965. Their first album, ''[[The Rubber Soul Project (album)|The Rubber Soul Project]]'', released in 1996, was conceived as an imaginary [[Beatles]] album, with the band writing music and lyrics to songs for which they had heard only the titles. Their second album, ''The Rubber Soul Project 2'', also inspired by the music and the titles of never-before-heard Beatles songs, was released in 2015.\n\n==History==\n\n===''The Rubber Soul Project''===\nThe band history begins in 1993 in [[Belgrade]], when visual artist [[Rastko \u0106iri\u0107]], professor of Illustration and Animation at the [[University of Arts in Belgrade|Belgrade Faculty of Applied Arts]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] writer Goran Skrobonja bonded over their mutual love for the Beatles.<ref name=\"vreme1270\">[http://www.vreme.rs/cms/view.php?id=1295363 \"INTERVJU \u2013 RASTKO \u0106IRI\u0106, PROFESOR, MUZI\u010cAR I AUTOR RUBBER SOUL PROJECTA: Izma\u0161tavanje Bitlsa\", vreme.rs]</ref> Inspired by the titles of songs the Beatles never released (some of which were available on [[bootleg recording]]s in [[Western Europe]], but not in Serbia) they found in Jeff Russel's book ''The Beatles \u2013 Album files and Complete Discography'', the two set out to write lyrics and music in the manner in which the Beatles would have done it.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The lyrics were written by Skrobonja, and the music was written by \u0106iri\u0107.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The two then decided to record the album with their songs.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> In 1995, the band, named The Rubber Soul Project (in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Beatles ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album), was formed. It consisted of \u0106iri\u0107, Neboj\u0161a Ignjatovi\u0107, musician and professor of [[double bass]] at the [[University of Arts in Belgrade|Belgrade Music Academy]], Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107, bass guitarist of the popular Serbian band [[Bajaga i Instruktori]], and \u010cedomir Macura, the drummer of Bajaga i Instruktori.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nThe album ''[[The Rubber Soul Project (album)|The Rubber Soul Project]]'' was recorded from December 1994 to March 1995. On the album recording \u0106iri\u0107 sang and played [[acoustic guitar]], [[piano]], [[soprano recorder]], [[tambourine]], [[maracas]], [[kazoo]]s, [[jingle bell]]s and [[xylophone]], Ignjatovi\u0107 sang and played [[electric guitar]], [[twelve-string guitar]], acoustic guitar, piano, tambourine, [[cabassa]], [[synthesizer]] and [[flute]], Cvetkovi\u0107 played [[H\u00f6fner 500/1|H\u00f6fner 500/1 violin bass]], tambourine, electric guitar, [[keyboard bass]], maracas, [[slide guitar]] and sang backing vocals, and Macura played [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and did lead vocals on the track \"When I Come To Town\", the \"[[Ringo Starr]] song\" of the album. The album was produced by Ignjatovi\u0107 and Cvetkovi\u0107, the latter also being the recording engineer. The goal of the band members was to produce the authentic Beatles sound and atmosphere. Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107 played the H\u00f6fner 500/1 violin bass, the same type [[Paul McCartney]] used, and Macura played on the [[Ludwig Drums|Ludwig]] drum set, the type Ringo Starr played on all Beatles records. The album included a [[sitar]] [[George Harrison]]-style track called \"Indian Rope Trick\", [[rock and roll]] songs \"Home\", \"When I Come To Town\", and \"Bound By Love\", [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] \"Colliding Circles\", \"Watching Rainbows\", and \"Rubber Soul\".<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nIn March 1996, record label [[PGP-RTS]] released the album on vinyl (circulation of less than 200 copies, exclusively for radio stations) and [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]]. The album was met by positive reactions from both the audience and the critics. In April 1996, an article about the project was published in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. Several videos were recorded for the songs from the album. The video for the song \"Colliding Circles\", directed by Sr\u0111an Markovi\u0107 and Jelena Obradovi\u0107, was awarded the Golden Plaque and the video for the song \"Rubber Soul\", directed by Aleksandar Devi\u0107, was awarded the Best Debut Award at the 1998 Belgrade Festival of Short and Documentary film.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nAs the authors of the album were unhappy with the fact that they never received any information from PGP-RTS about the number of sold copies, let alone an agreed percentage of the sales, the project was offered to other local publishers in attempt to publish the album on [[compact disc]], but none of them showed interest. Finally, after the three-year contract expired in 1998, the authors agreed to print the CD as their private issue in limited circulation, which appeared in sales at the beginning of 1999.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The CD edition package featured a [[novella]] entitled ''Rubber Soul'', originally written by Skrobonja in 1993. The novella was written as a combination of fiction and facts, with the projection of some twenty years in the future. It was illustrated with \"documents\" created by Rastko \u0106iri\u0107. In 1994, the novella was proclaimed the best science fiction story in [[FR Yugoslavia]].\n\n===''The Rubber Soul Project'' documentary===\nThe idea to create some kind of film about the Rubber Soul Project was present from the very beginnings of the project in 1993. In 1999, the authors discussed the first version of the script for a documentary movie about Rubber Soul Project with movie director Dinko Tucakovi\u0107 and screenwriter Sr\u0111an Koljevi\u0107. From 2000 until 2004 they actively worked on the film. The documentary, entitled simply ''The Rubber Soul Project'', was released in 2004. The film described the circumstances among which the whole idea of recording the album came, the recording process, interviews with the band members and some of the associates of the band members. It premiered at the [[Montpellier]] Film Festival, and was later screened on festivals in Belgrade, [[Rotterdam]], [[Reykjav\u00edk]], and other cities.\n\nThe documentary stated that a copy of the album was sent to Paul McCartney, who said he enjoyed listening to it.\n\n===Live performances===\nThe band who joined Rastko \u0106iri\u0107 to perform the Rubber Soul Project songs live did not feature the musicians which recorded the album. At concerts were the musicians from the band Fathers & Sons: Boi\u017edar Skipi\u0107 (lead guitar, vocal), Branimir Kosar (keyboards), Nedeljko Kusi\u0107 (bass guitar) and Nikola \u0110oki\u0107 (drums), as well as Maja Klisinski (percussion). In 1999, they started a series of concerts, which was stopped by the [[NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia]]. Before the beginning of the bombing, the band held concerts at the British Council Cultural Centre (16 March), the Center for Cultural Decontamination (on 19 March), Hemingway Club (on 21 March) and the Museum of Yugoslav Kinotheque (on 23 March).\n\nOn 21 April 2001, in [[Museum of Applied Arts, Belgrade|Belgrade Museum of Applied Arts]], the original Rubber Soul Project lineup, with the addition of Branko Kosar and Maja Klisinski, performed songs from the album.\n\nIn December 2005, \u0106iri\u0107 and Skrobonja were invited to by Liverpool Beatles Fan Club to unveil a plaque to [[John Lennon]] on the wall of Lennon Studios, formerly [[Liverpool]] Maternity Hospital (in which Lennon was born).<ref name=\"vreme780\">[http://www.vreme.rs/cms/view.php?id=436968 \"INTERVJU -

[[rockabilly]]-oriented, and the song \"Hitch Hike\" was the \"Ringo Starr song\" sung by Macura.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The song \"India\" featured a [[parrot]] trained to pronounce the line

The band took their name from the famous [[Beatles]] record ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' released in 1965. Their first album, ''[[The Rubber Soul Project (album)|The Rubber Soul Project]]'', released in 1996, was conceived as an imaginary [[Beatles]] album, with the band writing music and lyrics to songs for which they had heard only the titles. Their second album, ''The Rubber Soul Project 2'', also inspired by the music and the titles of never-before-heard Beatles songs, was released in 2015.\n\n==History==\n\n===''The Rubber Soul Project''===\nThe band history begins in 1993 in [[Belgrade]], when visual artist [[Rastko \u0106iri\u0107]], professor of Illustration and Animation at the [[University of Arts in Belgrade|Belgrade Faculty of Applied Arts]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] writer Goran Skrobonja bonded over their mutual love for the Beatles.<ref name=\"vreme1270\">[http://www.vreme.rs/cms/view.php?id=1295363 \"INTERVJU \u2013 RASTKO \u0106IRI\u0106, PROFESOR, MUZI\u010cAR I AUTOR RUBBER SOUL PROJECTA: Izma\u0161tavanje Bitlsa\", vreme.rs]</ref> Inspired by the titles of songs the Beatles never released (some of which were available on [[bootleg recording]]s in [[Western Europe]], but not in Serbia) they found in Jeff Russel's book ''The Beatles \u2013 Album files and Complete Discography'', the two set out to write lyrics and music in the manner in which the Beatles would have done it.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The lyrics were written by Skrobonja, and the music was written by \u0106iri\u0107.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The two then decided to record the album with their songs.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> In 1995, the band, named The Rubber Soul Project (in honor of the 30th anniversary of the Beatles ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album), was formed. It consisted of \u0106iri\u0107, Neboj\u0161a Ignjatovi\u0107, musician and professor of [[double bass]] at the [[University of Arts in Belgrade|Belgrade Music Academy]], Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107, bass guitarist of the popular Serbian band [[Bajaga i Instruktori]], and \u010cedomir Macura, the drummer of Bajaga i Instruktori.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nThe album ''[[The Rubber Soul Project (album)|The Rubber Soul Project]]'' was recorded from December 1994 to March 1995. On the album recording \u0106iri\u0107 sang and played [[acoustic guitar]], [[piano]], [[soprano recorder]], [[tambourine]], [[maracas]], [[kazoo]]s, [[jingle bell]]s and [[xylophone]], Ignjatovi\u0107 sang and played [[electric guitar]], [[twelve-string guitar]], acoustic guitar, piano, tambourine, [[cabassa]], [[synthesizer]] and [[flute]], Cvetkovi\u0107 played [[H\u00f6fner 500/1|H\u00f6fner 500/1 violin bass]], tambourine, electric guitar, [[keyboard bass]], maracas, [[slide guitar]] and sang backing vocals, and Macura played [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] and did lead vocals on the track \"When I Come To Town\", the \"[[Ringo Starr]] song\" of the album. The album was produced by Ignjatovi\u0107 and Cvetkovi\u0107, the latter also being the recording engineer. The goal of the band members was to produce the authentic Beatles sound and atmosphere. Miroslav Cvetkovi\u0107 played the H\u00f6fner 500/1 violin bass, the same type [[Paul McCartney]] used, and Macura played on the [[Ludwig Drums|Ludwig]] drum set, the type Ringo Starr played on all Beatles records. The album included a [[sitar]] [[George Harrison]]-style track called \"Indian Rope Trick\", [[rock and roll]] songs \"Home\", \"When I Come To Town\", and \"Bound By Love\", [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] \"Colliding Circles\", \"Watching Rainbows\", and \"Rubber Soul\".<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nIn March 1996, record label [[PGP-RTS]] released the album on vinyl (circulation of less than 200 copies, exclusively for radio stations) and [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]]. The album was met by positive reactions from both the audience and the critics. In April 1996, an article about the project was published in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine. Several videos were recorded for the songs from the album. The video for the song \"Colliding Circles\", directed by Sr\u0111an Markovi\u0107 and Jelena Obradovi\u0107, was awarded the Golden Plaque and the video for the song \"Rubber Soul\", directed by Aleksandar Devi\u0107, was awarded the Best Debut Award at the 1998 Belgrade Festival of Short and Documentary film.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/>\n\nAs the authors of the album were unhappy with the fact that they never received any information from PGP-RTS about the number of sold copies, let alone an agreed percentage of the sales, the project was offered to other local publishers in attempt to publish the album on [[compact disc]], but none of them showed interest. Finally, after the three-year contract expired in 1998, the authors agreed to print the CD as their private issue in limited circulation, which appeared in sales at the beginning of 1999.<ref name=\"vreme1270\"/> The CD edition package featured a [[novella]] entitled ''Rubber Soul'', originally written by Skrobonja in 1993. The novella was written as a combination of fiction and facts, with the projection of some twenty years in the future. It was illustrated with \"documents\" created by Rastko \u0106iri\u0107. In 1994, the novella was proclaimed the best science fiction story in [[FR Yugoslavia]].\n\n===''The Rubber Soul Project'' documentary===\nThe idea to create some kind of film about the Rubber Soul Project was present from the very beginnings of the project in 1993.

The county board is also responsible for the Armagh inter-county teams.\n\n==Kits, colours and crest==\nArmagh's county colours are Orange and White. Originally they wore black and amber striped shirts until 1926 when [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nuns from [[Omeath]], in [[County Louth]] knitted the team a pair of Orange and White kits ahead of a Junior clash with [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] which they have kept since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/gaa/6-counties-who-have-changed-their-gaa-kit-colours-and-the-reasons-why/333654|title=6 Counties Who Have Changed Their GAA Kit Colours And The Reasons Why|first=Conor|last=Neville|date=|website=balls.ie}}</ref>\n\n==Gaelic football==\n[[File:Liam Bradley & Peter McDonnell.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Previous Armagh senior football manager Peter McDonnell (right) with [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] manager [[Liam Bradley]] (left) at the launch of the [[2009 Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\n\n===History===\nArmagh has a long tradition of football. Several clubs were already in existence before the formation of the County Board in 1889.<ref>[http://www.newrymemoirs.com/stories_pages/relandpolsplitgaa_1.html Newry Memoirs] feature on GAA</ref> \n\nArmagh became only the second team to win the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] in 1890. In the early years of the GAA, a club that won its county championship went on to represent the county and would also wear the county colours. [[Armagh Harps GFC|Armagh Harps]] represented Armagh in the Ulster final, beating Tyrone (Cookstown's [[Cookstown Fr. Rock's GAC|Owen Roes]]), but losing to All-Ireland Champions Cork ([[Midleton GAA|Midleton]]) in the All-Ireland Semi-Final.\n\nDespite early success at provincial level, national success at junior and minor level and All-Ireland final appearances in 1953 and 1977, it took until 2002 for Armagh to win their first and only [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] under manager [[Joe Kernan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Kernan]]. The county won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship, in 1949 and again in 2009, but lost the 1957 All-Ireland Minor final to Meath.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2009 campaign which resulted in Armagh being defeated by Tyrone, Peter McDonnell stepped down as Armagh manager.

However, in recent years the county hurlers have shown a marked improvement under the guidance of manager Mattie Lennon and his assistant Ger Rogan.\n\nIn 2006 Armagh won the NHL Division 3 championship, winning all their games in the group stages before beating Louth 3-10 to 1-11 in the final at Breffni Park in Cavan. The step up to Division 2 proved to be a difficult one for the men from the Orchard County. While the team failed to win any of their group games they were unfortunate to lose to Meath and also managed to come within a point of the 2006 [[Christy Ring Cup]] finalists Carlow. Heavier defeats were suffered at the hands of more established counties such as Derry and Laois.\n\nArmagh returned to the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] in May 2007 for the first time in almost 60 years with a match against Derry. Despite putting in a strong performance the team lost out on the chance of a semi-final encounter with neighbours Down to an injury-time score.\n\nThe advances made in the county over the past two years placed them as favourites in the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] encounter on August 12 against Roscommon; however they lost this game by two points.\n\nIn 2010, Armagh won the Nicky Rackard Cup, beating London on a scoreline of 3-15 to 3-14 on 3 July in Croke Park. The Minor team won the Ulster Minor Hurling League Division One title and reached the Ulster Minor Hurling Championship Final. The Under 21 team also reached the Ulster U21 Championship Final.\n\nIn 2011 the senior side reached the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] final for the first time since 1946 and made it to the [[Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship]] final for the second year in a row for the first time in their history.\nArmagh then won Division 2B in 2016 earning promotion to Division 2A. They were then subsequently relegated.\nThey then beat Down in the Ulster Hurling championship semi final giving them a place in the final where they were beaten. They beat Down in the 2017 ulster hurling semi final and are in the final.\nThey were beaten in the 2016 Nicky Rackard cup by Mayo on a score line of 2-16 to 1-15.\n\nIn 2012, Armagh won the Nicky Rackard Cup for the second time, beating Louth 3-20 to 1-15 on 9 June in Croke Park.\n\n===Honours===\n*'''[[Nicky Rackard Cup]]s:''' ''2''\n**2010, 2012\n*'''[[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''3''\n**1978, 1979, 2000\n*'''[[National Hurling League]]s:''' 1\n**Division 3 Champions 2006\n** Division 2B Champions 2016\n*'''[[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship]]s:''' ''None''\n*'''[[Ulster Minor Hurling Championship]]s:''' 1\n**1975\nUlster Minor Hurling League Division One Winners: 2010\n*'''[[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]]s:''' 6\n**1949, 1965, 1973, 1990, 1991, 2000\n\n==Camogie==\n\n===History===\nThe high point in Armagh's [[camogie]] history was an appearance in the [[National Camogie League]] final of [[National Camogie League 1995|1995]] against Cork, beating Galway and Wexford's first teams en route to the final. It came just one year after they qualified for senior status having won the [[All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship]] in 1994, the [[All-Ireland Junior Camogie Championship|\"Premier Junior\"]] championship for the [[Kathleen Mills|Kay Mills Cup]] just twelve months earlier in 1993. The bulk of that team had emerged from an under-16 squad who reached the [[All-Ireland Minor Camogie Championship|All Ireland final]] of 1988.\n\nArmagh won Division 2 of the National Camogie League four times, [[National Camogie League 1980|1980]], [[National Camogie League 1988|1988]], [[National Camogie League 1993|1993]] and [[National Camogie League 1994|1994]], and the [[All-Ireland Junior Camogie Championship#Nancy Murray Cup|Nancy Murray Cup]] in 2006.<ref name=\"auto\">2006 Jun A Armagh 0-7 Laois 0-1 in Drogheda scorers in [http://www.independent.ie/sport/for-the-record-135362.html Irish Independent]</ref> Armagh qualified for the [[All-Ireland Minor Camogie Championship#All Ireland Minor B Finals|All Ireland Minor B final]] of 2003<ref>2003 minor b Waterford 6-11 Armagh 1-4 report in [https://archive.is/20120801232455/http://www.independent.ie/sport/camogie-cork-minors-make-it-three-on-trot-207561.html Irish Independent]</ref> and won the Minor C championship in 2011.<ref name=\"camogie.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.camogie.ie/Home/tabid/54/mid/411/newsid412/1781/Murphy-goal-snatches-title-for-Armagh/Default.aspx|title=Minor C final Armagh 3-5 Meath 1-10 report on camogie.ie|author=|date=|website=camogie.ie}}</ref>\n\n[[Crossmaglen Rangers GAC|Crossmaglen]] won the 2005 [[All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship#All Ireland Junior Club Camogie Finals|All Ireland junior club title]].<ref>2003 Junior Crossmaglen 2-5 Drumcullen 0-6 report in [https://archive.is/20120909145710/http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/camogie-nash-goal-helps-granagh-to-glory-194657.html Irish Independent]</ref> Keady L\u00e1mh Dhearg qualified for the finals in 2006 and 2007.<ref>2006 junior club final Harps 1-7 Keady 0-5 report in [http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/kittens-claim-allireland-club-hattrick-69481.html Irish Independent] and [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2006/1120/1163947707012.html Irish Times]</ref><ref>2007 Junior club final Harps 2-8 Keady 2-7 report in [https://archive.is/20120804150607/http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/cashel-and-harps-take-top-club-honours-1222876.html Irish Independent], [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2007/1119/1195251431520.html Irish Times] and on [http://www.camogie.ie/Home/tabid/54/mid/411/newsid412/29/Cashel-and-Harps-are-champions/Default.aspx camogie.ie]</ref> Keady L\u00e1mh Dhearg and [[Ballymacnab Round Towers GAC#Camogie|St Brenda's Ballymacnab]] have won divisional honours at [[F\u00e9ile na nGael]].

The county board is also responsible for the Armagh inter-county teams.\n\n==Kits, colours and crest==\nArmagh's county colours are Orange and White. Originally they wore black and amber striped shirts until 1926 when [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nuns from [[Omeath]], in [[County Louth]] knitted the team a pair of Orange and White kits ahead of a Junior clash with [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] which they have kept since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/gaa/6-counties-who-have-changed-their-gaa-kit-colours-and-the-reasons-why/333654|title=6 Counties Who Have Changed Their GAA Kit Colours And The Reasons Why|first=Conor|last=Neville|date=|website=balls.ie}}</ref>\n\n==Gaelic football==\n[[File:Liam Bradley & Peter McDonnell.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Previous Armagh senior football manager Peter McDonnell (right) with [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] manager [[Liam Bradley]] (left) at the launch of the [[2009 Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\n\n===History===\nArmagh has a long tradition of football. Several clubs were already in existence before the formation of the County Board in 1889.<ref>[http://www.newrymemoirs.com/stories_pages/relandpolsplitgaa_1.html Newry Memoirs] feature on GAA</ref> \n\nArmagh became only the second team to win the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] in 1890. In the early years of the GAA, a club that won its county championship went on to represent the county and would also wear the county colours. [[Armagh Harps GFC|Armagh Harps]] represented Armagh in the Ulster final, beating Tyrone (Cookstown's [[Cookstown Fr. Rock's GAC|Owen Roes]]), but losing to All-Ireland Champions Cork ([[Midleton GAA|Midleton]]) in the All-Ireland Semi-Final.\n\nDespite early success at provincial level, national success at junior and minor level and All-Ireland final appearances in 1953 and 1977, it took until 2002 for Armagh to win their first and only [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] under manager [[Joe Kernan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Kernan]]. The county won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship, in 1949 and again in 2009, but lost the 1957 All-Ireland Minor final to Meath.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2009 campaign which resulted in Armagh being defeated by Tyrone, Peter McDonnell stepped down as Armagh manager. He was replaced by [[Paddy O'Rourke (Down footballer)|Paddy O'Rourke]], who is from the neighbouring county of [[Down GAA|Down]]. Paddy O'Rourke was replaced by Paul Grimley who managed Armagh for the 2013 and 2014 seasons. In 2015 [[Kieran McGeeney]] took over as manager in a five year contract that was extended by a year in 2019 to 2020.\n\n===The Two Brian's Era (1995 - 2001)===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! style=\"background:orange\"|NFL !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|Provincial !! ! style=\"background:orange\"|All Ireland !!! style=\"background:orange\"| Total\n|-\n| '''! style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Played''' || 38 || 13 || 5 || 56\n|-\n| '''! style=\"background:orange\"|'''Games Won''' || 18 || 7 || 2 || 27\n|-\n| '''! style=\"background:orange\"|'''Percentage Won''' || 47.37% || 53.85% || 40.00% || 48.22%\n|}\n\n===Joe Kernan's Golden Era (2002 - 2006) ===\n\n[[Joe Kernan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Kernan]] is widely regarded as Armagh's most successful manager having won one League title, four Ulster Championships and one All Ireland Championship.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

In his first season as Armagh manager, McGeeney secured promotion to division 2 of the National Football League and beating [[Fermanagh]] in the final - this would be his first of two division 3 NFL titles. In his first Ulster championship as manager, Armagh were defeated by [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] on a scoreline of 0-8 to 2-11. Armagh's championship continued through the qualifiers where they managed a single win over [[Wicklow]] before being defeated by [[Galway]] in round 2. \n\nThe 2016 NFL campaign ended with four teams finishing on the same points but by virtue of having a poor scoring difference Armagh were relegated to division 3. In the 2016 Ulster championship, Armagh were suffered a defeat at the hands of [[Cavan]] forcing Armagh to continue their championship through the backdoor which resulted in a  defeat to [[Laois]] in round 1. \n\nArmagh's 2017 NFL campaign ended with [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] beating Armagh in the last league game, this defeat resulted in Armagh missing out on promotion back to division 2. In the Ulster championship Armagh went out at the hands of [[Down GAA|Down]]. However, Armagh recovered with wins over [[Fermanagh]], [[Westmeath]], [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] and [[Kildare]] to book a place in the All Ireland quarter finals where they were defeated by rivals [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]]. \n\nArmagh started the 2018 season with promotion to division 2 but their Ulster championship ended with a loss to [[Fermanagh]] in the quarter final. Armagh continued their championship in round 1 of the qualifiers where they beat [[Westmeath]], [[Sligo]] and [[Clare GAA]] but were unable to overcome Connacht finalists [[Roscommon]]. \n\nThe 2019 campaign started off with Armagh securing their division 2 status with two wins and two draws. Armagh's 2019 Ulster championships started of with a quarter final win against rivals [[Down GAA|Down]] which would be Kieran McGeeney's first win in Ulster as manager of Armagh. [[Cavan]] and Armagh were inseparable in the first game but [[Cavan]] took the victory in the replay. In the qualifiers Armagh were pitted against [[Monaghan]] winning the game 2-17 to 1-12. In round 3 of the qualifiers Armagh were drawn against [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] who would eventually defeat the Orchard county by a single point. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

However, in recent years the county hurlers have shown a marked improvement under the guidance of manager Mattie Lennon and his assistant Ger Rogan.\n\nIn 2006 Armagh won the NHL Division 3 championship, winning all their games in the group stages before beating Louth 3-10 to 1-11 in the final at Breffni Park in Cavan. The step up to Division 2 proved to be a difficult one for the men from the Orchard County. While the team failed to win any of their group games they were unfortunate to lose to Meath and also managed to come within a point of the 2006 [[Christy Ring Cup]] finalists Carlow. Heavier defeats were suffered at the hands of more established counties such as Derry and Laois.\n\nArmagh returned to the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] in May 2007 for the first time in almost 60 years with a match against Derry. Despite putting in a strong performance the team lost out on the chance of a semi-final encounter with neighbours Down to an injury-time score.\n\nThe advances made in the county over the past two years placed them as favourites in the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] encounter on August 12 against Roscommon; however they lost this game by two points.\n\nIn 2010, Armagh won the Nicky Rackard Cup, beating London on a scoreline of 3-15 to 3-14 on 3 July in Croke Park. The Minor team won the Ulster Minor Hurling League Division One title and reached the Ulster Minor Hurling Championship Final. The Under 21 team also reached the Ulster U21 Championship Final.\n\nIn 2011 the senior side reached the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] final for the first time since 1946 and made it to the [[Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship]] final for the second year in a row for the first time in their history.\nArmagh then won Division 2B in 2016 earning promotion to Division 2A. They were then subsequently relegated.\nThey then beat Down in the Ulster Hurling championship semi final giving them a place in the final where they were beaten.

Accessed May 30, 2012.</ref> The rolling hills and rich soils which produce bountiful agricultural crops drew Native American tribes and then Europeans to the area.\n\n==Geology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}Around 500 million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands shaped like an arch collided with proto North America and rode over the top of the North American plate. The rock from the islands created the highlands of Hunterdon County as there was a shallow sea where Hunterdon County is now located.  Then around four hundred million B.C., a small continent that was long and thin, collided with proto North America. This collision created compression, which caused heat. The Paleozoic sediment of shale and sandstone folded and faulted. The heat allowed the igneous rock to bend, thus Hunterdon County was born.\n\nThe African plate which later collided with North America created more folding and faulting, especially in the southern Appalachians.  Then the African and North America plates tore and drifted away from each other.\n\nThe Wisconsin glacier that entered into New Jersey around 21,000 [[Common Era|BCE]] and then melted around 13,000 BCE did not reach Hunterdon County. However, there are glacial outwash deposits from streams and rivers that flowed from the glacier southward depositing rock and sediment.\n\nHunterdon County has two geophysical provinces.  The first is the Highlands which is the western section of the county.  The other is the Piedmont which is the eastern and southern section of the county.  The Highlands account for one-third of the area and Piedmont accounts for two-thirds of the county.\n\nThe Highlands are part of the Reading Prong.  Limestone and shale over igneous rock comprise the Highlands.\n\nPiedmont includes the Hunterdon Plateau and the Raritan Valley Lowlands which are {{convert|150|to|300|ft}} above sea level.  Piedmont is made up of shale and sandstone.\n\n[[File: Califon Bridge.JPG|thumb|The bridge over the South Branch of the Raritan River in Califon.]]\n[[File: Oldwick General Store.JPG|thumb|Oldwick General Store]]\n\n==Paleo Indians and Native Americans==\nPaleo Indians moved into Hunterdon County between 12,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE. The area was warming due to climate change.  The Wisconsin Glacier in Warren and Sussex County was retreating northward.  The area was that of Taiga/Boreal forests. Paleo Indians traveled in small groups in search of game and edible plants.  They used spears made of bone, jasper or black chert.  Their camp sites are difficult to find as they are many feet below the present surface.\n\nNative Americans moved into the area but the time they arrived is unknown. Most have come from the Mississippi River area.  Many tribes of the Delaware Nation lived in Hunterdon County especially along the Delaware River and in the Flemington area.  These tribes were agricultural in nature, growing corn, beans and squash.  Those that lived along the South Branch of the Raritan River fished and farmed.  There was a Native American trail that went along the South Branch of the Raritan River (Philhower 1924).\n\n==European settlement==\nLand purchases from Native Americans occurred from 1688 to 1758.  Large land purchases from Native Americans occurred in 1703, 1709 and 1710.  Over {{convert|150000|acre|km2}} were bought with metal knives and pots, clothing, blankets, barrels of rum or hard cider, guns, powder and shot.  This allowed for European settlers to enter into Hunterdon County in the early 18th century.  After 1760, nearly all Native Americans left New Jersey and relocated to eastern Canada or the Mississippi River area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe first European settlers were Col.

Accessed May 30, 2012.</ref> The rolling hills and rich soils which produce bountiful agricultural crops drew Native American tribes and then Europeans to the area.\n\n==Geology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}Around 500 million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands shaped like an arch collided with proto North America and rode over the top of the North American plate. The rock from the islands created the highlands of Hunterdon County as there was a shallow sea where Hunterdon County is now located.  Then around four hundred million B.C., a small continent that was long and thin, collided with proto North America. This collision created compression, which caused heat. The Paleozoic sediment of shale and sandstone folded and faulted. The heat allowed the igneous rock to bend, thus Hunterdon County was born.\n\nThe African plate which later collided with North America created more folding and faulting, especially in the southern Appalachians.  Then the African and North America plates tore and drifted away from each other.\n\nThe Wisconsin glacier that entered into New Jersey around 21,000 [[Common Era|BCE]] and then melted around 13,000 BCE did not reach Hunterdon County. However, there are glacial outwash deposits from streams and rivers that flowed from the glacier southward depositing rock and sediment.\n\nHunterdon County has two geophysical provinces.  The first is the Highlands which is the western section of the county.  The other is the Piedmont which is the eastern and southern section of the county.  The Highlands account for one-third of the area and Piedmont accounts for two-thirds of the county.\n\nThe Highlands are part of the Reading Prong.  Limestone and shale over igneous rock comprise the Highlands.\n\nPiedmont includes the Hunterdon Plateau and the Raritan Valley Lowlands which are {{convert|150|to|300|ft}} above sea level.  Piedmont is made up of shale and sandstone.\n\n[[File: Califon Bridge.JPG|thumb|The bridge over the South Branch of the Raritan River in Califon.]]\n[[File: Oldwick General Store.JPG|thumb|Oldwick General Store]]\n\n==Paleo Indians and Native Americans==\nPaleo Indians moved into Hunterdon County between 12,000 BCE and 11,000 BCE. The area was warming due to climate change.  The Wisconsin Glacier in Warren and Sussex County was retreating northward.  The area was that of Taiga/Boreal forests. Paleo Indians traveled in small groups in search of game and edible plants.  They used spears made of bone, jasper or black chert.  Their camp sites are difficult to find as they are many feet below the present surface.\n\nNative Americans moved into the area but the time they arrived is unknown. Most have come from the Mississippi River area.  Many tribes of the Delaware Nation lived in Hunterdon County especially along the Delaware River and in the Flemington area.  These tribes were agricultural in nature, growing corn, beans and squash.  Those that lived along the South Branch of the Raritan River fished and farmed.  There was a Native American trail that went along the South Branch of the Raritan River (Philhower 1924).\n\n==European settlement==\nLand purchases from Native Americans occurred from 1688 to 1758.  Large land purchases from Native Americans occurred in 1703, 1709 and 1710.  Over {{convert|150000|acre|km2}} were bought with metal knives and pots, clothing, blankets, barrels of rum or hard cider, guns, powder and shot.  This allowed for European settlers to enter into Hunterdon County in the early 18th century.  After 1760, nearly all Native Americans left New Jersey and relocated to eastern Canada or the Mississippi River area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe first European settlers were Col.

In the ensuing argument, Mike has a moment of road rage with a motorist that culminates into Mike getting assaulted after chasing the motorist down the road. At the hospital, where Mike is recovering from minor head wounds, Kyle's fianc\u00e9 visits Mike and is confronted by Kyle over her affair. After she tells him that she still loves him, he then asks if she still wants to get married.\n\nKyle's fianc\u00e9 goes on to marry Mike instead, but she unexpectedly dies shortly after. A visibly distraught Mike causes a scene at her funeral which is diffused by Kyle, who came to pay his respects. Mike admits to Kyle that what he did was wrong and that he's a terrible friend. Though Kyle is still angry at Mike, he still consoles him over his loss. Sometime later, Kyle, now in better physical shape, is working as a commercial-jingle writer and is dating his former high-school girlfriend, Marissa, with whom he is celebrating Thanksgiving with his family. Though his overprotective, overbearing mother is disapproving of the relationship, she is nonetheless happy for him when he announces his engagement with her. She then reveals to Kyle that she invited Mike to celebrate Christmas with them, noting his having no family of his own to celebrate with.\n\nOn Christmas night, a now overweight, alcoholic Mike arrives at Kyle's family's home. Finding his way into the garage, he comes across some old pictures of himself and his old helmet from when he played football in high school. Kyle's mother confronts Mike and tells him that he needs to make amends with Kyle for his selfish actions stop feeling sorry for himself over how he hurt him. Kyle then stumbles into the living room where he passes out drunk.\n\nSeeing Mike's worsened state, Kyle invites him to join him and Marissa on their vacation to a ski resort over New Years. After breaking his arm on a difficult slope, Mike is given permission by Kyle to stay with them for the night, the two of them getting drunk together and catching up on their pasts. A frustrated Marissa tells Kyle that Mike is a negative influence on his life and that he needs to cut him out from it. When Marissa goes to bed early, Kyle joins her in the hopes of having sex, but he quickly passes out before she returns from the bathroom. She then goes down to confront Mike about his behavior, and he attempts to kiss her. Though disgusted, she physically pressures him into following through with his advances, convinced that it will finally convince Kyle to break off their friendship for good.\n\nMike and Marissa's brother Ronnie plan a surprise ice-fishing bachelor party for Kyle before his impending wedding with Marissa. When Kyle momentarily steps away from the party, Mike approaches him and admits that he slept with Marissa. Kyle, angered once again, surprises Mike by saying that he no longer cares and simply wants to spend his life with someone who cares for him. Mike responds that Marissa doesn't actually care for Kyle as he is and wants to turn him into something she wants him to be, suggesting that he leaves her. At some point, Kyle breaks through a thin patch of ice in the frozen lake, though Mike manages to pull him out.\n\nKyle has since cut all ties with Mike, who is lonelier than ever. On the day of Kyle and Marissa's wedding, Mike crashes the ceremony and objects to their union, instigating a small brawl in the church between him and members of both Kyle and Marissa's families. During the confrontation, Marissa loudly declares that she's pregnant and that she's adamant about getting married. Upon learning this, the priest refuses to wed them over concerns that their child is pressuring them into a potentially doomed marriage and advises them to wait until after the child is born.\n\nAbout a year later, Mike is now working at a bicycle shop/caf\u00e9, where a now-married Kyle and Marissa visit him with their newly-born son, the former of whom still misses Mike.\n\nSeveral years later, Kyle and Marissa decide to divorce, presumably over Kyle's seeming refusal to remove Mike from his life. Kyle lives close to Marissa to stay in touch with their son and maintains his friendship with Mike, whom Kyle\u2019a son affectionately refers to as his \u201cuncle.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* Michael Angelo Covino as Mike\n* Kyle Marvin as Kyle\n* [[Gayle Rankin]] as Marissa\n* [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]] as Ava\n* [[Talia Balsam]] as Suzi\n* [[George Wendt]] as Jim\n* Daniella Covino as Dani\n\n==Release==\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section on May 17, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-articles/communique/articles/the-screenings-guide-2019|title=The Screenings Guide 2019|date=May 9, 2019|accessdate=May 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/cannes-festival-2019-full-list-of-films |title=Cannes festival 2019: full list of films |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 18, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/the-climb-movie-cycling-comedy-sony-classics-deal-cannes-1202622085/|title=Sony Classics Acquires Un Certain Regard Buddy Comedy \u2018The Climb\u2019 \u2013 Cannes|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=May 24, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> The film went onto screen at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/telluride-film-festival-2019-lineup-ford-vs-ferrari-judy-full-list-of-movies-1202706577/|title=Telluride Film Festival: \u2018Ford V Ferrari\u2019, \u2018Judy\u2019, \u2018Motherless Brooklyn\u2019, Weinstein-Inspired Drama \u2018The Assistant\u2019 Among Premieres Headed to 46th Edition \u2013 Full List|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Pete|last=Hammond|date=August 29, 2019|accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aeronauts-burnt-orange-heresy-join-tiff-2019-lineup-1231031|title='The Aeronauts,' 'Burnt Orange Heresy' Added to Toronto Film Fest Lineup|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Etan|last=Vlessing|date=August 13, 2019|accessdate=August 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/events/the-climb|title=The Climb|website=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> and the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 24, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sundance.org/projects/the-climb-3d1157ca-7585-4795-884c-945641173bac|title=The Climb|website=[[Sundance Film Festival]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt was scheduled to be released on March 20, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/video/the-climb-trailer-cannes-feature-1202198306/|title=\u2018The Climb\u2019 Trailer: Cannes Breakout Kicks the Buddy Comedy Into a Hilarious New Gear \u2014 Exclusive|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Kate|last=Erbland|date=December 19, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> Previously, Sony Pictures Classics stated they would go ahead with the release of the film despite the [[COVID-19]] pandemic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/the-climb-interview-coronavirus-michael-covino-1202217527/|title=As Studios Postpone Big Theatrical Releases, \u2018The Climb\u2019 Sees Opportunity \u2014 For Now|website=IndieWire|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=March 13, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> However, it was later pulled from the schedule, and re-dated to July 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/sony-pictures-classics-release-the-climb-postponed-in-wake-of-ny-la-theater-closures-1202884481/|title=Sony Pictures Classics\u2019 Release \u2018The Climb\u2019 Postponed In Wake Of NY & LA Theater Closures|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ERCboxoffice/status/1239931460519251968|title=Warm summer nights.

Kyle lives close to Marissa to stay in touch with their son and maintains his friendship with Mike, whom Kyle\u2019a son affectionately refers to as his \u201cuncle.\u201d\n\n==Cast==\n* Michael Angelo Covino as Mike\n* Kyle Marvin as Kyle\n* [[Gayle Rankin]] as Marissa\n* [[Judith Godr\u00e8che]] as Ava\n* [[Talia Balsam]] as Suzi\n* [[George Wendt]] as Jim\n* Daniella Covino as Dani\n\n==Release==\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section on May 17, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-articles/communique/articles/the-screenings-guide-2019|title=The Screenings Guide 2019|date=May 9, 2019|accessdate=May 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/cannes-festival-2019-full-list-of-films |title=Cannes festival 2019: full list of films |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 18, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/the-climb-movie-cycling-comedy-sony-classics-deal-cannes-1202622085/|title=Sony Classics Acquires Un Certain Regard Buddy Comedy \u2018The Climb\u2019 \u2013 Cannes|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=May 24, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> The film went onto screen at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 30, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/telluride-film-festival-2019-lineup-ford-vs-ferrari-judy-full-list-of-movies-1202706577/|title=Telluride Film Festival: \u2018Ford V Ferrari\u2019, \u2018Judy\u2019, \u2018Motherless Brooklyn\u2019, Weinstein-Inspired Drama \u2018The Assistant\u2019 Among Premieres Headed to 46th Edition \u2013 Full List|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Pete|last=Hammond|date=August 29, 2019|accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2019,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aeronauts-burnt-orange-heresy-join-tiff-2019-lineup-1231031|title='The Aeronauts,' 'Burnt Orange Heresy' Added to Toronto Film Fest Lineup|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Etan|last=Vlessing|date=August 13, 2019|accessdate=August 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tiff.net/events/the-climb|title=The Climb|website=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> and the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 24, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sundance.org/projects/the-climb-3d1157ca-7585-4795-884c-945641173bac|title=The Climb|website=[[Sundance Film Festival]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt was scheduled to be released on March 20, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/video/the-climb-trailer-cannes-feature-1202198306/|title=\u2018The Climb\u2019 Trailer: Cannes Breakout Kicks the Buddy Comedy Into a Hilarious New Gear \u2014 Exclusive|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Kate|last=Erbland|date=December 19, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> Previously, Sony Pictures Classics stated they would go ahead with the release of the film despite the [[COVID-19]] pandemic.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/03/the-climb-interview-coronavirus-michael-covino-1202217527/|title=As Studios Postpone Big Theatrical Releases, \u2018The Climb\u2019 Sees Opportunity \u2014 For Now|website=IndieWire|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=March 13, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> However, it was later pulled from the schedule, and re-dated to July 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/sony-pictures-classics-release-the-climb-postponed-in-wake-of-ny-la-theater-closures-1202884481/|title=Sony Pictures Classics\u2019 Release \u2018The Climb\u2019 Postponed In Wake Of NY & LA Theater Closures|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ERCboxoffice/status/1239931460519251968|title=Warm summer nights.

The Victorian Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty Victoria), and solicitor Eric Vadarlis, were seeking a [[writ]] of [[habeas corpus]] (an order for the asylum seekers to be released). The case is significant because it is one of the few cases to consider the nature and scope of the [[prerogative power]] of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch of Government]] in Australia.\n\n==Background to the case==\n\n===Executive power===\n\nOne of the key issues in the case, both at trial and on appeal, was the nature of the executive power of government. There are several sources of executive power, but the source in consideration in this case was the prerogative power of government.\n\nThe concept of prerogative power, often referred to in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[Royal Prerogative]], consists of various powers belonging exclusively to [[the Crown]], such as the power to make [[treaty|treaties]] or the power to [[declaration of war|declare war]]. The Royal Prerogative was generally said to derive from the [[common law]]. The prerogative powers are not unlimited, and they can be superseded by [[statute]], or lost over time through disuse.<ref name=\"B&W\">{{Cite book|author=[[Tony Blackshield|Blackshield, Tony]] & [[George Williams (lawyer)|Williams, George]] | year=2006 | title=Australian Constitutional Law and Theory | edition=Fourth | publisher=The Federation Press | location=Sydney | isbn = 1-86287-586-3}}</ref> A statute can completely replace a prerogative power (extinguish it), or it can merely define how decisions should be made, and what factors to consider, when exercising a power.\n\nIn Australia, it is generally accepted that the prerogative power is included in [[Section 61 of the Constitution of Australia|section 61]] of the [[Constitution of Australia]],<ref name=\"B&W\" /> the section which vests the executive power of Australia in the Crown and the [[Governor-General of Australia]] as the Crown's representative. By [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], the executive functions of government in Australia are carried out from day to day by the [[Government of Australia]].\n\n===The Tampa affair===\n{{Main|Tampa affair}}\n\nOn 26 August 2001, the [[MV Tampa|MV ''Tampa'']] rescued 433 people, asylum seekers bound for Australia, and of mainly [[Afghanistan|Afghani]] background, from their wooden fishing boat. The boat was sinking in [[international waters]] about 140 kilometres north of [[Christmas Island]] (an [[states and territories of Australia|Australian territory]]). Initially the Captain sought to take the rescuees to Indonesia, but they objected, with some threatening to commit suicide if they were not taken to Australia. Some of the people required medical attention, and the ''Tampa'' then proceeded to the nearest port, at Christmas Island. The ''Tampa'' stopped at the boundary of Australia's [[territorial sea]] (twelve [[nautical mile]]s offshore) to request permission to enter Australian waters and unload the asylum seekers, but permission was refused.\n\nOn 29 August, the ''Tampa'' declared a state of emergency and entered Australian waters. About four nautical miles offshore, the ship was stopped and boarded by forty-five [[Special Air Service (Australia)|SAS]] troops, who took control of the ship and anchored it.\n\nThis action prompted the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties (VCCL) to take action. Along with Victorian solicitor Eric Vadarlis, they initiated proceedings in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] for a writ of habeas corpus, against the [[Government of Australia]] and three Ministers, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, [[Philip Ruddock]], the [[Attorney-General of Australia]], [[Daryl Williams (politician)|Daryl Williams]], and the Minister for Defence, [[Peter Reith]]. During the proceedings, [[Amnesty International]] and the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] intervened in the case, generally supporting VCCL and Vadarlis.\n\nThe various Government parties were represented by a team of lawyers including the [[Solicitor-General of Australia]], [[David Bennett (barrister)|David Bennett]] AO [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. VCCL and Vadarlis were represented by a number of [[barrister]]s well known for their public involvement in refugee law and [[pro bono]] work for refugees, including [[Julian Burnside]] QC.\n\n===Initial proceedings===\nThe applications were made in [[Melbourne]] on 31 August, at 5.00 p.m. Melbourne time, and the court was convened by 5.40 p.m., with Judge [[Anthony North|North]] presiding. Both VCCL and Vadarlis argued that the court should immediately make an order preventing the Government from removing the ''Tampa'' from Australian waters. North thought there was a strong basis for making such an order, but decided that he would make a final decision the next morning. Nevertheless, North warned that the asylum seekers should not be moved off the ''Tampa'' in the meantime, and this had the effect of a temporary [[injunction]].\n\nThe court reconvened on the morning of 1 September, but while proceedings were underway, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] announced the [[Pacific Solution]], under which the asylum seekers on the ''Tampa'' would be transferred to [[Nauru]] and [[New Zealand]]. As such, the Government asked that the case should be concluded that day, so that the Solution could be implemented. North decided that the trial should start the following day, on 2 September.\n\n===Trial===\nOver the night of 1 September, VCCL, Vadarlis and the Government agreed upon a statement of facts for the case, so that the proceedings could run faster. Approximately 100 people were involved on the Government side alone in working on the statement and preparing documents for the next morning's hearing. The trial started later in the morning, and the court started hearing evidence, but later that day it was announced that under the Pacific Solution, the Government planned to transfer the asylum seekers to [[HMAS Manoora (L 52)|HMAS ''Manoora'']] in order to carry them to [[Port Moresby]] for transfer to Nauru and New Zealand.\n\nThe issue of the injunction (which prevented the removal of the ''Tampa'' or the people on it) was still outstanding, and an agreement could not be reached. North sent the parties to [[mediation]], and that evening an agreement was reached, which allowed the Government to transfer the asylum seekers to the ''Manoora''.\n\nVCCL and Vadarlis made two main arguments. Firstly, they argued that the provisions of the ''[[Migration Act 1958]]'' (which regulates immigration) applied to the asylum seekers, and the normal procedures for dealing with other non-citizens should be applied. The ''Migration Act'' did empower the Government to detain all non-citizens, under the system of [[mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention]], but it also gave non-citizens certain rights, such as the right to seek [[Right of asylum|asylum]] and to apply for protection [[Visa (document)|visa]]s. As such, they argued that the asylum seekers should be taken to the mainland and be allowed to apply for visas. Alternatively, they argued that if the ''Migration Act'' did not apply to the situation of these asylum seekers, then they were being detained unlawfully, and that no-one in Australia, regardless of their citizenship status, could be detained unlawfully or arbitrarily, and so they should be released.\n\nOn the other hand, the Government argued that the non-citizens (whom they described as \"unlawful non-citizens\") were not being detained at all, and contended that they were free to go anywhere they pleased, with the exception of Australia. They also argued that even if the non-citizens were being detained, then despite there being no [[statute|statutory]] authority for their detention, the Government had a [[prerogative power]] to expel non-citizens from Australian waters.\n\n===Judgment at trial===\nJustice North delivered his decision on 11 September 2001.\n\nNorth decided that the asylum seekers (which he referred to as \"rescuees\") were in fact being detained by the Government. He found that the Government did indeed intend to control the rescuees, by directing the ''Tampa'' where it could go, by closing the port at Christmas Island, and by making decisions about what would happen to them without consulting them. North added that \"the presence of 45 SAS troops, armed and in combat fatigues, is likely to have led the rescuees to the conclusion that they were bound to do as they were told.\"<ref name=\"north\">{{Cite AustLII|FCA|1297|2001|litigants=Victorian Council for Civil Liberties Inc v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs |date=18 September 2001 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nNorth then considered whether there was a prerogative power which could be exercised to detain the asylum seekers. He found that it was unlikely that such a power existed at all, and even if it once did, then it had been replaced by the statutory scheme in the ''Migration Act'', which now identified and regulated all the powers of the [[executive (government)|executive government]] to deal with non-citizens. North relied on a number of authorities, including a 1906 case of the [[High Court of Australia]], in which Justice [[Edmund Barton|Barton]] found that \"the question to-day is one of statutory authority.\"<ref name=\"robtelmes\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|58|1906|litigants=[[Robtelmes v Brenan]] |date=2 October 1906 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/58.pdf (1906) 4 CLR 395]}}.</ref>\n\nUltimately, North granted a writ of habeas corpus, which he preferred to describe more simply as \"an order for release.\"<ref name=\"north\" /> He found that the Government had no statutory authority to detain the asylum seekers, and since there was no prerogative power to detain them, they were being held unlawfully and had to be released.\n\nNorth rejected a number of other arguments based on particular provisions of the ''Migration Act'' on the basis that VCCL and Vadarlis did not have [[standing (law)|standing]] to make those arguments.\n\n==Arguments==\nThe Government quickly appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, and on 12 September an application was granted to fast-track the proceedings. The arguments were heard on 13 September.\n\nThe Government argued that Judge North had erred in his judgment on a number of matters. They argued that North had made incorrect findings of fact, and that in truth:\n\n* the rescuees were not being detained by the SAS troops,\n* in reality it was the captain of the ''Tampa'', [[Arne Rinnan]], who was detaining the rescuees,\n* the circumstances of the rescuees were self-inflicted, and\n* the rescuees were not detained because they had the option of going to Nauru or New Zealand under the Pacific Solution.\n\nThey also argued that North erred in finding that the Government did not have a [[prerogative power]] to prevent the rescuees from entering Australia, and the complementary power to detain the rescuees for the purposes of expelling them from Australia. This was the principal issue in the appeal.\n\nThe VCCL and Vadarlis again argued that if there was such a prerogative power, it had been completely replaced by the statutory scheme in the ''[[Migration Act 1958]]''. They argued that the Act \"covered the field\", that is, it was so comprehensive that it demonstrated an intention to completely displace any other executive powers in the subject area (the concept of \"covering the field\" usually refers to the way that federal laws can displace state laws if they show an intention to be the only law with respect to the subject matter, see [[section 109 of the Australian Constitution]]).\n\nJudge [[Robert French|French]] summarised the key issues in the appeal as being:\n<blockquote>\n\n# \"Whether the executive power of the Commonwealth authorised and supported the expulsion of the rescuees and their detention for that purpose.\n# \"If there was no such executive power, whether the rescuees were subject to a restraint attributable to the Commonwealth and amenable to habeas corpus.\"<ref name=\"french\">{{Cite AustLII|FCA|1329|2001|litigants=Ruddock v Vadarlis |pinpoint=per French J starting paragraph 127}}.</ref>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n==Judgment==\nThe Full Court handed down its decision on 18 September. Justice [[Robert French|French]] delivered the majority opinion, with Justice [[Bryan Beaumont|Beaumont]] agreeing with him. Chief Justice [[Michael Black (judge)|Black]] dissented.\n\n===The majority===\nJustice French found that there is indeed a prerogative power to prevent the entry of non-citizens into Australia, and as a corollary, the power to do various things that are necessary to prevent such an entry. He said that:\n<blockquote>\n\"The power to determine who may come into Australia is so central to its [Australia's] sovereignty that it is not to be supposed that the Government of the nation would lack the power conferred upon it directly by the Constitution, the ability to prevent people not part of the Australia community [sic], from entering.\"<ref name=\"french\" />{{rp|para 193}}\n</blockquote>\nFrench said that this \"gatekeeping\" function had been recognised in a number of English cases, including an 1837 case concerning the power of the [[Governor of British Mauritius|Governor of Mauritius]] to eject non-citizens, and a 1906 case concerning the deportation of foreign workers from [[Canada]].<ref name=\"french\" />{{rp|paras 186\u2013190}}\n\nFrench also decided that, although statutes are capable of replacing prerogative powers, the ''Migration Act'' had not replaced the prerogative power in this case.

He said that \"to the extent that the Commonwealth prevented the rescuees landing on Australian soil it closed a possible avenue out of a situation in which they had been placed by other factors.\"<ref name=\"french\" />{{rp|para 212}} He also found that just because travelling to Nauru or New Zealand under the Pacific Solution was the only real exit from the situation for the rescuees, that did not mean the Government was responsible for detaining them.<ref name=\"french\" />{{rp|para 213}}\n\n===Black's dissent===\nChief Justice Black dissented, finding that although the executive does have the power to exclude or expel non-citizens from within the country, in Australia that power is completely contained within legislation.\n\nBlack, citing a range of authorities from case law and academic works, decided that although there probably once was a prerogative power to exclude non-citizens, it had fallen into disuse and was no longer considered a valid prerogative power by the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"black\">{{Cite AustLII|FCA|1329|2001|litigants=Ruddock v Vadarlis  |pinpoint=per Black CJ starting paragraph 1}}.</ref> Indeed, one source indicated that it seemed that the last time the prerogative power had been used was in 1771.<ref name=\"holdsworth\">{{Cite book| first=William | last=Holdsworth | authorlink=William Holdsworth | year=1938 | title=A History of English Law, Volume X | publisher=Sweet & Maxwell}}</ref> He did not consider it necessary to decide conclusively whether the power still existed or not, saying that it was sufficient when considering whether legislation had superseded the power to know that it was at best questionable whether the power even remained in existence.\n\nUltimately, Black decided that the ''Migration Act'', which provided \"for a very comprehensive regime\" about the entry into Australia of non-citizens, was exclusive and did displace any remnant of prerogative power that remained on the subject. He said that:\n<blockquote>\n\"The conclusion to be drawn is that the parliament intended that in the field of exclusion, entry and expulsion of aliens the Act should operate to the exclusion of any executive power derived otherwise than from powers conferred by the parliament.

Black agreed with Judge North's original conclusion that the rescuees were on the facts detained, and as such, he agreed with North's orders to release the rescuees.\n\n==Consequences==\nOn 26 September 2001, the [[Parliament of Australia]] passed the ''Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Act 2001'',<ref name=\"bpa\">{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|bpaepa2001512|Border Protection (Validation and Enforcement Powers) Act 2001}}.</ref> a [[ex post facto law|retrospective law]] which gave statutory authorisation to the actions of the Government in detaining the asylum seekers on the ''Tampa''.

The Victorian Council for Civil Liberties (now Liberty Victoria), and solicitor Eric Vadarlis, were seeking a [[writ]] of [[habeas corpus]] (an order for the asylum seekers to be released). The case is significant because it is one of the few cases to consider the nature and scope of the [[prerogative power]] of the [[Executive (government)|executive branch of Government]] in Australia.\n\n==Background to the case==\n\n===Executive power===\n\nOne of the key issues in the case, both at trial and on appeal, was the nature of the executive power of government. There are several sources of executive power, but the source in consideration in this case was the prerogative power of government.\n\nThe concept of prerogative power, often referred to in the [[United Kingdom]] as the [[Royal Prerogative]], consists of various powers belonging exclusively to [[the Crown]], such as the power to make [[treaty|treaties]] or the power to [[declaration of war|declare war]]. The Royal Prerogative was generally said to derive from the [[common law]]. The prerogative powers are not unlimited, and they can be superseded by [[statute]], or lost over time through disuse.<ref name=\"B&W\">{{Cite book|author=[[Tony Blackshield|Blackshield, Tony]] & [[George Williams (lawyer)|Williams, George]] | year=2006 | title=Australian Constitutional Law and Theory | edition=Fourth | publisher=The Federation Press | location=Sydney | isbn = 1-86287-586-3}}</ref> A statute can completely replace a prerogative power (extinguish it), or it can merely define how decisions should be made, and what factors to consider, when exercising a power.\n\nIn Australia, it is generally accepted that the prerogative power is included in [[Section 61 of the Constitution of Australia|section 61]] of the [[Constitution of Australia]],<ref name=\"B&W\" /> the section which vests the executive power of Australia in the Crown and the [[Governor-General of Australia]] as the Crown's representative. By [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]], the executive functions of government in Australia are carried out from day to day by the [[Government of Australia]].\n\n===The Tampa affair===\n{{Main|Tampa affair}}\n\nOn 26 August 2001, the [[MV Tampa|MV ''Tampa'']] rescued 433 people, asylum seekers bound for Australia, and of mainly [[Afghanistan|Afghani]] background, from their wooden fishing boat. The boat was sinking in [[international waters]] about 140 kilometres north of [[Christmas Island]] (an [[states and territories of Australia|Australian territory]]). Initially the Captain sought to take the rescuees to Indonesia, but they objected, with some threatening to commit suicide if they were not taken to Australia. Some of the people required medical attention, and the ''Tampa'' then proceeded to the nearest port, at Christmas Island. The ''Tampa'' stopped at the boundary of Australia's [[territorial sea]] (twelve [[nautical mile]]s offshore) to request permission to enter Australian waters and unload the asylum seekers, but permission was refused.\n\nOn 29 August, the ''Tampa'' declared a state of emergency and entered Australian waters. About four nautical miles offshore, the ship was stopped and boarded by forty-five [[Special Air Service (Australia)|SAS]] troops, who took control of the ship and anchored it.\n\nThis action prompted the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties (VCCL) to take action. Along with Victorian solicitor Eric Vadarlis, they initiated proceedings in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] for a writ of habeas corpus, against the [[Government of Australia]] and three Ministers, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, [[Philip Ruddock]], the [[Attorney-General of Australia]], [[Daryl Williams (politician)|Daryl Williams]], and the Minister for Defence, [[Peter Reith]]. During the proceedings, [[Amnesty International]] and the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] intervened in the case, generally supporting VCCL and Vadarlis.\n\nThe various Government parties were represented by a team of lawyers including the [[Solicitor-General of Australia]], [[David Bennett (barrister)|David Bennett]] AO [[Queen's Counsel|QC]]. VCCL and Vadarlis were represented by a number of [[barrister]]s well known for their public involvement in refugee law and [[pro bono]] work for refugees, including [[Julian Burnside]] QC.\n\n===Initial proceedings===\nThe applications were made in [[Melbourne]] on 31 August, at 5.00 p.m. Melbourne time, and the court was convened by 5.40 p.m., with Judge [[Anthony North|North]] presiding. Both VCCL and Vadarlis argued that the court should immediately make an order preventing the Government from removing the ''Tampa'' from Australian waters. North thought there was a strong basis for making such an order, but decided that he would make a final decision the next morning. Nevertheless, North warned that the asylum seekers should not be moved off the ''Tampa'' in the meantime, and this had the effect of a temporary [[injunction]].\n\nThe court reconvened on the morning of 1 September, but while proceedings were underway, [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] announced the [[Pacific Solution]], under which the asylum seekers on the ''Tampa'' would be transferred to [[Nauru]] and [[New Zealand]]. As such, the Government asked that the case should be concluded that day, so that the Solution could be implemented. North decided that the trial should start the following day, on 2 September.\n\n===Trial===\nOver the night of 1 September, VCCL, Vadarlis and the Government agreed upon a statement of facts for the case, so that the proceedings could run faster. Approximately 100 people were involved on the Government side alone in working on the statement and preparing documents for the next morning's hearing. The trial started later in the morning, and the court started hearing evidence, but later that day it was announced that under the Pacific Solution, the Government planned to transfer the asylum seekers to [[HMAS Manoora (L 52)|HMAS ''Manoora'']] in order to carry them to [[Port Moresby]] for transfer to Nauru and New Zealand.\n\nThe issue of the injunction (which prevented the removal of the ''Tampa'' or the people on it) was still outstanding, and an agreement could not be reached. North sent the parties to [[mediation]], and that evening an agreement was reached, which allowed the Government to transfer the asylum seekers to the ''Manoora''.\n\nVCCL and Vadarlis made two main arguments. Firstly, they argued that the provisions of the ''[[Migration Act 1958]]'' (which regulates immigration) applied to the asylum seekers, and the normal procedures for dealing with other non-citizens should be applied. The ''Migration Act'' did empower the Government to detain all non-citizens, under the system of [[mandatory detention in Australia|mandatory detention]], but it also gave non-citizens certain rights, such as the right to seek [[Right of asylum|asylum]] and to apply for protection [[Visa (document)|visa]]s. As such, they argued that the asylum seekers should be taken to the mainland and be allowed to apply for visas. Alternatively, they argued that if the ''Migration Act'' did not apply to the situation of these asylum seekers, then they were being detained unlawfully, and that no-one in Australia, regardless of their citizenship status, could be detained unlawfully or arbitrarily, and so they should be released.\n\nOn the other hand, the Government argued that the non-citizens (whom they described as \"unlawful non-citizens\") were not being detained at all, and contended that they were free to go anywhere they pleased, with the exception of Australia. They also argued that even if the non-citizens were being detained, then despite there being no [[statute|statutory]] authority for their detention, the Government had a [[prerogative power]] to expel non-citizens from Australian waters.\n\n===Judgment at trial===\nJustice North delivered his decision on 11 September 2001.\n\nNorth decided that the asylum seekers (which he referred to as \"rescuees\") were in fact being detained by the Government. He found that the Government did indeed intend to control the rescuees, by directing the ''Tampa'' where it could go, by closing the port at Christmas Island, and by making decisions about what would happen to them without consulting them. North added that \"the presence of 45 SAS troops, armed and in combat fatigues, is likely to have led the rescuees to the conclusion that they were bound to do as they were told.\"<ref name=\"north\">{{Cite AustLII|FCA|1297|2001|litigants=Victorian Council for Civil Liberties Inc v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs |date=18 September 2001 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nNorth then considered whether there was a prerogative power which could be exercised to detain the asylum seekers. He found that it was unlikely that such a power existed at all, and even if it once did, then it had been replaced by the statutory scheme in the ''Migration Act'', which now identified and regulated all the powers of the [[executive (government)|executive government]] to deal with non-citizens. North relied on a number of authorities, including a 1906 case of the [[High Court of Australia]], in which Justice [[Edmund Barton|Barton]] found that \"the question to-day is one of statutory authority.\"<ref name=\"robtelmes\">{{Cite AustLII|HCA|58|1906|litigants=[[Robtelmes v Brenan]] |date=2 October 1906 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/58.pdf (1906) 4 CLR 395]}}.</ref>\n\nUltimately, North granted a writ of habeas corpus, which he preferred to describe more simply as \"an order for release.\"<ref name=\"north\" /> He found that the Government had no statutory authority to detain the asylum seekers, and since there was no prerogative power to detain them, they were being held unlawfully and had to be released.\n\nNorth rejected a number of other arguments based on particular provisions of the ''Migration Act'' on the basis that VCCL and Vadarlis did not have [[standing (law)|standing]] to make those arguments.\n\n==Arguments==\nThe Government quickly appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, and on 12 September an application was granted to fast-track the proceedings. The arguments were heard on 13 September.\n\nThe Government argued that Judge North had erred in his judgment on a number of matters. They argued that North had made incorrect findings of fact, and that in truth:\n\n* the rescuees were not being detained by the SAS troops,\n* in reality it was the captain of the ''Tampa'', [[Arne Rinnan]], who was detaining the rescuees,\n* the circumstances of the rescuees were self-inflicted, and\n* the rescuees were not detained because they had the option of going to Nauru or New Zealand under the Pacific Solution.\n\nThey also argued that North erred in finding that the Government did not have a [[prerogative power]] to prevent the rescuees from entering Australia, and the complementary power to detain the rescuees for the purposes of expelling them from Australia. This was the principal issue in the appeal.\n\nThe VCCL and Vadarlis again argued that if there was such a prerogative power, it had been completely replaced by the statutory scheme in the ''[[Migration Act 1958]]''. They argued that the Act \"covered the field\", that is, it was so comprehensive that it demonstrated an intention to completely displace any other executive powers in the subject area (the concept of \"covering the field\" usually refers to the way that federal laws can displace state laws if they show an intention to be the only law with respect to the subject matter, see [[section 109 of the Australian Constitution]]).\n\nJudge [[Robert French|French]] summarised the key issues in the appeal as being:\n<blockquote>\n\n# \"Whether the executive power of the Commonwealth authorised and supported the expulsion of the rescuees and their detention for that purpose.\n# \"If there was no such executive power, whether the rescuees were subject to a restraint attributable to the Commonwealth and amenable to habeas corpus.\"<ref name=\"french\">{{Cite AustLII|FCA|1329|2001|litigants=Ruddock v Vadarlis |pinpoint=per French J starting paragraph 127}}.</ref>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n==Judgment==\nThe Full Court handed down its decision on 18 September. Justice [[Robert French|French]] delivered the majority opinion, with Justice [[Bryan Beaumont|Beaumont]] agreeing with him. Chief Justice [[Michael Black (judge)|Black]] dissented.\n\n===The majority===\nJustice French found that there is indeed a prerogative power to prevent the entry of non-citizens into Australia, and as a corollary, the power to do various things that are necessary to prevent such an entry.

This is in contradistinction to the crowded atmosphere of the more popular [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]] and the cosmopolitan bustle of nearby [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]]. Assisting South Bethany's reputation as a \"quiet\" place is the presence of [[Delaware Seashore State Park]] \u2013 a six-mile-long [[barrier island]] providing a substantial buffer from Dewey Beach's noise \u2013 to the north of Bethany Beach, as well as that of a large unincorporated area of private condominiums and multimillion-dollar beach homes between the park and Bethany Beach.

While it dragged on, [[William Penn]] granted the [[Delaware Colony]] its own legislature in 1701, establishing it as a separate colony. The dispute over the boundaries of the three colonies was not resolved until 1759, when the parties to the dispute agreed that the area where South Bethany now lies was part of Delaware.\n\nOutside of ''Penn vs. Baltimore'', recorded European interest in the land that was to become South Bethany dates to at least 1687, when an [[English people|Englishman]], Matthew Scarborough, had much of the area of what are now Bethany Beach and South Bethany surveyed, the 500 acres (202 hectares) surveyed in the northern part of the area becoming known as \"Scarborough's Adventure,\" while a 500-acre (202-hectare) parcel to its south became known as \"Middlesex.\" He \"took up\" \u2013 i.e., took possession of \u2013 the two parcels of land in 1688, and they were renamed \"North Petherton\" and \"South Petherton.\" The part of the area that would become South Bethany was included in a 430-acre (174-hectare) portion of South Petherton at the head of [[Little Assawoman Bay]] about two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) south of what is now Bethany Beach granted to Scarborough under a Maryland [[land patent]] in 1695.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\nEnglish settlers established farms in parts of what is now South Bethany. In 1741, Englishman William Evans was granted a land patent under a survey that combined North and South Petherton into a single parcel of land.<ref name=\"Walter13\"/>\n\nIn 1926, George McClellan of [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], bought four adjoining tracts of land in what is now South Bethany covering a combined 140 acres (56.7 hectares). McLellan conveyed the land to the Delaware Shore Land Corporation.<ref name=\"Walter13\"/>\n\n===Founding of South Bethany===\n\nIn 1952, the first span of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] opened, greatly improving access to the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] from [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland, and [[Washington, D.C.]], and spurring a great deal of growth and new investment in the Bethany Beach area. That year, Richard Hall and Elizabeth \"Iggie\" Hall purchased about 130 acres (52.6 hectares) of marsh land and old farm land from the Delaware Shore Land Corporation. Doing business as the South Bethany Corporation, the Halls sold 50-by-100-foot (15.2-by-30.5-meter) lots to people wishing to build vacation houses on the Delaware coast and named the new community \"South Bethany\" in order to exploit the popularity among vacationers of Bethany Beach, just to the north. The Halls conceived of South Bethany as strictly residential, with no businesses of any kind within its boundaries. For the next 10 years, the South Bethany Corporation  worked to drain and raise marshland to allow additional buildable lots and dug five miles (8&nbsp;km) of [[canal]]s in the community to ensure that people who purchased a lot in South Bethany would have either direct access to the beach along the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 where the community provided no [[lifeguard]] service, its only safety measure being a [[torpedo]]-style [[Personal flotation device|life preserver]] hanging from a post on the beach \u2013 or would reside along a canal offering access to inland bays and rivers by boat. By 1959, when a lot cost $1,050 and required a $200 down payment, they had sold 500 lots in South Bethany.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"We Present To You...South Bethany,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 3.</ref><ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, pp. 13, 16, 18, 21.</ref>\n\nAccess to the community was via [[Delaware Route 14]], known as Coastal Highway, a paved two-lane road with no [[Shoulder (road)|shoulders]]. As the community grew, Route 14 became inadequate for the automobile traffic South Bethany generated, and in 1958 Route 14 was expanded into a four-lane divided highway; it was redesignated as a portion of [[Delaware Route 1]] in the 1970s.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 24.</ref> At the time, the [[Delaware Army National Guard]] would drive its tracked [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|self-propelled anti-aircraft guns]] from its barracks north of Bethany Beach down Coastal Highway through Bethany Beach and South Bethany to its training grounds just south of South Bethany, where it would engage in [[antiaircraft]] training, firing at [[target drone]]s flying over the Atlantic.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015; pp. 25-26.</ref>\n\n===Incorporation and expansion===\n====1960s through 1990s====\nAlthough Iggie Hall of the South Bethany Corporation tried to have South Bethany [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a town even in its early years in order to improve services in the community, she had no success. Meanwhile, a group of South Bethany residents formed the South Bethany Association to address community services and needs.<ref name=\"Walter34\">Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 22.</ref>\n\nA destructive [[nor'easter]] known as the [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962]] struck the area from March 6 to 8, 1962. Delaware's Atlantic coast experienced severe damage from very high tides and waves more than 40 feet (12 meters) high breaking on its beaches. In South Bethany, the storm destroyed 37 oceanfront homes.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015; p. 29.</ref> The 1962 storm gave a new impetus to incorporation, because as an unincorporated community South Bethany could not receive federal funding to recover from the disaster. The [[Delaware General Assembly]] rebuffed the initial efforts to incorporate the community after the storm, claiming that its tiny year-round population disqualified it from incorporation.<ref name=\"Walter34\"/> The assembly eventually did pass an incorporation bill, which the [[governor of Delaware]], [[Charles L. Terry, Jr.]], signed in December 1965.<ref name=\"townhistory\"/> In the first public referendum in South Bethany on incorporation, held in June 1966, voters decisively rejected it.<ref name=\"Walter34\"/><ref name=\"townhistory\"/> But in 1969 another referendum on the matter won, and on June 18, 1969, Governor [[Russell W. Peterson]] signed a bill providing for incorporation of the community as the Town of South Bethany.<ref name=\"townhistory\"/> Elections for town offices soon took place, and James \"Jim\" Cleveland was elected as the town's first mayor.<ref name=\"townhistory\"/> At the time, South Bethany had 240 houses and 496 property owners, although its year-round population consisted of just 15 families.<ref name=\"Walter34\"/>\n\nPlans for a beach and tennis community, [[Sea Colony]], centered on nine high-rise condominiums situated on a private beach between South Bethany and Bethany Beach, began in 1969; these buildings, the area's first and only high-rises, opened in the early 1970s. The 1,200-[[townhome]] Sea Colony West low-rise beach and [[tennis]] resort development later was added just inland.<ref name=\"Meehan, p. 93, 155\">{{cite book|title=Bethany Beach Memoirs: A Long Look Back|year=1998|publisher=Harold E.

The annexation of York Beach brought York Beach Mall \u2013 opened in 1959 and expanded in 1965 \u2013 into South Bethany, giving the town its first and only commercial area.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015; pp. 21-22.</ref> In the same year, South Bethany began installing a central [[sewer system]],<ref name=\"Walter34\"/> and Sussex County prohibited construction in the town within 1,000 feet (305 meters) of the ocean in the hope of restoring the main [[dune]].<ref name=\"townhistory\"/>\n\nIn 1977, South Bethany's sewer system was completed, and the community installed its first two traffic signals, located on Coastal Highway at the north and south ends of the town.<ref name=\"townhistory\"/> Also in that year, South Bethany received a federal grant to construct its first town hall, located on land Iggie Hall had donated for that purpose;<ref name=\"townhistory\"/> the town hall opened in 1978.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 34.</ref> In January 1981, the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] lifted Sussex County's ban on construction on the dune, and development of the beach area resumed.<ref name=\"townhistory\"/>\n\nIn August 1983, property owners formed the South Bethany Property Owners Association,<ref name=\"townhistory\"/> and that year the town annexed the neighboring Sand Piper Pines community.

2000, South Bethany's Community Enhancement Committee launched the town's Adopt-A-Canal/Road-End Program, in which community volunteers renovate and maintain the landscaping at the ends of canals and roads in South Bethany; by October 2015, volunteers had adopted 32 of the town's 48 canal ends and road ends.<ref>Counts, Maria, \"A Community Growing For the Better,\" ''The Story of South Bethany,

While it dragged on, [[William Penn]] granted the [[Delaware Colony]] its own legislature in 1701, establishing it as a separate colony. The dispute over the boundaries of the three colonies was not resolved until 1759, when the parties to the dispute agreed that the area where South Bethany now lies was part of Delaware.\n\nOutside of ''Penn vs. Baltimore'', recorded European interest in the land that was to become South Bethany dates to at least 1687, when an [[English people|Englishman]], Matthew Scarborough, had much of the area of what are now Bethany Beach and South Bethany surveyed, the 500 acres (202 hectares) surveyed in the northern part of the area becoming known as \"Scarborough's Adventure,\" while a 500-acre (202-hectare) parcel to its south became known as \"Middlesex.\" He \"took up\" \u2013 i.e., took possession of \u2013 the two parcels of land in 1688, and they were renamed \"North Petherton\" and \"South Petherton.\" The part of the area that would become South Bethany was included in a 430-acre (174-hectare) portion of South Petherton at the head of [[Little Assawoman Bay]] about two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) south of what is now Bethany Beach granted to Scarborough under a Maryland [[land patent]] in 1695.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\nEnglish settlers established farms in parts of what is now South Bethany. In 1741, Englishman William Evans was granted a land patent under a survey that combined North and South Petherton into a single parcel of land.<ref name=\"Walter13\"/>\n\nIn 1926, George McClellan of [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], bought four adjoining tracts of land in what is now South Bethany covering a combined 140 acres (56.7 hectares). McLellan conveyed the land to the Delaware Shore Land Corporation.<ref name=\"Walter13\"/>\n\n===Founding of South Bethany===\n\nIn 1952, the first span of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] opened, greatly improving access to the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] from [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], Maryland, and [[Washington, D.C.]], and spurring a great deal of growth and new investment in the Bethany Beach area. That year, Richard Hall and Elizabeth \"Iggie\" Hall purchased about 130 acres (52.6 hectares) of marsh land and old farm land from the Delaware Shore Land Corporation. Doing business as the South Bethany Corporation, the Halls sold 50-by-100-foot (15.2-by-30.5-meter) lots to people wishing to build vacation houses on the Delaware coast and named the new community \"South Bethany\" in order to exploit the popularity among vacationers of Bethany Beach, just to the north. The Halls conceived of South Bethany as strictly residential, with no businesses of any kind within its boundaries. For the next 10 years, the South Bethany Corporation  worked to drain and raise marshland to allow additional buildable lots and dug five miles (8&nbsp;km) of [[canal]]s in the community to ensure that people who purchased a lot in South Bethany would have either direct access to the beach along the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 where the community provided no [[lifeguard]] service, its only safety measure being a [[torpedo]]-style [[Personal flotation device|life preserver]] hanging from a post on the beach \u2013 or would reside along a canal offering access to inland bays and rivers by boat. By 1959, when a lot cost $1,050 and required a $200 down payment, they had sold 500 lots in South Bethany.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"We Present To You...South Bethany,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 3.</ref><ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, pp. 13, 16, 18, 21.</ref>\n\nAccess to the community was via [[Delaware Route 14]], known as Coastal Highway, a paved two-lane road with no [[Shoulder (road)|shoulders]]. As the community grew, Route 14 became inadequate for the automobile traffic South Bethany generated, and in 1958 Route 14 was expanded into a four-lane divided highway; it was redesignated as a portion of [[Delaware Route 1]] in the 1970s.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015, p. 24.</ref> At the time, the [[Delaware Army National Guard]] would drive its tracked [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|self-propelled anti-aircraft guns]] from its barracks north of Bethany Beach down Coastal Highway through Bethany Beach and South Bethany to its training grounds just south of South Bethany, where it would engage in [[antiaircraft]] training, firing at [[target drone]]s flying over the Atlantic.<ref>Walter, Laura, \"Past,\" ''The Story of South Bethany, Delaware'', Ocean View, Delaware: Coastal Point LLC, 2015; pp. 25-26.</ref>\n\n===Incorporation and expansion===\n====1960s through 1990s====\nAlthough Iggie Hall of the South Bethany Corporation tried to have South Bethany [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a town even in its early years in order to improve services in the community, she had no success.

Three decades later Foxe made a [[dedication]] to Hawarden in one of his books, thanking Hawarden for enabling his education. At Brasenose College, Foxe shared rooms with [[Alexander Nowell]], afterwards [[dean (religion)|dean]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]].</ref> In 1535 Foxe was admitted to [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]], where he may either have been improving his Latin or acting as a junior instructor. He became a probationer fellow in July 1538 and a full [[fellow]] the following July.\n\nFoxe took his bachelor's degree on 17 July 1537, his master's degree in July 1543, and was [[lecturer]] in [[logic]] in 1539\u20131540.<ref>Foxe wrote several Latin plays on biblical subjects, of which the best, ''De Christo triumphante'' or ''Christus triumphans'', an allegorical verse drama on the history of the church, was printed in London in 1551 and by [[Johannes Oporinus|Oporinus]] in Basel in March 1556. It was performed at Cambridge and probably Oxford in the 1560s. The play was translated into French in 1562 and English in 1579. The latter translation was produced by [[Richard Day (printer)|Richard Day]], son of the printer, [[John Day (printer)|John Day]] or Daye, who published Foxe's [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|''Actes and Monuments'']]. Foxe's earliest extant literary creation is ''Titus et Gesippus'' (written in 1544), a Latin comedy based on [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]].</ref> A series of letters in Foxe's handwriting dated to 1544\u201345, shows Foxe to be \"a man of friendly disposition and warm sympathies, deeply religious, an ardent student, zealous in making acquaintance with scholars.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 18.</ref> By the time he was twenty-five, he had read the Latin and Greek fathers, the [[schoolmen]], the [[canon law]], and had \"acquired no mean skill in the Hebrew language.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Resignation from Oxford==\nFoxe resigned from his college in 1545 after becoming a Protestant and thereby subscribing to beliefs condemned by the [[Church of England]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>Foxe may have refused to attend mass.

Foxe says these masters persecuted other fellows, including [[Thomas Cooper (bishop)|Thomas Cooper]], later Bishop of Lincoln and Winchester under Elizabeth, and [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]], a lifelong friend and associate of Foxe, who also left the college at that time. Foxe's letter is printed in Pratt's edition (vol. i. Appendix, pp. 58\u201361); see also J. F. Mozley, ''John Foxe and His Book'' (New York: Macmillan Company, 1940).</ref> Foxe's change of religious opinion may have temporarily broken his relationship with his stepfather and even have put his life in danger. Foxe personally witnessed the burning of William Cowbridge in September 1538.<ref>Mozley, p. 21.</ref>\n\nAfter being forced to abandon what might have been a promising academic career, Foxe experienced a period of dire need. [[Hugh Latimer]] invited Foxe to live with him, but Foxe eventually became a tutor in the household of [[Thomas Lucy]] of [[Charlecote]], near [[Stratford-on-Avon]]. Before leaving the Lucys, Foxe married Agnes Randall on 3 February 1547.<ref name=\"Marriage\">Thomas S. Freeman, \"Foxe, John,\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004). The reasons for Foxe's departure from the Lucys are unknown.

In the middle of or at the end of 1547, Foxe moved to London and probably lived in [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]]. There he completed three translations of Protestant sermons published by the \"stout Protestant\" Hugh Singleton.<ref>One sermon was by [[Martin Luther]] ESTC 16983 and another by [[Urbannus Regius]]: ''An Instruction of the Christian Faith'' (ESTC 120847).</ref> During this period Foxe also found a patron in [[Mary Fitzroy]], Duchess of Richmond, who hired him as tutor to the orphan children of her brother, [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], a Catholic who had been executed for treason in January 1547.<ref>Surrey's father, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].</ref> (The children were [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas]], who would become the fourth duke of Norfolk and a valuable friend of Foxe; [[Jane Neville|Jane]], later Countess of Westmorland; [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry]], later [[earl of Northampton]]; and their cousin [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles]], who would later command the English fleet against the [[Spanish Armada]].) Foxe lived in the Duchess's London household at Mountjoy House and later at [[Reigate Castle]], and her patronage \"facilitated Foxe's entry into the ranks of England's Protestant elite.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> During his stay at Reigate, Foxe helped suppress a cult that had arisen around the shrine of the Virgin Mary at Ouldsworth, which had been credited with miraculous healing powers.<ref>[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/freemanessay.html Freeman, brief on-line biography of Foxe.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013934/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/freemanessay.html |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nFoxe was ordained deacon by [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]] on 24 June 1550. His circle of friends, associates, and supporters came to include [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]], [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]], [[John Rogers (c.1500\u20131555)|John Rogers]], [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], and most importantly [[John Bale]], who was to become a close friend and \"certainly encouraged, very probably guided, Foxe in the composition of his first [[martyrology]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> From 1548 to 1551, Foxe brought out one tract opposing the death penalty for adultery and another supporting ecclesiastical excommunication of those who he thought \"veiled ambition under the cloak of Protestantism.\" He also worked unsuccessfully to prevent two burnings for religion that occurred during the reign of Edward VI.<ref>Mozley, pp. 31\u201336.</ref>\n\n==Marian exile==\nOn the accession of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in July 1553, Foxe lost his tutorship when the children's grandfather, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]] was released from prison. Foxe walked warily as befitted one who had published Protestant books in his own name. As the political climate worsened, Foxe believed himself personally threatened by Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]]. Just ahead of officers sent to arrest him, he sailed with his pregnant wife from [[Ipswich]] to [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]].<ref>Mozley, p. 41.</ref> He then travelled to [[Antwerp]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Strasbourg]], which he reached by July 1554. In Strasbourg, Foxe published a Latin history of the Christian persecutions, the draft of which he had brought from England and \"which became the first shadowy draught of his ''Acts and Monuments''.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 42. He had assistance from two clerics of widely differing opinions \u2013 from [[Edmund Grindal]], who was later, as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to maintain his [[Puritan]] convictions in opposition to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], and from [[John Aylmer (English bishop)|John Aylmer]], afterwards one of the most bitter opponents of the [[Puritan]] party. Bale too is also thought to have been a critical assistant in the production of this book, which dealt chiefly with figures deemed precursors to the Protestant Reformation: [[John Wycliffe]], [[John Huss|Jan Hus]], [[Savonarola]] and [[Reginald Pecock]]. It was printed in Strasbourg by [[Wendelin Richelius]] with the title of ''Commentarii rerum in ecclesia gestarum''.</ref>\n\nIn the autumn of 1554, Foxe moved to Frankfurt, where he served as a preacher for the English church ministering to refugees in the city. There he was unwillingly drawn into a [[Troubles at Frankfurt|bitter theological controversy]]. One faction favoured the church polity and liturgy of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], while the other advocated the [[Reformed]] models promoted by [[John Calvin]]'s Genevan church. The latter group, led by [[John Knox]], was supported by Foxe; the former was led by [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]]. Eventually Knox, who seems to have acted with more magnanimity, was expelled, and in the autumn of 1555, Foxe and about twenty others also left Frankfurt.<ref>Mozley, pp. 44\u201346. The prayer book faction reported Knox as having written treason against the Emperor, and they also persuaded the city magistrates to enforce the Prayer Book service on the English church.</ref> Although Foxe clearly favoured Knox, he was [[irenic]] by temperament and expressed his disgust at \"the violence of the warring factions\".<ref>Mozley, 46.</ref>\n\nMoving to [[Basel]], Foxe worked with his fellow countrymen [[John Bale]] and [[Lawrence Humphrey]] at the drudgery of proofreading. (Educated Englishmen were noted for their learning, industry and honesty and \"would also be the last persons to quarrel with their bread and butter.\" No knowledge of German or French was required because the English tended to socialise with one another and could communicate with scholars in Latin.)<ref>Mozley, pp. 50\u201351 and 57. Foxe laboured over the proofreading of [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s second book on the [[Eucharist]] in the printing house of [[Johann Herbst]] (or [[Oporinus]]), a book he thought \"crabbed and obscure\" (Mozley, p. 46) and which proved too controversial to be printed. (Mozley, p. 56) Foxe also served as an assistant to [[Hieronymus Froben]] in the production of a Latin edition of [[St. John Chrysostom]]'s works.</ref> Foxe also completed and had printed a religious drama, ''Christus Triumphans'' (1556), in Latin verse. Yet despite receiving occasional financial contributions from English merchants on the continent, Foxe seems to have lived very close to the margin and been \"wretchedly poor.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 51.</ref>\n\nWhen Foxe received reports from England about the ongoing religious persecution there, he wrote a pamphlet urging the English nobility to use their influence with the queen to halt it. Foxe feared that the appeal would be useless, and his fears proved correct.<ref>The pamphlet, ''Ad inclytos ad praepotentes Angliae proceres... supplicatio'' (1557) was issued from the press of Oporinus.</ref> When Knox attacked [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] in his now famous ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]'', Foxe apparently criticized Knox's \"rude vehemency\" although their friendship seems to have remained unimpaired.<ref>Mozley, p. 58.</ref>\n\n==Return to England==\n[[File:Actes and Monuments.jpg|thumb|A page from the first edition of ''Actes and Monuments'', also known as ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs'', published in 1563.]]\nAfter the death of Mary I in 1558, Foxe was in no hurry to return home, and he waited to see if religious changes instituted by her successor, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], would take root. Foxe was also so poor that he was unable to travel with his family until money was sent to him.<ref>Mozley, p. 61.</ref> Back in England, he seems to have lived for ten years at [[Aldgate]], London, in the house of his former pupil, [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]], now Fourth [[Duke of Norfolk]].<ref>Mozley, p. 62. Howard retained sincere affection for his tutor and left him a small pension in his will years later when Norfolk was executed for treason.</ref> Foxe quickly became associated with [[John Day (printer)|John Day]] the printer and published works of religious controversy while working on a new martyrology that would eventually become the ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Actes and Monuments]]''.\n\nFoxe was ordained a priest by his friend [[Edmund Grindal]], now [[Bishop of London]], but he \"was something of a puritan, and like many of the exiles, had scruples about wearing the clerical vestments laid down in the queen's injunctions of 1559.\" Many of his friends eventually conformed, but Foxe was \"more stubborn or single-minded.\"  Some tried to find him preferments in the new regime, but it \"was not easy to help a man of so singularly unworldly a nature, who scorned to use his powerful friendships to advance himself.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 63.</ref>\n\n==''Actes and Monuments''==\n===Latin editions===\nFoxe began his Book of Martyrs in 1552, during the reign of Edward VI, with the [[Marian Persecutions]] still in the future. In 1554, while still in exile, Foxe published in Latin at Strasbourg the first shadow of his great book, emphasising the persecution of the English [[Lollards]] during the 15th century.\n\nAs word of the contemporary English persecution made its way to the continent, Foxe began to collect materials to continue his story to the present. He published the first true Latin edition of his famous book at Basel in August 1559.<ref>Mozley, 118\u2013123.</ref><ref>Fox J (1559) ''Rerum in ecclesia gestarum... pars prima, in qua primum de rebus per Angliam et Scotiam gestis atque in primis de horrenda sub Maria nuper regina persecutione narratio continetur'', at [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=peRDAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Foxe+rerum+1559&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjB4t_9r97cAhVMaVAKHZHxAEYQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&q=Foxe%20rerum%201559&f=false google books at 08 August 2018]. Or for free download from the Bavarian State Library.</ref> Of course, it was difficult to write contemporary English history while living (as he later said) \"in the far parts of Germany, where few friends, no conference, [and] small information could be had.\"<ref>Mozley, 124.</ref> But Foxe who had left England poor and unknown, returned only poor. He had gained \"a substantial reputation\" through his Latin work.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===First edition===\nOn 20 March 1563, Foxe published the first English edition of the ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Actes and Monuments]]'' from the press of [[John Day (printer)|John Day]].<ref>Day's epitaph reads: \"He set a Foxe to write how martyrs run/By death to life. Foxe ventured pains and health/To give them light: Daye spent in print his wealth,/And God with gain restored his wealth again,/ And gave to him as he gave to the poor.\" (Mozley, p. 138)</ref> It was a \"gigantic [[:wiktionary:folio|folio]] volume\" of about 1800 pages, about three times the length of the 1559 Latin book.<ref>Mozley, p. 129.</ref> As is typical for the period, the full title was a paragraph long and is abbreviated by scholars as ''Acts and Monuments'',<ref>The full title is \"Actes and Monuments of these latter and perilous days, touching matters of the Church, wherein are comprehended and described the great persecutions and horrible troubles that have been wrought and practised by the Romish prelates, specially in this realm of England and Scotland, from the year of our Lord 1000 unto the time now present; gathered and collected according to the true copies and writings certificatory, as well of the parties themselves that suffered, as also out of the bishops' registers, which were the doers thereof; by John Foxe.\"</ref> although the book was popularly known then, as it is now, as ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]''. Publication of the book made Foxe instantly famous \u2013 \"England's first literary celebrity\" \u2013 although because there were then no royalties, Foxe remained as poor as ever although the book sold for more than ten shillings, three weeks' pay for a skilled craftsman.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Mozley, p. 130; David Loades, [http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/loadesearlyreceptionessay.html \"The Early Reception\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517030350/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/loadesearlyreceptionessay.html |date=17 May 2011 }}.</ref>\n\n===Second edition===\n''Actes and Monuments'' was immediately attacked by Catholics such as [[Thomas Harding (1516\u20131572)|Thomas Harding]], [[Thomas Stapleton (theologian)|Thomas Stapleton]], and [[Nicholas Harpsfield]].<ref>Harpsfield, a former archdeacon of Canterbury under Mary I, wrote under the name of Alan Cope, ''Dialogi sex, contra summi pontificatus, monasticae vitae, sanctorum, sacrarum imaginum oppugnatores, et pseudomartyres'' (1566), a thousand-page book, with the sixth dialogue aimed at Foxe. Mozley, p. 139.</ref> In the next generation, [[Robert Parsons (priest)|Robert Parsons]], an English Jesuit, also struck at Foxe in ''A Treatise of Three Conversions of England'' (1603\u201304). Harding, in the spirit of the age, called ''Actes and Monuments'' ' \"that huge dunghill of your stinking martyrs,\" full of a thousand lies'.<ref>Mozley, p. 138.</ref>\n\nIntending to strengthen his book against his critics, and being flooded by new material brought to light by the publication of the first edition,<ref>\"[P]ersonal testimonies poured in on Foxe without solicitation as people sought to exonerate themselves and accuse or eulogize others.\" Freeman, ''ODNB''.</ref> Foxe put together a second edition in 1570 and where the charges of his critics had been reasonably accurate, Foxe removed the offending passages. Where he could rebut the charges, \"he mounted a vigorous counter-attack, seeking to crush his opponent under piles of documents.\"<ref>Freeman, ODNB: \"In short, Foxe reacted to Harpsfield's challenge like the commander of a besieged city, abandoning what could not be defended and fortifying what could. Harpsfield drove Foxe to more intensive and extensive research and made his martyrology a more impressive, although not necessarily more accurate, work of scholarship.\"</ref> Even though he deleted material that had been included in the first edition, the second edition was nearly double the size of the first, \"two gigantic folio volumes, with 2300 very large pages\" of double-columned text.<ref>Mozley, p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe edition was well received by the English church, and the upper house of the convocation of Canterbury meeting in 1571, ordered that a copy of the [[Bishop's Bible]] and \"that full history entitled Monuments of Martyrs\" be installed in every cathedral church and that church officials place copies in their houses for the use of servants and visitors. The decision was of certain benefit to Foxe's printer [[John Day (printer)|Day]] because he had taken great financial risks printing such a mammoth work.<ref>Mozley, p. 147.</ref>\n\n===Third and fourth editions===\n[[Image:FoxeMartyrsIllustration.JPG|thumb|right| Dual martyrdom by burning, 1558; from a 1641 edition of Foxe.]]\nFoxe published a third edition in 1576, but it was virtually a reprint of the second, although printed on inferior paper and in smaller type.<ref>Mozley, pp. 148\u201349.</ref> The fourth edition, published in 1583, the last in Foxe's lifetime, had larger type and better paper and consisted of \"two volumes of about two thousand folio pages in double columns.\" Nearly four times the length of the Bible, the fourth edition was \"the most physically imposing, complicated, and technically demanding English book of its era. It seems safe to say that it is the largest and most complicated book to appear during the first two or three centuries of English printing history.\"<ref>John N. King, ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs: Select Narratives'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. xli.</ref> The title page included the poignant request that the author \"desireth thee, good reader, to help him with thy prayer.\"<ref>Mozley, pp. 149\u201350.</ref>\n\n===Accuracy===\nFoxe based his accounts of martyrs before the early modern period on previous writers, including [[Eusebius]], [[Bede]], [[Matthew Paris]], and many others. Foxe's own contribution was his compilation of the English martyrs from the period of the [[Lollards]] through the persecution of Mary I. Here Foxe had primary sources of all kinds to draw on: episcopal registers, reports of trials, and the testimony of eyewitnesses, a remarkable range of sources for English historical writing of the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">.</ref>\n\nFoxe's material is more accurate when he deals with his own period, although it is selectively presented, and the book is not an impartial account. Sometimes Foxe copied documents verbatim; sometimes he adapted them to his own use. Although both he and his contemporary readers were more credulous than most moderns, Foxe presented \"lifelike and vivid pictures of the manners and feelings of the day, full of details that could never have been invented by a forger.\"<ref name=\"Mozley, 168\">Mozley, 168.</ref> Foxe's method of using his sources \"proclaims the honest man, the sincere seeker after truth.\"<ref>Mozley, 168. \"What the intent and custom is of the papists to do, I cannot tell: for mine own I will say, although many other vices I have, yet from this one I have always of nature abhorred, wittingly to deceive any man or child, so near as I could, much less the church of God, whom I with all my heart do reverence, and with fear obey.\" ''A&M'', 3, p. 393.</ref>\n\nFoxe often treated his material casually, and any reader \"must be prepared to meet plenty of small errors and inconsistencies.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 155.</ref> Furthermore, Foxe did not hold to later notions of neutrality or objectivity. He made unambiguous side glosses on his text, such as \"Mark the apish pageants of these popelings\" and \"This answer smelleth of forging and crafty packing\",<ref>Mozley, p. 157.</ref> as Foxe's age was one of strong language as well as of cruel deeds.<ref>Mozley, 158.</ref> The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica went so far as to accuse Foxe of \"wilful falsification of evidence.\"<ref>\"John Foxe\", 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref> Nevertheless, Foxe is \"factually detailed and preserves much firsthand material on the English Reformation unobtainable elsewhere.\"<ref>2009 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref> According to J.F. Mozley, Foxe presented \"lifelike and vivid pictures of the manners and feelings of the day, full of details that could never have been invented by a forger.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 168.</ref>\n\n==Life under Elizabeth I==\n===Salisbury and London===\nFoxe had dedicated ''Acts and Monuments'' to the queen,<ref>In the dedication, Foxe compares his work to [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]' ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', and Elizabeth to Eusebius' patron, the emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. The dedication was dropped after 1563.</ref> and on 22 May 1563, he was appointed [[prebend]] of Shipton in [[Salisbury Cathedral]], in recognition of his championship of the English church.<ref>Mozley, 67.</ref> Foxe never visited the cathedral or performed any duties associated with the position except to appoint a vicar, [[William Masters]], a highly educated fellow Protestant and former Marian exile. Foxe's inaction as a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the cathedral led him to him being declared [[contumacious]], and he was charged with failing to give a [[tithe]] for repairs to the cathedral. Perhaps his poverty made him unwilling to spare the time or money to make visits or contributions. In any case, he retained the position until his death.<ref>Mozley, p. 69.</ref>\n\nBy 1565, Foxe had been caught up in the [[vestments controversy]] led at that time by his associate [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Crowley]]. Foxe's name was on a list of \"godly preachers which have utterly forsaken Antichrist and all his Romish rags\" that was presented to Lord [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] some time between 1561 and 1564.<ref>Magdalene College, Cambridge, Pepys Library, \"Papers of state\", 2.701.</ref>  He was also one of the twenty clergymen who on 20 March 1565 petitioned to be allowed to choose not to wear [[vestments]]; but unlike many of the others, Foxe did not have a London [[benefice]] to lose when [[Archbishop Parker]] enforced conformity. Rather, when Crowley lost his position at [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], Foxe may have preached in his stead.<ref>Mozley, p. 75. Mozley says that the registers show that Foxe was never officially vicar of St. Giles.</ref>\n\nAt some point before 1569, Foxe left [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Norfolk's]] house and moved to his own on [[Grub Street]]. Perhaps his move was motivated by his concerns about Norfolk's exceptionally poor judgment in attempting to marry [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]], which led to his imprisonment in the [[Tower of London|Tower]] in 1569 and his condemnation in 1572 following the [[Ridolfi Plot]]. Although Foxe had written Norfolk \"a remarkably frank letter\" about the injudiciousness of his course, after Norfolk's condemnation, he and [[Alexander Nowell]] ministered to the prisoner until his execution, which Foxe attended, on 2 June 1572.<ref>Mozley, p. 84. Norfolk left Foxe twenty pounds a year.</ref>\n\nIn 1570, at the request of [[Edmund Grindal]], Bishop of London, Foxe preached the [[Good Friday]] sermon at [[Paul's Cross]]. This lofty exposition of the Protestant doctrine of redemption and attack on the doctrinal errors of the Roman Catholic Church was enlarged and published that year as ''A Sermon of Christ Crucified''.<ref>STC 11242.</ref>  Another sermon Foxe preached seven years later at Paul's Cross resulted in his denunciation to the Queen by the French ambassador on grounds that Foxe had advocated the right of the [[Huguenots]] to take arms against their king. Foxe replied that he had been misunderstood: he had argued only that if the French king permitted no foreign power (the Pope) to rule over him, the French Protestants would immediately lay down their arms.<ref>Mozley, 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nIn 1571, Foxe edited an edition of the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] gospels, in parallel with the [[Bishops' Bible]] translation, under the patronage of [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Parker]], who was interested in Anglo-Saxon and whose chaplain, [[John Joscelyn|John Jocelyn]] was an Anglo-Saxon scholar. Foxe's introduction argues that the vernacular scripture was an ancient custom in England.<ref>Mozley, 80\u201381. \"Anglo-Saxon studies were patronized by Archbishop Parker in the hope that they would demonstrate that the Church in England had always been independent of Rome. It was a preoccupation analogous to aspects of French [[Gallicanism]].\" John Burrow, ''A History of Histories''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008, p. 295.</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\nFoxe died on 18 April 1587 and was buried at [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate|St. Giles's, Cripplegate]]. His widow, Agnes, probably died in 1605. Foxe's son, [[Samuel Foxe]] (1560\u20131630) prospered after his father's death and \"accumulated a substantial estate.\" Fortunately for posterity, he also preserved his father's manuscripts, and they are now in the [[British Library]].\n\n==Personality==\nFoxe was so bookish that he ruined his health by his persistent study.<ref>Mozley, pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Yet he had \"a genius for friendship,\" served as a spiritual counselor and was a man of private charity. He even took part in matchmaking.<ref>Mozley, 96, 100\u201301.</ref> Foxe was so well known as a man of prayer that [[Francis Drake]] credited his victory at [[Cadiz]] in part to Foxe's praying.<ref>Mozley, 101\u201302.</ref> Furthermore, Foxe's extreme unworldliness caused others to claim that he had prophetic powers and could heal the sick.<ref>Mozley, pp. 96 and 105\u201307. Foxe had to stop the sick from being carried to him for healing.</ref>\n\nCertainly, Foxe had a hatred of cruelty in advance of his age. When a number of [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[Anabaptists]] were taken by Elizabeth's government in 1572 and sentenced to be burnt, Foxe first wrote letters to the Queen and her council asking for their lives and then wrote to the prisoners themselves (having his Latin draft translated into Flemish) pleading with them to abandon what he considered their theological errors. Foxe even visited the Anabaptists in prison. (The attempted intercession was in vain; two were burnt at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] \"in great horror with roaring and crying.\")<ref>Mozley, pp. 86\u201389.</ref>\n\nJohn Day's son Richard, who knew Foxe well, described him in 1607 as an \"excellent man... exceeding laborious in his pen... his learning inferior to none of his age and time; for his integrity of life a bright light to as many as knew him, beheld him, and lived with him\"\n<ref>Mozley, 240\u201341.</ref> Foxe's funeral was accompanied \"by crowds of mourners\".<ref>Mozley, p. 240</ref>\n\n==Historical reputation==\n[[File:John-Foxe-engraving.jpg|thumb|John-Foxe-engraving]]After his death, Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'' continued to be published and appreciatively read. John Burrow refers to it as, after the Bible, \"the greatest single influence on English Protestant thinking of the late Tudor and early Stuart period.\"<ref>John Burrow, ''A History of Histories'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008), p. 296.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, however, the work tended to be abbreviated to include only \"the most sensational episodes of torture and death\", thus giving to Foxe's work \"a lurid quality which was certainly far from the author's intention.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Because Foxe was used to attack Catholicism and a rising tide of [[high-church]] Anglicanism, the book's credibility was challenged in the early 19th century by a number of authors, most importantly, Samuel R. Maitland.<ref>Freeman, ''ODNB''. Maitland, ''Six letters on Foxe's Acts and Monuments'' (1837).</ref> In the words of one Catholic Victorian, after Maitland's critique, \"no one with any literary pretensions... ventured to quote Foxe as an authority.\"<ref>D. Trenow, \"The Credibility of John Foxe, the 'martyrologist' (1868), quoted in Freeman, ''ODNB''.</ref> Further analysis of Maitland's criticism in the 21st century has in the words of [[David Loades]], that Maitland \"deserves to be treated with genuine, but limited, respect. His demolition of the martyrologist's history of the [[Waldenses]], and of some of his other medieval reconstructions, was accurate up to a point, but he never addressed those parts of the ''Acts and Monuments'' where Foxe was at his strongest, and his general conclusion that the work was nothing but a tissue of fabrications and distortions is not supported by modern analysis.\"<ref>David Loades, [http://www.johnfoxe.org/index.php?realm=more&gototype=modern&type=essay&book=essay11 \"The Maitland Controversy\"]</ref>\n\nIt was not until J. F. Mozley published ''John Foxe and His Book'', in 1940. that Foxe's rehabilitation as a historian began, initiating a controversy that has continued to the present.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=10050|title=John Foxe (1516/17\u20131587)}}</ref> Recent renewed interest in Foxe as a seminal figure in early modern studies created a demand for a new critical edition of the ''Actes and Monuments'': [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709092855/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/index.html ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs Variorum Edition''].\n\nIn the words of Thomas S. Freeman, one of the most important living Foxe scholars, \"current scholarship has formed a more complex and nuanced estimate of the accuracy of ''Acts and Monuments''.... Perhaps [Foxe] may be most profitably seen in the same light as a barrister pleading a case for a client he knows to be innocent and whom he is determined to save. Like the hypothetical barrister, Foxe had to deal with the evidence of what actually happened, evidence that he was rarely in a position to forge. But he would not present facts damaging to his client, and he had the skills that enabled him to arrange the evidence so as to make it conform to what he wanted it to say. Like the barrister, Foxe presents crucial evidence and tells one side of a story which must be heard. But he should never be read uncritically, and his partisan objectives should always be kept in mind.\"<ref name=\"Freeman, ODNB\">Freeman, ODNB.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Christianity}}\n*[[John Foxe's apocalyptic thought]]\n*[[Religion in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Freeman, Thomas S.

But Samuel is very inaccurate in such matters; his diary misdates important happenings in his own life; and [his other son] [[Simeon Fox|Simeon]]'s statement is too precise to be disregarded.\" Mozley, 12.</ref> an English historian and [[martyrologist]], was the author of ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'' (otherwise ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs''), telling of [[Christianity|Christian]] martyrs throughout Western history, but particularly the sufferings of English [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestants]] from the 14th century and in the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]. Widely owned and read by [[English Puritans]], the book helped to mould British opinion about the [[Catholic Church]] for several centuries.<ref>William Haller, ''Foxe's First Book of Martyrs and the Elect Nation'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 1963) argues that ''Actes and Monuments'' is a complex book, portraying the English church as a body of elect whose history of suffering and dedication to the faith echo the history of Israel in the Old Testament.</ref>\n\n==Education==\nFoxe was born in [[Boston, England|Boston]], in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]], of a middlingly prominent family<ref>In 1551, one Henry Foxe, a [[merchant]] and possible relative, became [[mayor]] of that town.</ref> and seems to have been an unusually studious and devout child.<ref>J. F. Mozley, ''John Foxe and His Book'' (New York: Macmillan Company, 1940), p. 13. After work when boys went out to play, \"John would stay behind; and when search was made, he was found in church (sacro) at his prayers or deep in a book.\"</ref> In about 1534, when he was about 16, he entered [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], where he was the pupil of John Hawarden (or Harding), a fellow of the college.<ref>Hawarden was perhaps a family friend; he had become [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Coningsby]] in 1533, and Foxe's mother, her husband having died when Foxe was young, had married Richard Melton, a yeoman of Coningsby. Three decades later Foxe made a [[dedication]] to Hawarden in one of his books, thanking Hawarden for enabling his education. At Brasenose College, Foxe shared rooms with [[Alexander Nowell]], afterwards [[dean (religion)|dean]] of [[St Paul's Cathedral]].</ref> In 1535 Foxe was admitted to [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]], where he may either have been improving his Latin or acting as a junior instructor. He became a probationer fellow in July 1538 and a full [[fellow]] the following July.\n\nFoxe took his bachelor's degree on 17 July 1537, his master's degree in July 1543, and was [[lecturer]] in [[logic]] in 1539\u20131540.<ref>Foxe wrote several Latin plays on biblical subjects, of which the best, ''De Christo triumphante'' or ''Christus triumphans'', an allegorical verse drama on the history of the church, was printed in London in 1551 and by [[Johannes Oporinus|Oporinus]] in Basel in March 1556. It was performed at Cambridge and probably Oxford in the 1560s. The play was translated into French in 1562 and English in 1579. The latter translation was produced by [[Richard Day (printer)|Richard Day]], son of the printer, [[John Day (printer)|John Day]] or Daye, who published Foxe's [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|''Actes and Monuments'']]. Foxe's earliest extant literary creation is ''Titus et Gesippus'' (written in 1544), a Latin comedy based on [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]].</ref> A series of letters in Foxe's handwriting dated to 1544\u201345, shows Foxe to be \"a man of friendly disposition and warm sympathies, deeply religious, an ardent student, zealous in making acquaintance with scholars.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 18.</ref> By the time he was twenty-five, he had read the Latin and Greek fathers, the [[schoolmen]], the [[canon law]], and had \"acquired no mean skill in the Hebrew language.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Resignation from Oxford==\nFoxe resigned from his college in 1545 after becoming a Protestant and thereby subscribing to beliefs condemned by the [[Church of England]] under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].<ref>Foxe may have refused to attend mass. Other Protestants of future renown at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen]] then were [[Henry Bull (theologian)|Henry Bull]], [[Laurence Humphrey]], [[Thomas Cooper (bishop)|Thomas Cooper]], and [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]].</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} After a year of \"obligatory regency\" (public lecturing), Foxe would have been obliged to take [[holy orders]] by [[Michaelmas]] 1545, and the primary reason for his resignation was probably his opposition to clerical [[celibacy]], which he described in letters to friends as self-castration.<ref>BL, [[Lansdowne MS.]] 388, fols. 80v, 117r.</ref> Foxe may have been forced from the college in a general purge of its Protestant members although college records state that he resigned of his own accord and \"ex honesta causa\".<ref>There exists in Foxe's papers a draft of a letter to [[Owen Oglethorpe]], president of Magdalen, in which Foxe protests against the charges of irreverence and of belonging to a new religion, which were brought against him by some of the college's masters, who are not named by Foxe (BL, Lansdowne MS 388, folios 53r\u201358r). Foxe says these masters persecuted other fellows, including [[Thomas Cooper (bishop)|Thomas Cooper]], later Bishop of Lincoln and Winchester under Elizabeth, and [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]], a lifelong friend and associate of Foxe, who also left the college at that time. Foxe's letter is printed in Pratt's edition (vol. i. Appendix, pp. 58\u201361); see also J. F. Mozley, ''John Foxe and His Book'' (New York: Macmillan Company, 1940).</ref> Foxe's change of religious opinion may have temporarily broken his relationship with his stepfather and even have put his life in danger. Foxe personally witnessed the burning of William Cowbridge in September 1538.<ref>Mozley, p. 21.</ref>\n\nAfter being forced to abandon what might have been a promising academic career, Foxe experienced a period of dire need. [[Hugh Latimer]] invited Foxe to live with him, but Foxe eventually became a tutor in the household of [[Thomas Lucy]] of [[Charlecote]], near [[Stratford-on-Avon]]. Before leaving the Lucys, Foxe married Agnes Randall on 3 February 1547.<ref name=\"Marriage\">Thomas S. Freeman, \"Foxe, John,\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004). The reasons for Foxe's departure from the Lucys are unknown. According to a short remembrance written by [[Simeon Fox]]e in 1611 and appended to the 1641 ''Actes and Monuments'', Foxe stayed with the Randalls in [[Coventry]] before returning to his parents in Coningsby.</ref> They had six children.<ref name=\"Children\">John H. King, ed., ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs: Select Narratives'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. xvii.</ref>\n\n==London under Edward VI==\nFoxe's prospects, and those of the Protestant cause generally, improved after the accession of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]  in January 1547 and the formation of a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] dominated by pro-reform Protestants. In the middle of or at the end of 1547, Foxe moved to London and probably lived in [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]]. There he completed three translations of Protestant sermons published by the \"stout Protestant\" Hugh Singleton.<ref>One sermon was by [[Martin Luther]] ESTC 16983 and another by [[Urbannus Regius]]: ''An Instruction of the Christian Faith'' (ESTC 120847).</ref> During this period Foxe also found a patron in [[Mary Fitzroy]], Duchess of Richmond, who hired him as tutor to the orphan children of her brother, [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], a Catholic who had been executed for treason in January 1547.<ref>Surrey's father, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].</ref> (The children were [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas]], who would become the fourth duke of Norfolk and a valuable friend of Foxe; [[Jane Neville|Jane]], later Countess of Westmorland; [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry]], later [[earl of Northampton]]; and their cousin [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles]], who would later command the English fleet against the [[Spanish Armada]].) Foxe lived in the Duchess's London household at Mountjoy House and later at [[Reigate Castle]], and her patronage \"facilitated Foxe's entry into the ranks of England's Protestant elite.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> During his stay at Reigate, Foxe helped suppress a cult that had arisen around the shrine of the Virgin Mary at Ouldsworth, which had been credited with miraculous healing powers.<ref>[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/freemanessay.html Freeman, brief on-line biography of Foxe.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013934/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/freemanessay.html |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nFoxe was ordained deacon by [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]] on 24 June 1550. His circle of friends, associates, and supporters came to include [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]], [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]], [[John Rogers (c.1500\u20131555)|John Rogers]], [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], and most importantly [[John Bale]], who was to become a close friend and \"certainly encouraged, very probably guided, Foxe in the composition of his first [[martyrology]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> From 1548 to 1551, Foxe brought out one tract opposing the death penalty for adultery and another supporting ecclesiastical excommunication of those who he thought \"veiled ambition under the cloak of Protestantism.\" He also worked unsuccessfully to prevent two burnings for religion that occurred during the reign of Edward VI.<ref>Mozley, pp. 31\u201336.</ref>\n\n==Marian exile==\nOn the accession of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in July 1553, Foxe lost his tutorship when the children's grandfather, [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]] was released from prison. Foxe walked warily as befitted one who had published Protestant books in his own name. As the political climate worsened, Foxe believed himself personally threatened by Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]]. Just ahead of officers sent to arrest him, he sailed with his pregnant wife from [[Ipswich]] to [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]].<ref>Mozley, p. 41.</ref> He then travelled to [[Antwerp]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Strasbourg]], which he reached by July 1554. In Strasbourg, Foxe published a Latin history of the Christian persecutions, the draft of which he had brought from England and \"which became the first shadowy draught of his ''Acts and Monuments''.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 42. He had assistance from two clerics of widely differing opinions \u2013 from [[Edmund Grindal]], who was later, as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to maintain his [[Puritan]] convictions in opposition to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], and from [[John Aylmer (English bishop)|John Aylmer]], afterwards one of the most bitter opponents of the [[Puritan]] party. Bale too is also thought to have been a critical assistant in the production of this book, which dealt chiefly with figures deemed precursors to the Protestant Reformation: [[John Wycliffe]], [[John Huss|Jan Hus]], [[Savonarola]] and [[Reginald Pecock]]. It was printed in Strasbourg by [[Wendelin Richelius]] with the title of ''Commentarii rerum in ecclesia gestarum''.</ref>\n\nIn the autumn of 1554, Foxe moved to Frankfurt, where he served as a preacher for the English church ministering to refugees in the city. There he was unwillingly drawn into a [[Troubles at Frankfurt|bitter theological controversy]]. One faction favoured the church polity and liturgy of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], while the other advocated the [[Reformed]] models promoted by [[John Calvin]]'s Genevan church. The latter group, led by [[John Knox]], was supported by Foxe; the former was led by [[Richard Cox (bishop)|Richard Cox]]. Eventually Knox, who seems to have acted with more magnanimity, was expelled, and in the autumn of 1555, Foxe and about twenty others also left Frankfurt.<ref>Mozley, pp. 44\u201346. The prayer book faction reported Knox as having written treason against the Emperor, and they also persuaded the city magistrates to enforce the Prayer Book service on the English church.</ref> Although Foxe clearly favoured Knox, he was [[irenic]] by temperament and expressed his disgust at \"the violence of the warring factions\".<ref>Mozley, 46.</ref>\n\nMoving to [[Basel]], Foxe worked with his fellow countrymen [[John Bale]] and [[Lawrence Humphrey]] at the drudgery of proofreading. (Educated Englishmen were noted for their learning, industry and honesty and \"would also be the last persons to quarrel with their bread and butter.\" No knowledge of German or French was required because the English tended to socialise with one another and could communicate with scholars in Latin.)<ref>Mozley, pp. 50\u201351 and 57. Foxe laboured over the proofreading of [[Thomas Cranmer]]'s second book on the [[Eucharist]] in the printing house of [[Johann Herbst]] (or [[Oporinus]]), a book he thought \"crabbed and obscure\" (Mozley, p. 46) and which proved too controversial to be printed. (Mozley, p. 56) Foxe also served as an assistant to [[Hieronymus Froben]] in the production of a Latin edition of [[St. John Chrysostom]]'s works.</ref> Foxe also completed and had printed a religious drama, ''Christus Triumphans'' (1556), in Latin verse. Yet despite receiving occasional financial contributions from English merchants on the continent, Foxe seems to have lived very close to the margin and been \"wretchedly poor.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 51.</ref>\n\nWhen Foxe received reports from England about the ongoing religious persecution there, he wrote a pamphlet urging the English nobility to use their influence with the queen to halt it. Foxe feared that the appeal would be useless, and his fears proved correct.<ref>The pamphlet, ''Ad inclytos ad praepotentes Angliae proceres... supplicatio'' (1557) was issued from the press of Oporinus.</ref> When Knox attacked [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] in his now famous ''[[The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women]]'', Foxe apparently criticized Knox's \"rude vehemency\" although their friendship seems to have remained unimpaired.<ref>Mozley, p. 58.</ref>\n\n==Return to England==\n[[File:Actes and Monuments.jpg|thumb|A page from the first edition of ''Actes and Monuments'', also known as ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs'', published in 1563.]]\nAfter the death of Mary I in 1558, Foxe was in no hurry to return home, and he waited to see if religious changes instituted by her successor, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], would take root. Foxe was also so poor that he was unable to travel with his family until money was sent to him.<ref>Mozley, p. 61.</ref> Back in England, he seems to have lived for ten years at [[Aldgate]], London, in the house of his former pupil, [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]], now Fourth [[Duke of Norfolk]].<ref>Mozley, p. 62. Howard retained sincere affection for his tutor and left him a small pension in his will years later when Norfolk was executed for treason.</ref> Foxe quickly became associated with [[John Day (printer)|John Day]] the printer and published works of religious controversy while working on a new martyrology that would eventually become the ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Actes and Monuments]]''.\n\nFoxe was ordained a priest by his friend [[Edmund Grindal]], now [[Bishop of London]], but he \"was something of a puritan, and like many of the exiles, had scruples about wearing the clerical vestments laid down in the queen's injunctions of 1559.\" Many of his friends eventually conformed, but Foxe was \"more stubborn or single-minded.\"  Some tried to find him preferments in the new regime, but it \"was not easy to help a man of so singularly unworldly a nature, who scorned to use his powerful friendships to advance himself.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 63.</ref>\n\n==''Actes and Monuments''==\n===Latin editions===\nFoxe began his Book of Martyrs in 1552, during the reign of Edward VI, with the [[Marian Persecutions]] still in the future. In 1554, while still in exile, Foxe published in Latin at Strasbourg the first shadow of his great book, emphasising the persecution of the English [[Lollards]] during the 15th century.\n\nAs word of the contemporary English persecution made its way to the continent, Foxe began to collect materials to continue his story to the present. He published the first true Latin edition of his famous book at Basel in August 1559.<ref>Mozley, 118\u2013123.</ref><ref>Fox J (1559) ''Rerum in ecclesia gestarum... pars prima, in qua primum de rebus per Angliam et Scotiam gestis atque in primis de horrenda sub Maria nuper regina persecutione narratio continetur'', at [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=peRDAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Foxe+rerum+1559&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjB4t_9r97cAhVMaVAKHZHxAEYQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&q=Foxe%20rerum%201559&f=false google books at 08 August 2018]. Or for free download from the Bavarian State Library.</ref> Of course, it was difficult to write contemporary English history while living (as he later said) \"in the far parts of Germany, where few friends, no conference, [and] small information could be had.\"<ref>Mozley, 124.</ref> But Foxe who had left England poor and unknown, returned only poor. He had gained \"a substantial reputation\" through his Latin work.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===First edition===\nOn 20 March 1563, Foxe published the first English edition of the ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Actes and Monuments]]'' from the press of [[John Day (printer)|John Day]].<ref>Day's epitaph reads: \"He set a Foxe to write how martyrs run/By death to life. Foxe ventured pains and health/To give them light: Daye spent in print his wealth,/And God with gain restored his wealth again,/ And gave to him as he gave to the poor.\" (Mozley, p. 138)</ref> It was a \"gigantic [[:wiktionary:folio|folio]] volume\" of about 1800 pages, about three times the length of the 1559 Latin book.<ref>Mozley, p. 129.</ref> As is typical for the period, the full title was a paragraph long and is abbreviated by scholars as ''Acts and Monuments'',<ref>The full title is \"Actes and Monuments of these latter and perilous days, touching matters of the Church, wherein are comprehended and described the great persecutions and horrible troubles that have been wrought and practised by the Romish prelates, specially in this realm of England and Scotland, from the year of our Lord 1000 unto the time now present; gathered and collected according to the true copies and writings certificatory, as well of the parties themselves that suffered, as also out of the bishops' registers, which were the doers thereof; by John Foxe.\"</ref> although the book was popularly known then, as it is now, as ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]]''. Publication of the book made Foxe instantly famous \u2013 \"England's first literary celebrity\" \u2013 although because there were then no royalties, Foxe remained as poor as ever although the book sold for more than ten shillings, three weeks' pay for a skilled craftsman.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Mozley, p. 130; David Loades, [http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/loadesearlyreceptionessay.html \"The Early Reception\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517030350/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/loadesearlyreceptionessay.html |date=17 May 2011 }}.</ref>\n\n===Second edition===\n''Actes and Monuments'' was immediately attacked by Catholics such as [[Thomas Harding (1516\u20131572)|Thomas Harding]], [[Thomas Stapleton (theologian)|Thomas Stapleton]], and [[Nicholas Harpsfield]].<ref>Harpsfield, a former archdeacon of Canterbury under Mary I, wrote under the name of Alan Cope, ''Dialogi sex, contra summi pontificatus, monasticae vitae, sanctorum, sacrarum imaginum oppugnatores, et pseudomartyres'' (1566), a thousand-page book, with the sixth dialogue aimed at Foxe. Mozley, p. 139.</ref> In the next generation, [[Robert Parsons (priest)|Robert Parsons]], an English Jesuit, also struck at Foxe in ''A Treatise of Three Conversions of England'' (1603\u201304). Harding, in the spirit of the age, called ''Actes and Monuments'' ' \"that huge dunghill of your stinking martyrs,\" full of a thousand lies'.<ref>Mozley, p. 138.</ref>\n\nIntending to strengthen his book against his critics, and being flooded by new material brought to light by the publication of the first edition,<ref>\"[P]ersonal testimonies poured in on Foxe without solicitation as people sought to exonerate themselves and accuse or eulogize others.\" Freeman, ''ODNB''.</ref> Foxe put together a second edition in 1570 and where the charges of his critics had been reasonably accurate, Foxe removed the offending passages. Where he could rebut the charges, \"he mounted a vigorous counter-attack, seeking to crush his opponent under piles of documents.\"<ref>Freeman, ODNB: \"In short, Foxe reacted to Harpsfield's challenge like the commander of a besieged city, abandoning what could not be defended and fortifying what could. Harpsfield drove Foxe to more intensive and extensive research and made his martyrology a more impressive, although not necessarily more accurate, work of scholarship.\"</ref> Even though he deleted material that had been included in the first edition, the second edition was nearly double the size of the first, \"two gigantic folio volumes, with 2300 very large pages\" of double-columned text.<ref>Mozley, p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe edition was well received by the English church, and the upper house of the convocation of Canterbury meeting in 1571, ordered that a copy of the [[Bishop's Bible]] and \"that full history entitled Monuments of Martyrs\" be installed in every cathedral church and that church officials place copies in their houses for the use of servants and visitors. The decision was of certain benefit to Foxe's printer [[John Day (printer)|Day]] because he had taken great financial risks printing such a mammoth work.<ref>Mozley, p. 147.</ref>\n\n===Third and fourth editions===\n[[Image:FoxeMartyrsIllustration.JPG|thumb|right| Dual martyrdom by burning, 1558; from a 1641 edition of Foxe.]]\nFoxe published a third edition in 1576, but it was virtually a reprint of the second, although printed on inferior paper and in smaller type.<ref>Mozley, pp. 148\u201349.</ref> The fourth edition, published in 1583, the last in Foxe's lifetime, had larger type and better paper and consisted of \"two volumes of about two thousand folio pages in double columns.\" Nearly four times the length of the Bible, the fourth edition was \"the most physically imposing, complicated, and technically demanding English book of its era. It seems safe to say that it is the largest and most complicated book to appear during the first two or three centuries of English printing history.\"<ref>John N. King, ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs: Select Narratives'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. xli.</ref> The title page included the poignant request that the author \"desireth thee, good reader, to help him with thy prayer.\"<ref>Mozley, pp. 149\u201350.</ref>\n\n===Accuracy===\nFoxe based his accounts of martyrs before the early modern period on previous writers, including [[Eusebius]], [[Bede]], [[Matthew Paris]], and many others. Foxe's own contribution was his compilation of the English martyrs from the period of the [[Lollards]] through the persecution of Mary I. Here Foxe had primary sources of all kinds to draw on: episcopal registers, reports of trials, and the testimony of eyewitnesses, a remarkable range of sources for English historical writing of the period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">.</ref>\n\nFoxe's material is more accurate when he deals with his own period, although it is selectively presented, and the book is not an impartial account. Sometimes Foxe copied documents verbatim; sometimes he adapted them to his own use. Although both he and his contemporary readers were more credulous than most moderns, Foxe presented \"lifelike and vivid pictures of the manners and feelings of the day, full of details that could never have been invented by a forger.\"<ref name=\"Mozley, 168\">Mozley, 168.</ref> Foxe's method of using his sources \"proclaims the honest man, the sincere seeker after truth.\"<ref>Mozley, 168. \"What the intent and custom is of the papists to do, I cannot tell: for mine own I will say, although many other vices I have, yet from this one I have always of nature abhorred, wittingly to deceive any man or child, so near as I could, much less the church of God, whom I with all my heart do reverence, and with fear obey.\" ''A&M'', 3, p. 393.</ref>\n\nFoxe often treated his material casually, and any reader \"must be prepared to meet plenty of small errors and inconsistencies.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 155.</ref> Furthermore, Foxe did not hold to later notions of neutrality or objectivity. He made unambiguous side glosses on his text, such as \"Mark the apish pageants of these popelings\" and \"This answer smelleth of forging and crafty packing\",<ref>Mozley, p. 157.</ref> as Foxe's age was one of strong language as well as of cruel deeds.<ref>Mozley, 158.</ref> The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica went so far as to accuse Foxe of \"wilful falsification of evidence.\"<ref>\"John Foxe\", 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref> Nevertheless, Foxe is \"factually detailed and preserves much firsthand material on the English Reformation unobtainable elsewhere.\"<ref>2009 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.</ref> According to J.F. Mozley, Foxe presented \"lifelike and vivid pictures of the manners and feelings of the day, full of details that could never have been invented by a forger.\"<ref>Mozley, p. 168.</ref>\n\n==Life under Elizabeth I==\n===Salisbury and London===\nFoxe had dedicated ''Acts and Monuments'' to the queen,<ref>In the dedication, Foxe compares his work to [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]' ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', and Elizabeth to Eusebius' patron, the emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. The dedication was dropped after 1563.</ref> and on 22 May 1563, he was appointed [[prebend]] of Shipton in [[Salisbury Cathedral]], in recognition of his championship of the English church.<ref>Mozley, 67.</ref> Foxe never visited the cathedral or performed any duties associated with the position except to appoint a vicar, [[William Masters]], a highly educated fellow Protestant and former Marian exile. Foxe's inaction as a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the cathedral led him to him being declared [[contumacious]], and he was charged with failing to give a [[tithe]] for repairs to the cathedral. Perhaps his poverty made him unwilling to spare the time or money to make visits or contributions. In any case, he retained the position until his death.<ref>Mozley, p. 69.</ref>\n\nBy 1565, Foxe had been caught up in the [[vestments controversy]] led at that time by his associate [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Crowley]]. Foxe's name was on a list of \"godly preachers which have utterly forsaken Antichrist and all his Romish rags\" that was presented to Lord [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] some time between 1561 and 1564.<ref>Magdalene College, Cambridge, Pepys Library, \"Papers of state\", 2.701.</ref>  He was also one of the twenty clergymen who on 20 March 1565 petitioned to be allowed to choose not to wear [[vestments]]; but unlike many of the others, Foxe did not have a London [[benefice]] to lose when [[Archbishop Parker]] enforced conformity. Rather, when Crowley lost his position at [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], Foxe may have preached in his stead.<ref>Mozley, p. 75. Mozley says that the registers show that Foxe was never officially vicar of St. Giles.</ref>\n\nAt some point before 1569, Foxe left [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Norfolk's]] house and moved to his own on [[Grub Street]]. Perhaps his move was motivated by his concerns about Norfolk's exceptionally poor judgment in attempting to marry [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]], which led to his imprisonment in the [[Tower of London|Tower]] in 1569 and his condemnation in 1572 following the [[Ridolfi Plot]]. Although Foxe had written Norfolk \"a remarkably frank letter\" about the injudiciousness of his course, after Norfolk's condemnation, he and [[Alexander Nowell]] ministered to the prisoner until his execution, which Foxe attended, on 2 June 1572.<ref>Mozley, p. 84. Norfolk left Foxe twenty pounds a year.</ref>\n\nIn 1570, at the request of [[Edmund Grindal]], Bishop of London, Foxe preached the [[Good Friday]] sermon at [[Paul's Cross]]. This lofty exposition of the Protestant doctrine of redemption and attack on the doctrinal errors of the Roman Catholic Church was enlarged and published that year as ''A Sermon of Christ Crucified''.<ref>STC 11242.</ref>  Another sermon Foxe preached seven years later at Paul's Cross resulted in his denunciation to the Queen by the French ambassador on grounds that Foxe had advocated the right of the [[Huguenots]] to take arms against their king. Foxe replied that he had been misunderstood: he had argued only that if the French king permitted no foreign power (the Pope) to rule over him, the French Protestants would immediately lay down their arms.<ref>Mozley, 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nIn 1571, Foxe edited an edition of the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] gospels, in parallel with the [[Bishops' Bible]] translation, under the patronage of [[Matthew Parker|Archbishop Parker]], who was interested in Anglo-Saxon and whose chaplain, [[John Joscelyn|John Jocelyn]] was an Anglo-Saxon scholar. Foxe's introduction argues that the vernacular scripture was an ancient custom in England.<ref>Mozley, 80\u201381. \"Anglo-Saxon studies were patronized by Archbishop Parker in the hope that they would demonstrate that the Church in England had always been independent of Rome. It was a preoccupation analogous to aspects of French [[Gallicanism]].\" John Burrow, ''A History of Histories''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008, p. 295.</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\nFoxe died on 18 April 1587 and was buried at [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate|St. Giles's, Cripplegate]]. His widow, Agnes, probably died in 1605. Foxe's son, [[Samuel Foxe]] (1560\u20131630) prospered after his father's death and \"accumulated a substantial estate.\" Fortunately for posterity, he also preserved his father's manuscripts, and they are now in the [[British Library]].\n\n==Personality==\nFoxe was so bookish that he ruined his health by his persistent study.<ref>Mozley, pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Yet he had \"a genius for friendship,\" served as a spiritual counselor and was a man of private charity. He even took part in matchmaking.<ref>Mozley, 96, 100\u201301.</ref> Foxe was so well known as a man of prayer that [[Francis Drake]] credited his victory at [[Cadiz]] in part to Foxe's praying.<ref>Mozley, 101\u201302.</ref> Furthermore, Foxe's extreme unworldliness caused others to claim that he had prophetic powers and could heal the sick.<ref>Mozley, pp. 96 and 105\u201307. Foxe had to stop the sick from being carried to him for healing.</ref>\n\nCertainly, Foxe had a hatred of cruelty in advance of his age. When a number of [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[Anabaptists]] were taken by Elizabeth's government in 1572 and sentenced to be burnt, Foxe first wrote letters to the Queen and her council asking for their lives and then wrote to the prisoners themselves (having his Latin draft translated into Flemish) pleading with them to abandon what he considered their theological errors. Foxe even visited the Anabaptists in prison. (The attempted intercession was in vain; two were burnt at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] \"in great horror with roaring and crying.\")<ref>Mozley, pp. 86\u201389.</ref>\n\nJohn Day's son Richard, who knew Foxe well, described him in 1607 as an \"excellent man... exceeding laborious in his pen... his learning inferior to none of his age and time; for his integrity of life a bright light to as many as knew him, beheld him, and lived with him\"\n<ref>Mozley, 240\u201341.</ref> Foxe's funeral was accompanied \"by crowds of mourners\".<ref>Mozley, p. 240</ref>\n\n==Historical reputation==\n[[File:John-Foxe-engraving.jpg|thumb|John-Foxe-engraving]]After his death, Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'' continued to be published and appreciatively read. John Burrow refers to it as, after the Bible, \"the greatest single influence on English Protestant thinking of the late Tudor and early Stuart period.\"<ref>John Burrow, ''A History of Histories'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008), p. 296.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, however, the work tended to be abbreviated to include only \"the most sensational episodes of torture and death\", thus giving to Foxe's work \"a lurid quality which was certainly far from the author's intention.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Because Foxe was used to attack Catholicism and a rising tide of [[high-church]] Anglicanism, the book's credibility was challenged in the early 19th century by a number of authors, most importantly, Samuel R. Maitland.<ref>Freeman, ''ODNB''. Maitland, ''Six letters on Foxe's Acts and Monuments'' (1837).</ref> In the words of one Catholic Victorian, after Maitland's critique, \"no one with any literary pretensions... ventured to quote Foxe as an authority.\"<ref>D. Trenow, \"The Credibility of John Foxe, the 'martyrologist' (1868), quoted in Freeman, ''ODNB''.</ref> Further analysis of Maitland's criticism in the 21st century has in the words of [[David Loades]], that Maitland \"deserves to be treated with genuine, but limited, respect. His demolition of the martyrologist's history of the [[Waldenses]], and of some of his other medieval reconstructions, was accurate up to a point, but he never addressed those parts of the ''Acts and Monuments'' where Foxe was at his strongest, and his general conclusion that the work was nothing but a tissue of fabrications and distortions is not supported by modern analysis.\"<ref>David Loades, [http://www.johnfoxe.org/index.php?realm=more&gototype=modern&type=essay&book=essay11 \"The Maitland Controversy\"]</ref>\n\nIt was not until J. F. Mozley published ''John Foxe and His Book'', in 1940. that Foxe's rehabilitation as a historian began, initiating a controversy that has continued to the present.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=10050|title=John Foxe (1516/17\u20131587)}}</ref> Recent renewed interest in Foxe as a seminal figure in early modern studies created a demand for a new critical edition of the ''Actes and Monuments'': [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709092855/http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/index.html ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs Variorum Edition''].\n\nIn the words of Thomas S. Freeman, one of the most important living Foxe scholars, \"current scholarship has formed a more complex and nuanced estimate of the accuracy of ''Acts and Monuments''.... Perhaps [Foxe] may be most profitably seen in the same light as a barrister pleading a case for a client he knows to be innocent and whom he is determined to save. Like the hypothetical barrister, Foxe had to deal with the evidence of what actually happened, evidence that he was rarely in a position to forge. But he would not present facts damaging to his client, and he had the skills that enabled him to arrange the evidence so as to make it conform to what he wanted it to say. Like the barrister, Foxe presents crucial evidence and tells one side of a story which must be heard. But he should never be read uncritically, and his partisan objectives should always be kept in mind.\"<ref name=\"Freeman, ODNB\">Freeman, ODNB.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Christianity}}\n*[[John Foxe's apocalyptic thought]]\n*[[Religion in the United Kingdom]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*Freeman, Thomas S.
