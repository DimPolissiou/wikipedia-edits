The film mainly takes place in rural [[Berkeley County, South Carolina]], and depicts the story of an American Colonist, nominally loyal to the British Crown, who is swept into the [[American Revolutionary War]] when his family is affected. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure who Rodat has stated is based on four factual figures from the American Revolutionary War: [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]], [[Francis Marion]], [[Daniel Morgan]], and [[Thomas Sumter]].\n\nThe film takes place during the events of the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War]]. It attracted controversy over its fictional portrayal of historical British figures and atrocities, especially with the infamous \"Burning church\" scene, of which there is no historical or written record. Critic Roger Ebert wrote \"None of it has much to do with the historical reality of the Revolutionary War\".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-patriot-2000|title=The Patriot|first=Roger|last=Ebert|accessdate=May 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1775, Captain Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the [[French and Indian War]] and a [[widower]] with seven children, is called to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] to vote in the [[South Carolina]] [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] on a levy supporting the [[Continental Army]]. Fearing war against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continentals.\n \nTwo years later, Charleston [[Siege of Charleston|falls]] to the [[British Army|British]] and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British [[Dragoon]]s, led by Colonel William Tavington, arrive, capture Gabriel with the intention of hanging him as a spy, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house [[arson|burned]], and wounded [[Regular Army (United States)|Americans]] executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons [[rifle]]s, and they ambush the British unit escorting the captive Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \"Ghost\". Gabriel decides to rejoin the Continentals and Benjamin soon follows, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General [[Horatio Gates]] [[Battle of Camden|engaging]] the British Army. Benjamin recognizes the foolishness of the action, having served in the British Army; sure enough, the Continentals are decisively routed.\n\nBenjamin meets his former commanding officer, Colonel Harry Burwell, who makes him [[colonel]] of the local colonial [[militia (United States)|militia]] due to his combat experience and also places Gabriel under Benjamin's command. Benjamin is tasked with keeping [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]]'s regiments pinned south through [[guerrilla warfare]]. French Major Jean Villeneuve helps train the militia and promises more French aid.\n\nGabriel asks why Villeneuve and others often mention Benjamin's role in something called \"Fort Wilderness.\" Benjamin, having been hesitant to answer the question up to now, finally tells his son the story. Benjamin had been fighting in the British Army in the [[French and Indian War|previous war]] when he and several other soldiers discovered a French atrocity at a fort that Benjamin and his comrades had been trying to reinforce. In a teutonic rage, Benjamin and his comrades caught up with the French at Fort Wilderness, where Benjamin and his unit literally cut the defending French soldiers apart slowly. Benjamin reveals that he has been haunted by guilt ever since.\n\nBenjamin's militia harasses British supply lines, even capturing some of Cornwallis' personal effects and his two Great Danes, and burn half the bridges and ferries leading to Charleston. Lord Cornwallis blames Tavington for creating this reaction with his brutal tactics. However, irritated at the lack of progress, and insulted by Benjamin's [[ruse of war|clever ploy]] to free some of the captured militia, Cornwallis reluctantly allows Tavington to stop Benjamin by any means necessary.\n\nWith the reluctant aid of the Loyalist Captain Wilkins, Tavington learns the identities of some militia members and attacks their families and burns their homes. Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned to live in a [[Gullah]] settlement with former black slaves. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed Anne. Tavington's [[brigade]] rides into the town that supplies the militia. He assembles all the townspeople, including Anne, into the church, promising freedom in exchange for the whereabouts of the rebels. After their location is given, he has the doors barricaded, and orders the church to be burned, killing everyone inside. When they discover the tragedy, Gabriel and several other soldiers race to attack Tavington's encampment. In the ensuing battle, Gabriel shoots Tavington, but Tavington mortally wounds Gabriel before fleeing. Benjamin arrives soon thereafter, only to have another of his sons die in his arms.\n\nBenjamin mourns and wavers in his commitment to continue fighting, but is resolved when reminded of his son's dedication to the cause by finding an American flag he repaired. Martin's militia, along with a larger Continental Army regiment, confronts Cornwallis' regiment in a [[decisive victory|decisive battle]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. The British appear to have the upper hand until Benjamin rallies the troops forward against their lines and Tavington rushes to attack him. The two fight and Tavington attains the upper hand, delivering several wounds to Benjamin. Benjamin slumps to his knees, and Tavington prepares to deliver the [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]. At the last second, Benjamin dodges the attack and stabs Tavington, avenging his sons' deaths. The battle is a Continental victory, and Cornwallis sounds the retreat.\n\nAfter many retreats, Cornwallis is [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where he surrenders to the surrounding Continental Army and the long-awaited French naval force. After the conflict ends, Benjamin returns with his family, with Charlotte carrying their new baby, and discovers his militia soldiers rebuilding his homestead in their old town road.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Captain/Colonel Benjamin Martin<br>A veteran of the [[French and Indian War]], the hero of the fictional Fort Wilderness, and widowed father of seven children, Benjamin does what he can to avoid fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] knowing the implications surrounding it. In addition, he does not want to reveal to his family what he is capable of in violence. When his oldest son, Gabriel, joins up, and his second born son, Thomas, is killed, he takes it upon himself to join and fight with the colonial [[militia]]. He is nicknamed \"The Ghost\" by the British. He is based on a composite of historical characters which include [[Thomas Sumter]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]], and [[Francis Marion]].<ref name=DVD />\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as Corporal Gabriel Martin<br>Benjamin's eldest child, and the husband of Anne Howard. He decides to join up with the [[Continental Army]] against his father's wishes. He is killed during an attack on the [[British Legion (American Revolution)|Green Dragoons]]' camp, while seeking revenge against Colonel Tavington for his wife's murder.\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Charlotte Selton<br>Benjamin's sister-in-law and later wife. She is the owner of a plantation that is burned down by the British. She looks after Benjamin's children while he is fighting; eventually they have a child together.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as Colonel William Tavington<br>Colonel of the Green [[Dragoons]], he\u2019s portrayed as a brutal and psychopathic commander. Long ago, his late father wasted away the family esteem and William\u2019s inheritance. He suggests to Cornwallis that he be allowed to acquire land in the [[Ohio]] territory as payment after the war since the brutality his commander wants from him sacrifices his social standing in English society. He is nicknamed \"The Butcher\" by the people. The character is based on [[Banastre Tarleton]].<ref name=DVD />\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Colonel/General Harry Burwell<br>One of Benjamin's commanding officers in the [[French and Indian War]] and a colonel of the [[Continental Army]]. He fought in the 1775 [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. When his wife gives birth to their firstborn son, they name him after Benjamin's late eldest son, Gabriel. He is based on [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Lee III|Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee]].\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Major Jean Villeneuve<br>A French officer who trains Martin's militia, he holds a grudge against Martin for his part in the [[French and Indian War]], but they become close friends by the war's end. He explains in the film that he watched his wife and two daughters, 12-year-old Violette and 10-year-old Pauline, being burned in the ship that carried them by the British, which explains his hatred for them. He serves as Martin's [[second-in-command]].\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as Reverend Oliver<br>A minister of Pembroke who volunteers to fight with the militia. He also tries to give spiritual advice to his fellow soldiers. He is one of the eighteen captured men taken to [[Fort Carolina]] and released later on by Benjamin. He helps Gabriel in killing Captain Bordon, but is mortally shot by Tavington. Before dying, he courageously tosses his musket to Gabriel so that he may finish off Tavington.\n* [[Lisa Brenner]] as Anne Howard<br>Gabriel's childhood friend and love interest, whom he marries later in the film. She is killed in the town church along with the rest of the town on Tavington's orders.\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Lieutenant General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Earl Cornwallis]] <br>A general of the British army. While pompous and arrogant, he is disgusted by Tavington's savage and ungentlemanly tactics. Cornwallis is a skilled commander, with Martin calling him a genius, but he sees militia soldiers as nothing more than \"[[farmer]]s with [[pitchfork]]s\" and is easily duped by Martin in a key scene. His two Great Danes, Jupiter and Mars, are a gift from King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Dan Scott<br>One of Benjamin's men. He is a racist and bullies the former slave Occam, but grows to befriend him, especially when saved by him while wounded. In the last part of the film, they stand side by side in the final battle and the raising of Martin's new house.\n*[[Leon Rippy]] as John Billings<br>One of Benjamin's neighbors and oldest friends who joins the militia. He is one of the 18 captured men taken to Fort Carolina and later released by Benjamin. Afterward, John helps Charlotte Selton and Benjamin's children escape the burning of the Selton plantation. He commits [[suicide]], in full view of his comrades, after finding that Tavington's men have killed his wife Elizabeth and son Thomas. Afterward, Benjamin gives the militia a furlough.\n*[[Adam Baldwin]] as Captain James Wilkins<br>An officer in the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist Colonial]] militia recruited into the Green Dragoons by Captain Bordon. He knows Benjamin Martin well, and is called upon by Tavington to divulge such information when required. Earlier on, at the South Carolina Assembly in Charleston, he is one of the twelve out of forty to vote against a levy for the Continental Army. He fights alongside Tavington, and also shares these brutal views on how \"all those who stand against England deserve to die a traitor's death\". When he is forced to burn the church at Pembroke, with town residents inside by Tavington, only then does he regret his own words and realize what kind of man his commanding officer really is. He is last seen fighting alongside the British in the final battle of the movie; his fate is not shown.\n*[[Jay Arlen Jones]] as Occam<br>An African slave who is sent to fight in his master's place. He is taunted and bullied by the other soldiers in the militia, but is treated as an equal by Benjamin, Gabriel, Jean, and later on by Dan Scott and the others. He gives out information of the captured eighteen militia men at Fort Carolina while escaping Tavington's trap. After serving a year in the Continental Army, he becomes a free man, but nonetheless still serves with the militia until the end of the war, and later aids, alongside his former adversary Dan Scott, in raising a new house for Martin. (See also: [[African Americans in the Revolutionary War]])\n*[[Joey D. Vieira]] as Peter Howard<br>Anne Howard's father, who lost his left leg and most of his hearing while fighting the French and Indian War. He likens British taxation policies to the British taking his other leg.\n* [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] as Thomas Martin<br>Benjamin's second son, he, like Gabriel, is anxious to fight in the war, but Benjamin says he has to wait because of his age. He is shot and killed by Tavington when he protests against Gabriel's arrest. Tavington rebukes him as a \"stupid boy\" for his actions afterward. Benjamin takes Thomas's set of toy tin soldiers and, over the course of the film, melts them down into bullets for his pistol.\n* [[Mika Boorem]] as Margaret Martin<br>Benjamin's older daughter, she is often seen taking care of her younger siblings.\n* [[Skye McCole Bartusiak]] as Susan Martin<br>The youngest of Benjamin's seven children, initially she will not speak, which may be a post-traumatic reaction to the death of their mother Elizabeth. Her feelings towards her father change radically as the film progresses, and after Benjamin leaves from the furlough to rejoin his militia, in an extremely emotional scene, she seemingly forgives him and tells him she'll say anything he wants to make him stay, to which Benjamin can only promise to return.\n* [[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]] as Nathan Martin<br>Third son, he and Samuel help around the farm. When Gabriel is taken prisoner and Thomas is killed, he and Samuel help their father on a rescue mission.\n* [[Bryan Chafin]] as Samuel Martin<br>Fourth son, he is usually seen helping Nathan around the farm. When Gabriel is taken prisoner and Thomas is killed, he helps his father, Benjamin, rescue Gabriel by killing several British soldiers. For a short while, he becomes scared of his father after he witnesses him brutally killing and mutilating a British soldier with a tomahawk.\n* [[Logan Lerman]] as William Martin, Benjamin's fifth and youngest son.\n* [[Peter Woodward]] as Brigadier General [[Charles O'Hara]] <br>Cornwallis' second-in-command. Like Cornwallis, he does not share Tavington's views on war.\n*[[Jamieson Price|Jamieson K. Price]] as Captain Bordon<br>Tavington's second-in-command of the Green Dragoons. He is killed by Gabriel in the raid against the Dragoons.\n*[[Zach Hanner]] as British [[field officer]].\n*[[Terry Layman]] as General [[George Washington]].\n*[[Andrew Stahl|Andy Stahl]] as General [[Nathanael Greene]].\n*[[Grahame Wood]] as a friendly British Lieutenant at Martin's farm who interacts with both Benjamin Martin and Colonel Tavington. He sees Tavington's orders to kill the Colonial wounded and other prisoners revolting, but remains silent and follows through with the orders without question. He dies shortly afterwards in Martin's skirmish to rescue Gabriel.\n\n==Production==\n===Script===\nScreenwriter [[Robert Rodat]] wrote seventeen drafts of the script before there was an acceptable one. In an early version, Anne is pregnant with Gabriel's child when she dies in the burning church. Rodat wrote the script with Gibson in mind for Benjamin Martin, and gave the Martin character six children to signal this preference to studio executives. After the birth of Gibson's seventh child, the script was changed so that Martin had seven children. Like the character [[William Wallace]], which Gibson portrayed in ''[[Braveheart (film)|Braveheart]]'' five years earlier, Martin is a man seeking to live his life in peace until revenge drives him to lead a cause against a national enemy after the life of an innocent family member is taken.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Joshua Jackson]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], and [[Brad Renfro]] were considered to play Gabriel Martin. The producers and director narrowed their choices for this role to [[Ryan Phillippe]] and [[Heath Ledger]], with the latter chosen because the director thought he possessed \"exuberant youth\".\n\n===Filming===\nThe film's German director Emmerich said \"these were characters I could relate to, and they were engaged in a conflict that had a significant outcome\u2014the creation of the first modern democratic government.\"<ref name=DVD />\n\nThe film was shot entirely on location in South Carolina, including [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Rock Hill, South Carolina|Rock Hill]]\u2014for many of the battle scenes, and [[Lowrys, South Carolina|Lowrys]]\u2014for the farm of Benjamin Martin, as well as nearby [[Fort Lawn, South Carolina|Fort Lawn]].<ref name=TNT>{{cite web|title=''The Patriot'' on TNT|publisher=[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT (TV network)]]|year=2009|url=http://www.tnt.tv/movies/movietitle/?oid=5386|accessdate=March 28, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319003955/http://www.tnt.tv/movies/movietitle/?oid=5386|archivedate=March 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other scenes were filmed at [[Mansfield Plantation]], an antebellum rice plantation in [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Middleton Place]] in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Cistern Yard on the campus of [[College of Charleston]], and [[Hightower Hall]] and Homestead House at [[Brattonsville Historic District|Brattonsville]], South Carolina, along with the grounds of the Brattonsville Plantation in [[McConnells, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Movies Filmed in South Carolina \u2013 ''The Patriot''|work=South Carolina Information Highway|publisher=SCIway.net|url=http://www.sciway.net/movies/sc-movie-patriot.html|year=2009|accessdate=March 28, 2009}}</ref> Producer Mark Gordon said the production team \"tried their best to be as authentic as possible\" because \"the backdrop was serious history,\" giving attention to details in period dress.<ref name=DVD>{{cite video|date=2000 |title=The Patriot|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Columbia Pictures]]|quote=Special features \u2013 True Patriots featurette|isbn=0-7678-5846-8}}</ref> Producer Dean Devlin and the film's costume designers examined actual Revolutionary War uniforms at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] prior to shooting.<ref name=DVD />\n\n===Music===\n{{main|The Patriot (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] for ''The Patriot'' was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Filmtracks: The Patriot (John Williams) |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/patriot.html |publisher=Filmtracks.com |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |date=June 22, 2008}}</ref> [[David Arnold]], who composed the scores to Emmerich's ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', created a demo for ''The Patriot'' that was ultimately rejected.

''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Elvis Mitchell]] gave the film a generally negative review, although he praised its casting and called Mel Gibson \"an astonishing actor\", particularly for his \"on-screen comfort and expansiveness\".

Was he a determined and dangerous warrior? Did he commit acts in an 18th century war that we would consider atrocious in the current world of peace and [[political correctness]]?

Ben Fenton, commenting in the [[The Daily Telegraph|''Daily Telegraph'']], wrote: \n\n<blockquote>There is no evidence that Tarleton, called 'Bloody Ban' or 'The Butcher' in rebel pamphlets, ever broke the [[Laws of war|rules of war]] and certainly did not ever shoot a child in cold blood.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fenton|first=Ben|title=Truth is first casualty in Hollywood's war|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=June 19, 2000|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1343851/Truth-is-first-casualty-in-Hollywoods-war.html |accessdate=April 17, 2017 |location=London}}</ref></blockquote> \n\nAlthough Tarleton gained the reputation among Americans as a butcher for his involvement in the [[Battle of Waxhaws]] in South Carolina, he was a hero in Liverpool, England. [[Liverpool City Council]], led by [[Mayor]] Edwin Clein, called for a public apology for what they viewed as the film's \"[[character assassination]]\" of Tarleton.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patriotic Liverpool up in arms over Gibson's blockbuster|work=Guardian Unlimited |date=June 30, 2000 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,4029,338280,00.html |accessdate=October 31, 2007 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nWhat happened during the Battle of The Waxhaws, known to the Americans as the Buford Massacre or as the Waxhaw massacre, is the subject of debate. According to an American field surgeon named Robert Brownfield who witnessed the events, the Continental Army Col. Buford raised a [[white flag]] of surrender, \"expecting the usual treatment sanctioned by civilized warfare\". While Buford was calling for quarter, Tarleton's horse was struck by a musket ball and fell. This gave the Loyalist cavalrymen the impression that the Continentals had shot at their commander while asking for mercy. Enraged, the Loyalist troops charged at the Virginians. According to Brownfield, the Loyalists attacked, carrying out \"indiscriminate carnage never surpassed by the most ruthless atrocities of the most barbarous savages\".\n\nIn Tarleton's own account, he stated that his horse had been shot from under him during the initial charge in which he was knocked out for several minutes and that his men, thinking him dead, engaged in \"a vindictive asperity not easily restrained\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/americanrevolution/p/battle-of-waxhaws.htm |title=American Revolution: Battle of Waxhaws |first1=Kennedy |last1=Hickman |publisher=About.com |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nTarleton's role in the Revolutionary War in the Carolinas is examined by Ben Rubin who shows that historically, while the actual events of the Battle of the Waxhaws were presented differently according to which side was recounting them, the story of Tarleton's atrocities at Waxhaws and on other occasions became a rallying cry, particularly at the [[Battle of King's Mountain]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Ben|title=The Rhetoric of Revenge: Atrocity and Identity in Revolutionary Carolinas|journal=Journal of Backcountry Studies|volume=5 |issue=2 |year=2010|url=http://libjournal.uncg.edu/ojs/index.php/jbc/article/viewFile/102/84|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> The tales of Tarleton's atrocities were a part of standard U.S. accounts of the war and were described by Washington Irving and by Christopher Ward in his 1952 history, ''The War of the Revolution'', where Tarleton is described as \"cold-hearted, vindictive, and utterly ruthless. He wrote his name in letters of blood all across the history of the war in the South.\"<ref>Rubin, 2010, p. 17</ref> Not until Anthony Scotti's 2002 book, ''Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton'', were Tarleton's actions fully reexamined. Scotti challenged the factual accounts of atrocities and stressed the \"propaganda value that such stories held for the Americans both during and after the war\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Scotti, Anthony, Jr.|title=Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton|location=Boise, MD|publisher=Heritage Books|date=July 2002|isbn=978-0788420993}}</ref> Scotti's book, however, did not come out until two years after ''The Patriot''. Screenwriters consulting American works to build the character Tavington based on Tarleton would have commonly found descriptions of him as barbaric and accounts of his name being used for recruiting and motivation during the Revolutionary War itself.<ref>Rubin, 2010, p. 21.</ref>\n\nWhereas Tavington is depicted as aristocratic but penniless, Tarleton came from a wealthy Liverpool merchant family. Tarleton did not die in battle or from impalement, as Tavington did in the film. Tarleton died on January 16, 1833, in [[Leintwardine]], [[Herefordshire]], England, at the age of 78, nearly 50 years after the war ended. He outlived Col. [[Francis Marion]] who died in 1795, by 38 years. Before his death,  Tarleton had achieved the military rank of [[General]], equal to that held by the overall British Commanders during the American Revolution, and became a [[baronet]] and a member of the British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].\n\n===Depiction of atrocities in the Revolutionary War===\n''The Patriot'' was criticized for misrepresenting atrocities during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], including the killing of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and wounded soldiers and burning a church filled with townsfolk. While atrocities occurred during the war, the most striking of the film's depictions of British atrocities\u2014the burning of a church full of unarmed colonial civilians\u2014had virtually no factual basis nor parallel in the American or European 18th century wars, with the exception of the [[Massacre at Lucs-sur-Boulogne]] ([[:fr:Massacre des Lucs-sur-Boulogne|fr]]) in 1794, which was a purely French affair with no connection to British troops nor the American Revolution. The ''[[New York Post]]'' film critic [[Jonathan Foreman (journalist)|Jonathan Foreman]] was one of several focusing on this distortion in the film and wrote the following in an article at [[Salon.com]]:\n\n<blockquote>The most disturbing thing about ''The Patriot'' is not just that German director [[Roland Emmerich]] (director of'' [[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]])'' and his screenwriter [[Robert Rodat]] (who was criticized for excluding the roles played by British and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops in the [[Normandy landings]] from his script for ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'') depicted British troops as committing savage atrocities, but that those atrocities bear such a close resemblance to [[war crime]]s carried out by German troops\u2014particularly the [[SS]] in World War II. It's hard not to wonder if the filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda... They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|Oradour]]\u2014and implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history's worst monsters... So it's no wonder that the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British press]] sees this film as a kind of [[blood libel]] against the British people.<ref>Jonathan Foreman, [http://www.salon.com/2000/07/03/patriot_3/ 'The Nazis, er, the Redcoats are coming!'], Salon.com, July 3, 2000.

It was a very bitter war, a total war, and that is something that I am afraid has been lost to history....[T]he presence of the Loyalists (colonists who did not want to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Fenton |first=Ben |title=Truth is first casualty in Hollywood's war |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=June 19, 2000 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1343851/Truth-is-first-casualty-in-Hollywoods-war.html}}</ref> The historian Richard F.

The film mainly takes place in rural [[Berkeley County, South Carolina]], and depicts the story of an American Colonist, nominally loyal to the British Crown, who is swept into the [[American Revolutionary War]] when his family is affected. Benjamin Martin is a composite figure who Rodat has stated is based on four factual figures from the American Revolutionary War: [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]], [[Francis Marion]], [[Daniel Morgan]], and [[Thomas Sumter]].\n\nThe film takes place during the events of the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War]]. It attracted controversy over its fictional portrayal of historical British figures and atrocities, especially with the infamous \"Burning church\" scene, of which there is no historical or written record. Critic Roger Ebert wrote \"None of it has much to do with the historical reality of the Revolutionary War\".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-patriot-2000|title=The Patriot|first=Roger|last=Ebert|accessdate=May 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1775, Captain Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the [[French and Indian War]] and a [[widower]] with seven children, is called to [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] to vote in the [[South Carolina]] [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] on a levy supporting the [[Continental Army]]. Fearing war against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continentals.\n \nTwo years later, Charleston [[Siege of Charleston|falls]] to the [[British Army|British]] and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British [[Dragoon]]s, led by Colonel William Tavington, arrive, capture Gabriel with the intention of hanging him as a spy, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house [[arson|burned]], and wounded [[Regular Army (United States)|Americans]] executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons [[rifle]]s, and they ambush the British unit escorting the captive Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his [[tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \"Ghost\". Gabriel decides to rejoin the Continentals and Benjamin soon follows, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General [[Horatio Gates]] [[Battle of Camden|engaging]] the British Army. Benjamin recognizes the foolishness of the action, having served in the British Army; sure enough, the Continentals are decisively routed.\n\nBenjamin meets his former commanding officer, Colonel Harry Burwell, who makes him [[colonel]] of the local colonial [[militia (United States)|militia]] due to his combat experience and also places Gabriel under Benjamin's command. Benjamin is tasked with keeping [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]]'s regiments pinned south through [[guerrilla warfare]]. French Major Jean Villeneuve helps train the militia and promises more French aid.\n\nGabriel asks why Villeneuve and others often mention Benjamin's role in something called \"Fort Wilderness.\" Benjamin, having been hesitant to answer the question up to now, finally tells his son the story. Benjamin had been fighting in the British Army in the [[French and Indian War|previous war]] when he and several other soldiers discovered a French atrocity at a fort that Benjamin and his comrades had been trying to reinforce. In a teutonic rage, Benjamin and his comrades caught up with the French at Fort Wilderness, where Benjamin and his unit literally cut the defending French soldiers apart slowly. Benjamin reveals that he has been haunted by guilt ever since.\n\nBenjamin's militia harasses British supply lines, even capturing some of Cornwallis' personal effects and his two Great Danes, and burn half the bridges and ferries leading to Charleston. Lord Cornwallis blames Tavington for creating this reaction with his brutal tactics. However, irritated at the lack of progress, and insulted by Benjamin's [[ruse of war|clever ploy]] to free some of the captured militia, Cornwallis reluctantly allows Tavington to stop Benjamin by any means necessary.\n\nWith the reluctant aid of the Loyalist Captain Wilkins, Tavington learns the identities of some militia members and attacks their families and burns their homes. Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned to live in a [[Gullah]] settlement with former black slaves. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed Anne. Tavington's [[brigade]] rides into the town that supplies the militia. He assembles all the townspeople, including Anne, into the church, promising freedom in exchange for the whereabouts of the rebels. After their location is given, he has the doors barricaded, and orders the church to be burned, killing everyone inside. When they discover the tragedy, Gabriel and several other soldiers race to attack Tavington's encampment. In the ensuing battle, Gabriel shoots Tavington, but Tavington mortally wounds Gabriel before fleeing. Benjamin arrives soon thereafter, only to have another of his sons die in his arms.\n\nBenjamin mourns and wavers in his commitment to continue fighting, but is resolved when reminded of his son's dedication to the cause by finding an American flag he repaired. Martin's militia, along with a larger Continental Army regiment, confronts Cornwallis' regiment in a [[decisive victory|decisive battle]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. The British appear to have the upper hand until Benjamin rallies the troops forward against their lines and Tavington rushes to attack him. The two fight and Tavington attains the upper hand, delivering several wounds to Benjamin. Benjamin slumps to his knees, and Tavington prepares to deliver the [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]. At the last second, Benjamin dodges the attack and stabs Tavington, avenging his sons' deaths. The battle is a Continental victory, and Cornwallis sounds the retreat.\n\nAfter many retreats, Cornwallis is [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia]] where he surrenders to the surrounding Continental Army and the long-awaited French naval force. After the conflict ends, Benjamin returns with his family, with Charlotte carrying their new baby, and discovers his militia soldiers rebuilding his homestead in their old town road.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Captain/Colonel Benjamin Martin<br>A veteran of the [[French and Indian War]], the hero of the fictional Fort Wilderness, and widowed father of seven children, Benjamin does what he can to avoid fighting in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] knowing the implications surrounding it. In addition, he does not want to reveal to his family what he is capable of in violence. When his oldest son, Gabriel, joins up, and his second born son, Thomas, is killed, he takes it upon himself to join and fight with the colonial [[militia]]. He is nicknamed \"The Ghost\" by the British. He is based on a composite of historical characters which include [[Thomas Sumter]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Andrew Pickens (congressman)|Andrew Pickens]], and [[Francis Marion]].<ref name=DVD />\n* [[Joely Richardson]] as Charlotte Selton<br>Benjamin's sister-in-law and later wife. She is the owner of a plantation that is burned down by the British. She looks after Benjamin's children while he is fighting; eventually they have a child together.\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as Corporal Gabriel Martin<br>Benjamin's eldest child, and the husband of Anne Howard. He decides to join up with the [[Continental Army]] against his father's wishes. He is killed during an attack on the [[British Legion (American Revolution)|Green Dragoons]]' camp, while seeking revenge against Colonel Tavington for his wife's murder.\n* [[Lisa Brenner]] as Anne Howard<br>Gabriel's childhood friend and love interest, whom he marries later in the film. She is killed in the town church along with the rest of the town on Tavington's orders.\n* [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] as Thomas Martin<br>Benjamin's second son, he, like Gabriel, is anxious to fight in the war, but Benjamin says he has to wait because of his age. He is shot and killed by Tavington when he protests against Gabriel's arrest. Tavington rebukes him as a \"stupid boy\" for his actions afterward. Benjamin takes Thomas's set of toy tin soldiers and, over the course of the film, melts them down into bullets for his pistol.\n* [[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]] as Nathan Martin<br>Third son, he and Samuel help around the farm. When Gabriel is taken prisoner and Thomas is killed, he and Samuel help their father on a rescue mission.\n* [[Bryan Chafin]] as Samuel Martin<br>Fourth son, he is usually seen helping Nathan around the farm. When Gabriel is taken prisoner and Thomas is killed, he helps his father, Benjamin, rescue Gabriel by killing several British soldiers. For a short while, he becomes scared of his father after he witnesses him brutally killing and mutilating a British soldier with a tomahawk.\n* [[Mika Boorem]] as Margaret Martin<br>Benjamin's older daughter, she is often seen taking care of her younger siblings.\n* [[Logan Lerman]] as William Martin, Benjamin's fifth and youngest son.\n* [[Skye McCole Bartusiak]] as Susan Martin<br>The youngest of Benjamin's seven children, initially she will not speak, which may be a post-traumatic reaction to the death of their mother Elizabeth. Her feelings towards her father change radically as the film progresses, and after Benjamin leaves from the furlough to rejoin his militia, in an extremely emotional scene, she seemingly forgives him and tells him she'll say anything he wants to make him stay, to which Benjamin can only promise to return.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as Colonel William Tavington<br>Colonel of the Green [[Dragoons]], he\u2019s portrayed as a brutal and psychopathic commander. Long ago, his late father wasted away the family esteem and William\u2019s inheritance. He suggests to Cornwallis that he be allowed to acquire land in the [[Ohio]] territory as payment after the war since the brutality his commander wants from him sacrifices his social standing in English society. He is nicknamed \"The Butcher\" by the people. The character is based on [[Banastre Tarleton]].<ref name=DVD />\n* [[Chris Cooper]] as Colonel/General Harry Burwell<br>One of Benjamin's commanding officers in the [[French and Indian War]] and a colonel of the [[Continental Army]]. He fought in the 1775 [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. When his wife gives birth to their firstborn son, they name him after Benjamin's late eldest son, Gabriel. He is based on [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Lee III|Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee]].\n* [[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]] as Major Jean Villeneuve<br>A French officer who trains Martin's militia, he holds a grudge against Martin for his part in the [[French and Indian War]], but they become close friends by the war's end. He explains in the film that he watched his wife and two daughters, 12-year-old Violette and 10-year-old Pauline, being burned in the ship that carried them by the British, which explains his hatred for them. He serves as Martin's [[second-in-command]].\n* [[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]] as Reverend Oliver<br>A minister of Pembroke who volunteers to fight with the militia. He also tries to give spiritual advice to his fellow soldiers. He is one of the eighteen captured men taken to [[Fort Carolina]] and released later on by Benjamin. He helps Gabriel in killing Captain Bordon, but is mortally shot by Tavington. Before dying, he courageously tosses his musket to Gabriel so that he may finish off Tavington.\n* [[Tom Wilkinson]] as Lieutenant General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Earl Cornwallis]] <br>A general of the British army. While pompous and arrogant, he is disgusted by Tavington's savage and ungentlemanly tactics. Cornwallis is a skilled commander, with Martin calling him a genius, but he sees militia soldiers as nothing more than \"[[farmer]]s with [[pitchfork]]s\" and is easily duped by Martin in a key scene. His two Great Danes, Jupiter and Mars, are a gift from King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].\n* [[Donal Logue]] as Dan Scott<br>One of Benjamin's men. He is a racist and bullies the former slave Occam, but grows to befriend him, especially when saved by him while wounded. In the last part of the film, they stand side by side in the final battle and the raising of Martin's new house.\n* [[Peter Woodward]] as Brigadier General [[Charles O'Hara]] <br>Cornwallis' second-in-command. Like Cornwallis, he does not share Tavington's views on war.\n*[[Leon Rippy]] as John Billings<br>One of Benjamin's neighbors and oldest friends who joins the militia. He is one of the 18 captured men taken to Fort Carolina and later released by Benjamin. Afterward, John helps Charlotte Selton and Benjamin's children escape the burning of the Selton plantation. He commits [[suicide]], in full view of his comrades, after finding that Tavington's men have killed his wife Elizabeth and son Thomas. Afterward, Benjamin gives the militia a furlough.\n*[[Adam Baldwin]] as Captain James Wilkins<br>An officer in the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist Colonial]] militia recruited into the Green Dragoons by Captain Bordon. He knows Benjamin Martin well, and is called upon by Tavington to divulge such information when required. Earlier on, at the South Carolina Assembly in Charleston, he is one of the twelve out of forty to vote against a levy for the Continental Army. He fights alongside Tavington, and also shares these brutal views on how \"all those who stand against England deserve to die a traitor's death\". When he is forced to burn the church at Pembroke, with town residents inside by Tavington, only then does he regret his own words and realize what kind of man his commanding officer really is. He is last seen fighting alongside the British in the final battle of the movie; his fate is not shown.\n*[[Jamieson Price|Jamieson K. Price]] as Captain Bordon<br>Tavington's second-in-command of the Green Dragoons. He is killed by Gabriel in the raid against the Dragoons.\n*[[Jay Arlen Jones]] as Occam<br>An African slave who is sent to fight in his master's place. He is taunted and bullied by the other soldiers in the militia, but is treated as an equal by Benjamin, Gabriel, Jean, and later on by Dan Scott and the others. He gives out information of the captured eighteen militia men at Fort Carolina while escaping Tavington's trap. After serving a year in the Continental Army, he becomes a free man, but nonetheless still serves with the militia until the end of the war, and later aids, alongside his former adversary Dan Scott, in raising a new house for Martin. (See also: [[African Americans in the Revolutionary War]])\n*[[Joey D. Vieira]] as Peter Howard<br>Anne Howard's father, who lost his left leg and most of his hearing while fighting the French and Indian War. He likens British taxation policies to the British taking his other leg.\n*[[Zach Hanner]] as British [[field officer]].\n*[[Terry Layman]] as General [[George Washington]].\n*[[Andrew Stahl|Andy Stahl]] as General [[Nathanael Greene]].\n*[[Grahame Wood]] as a friendly British Lieutenant at Martin's farm who interacts with both Benjamin Martin and Colonel Tavington. He sees Tavington's orders to kill the Colonial wounded and other prisoners revolting, but remains silent and follows through with the orders without question. He dies shortly afterwards in Martin's skirmish to rescue Gabriel.\n\n==Production==\n===Script===\nScreenwriter [[Robert Rodat]] wrote seventeen drafts of the script before there was an acceptable one. In an early version, Anne is pregnant with Gabriel's child when she dies in the burning church. Rodat wrote the script with Gibson in mind for Benjamin Martin, and gave the Martin character six children to signal this preference to studio executives. After the birth of Gibson's seventh child, the script was changed so that Martin had seven children. Like the character [[William Wallace]], which Gibson portrayed in ''[[Braveheart (film)|Braveheart]]'' five years earlier, Martin is a man seeking to live his life in peace until revenge drives him to lead a cause against a national enemy after the life of an innocent family member is taken.\n\n===Casting===\n[[Joshua Jackson]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], and [[Brad Renfro]] were considered to play Gabriel Martin. The producers and director narrowed their choices for this role to [[Ryan Phillippe]] and [[Heath Ledger]], with the latter chosen because the director thought he possessed \"exuberant youth\".\n\n===Filming===\nThe film's German director Emmerich said \"these were characters I could relate to, and they were engaged in a conflict that had a significant outcome\u2014the creation of the first modern democratic government.\"<ref name=DVD />\n\nThe film was shot entirely on location in South Carolina, including [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Rock Hill, South Carolina|Rock Hill]]\u2014for many of the battle scenes, and [[Lowrys, South Carolina|Lowrys]]\u2014for the farm of Benjamin Martin, as well as nearby [[Fort Lawn, South Carolina|Fort Lawn]].<ref name=TNT>{{cite web|title=''The Patriot'' on TNT|publisher=[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT (TV network)]]|year=2009|url=http://www.tnt.tv/movies/movietitle/?oid=5386|accessdate=March 28, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319003955/http://www.tnt.tv/movies/movietitle/?oid=5386|archivedate=March 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other scenes were filmed at [[Mansfield Plantation]], an antebellum rice plantation in [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Middleton Place]] in Charleston, South Carolina, at the Cistern Yard on the campus of [[College of Charleston]], and [[Hightower Hall]] and Homestead House at [[Brattonsville Historic District|Brattonsville]], South Carolina, along with the grounds of the Brattonsville Plantation in [[McConnells, South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Movies Filmed in South Carolina \u2013 ''The Patriot''|work=South Carolina Information Highway|publisher=SCIway.net|url=http://www.sciway.net/movies/sc-movie-patriot.html|year=2009|accessdate=March 28, 2009}}</ref> Producer Mark Gordon said the production team \"tried their best to be as authentic as possible\" because \"the backdrop was serious history,\" giving attention to details in period dress.<ref name=DVD>{{cite video|date=2000 |title=The Patriot|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Columbia Pictures]]|quote=Special features \u2013 True Patriots featurette|isbn=0-7678-5846-8}}</ref> Producer Dean Devlin and the film's costume designers examined actual Revolutionary War uniforms at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] prior to shooting.<ref name=DVD />\n\n===Music===\n{{main|The Patriot (soundtrack)}}\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] for ''The Patriot'' was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Filmtracks: The Patriot (John Williams) |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/patriot.html |publisher=Filmtracks.com |accessdate=November 28, 2012 |date=June 22, 2008}}</ref> [[David Arnold]], who composed the scores to Emmerich's ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', created a demo for ''The Patriot'' that was ultimately rejected.

Ben Fenton, commenting in the [[The Daily Telegraph|''Daily Telegraph'']], wrote: \n\n<blockquote>There is no evidence that Tarleton, called 'Bloody Ban' or 'The Butcher' in rebel pamphlets, ever broke the [[Laws of war|rules of war]] and certainly did not ever shoot a child in cold blood.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fenton|first=Ben|title=Truth is first casualty in Hollywood's war|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=June 19, 2000|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1343851/Truth-is-first-casualty-in-Hollywoods-war.html |accessdate=April 17, 2017 |location=London}}</ref></blockquote> \n\nAlthough Tarleton gained the reputation among Americans as a butcher for his involvement in the [[Battle of Waxhaws]] in South Carolina, he was a hero in Liverpool, England. [[Liverpool City Council]], led by [[Mayor]] Edwin Clein, called for a public apology for what they viewed as the film's \"[[character assassination]]\" of Tarleton.<ref>{{cite news|title=Patriotic Liverpool up in arms over Gibson's blockbuster|work=Guardian Unlimited |date=June 30, 2000 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,4029,338280,00.html |accessdate=October 31, 2007 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nWhat happened during the Battle of The Waxhaws, known to the Americans as the Buford Massacre or as the Waxhaw massacre, is the subject of debate. According to an American field surgeon named Robert Brownfield who witnessed the events, the Continental Army Col. Buford raised a [[white flag]] of surrender, \"expecting the usual treatment sanctioned by civilized warfare\". While Buford was calling for quarter, Tarleton's horse was struck by a musket ball and fell. This gave the Loyalist cavalrymen the impression that the Continentals had shot at their commander while asking for mercy. Enraged, the Loyalist troops charged at the Virginians. According to Brownfield, the Loyalists attacked, carrying out \"indiscriminate carnage never surpassed by the most ruthless atrocities of the most barbarous savages\".\n\nIn Tarleton's own account, he stated that his horse had been shot from under him during the initial charge in which he was knocked out for several minutes and that his men, thinking him dead, engaged in \"a vindictive asperity not easily restrained\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/americanrevolution/p/battle-of-waxhaws.htm |title=American Revolution: Battle of Waxhaws |first1=Kennedy |last1=Hickman |publisher=About.com |accessdate=December 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\nTarleton's role in the Revolutionary War in the Carolinas is examined by Ben Rubin who shows that historically, while the actual events of the Battle of the Waxhaws were presented differently according to which side was recounting them, the story of Tarleton's atrocities at Waxhaws and on other occasions became a rallying cry, particularly at the [[Battle of King's Mountain]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Ben|title=The Rhetoric of Revenge: Atrocity and Identity in Revolutionary Carolinas|journal=Journal of Backcountry Studies|volume=5 |issue=2 |year=2010|url=http://libjournal.uncg.edu/ojs/index.php/jbc/article/viewFile/102/84|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> The tales of Tarleton's atrocities were a part of standard U.S. accounts of the war and were described by Washington Irving and by Christopher Ward in his 1952 history, ''The War of the Revolution'', where Tarleton is described as \"cold-hearted, vindictive, and utterly ruthless. He wrote his name in letters of blood all across the history of the war in the South.\"<ref>Rubin, 2010, p. 17</ref> Not until Anthony Scotti's 2002 book, ''Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton'', were Tarleton's actions fully reexamined. Scotti challenged the factual accounts of atrocities and stressed the \"propaganda value that such stories held for the Americans both during and after the war\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Scotti, Anthony, Jr.|title=Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton|location=Boise, MD|publisher=Heritage Books|date=July 2002|isbn=978-0788420993}}</ref> Scotti's book, however, did not come out until two years after ''The Patriot''. Screenwriters consulting American works to build the character Tavington based on Tarleton would have commonly found descriptions of him as barbaric and accounts of his name being used for recruiting and motivation during the Revolutionary War itself.<ref>Rubin, 2010, p. 21.</ref>\n\nWhereas Tavington is depicted as aristocratic but penniless, Tarleton came from a wealthy Liverpool merchant family. Tarleton did not die in battle or from impalement, as Tavington did in the film. Tarleton died on January 16, 1833, in [[Leintwardine]], [[Herefordshire]], England, at the age of 78, nearly 50 years after the war ended. He outlived Col. [[Francis Marion]] who died in 1795, by 38 years. Before his death,  Tarleton had achieved the military rank of [[General]], equal to that held by the overall British Commanders during the American Revolution, and became a [[baronet]] and a member of the British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].\n\n===Depiction of atrocities in the Revolutionary War===\n''The Patriot'' was criticized for misrepresenting atrocities during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], including the killing of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and wounded soldiers and burning a church filled with townsfolk. While atrocities occurred during the war, the most striking of the film's depictions of British atrocities\u2014the burning of a church full of unarmed colonial civilians\u2014had virtually no factual basis nor parallel in the American or European 18th century wars, with the exception of the [[Massacre at Lucs-sur-Boulogne]] ([[:fr:Massacre des Lucs-sur-Boulogne|fr]]) in 1794, which was a purely French affair with no connection to British troops nor the American Revolution. The ''[[New York Post]]'' film critic [[Jonathan Foreman (journalist)|Jonathan Foreman]] was one of several focusing on this distortion in the film and wrote the following in an article at [[Salon.com]]:\n\n<blockquote>The most disturbing thing about ''The Patriot'' is not just that German director [[Roland Emmerich]] (director of'' [[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]])'' and his screenwriter [[Robert Rodat]] (who was criticized for excluding the roles played by British and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops in the [[Normandy landings]] from his script for ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'') depicted British troops as committing savage atrocities, but that those atrocities bear such a close resemblance to [[war crime]]s carried out by German troops\u2014particularly the [[SS]] in World War II. It's hard not to wonder if the filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda... They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|Oradour]]\u2014and implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history's worst monsters... So it's no wonder that the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British press]] sees this film as a kind of [[blood libel]] against the British people.<ref>Jonathan Foreman, [http://www.salon.com/2000/07/03/patriot_3/ 'The Nazis, er, the Redcoats are coming!'], Salon.com, July 3, 2000.

It was a very bitter war, a total war, and that is something that I am afraid has been lost to history....[T]he presence of the Loyalists (colonists who did not want to join the fight for independence from Britain) meant that the War of Independence was a conflict of complex loyalties.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Fenton |first=Ben |title=Truth is first casualty in Hollywood's war |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=June 19, 2000 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1343851/Truth-is-first-casualty-in-Hollywoods-war.html}}</ref> The historian Richard F.

According to a local rhyme, the demise of ''Venta Icenorum'' led to the development of Norwich: \"Caistor was a city when Norwich was none, Norwich was built of Caistor stone.\"{{sfn |Morley |2006}}\n\n===Early English and Norman conquest===\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral, spire and south transept.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Cathedral]] is one of the great Norman buildings of England.]]\nThere are two suggested models of development for Norwich. It is possible that three separate early Anglo-Saxon settlements, one north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as they grew or that one Anglo-Saxon settlement, north of the river, emerged in the mid-7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in East Anglia in 1004 when it was raided and burnt by [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Swein Forkbeard]] the [[Viking]] king of Denmark. [[Mercia]]n coins and shards of pottery from the [[Rhineland]] dating from the 8th century suggest that long-distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924 and 939, Norwich became fully established as a town, with its own mint. The word ''Norvic'' appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, in the reign of [[Athelstan|King Athelstan]]. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40 to 50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] district near the north end of present-day King Street. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], the city was one of the largest in England. The [[Domesday Book]] states that it had approximately 25 churches and a population of between 5,000 and 10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Saxon market place and the later [[Norwich Cathedral|Norman cathedral]]. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the River Wensum being a convenient export route to the [[River Yare]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], which served as the [[Port of Norwich|port for Norwich]]. [[Quern stone]]s and other artefacts from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre. These date from the 11th century onwards.\n\n[[File:Norwich Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Castle]]'s 12th-century keep]]\n[[Norwich Castle]] was founded soon after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{PastScape |mnumber=132268 |mname=Norwich Castle |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Domesday Book]] records that 98 Saxon homes were demolished to make way for the castle.{{sfn |Harfield |1991 |pp=373, 384}} The [[Normans]] established a new focus of settlement around the Castle and the area to the west of it: this became known as the \"New\" or \"French\" borough, centred on the Normans' own market place, which survives today as Norwich Market. In 1096, [[Herbert de Losinga]], [[Bishop of Thetford]], began construction of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. The chief building material for the Cathedral was limestone, imported from Caen in Normandy. To transport the building stone to the site, a canal was cut from the river (from the site of present-day Pulls Ferry) up to the east wall. Herbert de Losinga then moved his [[Episcopal see|See]] there, to what became the cathedral church for the [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]]. The Bishop of Norwich still signs himself ''Norvic''. Norwich received a [[royal charter]] from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1158, and another from [[Richard I of England|Richard ''the Lionheart'']] in 1194. After a riot in the city in 1274, Norwich has the distinction of being the only complete English city to be excommunicated by the Pope.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe first recorded presence of [[Jews]] in Norwich is 1134.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130806235625/http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 August 2013 |title=Jews in Norwich |publisher=Heritagecity.org |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> In 1144, the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy ([[William of Norwich]]) was found dead with stab wounds.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\"/> William acquired the status of martyr and was subsequently [[canonization|canonised]].

In February 1190, all the Jews of Norwich were massacred except for a few who found refuge in the castle. At the site of a medieval well, the bones of 17 individuals, including 11 children, were found in 2004 by workers preparing the ground for construction of a Norwich shopping centre. The remains were determined by [[forensic science|forensic scientists]] to be most probably the remains of such murdered Jews, and a [[Genetic genealogy|DNA]] expert determined that the victims were all related, so that they probably came from one [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] family.{{sfn |Jewish Telegraphic Agency |2011}} The study of the remains featured in an episode of the [[BBC Television|BBC television]] documentary series ''[[History Cold Case]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Bodies in the Well |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |series=History Cold Case |network=[[BBC HD]] |airdate=28 June 2011 |seriesno=2 |number=3 |access-date=25 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816170740/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |archivedate=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ethelbert Gate from Tombland, Norwich, UK.jpg|thumb|St Ethelbert's Gate at Tombland was built as penance for riots which occurred in the 1270s.]]\nIn 1216, the castle fell to Louis, Dauphin of France and Hildebrand's Hospital was founded, followed ten years later by the [[Franciscan]] Friary and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary. The Great Hospital dates from 1249 and the College of St Mary in the Field from 1250. In 1256, Whitefriars was founded. In 1266 the city was sacked by the \"Disinherited\". It has the distinction of being the only English city ever to be excommunicated, following a riot between citizens and monks in 1274.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}} As a penance, St Ethelbert's Gate, one of the entrances to the cathedral priory, was constructed by Norwich citizens. In 1278 the Cathedral received final consecration. In 1290 the city flooded. Austin Friary was founded in that year.\n\nThe engine of trade was [[wool]] from Norfolk's [[sheepwalk]]s. Wool made England rich, and the [[staple right|staple port]] of Norwich \"in her state doth stand With towns of high'st regard the fourth of all the land\", as [[Michael Drayton]] noted in ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' (1612). The wealth generated by the [[wool#History|wool trade]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]] financed the construction of many fine churches, so that Norwich still has more medieval churches than any other city in Western Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Throughout this period Norwich established wide-ranging trading links with other parts of Europe, its markets stretching from [[Scandinavia]] to Spain and the city housing a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] warehouse. To organise and control its exports to the [[Low Countries]], Great Yarmouth, as the port for Norwich, was designated one of the staple ports under the terms of the 1353 [[Statute of the Staple]].\n\nFrom 1280 to 1340 the [[defensive wall|city walls]] were built. At around {{convert|2 + 1/2|mi|km|}}, these walls, along with the river, enclosed a larger area than that of the [[City of London]]. However, when the city walls were constructed it was made illegal to build outside them, inhibiting expansion of the city. Around this time, the city was made a [[county corporate]] and became the seat of one of the most densely populated and prosperous [[ancient counties of England|counties]] of England. Part of these walls remain standing today.\n\n===Early modern period (1485\u20131640)===\nHand-in-hand with the wool industry, this key religious centre experienced a Reformation significantly different to other parts of England. The magistracy in Tudor Norwich unusually found ways of managing religious discord whilst maintaining civic harmony.{{sfn |McClendon |1999}}\n\n[[File:John Crome 002.jpg|thumb|''Mousehold Heath, Norwich'' by Norfolk-based artist [[John Crome]]]]The summer of 1549 saw an unprecedented rebellion in Norfolk. Unlike popular challenges elsewhere in the Tudor period, it appears to have been [[Protestant]] in nature. For several weeks, rebels led by [[Robert Kett]] camped outside Norwich on [[Mousehold Heath]] and took control of the city on 29 July 1549 with the support of many of its poorer inhabitants. [[Kett's Rebellion]] was particularly in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals and the general abuses of power by the nobility. The uprising ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army.

In the case of Norwich, this process was underscored later by the arrival of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] \"[[Elizabethan Strangers|Strangers]]\" fleeing persecution from the Catholics and eventually numbering as many as one-third of the city's population.{{sfn |Houlbroke |McClendon |2004 |p=257}} Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants from the Westkwartier (\"Western Quarter\"), a region in the [[Southern Netherlands]] where the first [[Calvinist]] fires of the [[Dutch Revolt]] had spread. Inhabitants of [[Ypres]], in particular, chose Norwich above other destinations.{{sfn |Fagel |2003 |p=52}} Perhaps in response to Kett, Norwich became the first provincial city to initiate compulsory payments for a civic scheme of poor relief, which it has been claimed led to its wider introduction, forming the basis of the later Elizabethan Poor Law of 1597\u20131598.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |pp=50\u201356}}\n\nNorwich has traditionally been the home of various minorities, notably French [[Huguenot]] and Belgian [[Walloons|Walloon]] communities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The great \"stranger\" immigration of 1567 brought a substantial Flemish and Walloon community of Protestant [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s to Norwich, where they are said to have been made welcome.{{sfn |Ketton-Cremer |1957}} The merchant's house which was their earliest base in the city \u2014 now a museum \u2014 is still known as [[Strangers' Hall]]. It seems that the strangers integrated into the local community without much animosity, at least among the business fraternity, who had the most to gain from their skills. Their arrival in Norwich boosted trade with mainland Europe and fostered a movement toward religious reform and radical politics in the city. By contrast, after being persecuted by the Anglican church for his [[Puritan]] beliefs, [[Michael Metcalf (puritan)|Michael Metcalf]], a 17th-century Norwich weaver, fled the city and settled in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=A New England Town |last=Lockridge |first=Kenneth |year=1985 |publisher=W.

Along with their advanced techniques in textile working, they brought pet canaries which they began to breed locally; eventually becoming, in the 20th century, a mascot of the city and the emblem of its football club, [[Norwich City F.C.]], whose nickname is \"The Canaries\". \n\nPrinting was introduced to the city in 1567 by Anthony de Solempne, one of the strangers, but it did not take root and had died out by about 1572.{{sfn |Stoker |1981}}\n\n===Civil War to Victorian era===\nAcross the Eastern Counties, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s powerful [[Eastern Association]] was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been a large element of Royalist sympathy within Norwich, which seems to have experienced a continuity of its two-sided political tradition throughout the period. Bishop [[Matthew Wren]] was a forceful supporter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Nonetheless, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] recruitment took hold. The strong Royalist party was stifled by a lack of commitment from the aldermen and isolation from Royalist-held regions.{{sfn |Hopper |2004}} Serious inter-factional disturbances culminated in \"The Great Blow\" of 1648 when Parliamentary forces tried to quell a Royalist riot. The latter's gunpowder was set off by accident in the city centre, causing mayhem. According to Hopper<ref>{{harvnb |Hopper |2004}},</ref> the explosion \"ranks among the largest of the century\". Stoutly defended though East Anglia was by the Parliamentary army, there are said to have been pubs in Norwich where the king's health was still drunk and the name of the Protector sung to ribald verse.\n\nAt the cost of some discomfort to the Mayor, the moderate [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] was targeted because of his position as Bishop of Norwich.\n\nNorwich was marked in the period after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of 1660 and the ensuing century by a golden age of its cloth industry, comparable only to those in the [[West Country]] and Yorkshire.{{sfn |Wilson |2004a}} But unlike other cloth-manufacturing regions, Norwich weaving brought greater urbanisation, mainly concentrated in the surrounds of the city itself, creating an urban society, with features such as leisure time, alehouses and other public forums of debate and argument.{{sfn |Wilson |2004b}}\n\n[[File:Original Norfolk and Norwich Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 84361.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1771, the [[Norfolk and Norwich Hospital]] cared for the city's poor and sick. It closed in 2003 after services were moved to the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]].]]\nWriting of the early 18th century, Pound describes the city's rich cultural life, the winter theatre season, the festivities accompanying the summer assizes, and other popular entertainments. Norwich was the wealthiest town in England, with a sophisticated system of [[poor relief]], and a large influx of foreign refugees.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |p=61}} Despite severe outbreaks of plague, the city had a population of almost 30,000. This made Norwich unique in England, although there were some 50 cities of similar size in Europe. In some, like Lyon and [[Dresden]], this was, as in the case of Norwich, linked to an important proto-industry, such as textiles or china pottery, in some, such as Vienna, Madrid and Dublin, to the city's status as an administrative capital, and in some such as Antwerp, Marseilles and Cologne to a position on an important maritime or river trade route.{{efn|1=For table of city sizes see {{harvtxt |Corfield |2004 |p=143}}}}\n\nNorwich in the late 17th century was riven politically. Churchman [[Humphrey Prideaux]] described \"two factions, [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory]], and both contend for their way with the utmost violence.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004}} Nor did the city accept the outcome of the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse \"with a glass of beer in hand, went down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [sic] well and settled on his head.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174 |quote= \"Never was a city in the miserable kingdom so wretchedly divided as this,\" said the ''London Post''}}\n\nIn 1716, at a play at the ''New Inn'', the Pretender was cheered and the audience booed and hissed every time King George's name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king were said to be \"hiss'd at and curst as they go in the streets,\" and in 1731 \"a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government.\"{{efn |1=Reports quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}}} But the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city's popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city's Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in, and the vestry of [[St Peter Mancroft]] resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, it was the end of the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the [[Battle of Culloden]].{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\nThe events of this period illustrate how Norwich had a strong tradition of popular protest favouring Church and Stuarts and attached to the street and alehouse. Knights tells how in 1716 the mayoral election had ended in a riot, with both sides throwing \"brick-ends and great paving stones\" at each other.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} A renowned Jacobite watering-hole, the ''Blue Bell Inn'' (nowadays ''The Bell Hotel''), owned in the early 18th century by the high-church Helwys family, became the central rendezvous of the Norwich Revolution Society in the 1790s.{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=38}}\n\nBritain's first provincial newspaper, the ''[[Norwich Post]]'', appeared in 1701. By 1726 there were rival Whig and Tory presses, and as early as mid-century, three-quarters of the males in some parishes were literate.{{efn |1=Quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=181\u2013182}}}} The Norwich municipal library claims an excellent collection of these newspapers, also a folio collection of scrapbooks on 18th-century Norwich politics, which Knights says are \"valuable and important\". Norwich alehouses had 281 clubs and societies meeting in them in 1701, and at least 138 more were formed before 1758.

The open and contestable structure of local government, the press, the clubs and societies, and dissent all ensured that politics overlapped with communities bound by economics, religion, ideology and print in a world in which public opinion could not be ignored.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\n[[File:OctagonChapel.JPG|thumb|left|The Octagon Chapel]]\nAmid this metropolitan culture, the city burghers had built a sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who had the right to trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} This was notoriously the age of [[rotten borough|\"rotten\"]] and [[pocket borough|\"pocket\"]] boroughs, and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. \"Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals to make use of the electoral process.\"{{sfn |Thompson |1968 |p=513}} \"Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed,\" says {{harvnb |Jewson |1975}}, describing other towns under the control of a single [[fief]]dom.

It contained one, so far unmentioned aspect: [[Harriet Martineau]] wrote of the city's ''literati'' of the period, including such people as [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]], one of England's first scholars of German. The city \"boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself ''The Athens of England''.\"{{sfn |Martineau |1869}}\n\n[[File:St Peter Mancroft.jpg|thumb|[[St Peter Mancroft]]]]\nDespite Norwich's hitherto industrial prosperity, the wool trade was experiencing intense competition by the 1790s, from Yorkshire woollens and increasingly from Lancashire cottons. The effects were aggravated by the loss of continental markets after Britain went to war with France in 1793.{{efn |1={{harvnb |Hayes |1958}} Quote: \"a major city manufacturer, and government supporter, Robert Harvey Jr as writing on 12 March 1793: 'The consequences of this just and inevitable war visit this poor city severely and suspend the operations of the Dutch, German and Italian trade and the only lingering employment in the manufactory is the completion of a few Russian orders, and the last China [[camlet|cambletts]] which I hope will find encouragement in the new East India Charter. This languid trade has doubled our poor rate and a voluntary subscription of above \u00a32,000 is found inadequate to the exigencies of the poor.\"}} The early 19th century saw de-industrialisation accompanied by bitter squabbles. The 1820s were marked by wage cuts and personal recrimination against owners. So amid the rich commercial and cultural heritage of its recent past, Norwich suffered in the 1790s from incipient decline exacerbated by a serious trade recession.\n\nAs early in the war as 1793, a major city manufacturer and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and doubling of the poor rate.{{efn |1=Quotations and facts from {{harvtxt |Wilson |2004b}}}} Like many of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints onto the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, where \"Citizen Stanhope\" spoke.{{efn|1=Lord Stanhope was a radical peer, seen by many at the time as a dangerous menace. He is said to have given his rabble-rousing speech in a Norwich public house in 1794.}} The gathering \"[roared its] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; \u2013 and if there was a people still in England, the event might turn out to be so.\" Hayes says that \"the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended.\"{{sfn |Hayes |1958 |pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nAt this period opposition to Pitt's government and their war came \u2013 in their case almost unanimously \u2013 from a circle of radical Dissenting intellectuals of interest in their own right They included the Rigby, Taylor, Aitkin, Barbold, and Alderson families \u2013 all Unitarians, and some of the Quaker Gurneys, one of whose girls, Elizabeth, was under her married name of Fry to be noted campaigner for prison reform. Their activities included visits to revolutionary France (before the execution of Louis XVI), the earliest British research into German literature, studies on medical science, petitioning for parliamentary reform, and publishing a highbrow literary magazine called \"The Cabinet\", in 1795. Their blend of politics, religion and social campaigning was suspicious to Pitt and Windham, causing Pitt to denounce Norwich as \"the Jacobin city\". Edmund Burke attacked John Gurney in print for sponsoring anti-war protests. Politics aside, it is safe to say that Norwich was the most active intellectual hotbed outside London in the 1790s, and did not retrieve comparable prominence until the University of East of Anglia arrived in the late 20th century.<ref>Sources: C.

In April that year, the Norwich Patriotic Society was founded, its manifesto declaring \"that the great end of civil society was general happiness; that every individual had a right to share in the government.\"{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=66}} In December the price of bread reached a new peak, and in May 1796, when William Windham was forced to seek re-election after his appointment as war secretary, he only just held his seat.{{efn |1=Before the 20th century it was the practice for a sitting member to seek re-election if appointed to ministerial office.}} Amid the disorder and violence so often in Norwich elections, it was only by the narrowest margin that the radical Bartlett Gurney (\"Peace and Gurney \u2013 No More War \u2013 No more Barley Bread\") failed to unseat him.{{sfn |Thompson |1994}}\n\nThough informed by issues of recent national importance, the bipartisan political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be divorced from local tradition. Two features stand out from a political continuum of three centuries. The first is a dichotomous power balance. From at least the time of the Reformation, Norwich was recorded as a \"two-party city\". In the mid-16th century, the weaving parishes fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor clothworkers. Indeed there seems to be a case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had steadily developed an infrastructure, evident in its many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with alehouse crowds ready to have \"a Minister's head brought to the block\", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy exerted themselves to conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground and reinforcing the well-mannered civic tradition of earlier periods.\n\n[[File:Surrey House on Surrey Street - geograph.org.uk - 22919.jpg|thumb|left|[[Surrey House]], historic headquarters of the Norwich Union insurance company]]\nIn 1797 [[Thomas Bignold]], a 36-year-old wine merchant and banker, founded the first [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Society]]. Some years earlier, when he moved from Kent to Norwich, Bignold had been unable to find anyone willing to insure him against the threat from highwaymen. With the entrepreneurial thought that nothing was impossible, and aware that in a city built largely of wood the threat of fire was uppermost in people's minds, Bignold formed the \"Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire\". The new business, which became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office, was a \"mutual\" enterprise. [[Aviva|Norwich Union]] was later to become the country's largest insurance giant.\n\nFrom earliest times Norwich was a textile centre. In the 1780s the manufacture of Norwich [[shawl]]s became an important industry<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192534/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm |date=24 March 2012}} \u2014 \"Norwich Shawls\"</ref> and remained so for nearly a hundred years. The shawls were a high-quality fashion product and rivalled those of other towns such as [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], which had entered shawl manufacturing in about 1805, some 20 or more years after Norwich. With changes in women's fashion in the later [[Victorian period]], the popularity of shawls declined and eventually manufacture ceased. Examples of Norwich shawls are now sought after by collectors of textiles.\n\nNorwich's geographical isolation was such that until 1845, when a railway link was established, it was often quicker to travel to [[Amsterdam]] by boat than to London. The railway was introduced to Norwich by [[Samuel Morton Peto|Morton Peto]], who also built a line to [[Great Yarmouth]]. From 1808 to 1814, Norwich had a station in the [[Semaphore line|shutter telegraph chain]] that connected the [[Admiralty]] in London to its naval ships in the port of [[Great Yarmouth]]. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of [[Britannia Barracks]] in 1897.<ref name=museum>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |title=Britannia Barracks |publisher=Royal Norfolk Regiment Museum |accessdate=9 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109225923/http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |archive-date=9 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Bethel Street drill hall, Norwich|Bethel Street]] and [[Cattle Market Street drill hall, Norwich|Cattle Market Street]] [[drill hall]]s were built around the same time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |title=Norwich |publisher=Drill halls project |accessdate=16 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813144606/http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Waterloo Park Norwich Herbaceous Border.JPG|thumb|Waterloo Park, one of six parks built during the 1930s to help alleviate unemployment in the city]]\nIn the early 20th century, Norwich still had several major manufacturing industries. Among them were the large-scale and bespoke manufacture of shoes (for example the [[Start-rite]] and Van Dal brands, Bowhill & Elliott and Cheney & Sons Ltd respectively), clothing, joinery (including the cabinet makers and furniture retailer [[Arthur Brett and Sons]], which continues in business in the 21st century), structural engineering, and aircraft design and manufacture. Notable employers included [[Boulton & Paul]], Barnards (ironfounders and inventors of machine-produced [[wire netting]]), and the electrical engineers Laurence Scott and Electromotors.\n\nNorwich also has a long association with chocolate making, mainly through the local firm of Caley's, which began as a manufacturer and bottler of mineral water and later diversified into chocolate and [[Christmas crackers]]. The Caley's cracker-manufacturing business was taken over by Tom Smith in 1953,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tomsmithcrackers.co.uk/ |title=Tom Smith Crackers |publisher=Tom Smith Crackers |accessdate=13 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827125125/http://www.tomsmithcrackers.co.uk/ |archive-date=27 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the Norwich factory in Salhouse Road closed in 1998. Caley's was acquired by Mackintosh in the 1930s, and merged with [[Rowntree's]] in 1969 to become Rowntree-Mackintosh. Finally it was bought by [[Nestl\u00e9]] and closed in 1996, with all operations moving to [[York]] after a Norwich association of 120 years.

The heaviest raids occurred on the nights of 27/28 and 29/30 April 1942; as part of the [[Baedeker raids]] (so-called because Baedeker's series of tourist guides to the [[British Isles]] were used to select propaganda-rich targets of cultural and historic significance rather than strategic importance). [[Lord Haw-Haw]] made reference to the imminent destruction of Norwich's new [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] (completed in 1938), although in the event it survived unscathed. Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, [[Colman's]] [[Wincarnis]] works, [[Norwich City railway station|City Station]], the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St Stephen's St and St Benedict's St, the site of Bond's [[department store]] (now [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]) and Curl's department store.\n\n229 citizens were killed in the two [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]] with 1000 others injured, and 340 by bombing throughout the war\u2014giving Norwich the highest air raid casualties in Eastern England.

The whole borough was demolished, which consisted of around 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 considered unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, four offices, 22 public houses and two schools.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |title=Returning to the lost \"village on the hill\" in old Norwich |last=James |first=Derek |work=Norwich Evening News |access-date=2018-08-30 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110811/http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |archive-date=30 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Communities were moved to high-rise buildings such as Normandie Tower and new housing estates such as the Tuckswood Estate, which were being built at the time.

The final part of St Peters Street (opposite [[St Peter Mancroft]] church), along with large Georgian townhouses at the top of Bethel Street were demolished to make way for the new City Library in 1961.<ref name=\"oldcity.org.uk\"/> This burnt down in April 1994 and was replaced in 2001 with [[The Forum, Norwich|The Forum]].\n\nMany more buildings were demolished during the construction of the inner ring-road, which saw an ancient road junction \u2013 Stump Cross with Tudor and Georgian buildings in Magdalen Street, Botolph Street, St George's Street and most notably Pitt Street \u2013 cleared to make way for a fly-over and [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete shopping centre, [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]] and office blocks such as HMSO building Sovereign House. Other areas affected by the ring-road were Grapes Hill, a once narrow lane lined with 19th-century workers cottages, which was cleared and widened into a dual carriageway leading into a roundabout. Shortly before construction of this roundabout, the city's old [[Chapel Field Road drill hall, Norwich|Drill Hall]] was demolished, along with sections of the original city wall and other larger townhouses along the start of Unthank Road (named after the Unthank family, who were local landowners).<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=Derek |title=The real story behind Unthank Road |url=https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |website=Evening News |access-date=25 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125184433/https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |archive-date=25 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The north-westerly corner of Chapelfield Gardens was also cut off to accommodate the new roundabout. About a mile of Georgian houses along Chapelfield Road and Queens Road; which included many houses that were built into the city walls, were bulldozed in 1964. This included the surrounding district off Vauxhall Street, consisting of swathes of terrace housing which were condemned as slums. Post-war housing and maisonettes flats now stand where the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery slums]] once did. Some aspects of The '45 Plan were put into action, which saw large three-story Edwardian houses in Grove Avenue and Grove Road, and other large properties on Southwell Road, demolished in 1962 to make way for flat-roofed single-story style maisonettes that still stand today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://norfolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/PICNOR/BIBENQ/155332801/2219614,5?FMT=IMG|title=Spydus - Image Display \u2013 Record 5 of 8 |website=Civica |publisher=Norfolk County Council |language=en |access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham]] Hall, a large Victorian manor house off Old Palace Road was also demolished in 1963, to build Dolphin Grove flats.\n\nOther housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and to replace condemned and bomb-damaged areas, such as the [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham Grove]] district between Barn Road and Old Palace Road, and West Pottergate off Dereham Road/Earlham Road. Other central streets such as St Stephens Street was widened, firstly by [[Norwich Union]]'s new office blocks and shortly after with new buildings, after it suffered extensive damage during the [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]]. In Surrey Street, many six-storey Georgian buildings were demolished to make way for Norwich Union's office. Other notable buildings that were lost were three theatres, the Norwich Hippodrome on St Giles Street, which is now a multi-storey car park, the Grosvenor Rooms and Electric Theatre in Prince of Wales Road, the Corn Hall in Exchange Street, the Free Library in Duke Street and the Great Eastern Hotel, which faced [[Norwich railway station|Norwich Station]].

It has a creative writing programme, established by [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Angus Wilson]], whose graduates include [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] and [[Ian McEwan]]. It has done work on climate research and climate change. The university campus is the home of the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]], which houses several important art collections. The Norwich University of the Arts dates back to 1845 as the Norwich School of Design. Founded by artists and followers of the [[Norwich School (art movement)|Norwich School]] art movement, it was established to provide designers for local industries. Previously a specialist art school (as the Norwich School of Art and Design), it achieved university status in 2013.\n\nNorwich has three [[further education]] colleges.

Norwich is one of the UK's top ten shopping destinations, with a mix of chain retailers and independent stores as well as [[Norwich Market]], one of the largest outdoor markets in England.

The building also provides a venue for art exhibitions, concerts and events, although the city still lacks a dedicated concert venue.\n\nRecent attempts to shed the backwater image of Norwich and market it as a popular tourist destination, as well as a centre for science, commerce, culture and the arts, have included the refurbishment of the [[Norwich Castle|Norwich Castle Museum]] and the opening of the Forum. The proposed new slogan for Norwich as ''England's Other City'' has been the subject of much discussion and controversy. It remains to be seen whether it will be finally adopted. A number of signs at the approaches to the city still display the traditional phrase: \"Norwich \u2014 a fine city\".\n\n[[File:The Forum Norwich 2015.JPG|thumb|[[The Forum, Norwich|The Forum]], housing, among other things, the Norfolk and Norwich Millennium Library and the [[BBC]]'s East of England headquarters and studios]]\nThe city promotes its architectural heritage through a collection of notable buildings in Norwich called the \"[[Norwich 12]]\".

The founder was [[Nugent Monck]] who had worked with [[William Poel]]. The theatre is a [[Shakespearean]]-style playhouse and has a [[seating capacity]] of 310. [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]] was founded in 1979 by Ray and Joan DaSilva as a permanent base for their touring company and was first opened as a public venue in 1980, following the conversion of the medieval church of St. James in the heart of Norwich. Under subsequent artistic directors \u2014 Barry Smith and Luis Z. Boy \u2014 the theatre established its current pattern of operation. It is a nationally unique venue dedicated to puppetry, and currently houses a 185-seat raked auditorium, the 50-seat Octagon Studio, workshops, an exhibition gallery, shop and licensed bar. It is the only theatre in the Eastern region with a year-round programme of family-centred entertainment. [[Norwich Arts Centre]] theatre opened in 1977 in St Benedict's Street, and has a capacity of 290. The [[Norwich Playhouse]], which opened in 1995 and has a [[seating capacity]] of 300, is a venue in the heart of the city and one of the most modern performance spaces of its size in East Anglia.\n\nThe Garage studio theatre can seat up to 110 people in a range of layouts. It can also be used for standing events to accommodate up to 180 people. Platform Theatre is in the grounds of the City College Norwich. Productions are staged mainly during the autumn and summer months. The theatre is raked and seats about 250 people. On 20 April 2012, the theatre held a large relaunch event with an evening performance, show-casing it at its best with previews of upcoming performances and scenes from some of its past performances.<ref>[http://www.ccn.ac.uk/news/new-building-boost-creative-arts-city-college-norwich City College Norwich] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406070519/http://www.ccn.ac.uk/news/new-building-boost-creative-arts-city-college-norwich |date=6 April 2012}} Retrieved 23 March 2012</ref>\n\nThe Whiffler Theatre was built in 1981 and was given to the people of Norwich by the local newspaper group Eastern Daily Press.

Its magnificent architecture is complemented by displays showing the history of the building and its role in the life of Norwich through the ages. The Norwich Castle Study Centre, at the Shirehall in Market Avenue, contains a number of important collections, including an extensive collection of more than 20,000 costume and textile items, built up over a period of some 130 years, and previously kept in other Norwich museums. Although not a publicly open museum in the usual sense, items in the collections are accessible to the general public, students, researchers and others by prior appointment.<ref>[https://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/norwich-castle/whats-here/norwich-castle-study-centre Norwich Castle Study Centre] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190720135458/https://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/norwich-castle/whats-here/norwich-castle-study-centre |date=20 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\nNorwich has three cinema complexes.

Prince of Wales Road in the city centre, running from the Riverside district near [[Norwich railway station]] to Norwich Castle, is home to many pubs, bars and clubs.\n\n===Media and film===\n[[File:A Saturday in Norwich (14998715671) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Anglia House, the headquarters of Anglia Television, today [[ITV Anglia]]]]\nNorwich is the headquarters of BBC East, its presence in the east of England, and [[BBC Radio Norfolk]], ''[[BBC Look East]]'', ''Inside Out'' and ''[[The Politics Show]]'' are all broadcast from BBC studios in The Forum. [[Independent radio]] stations based in Norwich include [[Heart Norwich|Heart]], [[Smooth Radio]], [[99.9 Radio Norwich]], and the University of East Anglia's Livewire 1350, an online station. A community station, [[Future Radio]], was launched on 6 August 2007.\n\n[[ITV Anglia]], formerly [[Anglia Television]], is based in Norwich. Although one of the smaller ITV companies, it supplied the network with some of its most popular shows such as ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[Survival (TV series)|Survival]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (1971\u20131983), which began each edition with [[John Benson (announcer)|John Benson]]'s enthusiastic announcement: \"And now from Norwich, it's the quiz of the week!\" The company also had a subsidiary called Anglia Multimedia, which produced educational content on CD and DVD mainly for schools, and was one of the three companies, along with [[Granada TV]] and the [[BBC]] vying for the right to produce a digital television station for English schools and colleges.\n\nLaunched in 1959, Anglia Television lost its independence in 1994 following a takeover by [[Meridian Broadcasting]] and subsequent mergers have seen it reduced from a significant producer of programmes to a regional news centre. The company is still based in Anglia House, the former Norfolk and Norwich Agricultural Hall, on Agricultural Hall Plain near Prince of Wales Road. However, despite the contraction of Anglia, television production in Norwich has by no means ended. Anglia's former network production centre at Magdalen Street has been taken over by Norfolk County Council and extensively re-vamped. After a total investment of \u00a34&nbsp;million from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as Epic Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are also run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. Epic has commercial, broadcast quality post-production facilities, a real-time virtual studio and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008. Throughout 2008, the centre has concentrated on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows with Les Dennis, Gaby Roslin and Christopher Biggins.\n\n[[Archant]] publishes two daily newspapers in Norwich, the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', and the regional ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'' (EDP), and had its own television operation, [[Mustard TV]], which has now closed after being bought out by the [[That's TV]] group. Mustard TV is now [[That's Norfolk]].\n\nThe character of [[Alan Partridge]] in the sitcom ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'' (1997\u20132002) and the comedy film ''[[Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa]]'' (2013) is a Norwich broadcaster played by [[Steve Coogan]].\n\n===Esoteric associations===\nBecause Norwich was England's second city during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it has, though little acknowledged, a number of significant associations with [[esoteric]] spirituality. It was the home of [[William Cuningham]], a physician who published ''An Invective Epistle in Defense of Astrologers'' in 1560.<ref>Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers by Michael Bryan, edited by Robert Edmund Graves and Sir Walter Armstrong, an 1886\u20131889 publication now in the public domain</ref> The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], author of [[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]], was born in Norwich in 1558. The city was also the retirement residence of [[Arthur Dee]] (died Norwich, 1651) the eldest son of the alchemist [[John Dee]]{{sfn|Fleay|1891|pp=251\u2013252}}<ref>Dictionary of National Biography, 1885\u20131900, Volume 14</ref> [[File:St John the Baptist Church - The Layer Monument.jpg|thumb|The Layer Monument, marble polychrome c. 1600]]\n\nNorwich was also the residence of the physician and [[hermeticism|hermetic]] philosopher Sir [[Thomas Browne]], author of [[The Garden of Cyrus]] (1658). Many influential esoteric books-titles are listed as once in Browne's [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne#Esoteric|library]].<ref>Catalogue of the libraries of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward Browne, edited with an introduction by J. S. Finch E. J. Brill Publications 1986</ref> His coffin-plate, on display at the church of [[St Peter Mancroft]], alludes to [[Paracelsian]] medicine and alchemy. Translated from Latin it reads, ''Great Virtues, &hellip; sleeping here the dust of his [[spagyric]] body converts the lead to gold''. Browne is also a significant figure in the history of [[physiognomy]].\n\nThe [[Church of St John Maddermarket]]'s graveyard includes the Crabtree headstone, which has the pre-Christian symbol of the [[Ouroboros]] along with [[Masonic]] [[Square and Compasses]] carved upon it. Housed within the church there is [[the Layer Monument]], a rare example of an alchemical [[mandala]] in European funerary art.{{sfn|Faulkner|2013}}\n\nFrom 1787 the congregation of the [[New Jerusalem Church]] of [[Swedenborgians]], followers of the mystic [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], worshipped at the church of St. Mary the Less; in 1852 they moved to Park Lane, Norwich to establish the Swedenborgian Chapel.<ref>[http://www.norwich-churches.org/St%20Mary%20the%20Less/home.shtm Norwich historic churches \u2013 St Mary the Less] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016080407/http://www.norwich-churches.org/St%20Mary%20the%20Less/home.shtm |date=16 October 2013}} Retrieved 9 October 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.norfolkchurches.co.uk/norwichsweden/norwichsweden.htm Norfolk Churches \u2013 Swedenborgian Chapel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029002119/http://www.norfolkchurches.co.uk/norwichsweden/norwichsweden.htm |date=29 October 2012}} Retrieved 8 October 2013.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{See also|Grade I listed buildings in Norwich|Grade II*listed buildings in Norwich}}\nNorwich has a wealth of historical architecture.

Notable examples of [[Secularity|secular]] medieval architecture are [[Dragon Hall, Norwich|Dragon Hall]], built in about 1430, and [[Norwich Guildhall|The Guildhall]], built 1407\u20131413, with later additions. From the 18th century, the pre-eminent local name is [[Thomas Ivory]], who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen's House (1752) in the grounds of the [[Great Hospital]], and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (c. 1761). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and similar period.\n\nThe 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich's size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre, dates from this period. The local architect of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] periods who has continued to command most critical respect was [[George Skipper]] (1856\u20131948). Examples of his work include the headquarters of [[Norwich Union]] on Surrey Street; the [[Art Nouveau]] Royal Arcade; and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of [[Cromer]]. The [[neo-Gothic]] Roman Catholic [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich|cathedral]] dedicated to [[St John the Baptist]] on [[Earlham Road]], begun in 1882, is by [[George Gilbert Scott Junior]] and his brother, [[John Oldrid Scott]].\n\nThe city continued to grow through the 20th century, and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938; at the same time, they moved the [[Norwich War Memorial|City War Memorial]], designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], to sit in a memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to the housing stock in the city centre. Much of the postwar replacement stock was designed by the local-authority architect, David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was the opening of the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1964. Originally designed by [[Denys Lasdun]] (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and [[Rick Mather]].\n\n<gallery heights=\"132\" mode=\"packed\">\nNorwichcathedral2.jpg|Norwich Cathedral lies close to Tombland in the city centre.\nElmHill.jpg|[[Elm Hill, Norwich|Elm Hill]] is an intact medieval street.\nCowtower.jpg|[[Cow Tower, Norwich|Cow Tower]] stands on the banks of the River Wensum.\nGentlemanswalk.JPG|The varying styles of architecture along Gentleman's Walk\n</gallery>\n\n===Parks, gardens and open spaces===\n[[File:Riverside Flats Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 73621.jpg|thumb|Riverside flats Norwich]]\n''See also [[List of parks, gardens and open spaces in Norwich]]''\n\nChapelfield Gardens in central Norwich became the city's first [[public park]] in November 1880.

[[Sewell Park, Norwich|Sewell Park]] and James Stuart Gardens are examples of land donated by benefactors.\n\nAfter World War I the corporation took advantage of government grants and made the decision to construct a series of formal parks as a means to alleviate unemployment.

It has also won two [[Football League Cup]]s and finished third in the inaugural [[Premier League]] in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its top-flight place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions.\n\nPerhaps Norwich City's most famous result to date came later in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]], in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but they were unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] from the FA Cup in 1959, and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some of the most highly rated talent of that era, including striker [[Chris Sutton]], winger [[Ruel Fox]], defender [[Andy Linighan]], midfielder [[Mike Phelan]], midfielder [[Tim Sherwood]] and striker [[Justin Fashanu]].

This closed in 1986 and the entire Thorpe power station site was demolished and cleared in 1981\u20131982. Two tall electricity pylons stood near the site until they were dismantled in 2017.

City, farewell: I mourn thy cruel fate''.\n\n[[Thomas Fuller]] in his ''The Worthies of England'' described the City in 1662 as:\n: ''Either a city in an orchard or an orchard in a city, so equally are houses and trees blended in it, so that the pleasure of the country and the populousness of the city meet here together. Yet in this mixture, the inhabitants participate nothing of the rusticalness of the one, but altogether the urbanity and civility of the other''.\n\n[[Celia Fiennes]] (1662\u20131741) visited Norwich in 1698 and described it as\n: '' a city walled full round of towers, except on the river side which serves as a wall; they seem the best in repair of any walled city I know''. She also records that three times a year the city held:\n: ''great fairs. &hellip; to which resort a vast concourse of people and wares a full trade'', Norwich being ''a rich, thriving industrious place full of weaving, knitting and dyeing''.\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] in his ''Tour of the whole Island of Great Britain'' (1724) wrote:\n: ''the inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures, dwell in their garrets at their looms, in their combing-shops, so they call them, twisting-mills, and other work-houses; almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors''.\n\n[[John Evelyn]] (1620\u20131706), royalist, traveller and diarist, wrote to [[Sir Thomas Browne]]:\n: '' I hear Norwich is a place very much addicted to the flowery part''. He visited the City as a courtier to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1671 and described it thus:\n: ''The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town''.\n[[James Woodforde]] (1740\u20131803), clergyman, on his first visit to Norwich, wrote in his Diary on 14 April 1775:\n\n: ''We took a walk over the City in the morning, and we both agreed that it was the finest City in England by far, in the center of it is a high Hill and on that a prodigious large old Castle almost perfect and forms a compleat square, round it is a fine Terrass Walk which commands the whole City. There are in the City 36 noble Churches mostly built with flint, besides many meeting Houses of divers sorts. A noble River runs almost thro the Center of the City. The City walls are also very perfect and all round the City but where the River is. On the Hills round the City stand many Wind Mills about a dozen, to be seen from Castle Mount''.\n[[George Borrow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Lavengro]] (1851) wrote of Norwich as:\n: ''A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town &hellip;.There it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound....There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire.... Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?''\n\nBorrow wrote far less favourably of the City in his translation of [[Faust]]:\n: ''They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday's best''.\n\nIn 1812, Andrew Robertson wrote to the painter [[Constable]]:\n: ''I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated &hellip; some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length. General literature seems to be pursued with an ardour which is astonishing when we consider that it does not contain a university, as is merely a manufacturing town.''\n\nIn 1962, [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]] stated in his North-West Norfolk and Norwich volume of ''[[The Buildings of England]]'' that:\n: ''Norwich is distinguished by a prouder sense of civic responsibility than any other town of about the same size in Britain.''\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Thomas Browne statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sir [[Thomas Browne]] on Hay Hill, near to where he lived.

According to a local rhyme, the demise of ''Venta Icenorum'' led to the development of Norwich: \"Caistor was a city when Norwich was none, Norwich was built of Caistor stone.\"{{sfn |Morley |2006}}\n\n===Early English and Norman conquest===\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral, spire and south transept.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Cathedral]] is one of the great Norman buildings of England.]]\nThere are two suggested models of development for Norwich. It is possible that three separate early Anglo-Saxon settlements, one north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as they grew or that one Anglo-Saxon settlement, north of the river, emerged in the mid-7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in East Anglia in 1004 when it was raided and burnt by [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Swein Forkbeard]] the [[Viking]] king of Denmark. [[Mercia]]n coins and shards of pottery from the [[Rhineland]] dating from the 8th century suggest that long-distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924 and 939, Norwich became fully established as a town, with its own mint. The word ''Norvic'' appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, in the reign of [[Athelstan|King Athelstan]]. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40 to 50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] district near the north end of present-day King Street. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], the city was one of the largest in England. The [[Domesday Book]] states that it had approximately 25 churches and a population of between 5,000 and 10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Saxon market place and the later [[Norwich Cathedral|Norman cathedral]]. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the River Wensum being a convenient export route to the [[River Yare]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], which served as the [[Port of Norwich|port for Norwich]]. [[Quern stone]]s and other artefacts from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre. These date from the 11th century onwards.\n\n[[File:Norwich Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Castle]]'s 12th-century keep]]\n[[Norwich Castle]] was founded soon after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{PastScape |mnumber=132268 |mname=Norwich Castle |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Domesday Book]] records that 98 Saxon homes were demolished to make way for the castle.{{sfn |Harfield |1991 |pp=373, 384}} The [[Normans]] established a new focus of settlement around the Castle and the area to the west of it: this became known as the \"New\" or \"French\" borough, centred on the Normans' own market place, which survives today as Norwich Market. In 1096, [[Herbert de Losinga]], [[Bishop of Thetford]], began construction of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. The chief building material for the Cathedral was limestone, imported from Caen in Normandy. To transport the building stone to the site, a canal was cut from the river (from the site of present-day Pulls Ferry) up to the east wall. Herbert de Losinga then moved his [[Episcopal see|See]] there, to what became the cathedral church for the [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]]. The Bishop of Norwich still signs himself ''Norvic''. Norwich received a [[royal charter]] from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1158, and another from [[Richard I of England|Richard ''the Lionheart'']] in 1194. After a riot in the city in 1274, Norwich has the distinction of being the only complete English city to be excommunicated by the Pope.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe first recorded presence of [[Jews]] in Norwich is 1134.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130806235625/http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 August 2013 |title=Jews in Norwich |publisher=Heritagecity.org |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> In 1144, the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy ([[William of Norwich]]) was found dead with stab wounds.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\"/> William acquired the status of martyr and was subsequently [[canonization|canonised]]. Pilgrims made offerings to a shrine at the Cathedral (largely finished by 1140) up to the 16th century, but the records suggest there were few of them.{{sfn |Nilson |2001 |p=157}} In 1174, Norwich was sacked by the [[Flemish people|Flemings]]. In February 1190, all the Jews of Norwich were massacred except for a few who found refuge in the castle. At the site of a medieval well, the bones of 17 individuals, including 11 children, were found in 2004 by workers preparing the ground for construction of a Norwich shopping centre. The remains were determined by [[forensic science|forensic scientists]] to be most probably the remains of such murdered Jews, and a [[Genetic genealogy|DNA]] expert determined that the victims were all related, so that they probably came from one [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] family.{{sfn |Jewish Telegraphic Agency |2011}} The study of the remains featured in an episode of the [[BBC Television|BBC television]] documentary series ''[[History Cold Case]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Bodies in the Well |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |series=History Cold Case |network=[[BBC HD]] |airdate=28 June 2011 |seriesno=2 |number=3 |access-date=25 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816170740/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |archivedate=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ethelbert Gate from Tombland, Norwich, UK.jpg|thumb|St Ethelbert's Gate at Tombland was built as penance for riots which occurred in the 1270s.]]\nIn 1216, the castle fell to Louis, Dauphin of France and Hildebrand's Hospital was founded, followed ten years later by the [[Franciscan]] Friary and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary. The Great Hospital dates from 1249 and the College of St Mary in the Field from 1250. In 1256, Whitefriars was founded. In 1266 the city was sacked by the \"Disinherited\". It has the distinction of being the only English city ever to be excommunicated, following a riot between citizens and monks in 1274.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}} As a penance, St Ethelbert's Gate, one of the entrances to the cathedral priory, was constructed by Norwich citizens. In 1278 the Cathedral received final consecration. In 1290 the city flooded. Austin Friary was founded in that year.\n\nThe engine of trade was [[wool]] from Norfolk's [[sheepwalk]]s. Wool made England rich, and the [[staple right|staple port]] of Norwich \"in her state doth stand With towns of high'st regard the fourth of all the land\", as [[Michael Drayton]] noted in ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' (1612). The wealth generated by the [[wool#History|wool trade]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]] financed the construction of many fine churches, so that Norwich still has more medieval churches than any other city in Western Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Throughout this period Norwich established wide-ranging trading links with other parts of Europe, its markets stretching from [[Scandinavia]] to Spain and the city housing a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] warehouse. To organise and control its exports to the [[Low Countries]], Great Yarmouth, as the port for Norwich, was designated one of the staple ports under the terms of the 1353 [[Statute of the Staple]].\n\nFrom 1280 to 1340 the [[defensive wall|city walls]] were built. At around {{convert|2 + 1/2|mi|km|}}, these walls, along with the river, enclosed a larger area than that of the [[City of London]]. However, when the city walls were constructed it was made illegal to build outside them, inhibiting expansion of the city. Around this time, the city was made a [[county corporate]] and became the seat of one of the most densely populated and prosperous [[ancient counties of England|counties]] of England. Part of these walls remain standing today.\n\n===Early modern period (1485\u20131640)===\nHand-in-hand with the wool industry, this key religious centre experienced a Reformation significantly different to other parts of England. The magistracy in Tudor Norwich unusually found ways of managing religious discord whilst maintaining civic harmony.{{sfn |McClendon |1999}}\n\n[[File:John Crome 002.jpg|thumb|''Mousehold Heath, Norwich'' by Norfolk-based artist [[John Crome]]]]The summer of 1549 saw an unprecedented rebellion in Norfolk. Unlike popular challenges elsewhere in the Tudor period, it appears to have been [[Protestant]] in nature. For several weeks, rebels led by [[Robert Kett]] camped outside Norwich on [[Mousehold Heath]] and took control of the city on 29 July 1549 with the support of many of its poorer inhabitants. [[Kett's Rebellion]] was particularly in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals and the general abuses of power by the nobility.

In the case of Norwich, this process was underscored later by the arrival of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] \"[[Elizabethan Strangers|Strangers]]\" fleeing persecution from the Catholics and eventually numbering as many as one-third of the city's population.{{sfn |Houlbroke |McClendon |2004 |p=257}} Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants from the Westkwartier (\"Western Quarter\"), a region in the [[Southern Netherlands]] where the first [[Calvinist]] fires of the [[Dutch Revolt]] had spread. Inhabitants of [[Ypres]], in particular, chose Norwich above other destinations.{{sfn |Fagel |2003 |p=52}} Perhaps in response to Kett, Norwich became the first provincial city to initiate compulsory payments for a civic scheme of poor relief, which it has been claimed led to its wider introduction, forming the basis of the later Elizabethan Poor Law of 1597\u20131598.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |pp=50\u201356}}\n\nNorwich has traditionally been the home of various minorities, notably French [[Huguenot]] and Belgian [[Walloons|Walloon]] communities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The great \"stranger\" immigration of 1567 brought a substantial Flemish and Walloon community of Protestant [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s to Norwich, where they are said to have been made welcome.{{sfn |Ketton-Cremer |1957}} The merchant's house which was their earliest base in the city \u2014 now a museum \u2014 is still known as [[Strangers' Hall]]. It seems that the strangers integrated into the local community without much animosity, at least among the business fraternity, who had the most to gain from their skills. Their arrival in Norwich boosted trade with mainland Europe and fostered a movement toward religious reform and radical politics in the city. By contrast, after being persecuted by the Anglican church for his [[Puritan]] beliefs, [[Michael Metcalf (puritan)|Michael Metcalf]], a 17th-century Norwich weaver, fled the city and settled in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=A New England Town |last=Lockridge |first=Kenneth |year=1985 |publisher=W.

Along with their advanced techniques in textile working, they brought pet canaries which they began to breed locally; eventually becoming, in the 20th century, a mascot of the city and the emblem of its football club, [[Norwich City F.C.]], whose nickname is \"The Canaries\". \n\nPrinting was introduced to the city in 1567 by Anthony de Solempne, one of the strangers, but it did not take root and had died out by about 1572.{{sfn |Stoker |1981}}\n\n===Civil War to Victorian era===\nAcross the Eastern Counties, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s powerful [[Eastern Association]] was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been a large element of Royalist sympathy within Norwich, which seems to have experienced a continuity of its two-sided political tradition throughout the period. Bishop [[Matthew Wren]] was a forceful supporter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Nonetheless, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] recruitment took hold. The strong Royalist party was stifled by a lack of commitment from the aldermen and isolation from Royalist-held regions.{{sfn |Hopper |2004}} Serious inter-factional disturbances culminated in \"The Great Blow\" of 1648 when Parliamentary forces tried to quell a Royalist riot. The latter's gunpowder was set off by accident in the city centre, causing mayhem. According to Hopper<ref>{{harvnb |Hopper |2004}},</ref> the explosion \"ranks among the largest of the century\". Stoutly defended though East Anglia was by the Parliamentary army, there are said to have been pubs in Norwich where the king's health was still drunk and the name of the Protector sung to ribald verse.\n\nAt the cost of some discomfort to the Mayor, the moderate [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] was targeted because of his position as Bishop of Norwich.\n\nNorwich was marked in the period after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of 1660 and the ensuing century by a golden age of its cloth industry, comparable only to those in the [[West Country]] and Yorkshire.{{sfn |Wilson |2004a}} But unlike other cloth-manufacturing regions, Norwich weaving brought greater urbanisation, mainly concentrated in the surrounds of the city itself, creating an urban society, with features such as leisure time, alehouses and other public forums of debate and argument.{{sfn |Wilson |2004b}}\n\n[[File:Original Norfolk and Norwich Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 84361.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1771, the [[Norfolk and Norwich Hospital]] cared for the city's poor and sick. It closed in 2003 after services were moved to the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]].]]\nWriting of the early 18th century, Pound describes the city's rich cultural life, the winter theatre season, the festivities accompanying the summer assizes, and other popular entertainments. Norwich was the wealthiest town in England, with a sophisticated system of [[poor relief]], and a large influx of foreign refugees.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |p=61}} Despite severe outbreaks of plague, the city had a population of almost 30,000. This made Norwich unique in England, although there were some 50 cities of similar size in Europe. In some, like Lyon and [[Dresden]], this was, as in the case of Norwich, linked to an important proto-industry, such as textiles or china pottery, in some, such as Vienna, Madrid and Dublin, to the city's status as an administrative capital, and in some such as Antwerp, Marseilles and Cologne to a position on an important maritime or river trade route.{{efn|1=For table of city sizes see {{harvtxt |Corfield |2004 |p=143}}}}\n\nNorwich in the late 17th century was riven politically. Churchman [[Humphrey Prideaux]] described \"two factions, [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory]], and both contend for their way with the utmost violence.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004}} Nor did the city accept the outcome of the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse \"with a glass of beer in hand, went down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [sic] well and settled on his head.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174 |quote= \"Never was a city in the miserable kingdom so wretchedly divided as this,\" said the ''London Post''}}\n\nIn 1716, at a play at the ''New Inn'', the Pretender was cheered and the audience booed and hissed every time King George's name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king were said to be \"hiss'd at and curst as they go in the streets,\" and in 1731 \"a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government.\"{{efn |1=Reports quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}}} But the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city's popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city's Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in, and the vestry of [[St Peter Mancroft]] resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, it was the end of the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the [[Battle of Culloden]].{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\nThe events of this period illustrate how Norwich had a strong tradition of popular protest favouring Church and Stuarts and attached to the street and alehouse. Knights tells how in 1716 the mayoral election had ended in a riot, with both sides throwing \"brick-ends and great paving stones\" at each other.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} A renowned Jacobite watering-hole, the ''Blue Bell Inn'' (nowadays ''The Bell Hotel''), owned in the early 18th century by the high-church Helwys family, became the central rendezvous of the Norwich Revolution Society in the 1790s.{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=38}}\n\nBritain's first provincial newspaper, the ''[[Norwich Post]]'', appeared in 1701. By 1726 there were rival Whig and Tory presses, and as early as mid-century, three-quarters of the males in some parishes were literate.{{efn |1=Quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=181\u2013182}}}} The Norwich municipal library claims an excellent collection of these newspapers, also a folio collection of scrapbooks on 18th-century Norwich politics, which Knights says are \"valuable and important\". Norwich alehouses had 281 clubs and societies meeting in them in 1701, and at least 138 more were formed before 1758. The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] opened in 1758, alongside the city's stage productions in inns and puppet shows in rowdy alehouses.{{sfn |Chandler |1998}}{{sfn |Blackwell |Blackwell |2007 |loc=Chap 2}} In 1750 Norwich could boast nine booksellers and after 1780 a \"growing number of circulating and subscription libraries\".{{sfn |Dain |2004}} {{harvnb |Knights |2004}} says: \"[All this] made for a lively political culture, in which independence from governmental lines was particularly strong, evident in campaigns against the war with America and for reform... in which trade and the impact of war with [[Revolutionary France]] were key ingredients. The open and contestable structure of local government, the press, the clubs and societies, and dissent all ensured that politics overlapped with communities bound by economics, religion, ideology and print in a world in which public opinion could not be ignored.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\n[[File:OctagonChapel.JPG|thumb|left|The Octagon Chapel]]\nAmid this metropolitan culture, the city burghers had built a sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who had the right to trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} This was notoriously the age of [[rotten borough|\"rotten\"]] and [[pocket borough|\"pocket\"]] boroughs, and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. \"Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals to make use of the electoral process.\"{{sfn |Thompson |1968 |p=513}} \"Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed,\" says {{harvnb |Jewson |1975}}, describing other towns under the control of a single [[fief]]dom. In Norwich, he says, a powerful Anglican establishment, symbolised by the Cathedral and the great church of St Peter Mancroft was matched by scarcely less powerful [[wikt:congeries|congeries]] of Dissenters headed by the wealthy literate body [of Unitarians] worshipping at the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich|Octagon Chapel]].{{sfn |Jewson |1975}}\n\n[[File:Map of Norwich 1781.jpg|thumb|Map of Norwich 1781]]\nIn the middle of political disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. It contained one, so far unmentioned aspect: [[Harriet Martineau]] wrote of the city's ''literati'' of the period, including such people as [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]], one of England's first scholars of German. The city \"boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself ''The Athens of England''.\"{{sfn |Martineau |1869}}\n\n[[File:St Peter Mancroft.jpg|thumb|[[St Peter Mancroft]]]]\nDespite Norwich's hitherto industrial prosperity, the wool trade was experiencing intense competition by the 1790s, from Yorkshire woollens and increasingly from Lancashire cottons. The effects were aggravated by the loss of continental markets after Britain went to war with France in 1793.{{efn |1={{harvnb |Hayes |1958}} Quote: \"a major city manufacturer, and government supporter, Robert Harvey Jr as writing on 12 March 1793: 'The consequences of this just and inevitable war visit this poor city severely and suspend the operations of the Dutch, German and Italian trade and the only lingering employment in the manufactory is the completion of a few Russian orders, and the last China [[camlet|cambletts]] which I hope will find encouragement in the new East India Charter. This languid trade has doubled our poor rate and a voluntary subscription of above \u00a32,000 is found inadequate to the exigencies of the poor.\"}} The early 19th century saw de-industrialisation accompanied by bitter squabbles. The 1820s were marked by wage cuts and personal recrimination against owners. So amid the rich commercial and cultural heritage of its recent past, Norwich suffered in the 1790s from incipient decline exacerbated by a serious trade recession.\n\nAs early in the war as 1793, a major city manufacturer and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and doubling of the poor rate.{{efn |1=Quotations and facts from {{harvtxt |Wilson |2004b}}}} Like many of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints onto the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, where \"Citizen Stanhope\" spoke.{{efn|1=Lord Stanhope was a radical peer, seen by many at the time as a dangerous menace. He is said to have given his rabble-rousing speech in a Norwich public house in 1794.}} The gathering \"[roared its] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; \u2013 and if there was a people still in England, the event might turn out to be so.\" Hayes says that \"the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended.\"{{sfn |Hayes |1958 |pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nAt this period opposition to Pitt's government and their war came \u2013 in their case almost unanimously \u2013 from a circle of radical Dissenting intellectuals of interest in their own right They included the Rigby, Taylor, Aitkin, Barbold, and Alderson families \u2013 all Unitarians, and some of the Quaker Gurneys, one of whose girls, Elizabeth, was under her married name of Fry to be noted campaigner for prison reform. Their activities included visits to revolutionary France (before the execution of Louis XVI), the earliest British research into German literature, studies on medical science, petitioning for parliamentary reform, and publishing a highbrow literary magazine called \"The Cabinet\", in 1795. Their blend of politics, religion and social campaigning was suspicious to Pitt and Windham, causing Pitt to denounce Norwich as \"the Jacobin city\". Edmund Burke attacked John Gurney in print for sponsoring anti-war protests. Politics aside, it is safe to say that Norwich was the most active intellectual hotbed outside London in the 1790s, and did not retrieve comparable prominence until the University of East of Anglia arrived in the late 20th century.<ref>Sources: C. B. Jewson: ''Jacobin City''; I. Scott: ''Reactions to Radicalism in Norwich 1989\u20131802''; J. P.

In April that year, the Norwich Patriotic Society was founded, its manifesto declaring \"that the great end of civil society was general happiness; that every individual had a right to share in the government.\"{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=66}} In December the price of bread reached a new peak, and in May 1796, when William Windham was forced to seek re-election after his appointment as war secretary, he only just held his seat.{{efn |1=Before the 20th century it was the practice for a sitting member to seek re-election if appointed to ministerial office.}} Amid the disorder and violence so often in Norwich elections, it was only by the narrowest margin that the radical Bartlett Gurney (\"Peace and Gurney \u2013 No More War \u2013 No more Barley Bread\") failed to unseat him.{{sfn |Thompson |1994}}\n\nThough informed by issues of recent national importance, the bipartisan political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be divorced from local tradition. Two features stand out from a political continuum of three centuries. The first is a dichotomous power balance. From at least the time of the Reformation, Norwich was recorded as a \"two-party city\". In the mid-16th century, the weaving parishes fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor clothworkers. Indeed there seems to be a case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had steadily developed an infrastructure, evident in its many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with alehouse crowds ready to have \"a Minister's head brought to the block\", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy exerted themselves to conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground and reinforcing the well-mannered civic tradition of earlier periods.\n\n[[File:Surrey House on Surrey Street - geograph.org.uk - 22919.jpg|thumb|left|[[Surrey House]], historic headquarters of the Norwich Union insurance company]]\nIn 1797 [[Thomas Bignold]], a 36-year-old wine merchant and banker, founded the first [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Society]]. Some years earlier, when he moved from Kent to Norwich, Bignold had been unable to find anyone willing to insure him against the threat from highwaymen. With the entrepreneurial thought that nothing was impossible, and aware that in a city built largely of wood the threat of fire was uppermost in people's minds, Bignold formed the \"Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire\". The new business, which became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office, was a \"mutual\" enterprise. [[Aviva|Norwich Union]] was later to become the country's largest insurance giant.\n\nFrom earliest times Norwich was a textile centre. In the 1780s the manufacture of Norwich [[shawl]]s became an important industry<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192534/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm |date=24 March 2012}} \u2014 \"Norwich Shawls\"</ref> and remained so for nearly a hundred years. The shawls were a high-quality fashion product and rivalled those of other towns such as [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], which had entered shawl manufacturing in about 1805, some 20 or more years after Norwich. With changes in women's fashion in the later [[Victorian period]], the popularity of shawls declined and eventually manufacture ceased. Examples of Norwich shawls are now sought after by collectors of textiles.\n\nNorwich's geographical isolation was such that until 1845, when a railway link was established, it was often quicker to travel to [[Amsterdam]] by boat than to London. The railway was introduced to Norwich by [[Samuel Morton Peto|Morton Peto]], who also built a line to [[Great Yarmouth]]. From 1808 to 1814, Norwich had a station in the [[Semaphore line|shutter telegraph chain]] that connected the [[Admiralty]] in London to its naval ships in the port of [[Great Yarmouth]]. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of [[Britannia Barracks]] in 1897.<ref name=museum>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |title=Britannia Barracks |publisher=Royal Norfolk Regiment Museum |accessdate=9 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109225923/http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |archive-date=9 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Bethel Street drill hall, Norwich|Bethel Street]] and [[Cattle Market Street drill hall, Norwich|Cattle Market Street]] [[drill hall]]s were built around the same time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |title=Norwich |publisher=Drill halls project |accessdate=16 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813144606/http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Waterloo Park Norwich Herbaceous Border.JPG|thumb|Waterloo Park, one of six parks built during the 1930s to help alleviate unemployment in the city]]\nIn the early 20th century, Norwich still had several major manufacturing industries. Among them were the large-scale and bespoke manufacture of shoes (for example the [[Start-rite]] and Van Dal brands, Bowhill & Elliott and Cheney & Sons Ltd respectively), clothing, joinery (including the cabinet makers and furniture retailer [[Arthur Brett and Sons]], which continues in business in the 21st century), structural engineering, and aircraft design and manufacture. Notable employers included [[Boulton & Paul]], Barnards (ironfounders and inventors of machine-produced [[wire netting]]), and the electrical engineers Laurence Scott and Electromotors.\n\nNorwich also has a long association with chocolate making, mainly through the local firm of Caley's, which began as a manufacturer and bottler of mineral water and later diversified into chocolate and [[Christmas crackers]].

Caley's was acquired by Mackintosh in the 1930s, and merged with [[Rowntree's]] in 1969 to become Rowntree-Mackintosh. Finally it was bought by [[Nestl\u00e9]] and closed in 1996, with all operations moving to [[York]] after a Norwich association of 120 years.

Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, [[Colman's]] [[Wincarnis]] works, [[Norwich City railway station|City Station]], the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St Stephen's St and St Benedict's St, the site of Bond's [[department store]] (now [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]) and Curl's department store.\n\n229 citizens were killed in the two [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]] with 1000 others injured, and 340 by bombing throughout the war\u2014giving Norwich the highest air raid casualties in Eastern England.

However, the ten years between 1960 and 1970 completely altered the city, and significantly large areas of Norwich were cleared to make way for modern redevelopment.\n\nIn 1960, the inner-city district of Richmond, locally known as 'the Village on the Hill' was condemned as slums, and many residents were forced to leave due to [[compulsory purchase order]]s on the old terraces and lanes. The whole borough was demolished, which consisted of around 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 considered unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, four offices, 22 public houses and two schools.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |title=Returning to the lost \"village on the hill\" in old Norwich |last=James |first=Derek |work=Norwich Evening News |access-date=2018-08-30 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110811/http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |archive-date=30 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Communities were moved to high-rise buildings such as Normandie Tower and new housing estates such as the Tuckswood Estate, which were being built at the time. A new road, Rouen Road was developed in the area's place, which consists mainly of light industrial units and council flats. [[Ber Street, Norwich|Ber Street]], a once historical main road into the city had its whole eastern side demolished. The final part of St Peters Street (opposite [[St Peter Mancroft]] church), along with large Georgian townhouses at the top of Bethel Street were demolished to make way for the new City Library in 1961.<ref name=\"oldcity.org.uk\"/> This burnt down in April 1994 and was replaced in 2001 with [[The Forum, Norwich|The Forum]].\n\nMany more buildings were demolished during the construction of the inner ring-road, which saw an ancient road junction \u2013 Stump Cross with Tudor and Georgian buildings in Magdalen Street, Botolph Street, St George's Street and most notably Pitt Street \u2013 cleared to make way for a fly-over and [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete shopping centre, [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]] and office blocks such as HMSO building Sovereign House. Other areas affected by the ring-road were Grapes Hill, a once narrow lane lined with 19th-century workers cottages, which was cleared and widened into a dual carriageway leading into a roundabout. Shortly before construction of this roundabout, the city's old [[Chapel Field Road drill hall, Norwich|Drill Hall]] was demolished, along with sections of the original city wall and other larger townhouses along the start of Unthank Road (named after the Unthank family, who were local landowners).<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=Derek |title=The real story behind Unthank Road |url=https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |website=Evening News |access-date=25 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125184433/https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |archive-date=25 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The north-westerly corner of Chapelfield Gardens was also cut off to accommodate the new roundabout. About a mile of Georgian houses along Chapelfield Road and Queens Road; which included many houses that were built into the city walls, were bulldozed in 1964. This included the surrounding district off Vauxhall Street, consisting of swathes of terrace housing which were condemned as slums. Post-war housing and maisonettes flats now stand where the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery slums]] once did. Some aspects of The '45 Plan were put into action, which saw large three-story Edwardian houses in Grove Avenue and Grove Road, and other large properties on Southwell Road, demolished in 1962 to make way for flat-roofed single-story style maisonettes that still stand today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://norfolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/PICNOR/BIBENQ/155332801/2219614,5?FMT=IMG|title=Spydus - Image Display \u2013 Record 5 of 8 |website=Civica |publisher=Norfolk County Council |language=en |access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham]] Hall, a large Victorian manor house off Old Palace Road was also demolished in 1963, to build Dolphin Grove flats.\n\nOther housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and to replace condemned and bomb-damaged areas, such as the [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham Grove]] district between Barn Road and Old Palace Road, and West Pottergate off Dereham Road/Earlham Road. Other central streets such as St Stephens Street was widened, firstly by [[Norwich Union]]'s new office blocks and shortly after with new buildings, after it suffered extensive damage during the [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]]. In Surrey Street, many six-storey Georgian buildings were demolished to make way for Norwich Union's office. Other notable buildings that were lost were three theatres, the Norwich Hippodrome on St Giles Street, which is now a multi-storey car park, the Grosvenor Rooms and Electric Theatre in Prince of Wales Road, the Corn Hall in Exchange Street, the Free Library in Duke Street and the Great Eastern Hotel, which faced [[Norwich railway station|Norwich Station]]. It has been said that more of Norwich's architecture was destroyed but by the council in post-war redevelopment schemes than during the Second World War.\n\n====Other events====\nIn 1976 the city's pioneering spirit was on show when Motum Road in Norwich, allegedly the scene of \"a number of accidents over the years\", became the third road in Britain to be equipped with [[sleeping policemen]], intended to encourage adherence to the road's {{convert|30|mph|km/h}} speed limit.<ref name=Autocar197605>{{Cite journal |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |volume=144 |issue=4147 |authorlink=Peter Garnier (Ed)|title=News: Humps \u2013 another road |page=2 |date=1 May 1976}}</ref> The bumps, installed at intervals of 50 and 150 yards, stretched 12 feet across the width of the road and their curved profile was, at its highest point, {{convert|4|inch|cm}} high.<ref name=Autocar197605/> The responsible [[Transport Research Laboratory|quango]] gave an assurance that the experimental devices would be removed not more than one year after installation.<ref name=Autocar197605/>\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985 the city became a frequent focus of national media due to squatting in [[Argyle Street, Norwich|Argyle Street]], a Victorian street that was demolished in 1986, despite being the last street to survive the Richmond Hill redevelopment.

Prince of Wales Road in the city centre, running from the Riverside district near [[Norwich railway station]] to Norwich Castle, is home to many pubs, bars and clubs.\n\n===Media and film===\n[[File:A Saturday in Norwich (14998715671) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Anglia House, the headquarters of Anglia Television, today [[ITV Anglia]]]]\nNorwich is the headquarters of BBC East, its presence in the east of England, and [[BBC Radio Norfolk]], ''[[BBC Look East]]'', ''Inside Out'' and ''[[The Politics Show]]'' are all broadcast from BBC studios in The Forum. [[Independent radio]] stations based in Norwich include [[Heart Norwich|Heart]], [[Smooth Radio]], [[99.9 Radio Norwich]], and the University of East Anglia's Livewire 1350, an online station. A community station, [[Future Radio]], was launched on 6 August 2007.\n\n[[ITV Anglia]], formerly [[Anglia Television]], is based in Norwich. Although one of the smaller ITV companies, it supplied the network with some of its most popular shows such as ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[Survival (TV series)|Survival]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (1971\u20131983), which began each edition with [[John Benson (announcer)|John Benson]]'s enthusiastic announcement: \"And now from Norwich, it's the quiz of the week!\" The company also had a subsidiary called Anglia Multimedia, which produced educational content on CD and DVD mainly for schools, and was one of the three companies, along with [[Granada TV]] and the [[BBC]] vying for the right to produce a digital television station for English schools and colleges.\n\nLaunched in 1959, Anglia Television lost its independence in 1994 following a takeover by [[Meridian Broadcasting]] and subsequent mergers have seen it reduced from a significant producer of programmes to a regional news centre. The company is still based in Anglia House, the former Norfolk and Norwich Agricultural Hall, on Agricultural Hall Plain near Prince of Wales Road. However, despite the contraction of Anglia, television production in Norwich has by no means ended. Anglia's former network production centre at Magdalen Street has been taken over by Norfolk County Council and extensively re-vamped. After a total investment of \u00a34&nbsp;million from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as Epic Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are also run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. Epic has commercial, broadcast quality post-production facilities, a real-time virtual studio and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008. Throughout 2008, the centre has concentrated on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows with Les Dennis, Gaby Roslin and Christopher Biggins.\n\n[[Archant]] publishes two daily newspapers in Norwich, the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', and the regional ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'' (EDP), and had its own television operation, [[Mustard TV]], which has now closed after being bought out by the [[That's TV]] group. Mustard TV is now [[That's Norfolk]].\n\nThe character of [[Alan Partridge]] in the sitcom ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'' (1997\u20132002) and the comedy film ''[[Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa]]'' (2013) is a Norwich broadcaster played by [[Steve Coogan]].\n\n===Esoteric associations===\nBecause Norwich was England's second city during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it has, though little acknowledged, a number of significant associations with [[esoteric]] spirituality. It was the home of [[William Cuningham]], a physician who published ''An Invective Epistle in Defense of Astrologers'' in 1560.<ref>Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers by Michael Bryan, edited by Robert Edmund Graves and Sir Walter Armstrong, an 1886\u20131889 publication now in the public domain</ref> The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], author of [[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]], was born in Norwich in 1558.

Many influential esoteric books-titles are listed as once in Browne's [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne#Esoteric|library]].<ref>Catalogue of the libraries of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward Browne, edited with an introduction by J.

Translated from Latin it reads, ''Great Virtues, &hellip; sleeping here the dust of his [[spagyric]] body converts the lead to gold''. Browne is also a significant figure in the history of [[physiognomy]].\n\nThe [[Church of St John Maddermarket]]'s graveyard includes the Crabtree headstone, which has the pre-Christian symbol of the [[Ouroboros]] along with [[Masonic]] [[Square and Compasses]] carved upon it.

Notable examples of [[Secularity|secular]] medieval architecture are [[Dragon Hall, Norwich|Dragon Hall]], built in about 1430, and [[Norwich Guildhall|The Guildhall]], built 1407\u20131413, with later additions. From the 18th century, the pre-eminent local name is [[Thomas Ivory]], who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen's House (1752) in the grounds of the [[Great Hospital]], and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (c. 1761). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and similar period.\n\nThe 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich's size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre, dates from this period. The local architect of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] periods who has continued to command most critical respect was [[George Skipper]] (1856\u20131948). Examples of his work include the headquarters of [[Norwich Union]] on Surrey Street; the [[Art Nouveau]] Royal Arcade; and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of [[Cromer]]. The [[neo-Gothic]] Roman Catholic [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich|cathedral]] dedicated to [[St John the Baptist]] on [[Earlham Road]], begun in 1882, is by [[George Gilbert Scott Junior]] and his brother, [[John Oldrid Scott]].\n\nThe city continued to grow through the 20th century, and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938; at the same time, they moved the [[Norwich War Memorial|City War Memorial]], designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], to sit in a memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to the housing stock in the city centre. Much of the postwar replacement stock was designed by the local-authority architect, David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was the opening of the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1964. Originally designed by [[Denys Lasdun]] (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and [[Rick Mather]].\n\n<gallery heights=\"132\" mode=\"packed\">\nNorwichcathedral2.jpg|Norwich Cathedral lies close to Tombland in the city centre.\nElmHill.jpg|[[Elm Hill, Norwich|Elm Hill]] is an intact medieval street.\nCowtower.jpg|[[Cow Tower, Norwich|Cow Tower]] stands on the banks of the River Wensum.\nGentlemanswalk.JPG|The varying styles of architecture along Gentleman's Walk\n</gallery>\n\n===Parks, gardens and open spaces===\n[[File:Riverside Flats Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 73621.jpg|thumb|Riverside flats Norwich]]\n''See also [[List of parks, gardens and open spaces in Norwich]]''\n\nChapelfield Gardens in central Norwich became the city's first [[public park]] in November 1880.

In the 2018\u20132019 season it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for the 2019-2020 season. Majority-owned by celebrity chef [[Delia Smith]] and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is the [[Carrow Road|Carrow Road Stadium]]. It has a strong [[East Anglian Derby|East Anglian rivalry]] with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The club has enjoyed considerable success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has also won two [[Football League Cup]]s and finished third in the inaugural [[Premier League]] in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its top-flight place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions.\n\nPerhaps Norwich City's most famous result to date came later in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]], in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but they were unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] from the FA Cup in 1959, and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some of the most highly rated talent of that era, including striker [[Chris Sutton]], winger [[Ruel Fox]], defender [[Andy Linighan]], midfielder [[Mike Phelan]], midfielder [[Tim Sherwood]] and striker [[Justin Fashanu]].

The first permanent supply started in 1893 from a generating station in Duke Street. This supplied electricity to local industry and domestic users and, from 1900, the [[Norwich Electric Tramways]]. In the late 1920s a new 40 MW power station was built at Thorpe, this was expanded in 1937 with the addition of a 30 MW \u2018high pressure\u2019 generating plant. These power stations operated until 1975.\u00a0 A gas turbine plant was installed in 1964 to provide power at times of peak demand. This closed in 1986 and the entire Thorpe power station site was demolished and cleared in 1981\u20131982. Two tall electricity pylons stood near the site until they were dismantled in 2017.

City, farewell: I mourn thy cruel fate''.\n\n[[Thomas Fuller]] in his ''The Worthies of England'' described the City in 1662 as:\n: ''Either a city in an orchard or an orchard in a city, so equally are houses and trees blended in it, so that the pleasure of the country and the populousness of the city meet here together. Yet in this mixture, the inhabitants participate nothing of the rusticalness of the one, but altogether the urbanity and civility of the other''.\n\n[[Celia Fiennes]] (1662\u20131741) visited Norwich in 1698 and described it as\n: '' a city walled full round of towers, except on the river side which serves as a wall; they seem the best in repair of any walled city I know''. She also records that three times a year the city held:\n: ''great fairs. &hellip; to which resort a vast concourse of people and wares a full trade'', Norwich being ''a rich, thriving industrious place full of weaving, knitting and dyeing''.\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] in his ''Tour of the whole Island of Great Britain'' (1724) wrote:\n: ''the inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures, dwell in their garrets at their looms, in their combing-shops, so they call them, twisting-mills, and other work-houses; almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors''.\n\n[[John Evelyn]] (1620\u20131706), royalist, traveller and diarist, wrote to [[Sir Thomas Browne]]:\n: '' I hear Norwich is a place very much addicted to the flowery part''. He visited the City as a courtier to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1671 and described it thus:\n: ''The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town''.\n[[James Woodforde]] (1740\u20131803), clergyman, on his first visit to Norwich, wrote in his Diary on 14 April 1775:\n\n: ''We took a walk over the City in the morning, and we both agreed that it was the finest City in England by far, in the center of it is a high Hill and on that a prodigious large old Castle almost perfect and forms a compleat square, round it is a fine Terrass Walk which commands the whole City. There are in the City 36 noble Churches mostly built with flint, besides many meeting Houses of divers sorts. A noble River runs almost thro the Center of the City. The City walls are also very perfect and all round the City but where the River is. On the Hills round the City stand many Wind Mills about a dozen, to be seen from Castle Mount''.\n[[George Borrow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Lavengro]] (1851) wrote of Norwich as:\n: ''A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town &hellip;.There it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound....There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire.... Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?''\n\nBorrow wrote far less favourably of the City in his translation of [[Faust]]:\n: ''They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday's best''.\n\nIn 1812, Andrew Robertson wrote to the painter [[Constable]]:\n: ''I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated &hellip; some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length.

This is done by increasing the duration of the commercial breaks and then decreasing them once the prime-time period is over.  This tactic not only disrupts viewer recordings of the shows, but has a dramatic effect on their regional affiliates such as Prime and Southern Cross who must adapt their inserted commercials breaks as the live play-out from Seven's Melbourne facility occurs which can cause either both the regional [[station identification]] and the Seven identification being displayed with a possible black screen between them or the start of a program being missed entirely by the regional break overlapping.\n\n===Local programs===\nAustralian programming shown on the network includes dramas ''[[Wanted (2016 Australian TV series)|Wanted]]'', soap ''[[Home and Away]]'', lifestyle shows; ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (TV series)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'', gameshows; ''[[The Chase Australia]]'', ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'', reality; ''[[My Kitchen Rules]]'', ''[[House Rules (Australian TV series)|House Rules]]'', ''[[First Dates (Australian TV series)|First Dates]]'' and ''[[Seven Year Switch]]'', factuals; ''[[The Force: Behind the Line|The Force]]'', ''[[Border Security: Australia's Front Line|Border Security]]'', ''[[Highway Patrol (Australian TV series)|Highway Patrol]]'', ''[[Beach Cops]]'', ''[[Surveillance Oz]]'' and ''[[Gold Coast Medical]]''.\n\n===Foreign programs===\nMost US programming that airs on Seven and its digital multichannels is sourced from Seven's deals with [[Disney-ABC International Television]] / [[Disney Media Distribution]] (long running; also shared with [[Disney+]]), [[20th Century Fox|20th Century Studios]] (long running), [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution|NBCUniversal International Television]], [[Sony Pictures Television]] International / [[Sony Pictures Animation]], [[Warner Bros.

The ribbon logo was used between 2000 and 2003 in five colour variants: red, orange, yellow, green and blue, to symbolise ''passion'', ''involving'', ''fun'', ''life'' and ''energy'' respectively. The logo was simplified in 2003, effectively becoming simply two angled trapezoids, losing its gradient, shadows and colour-coded usages to become solid red but first it was used in solid white as an on-screen bug from 2000. In 2012, the Seven logo was slightly modified with the shape of it remaining the same, the upper right corner was lighter red than the remaining logo. On 1 February 2016, it reverted to red trapezoids.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Seven Network 1968.png|ATN-7: 1968 \u2013 5 October 1969\nFile:Seven Network 1970.svg|ATN-7, HSV-7: 5 October 1969 \u2013 28 February 1975, BTQ-7, ADS-7: 5 October 1969 \u2013 July 1976\nFile:Seven 1975-89.png|ATN-7, HSV-7: 1 March 1975 \u2013 23 January 1989, ADS-7: July 1976 \u2013 26 December 1987, BTQ-7: July 1976 \u2013 23 January 1989, TVW-7: October 1977 \u2013 23 January 1989, SAS-7: 27 December 1987 \u2013 23 January 1989\nFile:Seven red 1989.svg|23 January 1989 \u2013 31 December 1999 \nFile:Seven Passion logo.svg|1 January 2000 \u2014 13 September 2003\nFile:Seven Network logo.svg|14 September 2003 \u2013 present\n</gallery>\n\n===Identity history===\n*1959: ''You're in Tune When You're Tuned to Seven'' (ADS-7 only)\n*1960: ''You're on Seven.

This tactic not only disrupts viewer recordings of the shows, but has a dramatic effect on their regional affiliates such as Prime and Southern Cross who must adapt their inserted commercials breaks as the live play-out from Seven's Melbourne facility occurs which can cause either both the regional [[station identification]] and the Seven identification being displayed with a possible black screen between them or the start of a program being missed entirely by the regional break overlapping.\n\n===Local programs===\nAustralian programming shown on the network includes dramas ''[[Wanted (2016 Australian TV series)|Wanted]]'', soap ''[[Home and Away]]'', lifestyle shows; ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (TV series)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'', gameshows; ''[[The Chase Australia]]'', ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'', reality; ''[[My Kitchen Rules]]'', ''[[House Rules (Australian TV series)|House Rules]]'', ''[[First Dates (Australian TV series)|First Dates]]'' and ''[[Seven Year Switch]]'', factuals; ''[[The Force: Behind the Line|The Force]]'', ''[[Border Security: Australia's Front Line|Border Security]]'', ''[[Highway Patrol (Australian TV series)|Highway Patrol]]'', ''[[Beach Cops]]'', ''[[Surveillance Oz]]'' and ''[[Gold Coast Medical]]''.\n\n===Foreign programs===\nMost US programming that airs on Seven and its digital multichannels is sourced from Seven's deals with [[Disney-ABC International Television]] / [[Disney Media Distribution]] (long running; also shared with [[Disney+]]), [[20th Century Fox|20th Century Studios]] (long running), [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution|NBCUniversal International Television]], [[Sony Pictures Television]] International / [[Sony Pictures Animation]], [[Warner Bros.

However, in some states from as early back as 1967 the \"Seven eye\" appeared and continued right through to 1975.  Colour television was introduced across the network and the country on 1 March 1975, along with a new logo incorporating a bright ring of the colours of the visual light spectrum. This logo was used nationally until 23 January 1989, when the recently renamed Seven Network introduced a new red logo with the circle modified to incorporate the \"7\" (similar to the logo then used by [[WJLA-TV#Logos and Imaging|WJLA-TV]] in Washington).  The new logo was rolled out along with evening soap ''[[Home and Away]]'' and a relaunched ''Seven Nightly News'' (later to become ''Seven News'').<ref name=\"atvh-80s\" />\n\nThe current ribbon logo was launched to coincide with the new millennium celebration on 1 January 2000 and the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in Sydney. The ribbon logo was used between 2000 and 2003 in five colour variants: red, orange, yellow, green and blue, to symbolise ''passion'', ''involving'', ''fun'', ''life'' and ''energy'' respectively. The logo was simplified in 2003, effectively becoming simply two angled trapezoids, losing its gradient, shadows and colour-coded usages to become solid red but first it was used in solid white as an on-screen bug from 2000. In 2012, the Seven logo was slightly modified with the shape of it remaining the same, the upper right corner was lighter red than the remaining logo. On 1 February 2016, it reverted to red trapezoids.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Seven Network 1968.png|ATN-7: 1968 \u2013 5 October 1969\nFile:Seven Network 1970.svg|ATN-7, HSV-7: 5 October 1969 \u2013 28 February 1975, BTQ-7, ADS-7: 5 October 1969 \u2013 July 1976\nFile:Seven 1975-89.png|ATN-7, HSV-7: 1 March 1975 \u2013 23 January 1989, ADS-7: July 1976 \u2013 26 December 1987, BTQ-7: July 1976 \u2013 23 January 1989, TVW-7: October 1977 \u2013 23 January 1989, SAS-7: 27 December 1987 \u2013 23 January 1989\nFile:Seven red 1989.svg|23 January 1989 \u2013 31 December 1999 \nFile:Seven Passion logo.svg|1 January 2000 \u2014 13 September 2003\nFile:Seven Network logo.svg|14 September 2003 \u2013 present\n</gallery>\n\n===Identity history===\n*1959: ''You're in Tune When You're Tuned to Seven'' (ADS-7 only)\n*1960: ''You're on Seven.

It has over 12 million registered users and hosts stories in over 40 languages.\n\nThe site is split into nine main categories: [[Anime]]/[[Manga]], [[Book]]s, [[Cartoons]], Miscellaneous, [[Video games|Game]]s, [[Comics]], [[film|Movie]]s, [[Play (theatre)|Plays]]/[[Musical theatre|Musicals]], and [[Television program|TV Show]]s. The site also includes the [[Fictional crossover|Crossover]] category, added on March 27, 2009. Users who complete the free registration process can submit their fan fiction, maintain a [[user profile]], review other stories, apply for a [[beta reader]] position, contact each other via private messages, and maintain a list of favorite stories and authors. There are centralized communities and [[Internet forum|forums]]. In lieu of signing up with a new account, the website allows users to use their [[Google]], [[Facebook]], or [[Twitter]] accounts. The site also owns a Twitter account called FictionPress where users of the website are updated on changes and improvements made.\n\n==Creation==\nIn 1998, Xing Li, a software designer, created FanFiction.Net.<ref name=\"Bermanlame\">Berman, A.S. \"[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/2001-02-22-net038.htm Lame TV season?

Retrieved on May 19, 2011.</ref> The site was created as a repository for fan-created stories that revolved around characters from popular literature, television, comics, or real-world celebrities. Unlike other fan fiction sites, FanFiction.Net allowed stories about any characters rather than revolving around a specific set of characters, such as those from ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Harry Potter]]'', or ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. Registration was open to all people who claimed to be over 18, and by 2002 over 118,000 people were registered. (The age limit has since been moved down to 13.) At that time, one-third of the registrants self-identified as 18 or younger, and 80% were female.<ref name=\"time\"/>\n\n== Rating system ==\nFanfiction.net uses the rating system from FictionRatings.com. This system contains the ratings of K, K+, T, M and MA. The MA rating and explicit violent and/or sexual themes are forbidden.<ref>{{cite web |title=Guidelines - FanFiction.Net |url=https://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/ |website=www.fanfiction.net |publisher=FanFiction.Fet |accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Allowed ratings ===\nCurrently, the ratings K, K+, T and M are allowed.\n\n==== K rating ====\nThe K rating is for audiences ages 5 or older. Any content that is rated K should be completely free of coarse language, adult themes and violence.\n\n==== K+ rating ====\nThe K+ rating is recommended for audiences ages 9 or older. Content that is rated K+ should only contain minor coarse language and violence and should be completely free of adult themes.\n\n==== T rating ====\nThe T rating is not recommended for audiences below age 13. Some non-explicit violence, presence of blood and minor coarse language, as well as minor suggestive adult themes can be used.\n\n==== M rating ====\nThe M rating is only for audiences ages 16 or older. Coarse language, violence and suggestive adult themes are allowed if not too explicit. Fanfictions with these ratings often have sexual references.\n\n=== Not allowed ratings ===\nCurrently, the MA rating is strictly forbidden.\n\n==== MA rating ====\nOnly for people over 18 years old. Many M-rated stories that contain explicit adult themes still exist on Fanfiction.net and are yet to be removed.\n\n==Site content==\nWriters may upload their stories to the site and assign them a category and rating (such as K, K+, T, and M). The ratings are no longer done on the MPAA system, due to cease-and-desist demands from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |title=Please Don't Call It a G-Rated Dispute |first=Pamela Licalzi |last=O'Connell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/18/business/media/18ratings.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 18, 2005 |accessdate=May 20, 2011}}</ref> A list of explanations for the rating system currently employed is available from the drop-down rating menu in each of the individual archives on the site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fictionratings.com/ |title=Fiction Ratings |publisher=Fiction Ratings |date= |access-date=2013-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009212333/http://www.fictionratings.com/ |archive-date=2013-10-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The MA (18+) rating is not permitted on this site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terms of Service|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/|work=FanFiction.net|accessdate=2011-08-26}}</ref> The site does not pay money to people for posting content or charge money for posting on the website,<ref name=\"Bermanlame\"/> and it uses advertisements to pay for costs.\n\nFanFiction.net does not operate a screening or editorial board.<ref name=\"time\"/> Many users leave short reviews after reading stories, most of which are positive.<ref name=\"Bermanlame\"/> While reviews can be left by those without accounts, it is an option for all writers on the site to moderate \"anonymous reviews\", made by those who are not signed into an account.\n\nThe stories are based on books, television series, films, and video games. Stories are about recent works and older works. By 2001, almost 100,000 stories were posted on the website. Steven Savage, a programmer who operated a column on FanFiction.net, described it as \"the adult version of when kids play at being TV characters\" and that the content posted on the website serves as examples for \"when people really care about something.\" A.

N. Elrod]], [[Archie Comics]], [[Dennis L. McKiernan]], Irene Radford, [[J.R. Ward]], [[Laurell K. Hamilton]], [[Nora Roberts]]/J.D. Robb, [[Raymond Feist]], [[Robin Hobb]], [[Robin McKinley]], and [[Terry Goodkind]].<ref name=guidelines>{{cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/ |title=Content Guidelines |publisher=FanFiction.net |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, stories based on real-life celebrities were disallowed around 2003. Fan fiction based on professional wrestling, however, is still allowed, being the number one fandom in the \"Miscellaneous\" category.<ref name=\"guidelines\"/>\n\n===NC-17 ratings===\nOn September 12, 2002, FanFiction.Net banned and removed material that was rated [[MPAA film rating system|NC-17]]. Prior to the new policy, the site would use a pop-up to prompt readers to say whether they were over 17 or not, but since then, the site has relied on its users to report stories that are inappropriately rated. Some NC-17 material was moved to [http://www.adult-fanfiction.org/html-index.php Adult-FanFiction.org] (previously AdultFanFiction.Net), a similar site which was created to serve the adults who write R and NC-17 rated fan fiction. However, many stories containing explicit material still exist and have yet to be removed.\n\nStory titles and summaries must be rated K.<ref name=\"guidelines\"/>\n\n===CYOA (Choose-Your-Own-Adventure)/Reader-Insertion fics===\nThese have been banned since 2005, and the site removed all material that had the potential of inserting the reader into a fanfiction. Under the heading of \"Entries not allowed,\" Item #5 says: ''Any form of interactive entry: choose your adventure, second person/you based, Q&As, etc.''<ref name=guidelines/> <!--What are the potential dangers?-->\n\n===Songfics===\nIn 2005, FanFiction.net banned [[songfic]]s which contain copyrighted lyrics. [[Public domain]] lyrics (such as those to \"[[Amazing Grace]]\") or lyrics written by the author of the fanfiction are allowed, however.\n\n===Lists===\nUntil April 21, 2002, in addition to fiction stories based on existing characters, the site had a section devoted to lists, generally humor-related, for example \"20 Ways to Dump Your Girlfriend\".\n\n==Globalization==\nAt first, FanFiction.net's server was accessible mainly only in the West; and worked poorly, if at all, in other parts of the world. In late 2006, announcements were made of special web links designed for [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. These were supposed to give other areas of the world a significant boost in server speed on the website. In 2007, all three web links were combined under one worldwide link. In an announcement on the home page, it was stated that the site would go global that year.\n\nPrior to the reorganizations of 2002, FanFiction.Net contained approximately 20% of English-language fanfiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternateuniverses.com/ffnstats.html|title=Fanfiction.net Statistics}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Hitwise]], as of August 2007 FanFiction.Net comprised 34.7% of all traffic directed to sites in the Entertainment, Books and Writing category.

It has over 12 million registered users and hosts stories in over 40 languages.\n\nThe site is split into nine main categories: [[Anime]]/[[Manga]], [[Book]]s, [[Cartoons]], Miscellaneous, [[Video games|Game]]s, [[Comics]], [[film|Movie]]s, [[Play (theatre)|Plays]]/[[Musical theatre|Musicals]], and [[Television program|TV Show]]s. The site also includes the [[Fictional crossover|Crossover]] category, added on March 27, 2009. Users who complete the free registration process can submit their fan fiction, maintain a [[user profile]], review other stories, apply for a [[beta reader]] position, contact each other via private messages, and maintain a list of favorite stories and authors. There are centralized communities and [[Internet forum|forums]]. In lieu of signing up with a new account, the website allows users to use their [[Google]], [[Facebook]], or [[Twitter]] accounts. The site also owns a Twitter account called FictionPress where users of the website are updated on changes and improvements made.\n\n==Creation==\nIn 1998, Xing Li, a software designer, created FanFiction.Net.<ref name=\"Bermanlame\">Berman, A.S. \"[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/2001-02-22-net038.htm Lame TV season?

Retrieved on May 19, 2011.</ref> The site was created as a repository for fan-created stories that revolved around characters from popular literature, television, comics, or real-world celebrities. Unlike other fan fiction sites, FanFiction.Net allowed stories about any characters rather than revolving around a specific set of characters, such as those from ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Harry Potter]]'', or ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. Registration was open to all people who claimed to be over 18, and by 2002 over 118,000 people were registered. (The age limit has since been moved down to 13.) At that time, one-third of the registrants self-identified as 18 or younger, and 80% were female.<ref name=\"time\"/>\n\n== Rating system ==\nFanfiction.net uses the rating system from FictionRatings.com. This system contains the ratings of K, K+, T, M and MA.

Any content that is rated K should be completely free of coarse language, adult themes and violence.\n\n==== K+ rating ====\nThe K+ rating is recommended for audiences ages 9 or older. Content that is rated K+ should only contain minor coarse language and violence and should be completely free of adult themes.\n\n==== T rating ====\nThe T rating is not recommended for audiences below age 13. Some non-explicit violence, presence of blood and minor coarse language, as well as minor suggestive adult themes can be used.\n\n==== M rating ====\nThe M rating is only for audiences ages 16 or older. Coarse language, violence and suggestive adult themes are allowed if not too explicit. Fanfictions with these ratings often have sexual references.\n\n=== Not allowed ratings ===\nCurrently, the MA rating is strictly forbidden.\n\n==== MA rating ====\nOnly for people over 18 years old. Many M-rated stories that contain explicit adult themes still exist on Fanfiction.net and are yet to be removed.\n\n==Site content==\nWriters may upload their stories to the site and assign them a category and rating (such as K, K+, T, and M). The ratings are no longer done on the MPAA system, due to cease-and-desist demands from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |title=Please Don't Call It a G-Rated Dispute |first=Pamela Licalzi |last=O'Connell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/18/business/media/18ratings.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 18, 2005 |accessdate=May 20, 2011}}</ref> A list of explanations for the rating system currently employed is available from the drop-down rating menu in each of the individual archives on the site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fictionratings.com/ |title=Fiction Ratings |publisher=Fiction Ratings |date= |access-date=2013-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009212333/http://www.fictionratings.com/ |archive-date=2013-10-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The MA (18+) rating is not permitted on this site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terms of Service|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/|work=FanFiction.net|accessdate=2011-08-26}}</ref> The site does not pay money to people for posting content or charge money for posting on the website,<ref name=\"Bermanlame\"/> and it uses advertisements to pay for costs.\n\nFanFiction.net does not operate a screening or editorial board.<ref name=\"time\"/> Many users leave short reviews after reading stories, most of which are positive.<ref name=\"Bermanlame\"/> While reviews can be left by those without accounts, it is an option for all writers on the site to moderate \"anonymous reviews\", made by those who are not signed into an account.\n\nThe stories are based on books, television series, films, and video games.

{"title_page": "Composer", "text_new": "{{About|composers of music}}\n[[File:Louis-Nicolas Clerambault.jpg|thumb|French composer [[Louis-Nicolas Cl\u00e9rambault]] composing a[[wikt:compono|''comp\u014dn\u014d'']]; literally \"one who puts together\") is a [[musician]] who is an [[author]] of [[music]] in any form, including [[vocal music]] (for a [[Singing|singer]] or [[choir]]), [[instrumental music]], [[electronic music]], and music which combines multiple forms. A composer may create music in any [[music genre]], including, for example, [[classical music]], [[musical theatre]], [[blues]], [[folk music]], [[jazz]], and [[popular music]]. Composers often express their works in a written musical score using [[musical notation]].\n\nMany composers are, or were, also skilled performers of music.\n\n==Composers and performers==\n[[Musical notation]] serves as a set of directions for a performer, but there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in performance. \n\nEven in a conventional Western piece of instrumental music, in which all of the [[Melody|melodies]], [[Chord (music)|chords]], and [[bassline]]s are written out in musical notation, the performer has a degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work, by such means as by varying his or her articulation and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], choosing how long to make [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and \u2014 in the case of bowed string instruments, woodwinds or brass instruments \u2014 deciding whether to use expressive effects such as [[vibrato]] or [[portamento]]. For a singer or instrumental performer, the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed \"interpretation\". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a [[musical composition]] often has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in [[musical theatre]], where the songs may be written by one person, the [[orchestration]] of the accompaniment parts and writing of the [[overture]] is done by an orchestrator, and the words may be written by a third person.\n\nA piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or, in the 20th and 21st century, computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples of this range from [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze, to avant-garde music from the 20th century that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]].\n\nThe nature and means of individual variation of the music is varied, depending on the musical culture in the country and time period it was written. For instance, music composed in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], particularly in slow tempos, often was written in bare outline, with the expectation that the performer would add [[musical improvisation|improvised]] [[ornamentation (music)|ornaments]] to the melody line during a performance. Such freedom generally diminished in later eras, correlating with the increased use by composers of more detailed scoring in the form of dynamics, articulation et cetera; composers becoming uniformly more explicit in how they wished their music to be interpreted, although how strictly and minutely these are dictated varies from one composer to another. Because of this trend of composers becoming increasingly specific and detailed in their instructions to the performer, a culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer's written intention came to be highly valued (see, for example, [[Urtext edition]]). This musical culture is almost certainly related to the high esteem (bordering on veneration) in which the leading classical composers are often held by performers.\n\nThe [[historically informed performance]] movement has revived to some extent the possibility of the performer elaborating in a serious way the music as given in the score, particularly for [[Baroque music]] and music from the early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. The movement might be considered a way of creating ''greater'' faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise. In genres other than classical music, the performer generally has more freedom; thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a \"cover\" of an earlier song, there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original; nor is exact faithfulness necessarily highly valued (with the possible exception of \"note-for-note\" transcriptions of famous [[guitar solo]]s).\n\nIn Western art music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an [[arranger]] to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in his or her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough the creation of popular and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].\n\n==History==\nThe level of distinction between composers and other [[musician]]s varies, which affects issues such as [[copyright]]{{Specify|date=April 2010}} and the deference given to individual interpretations of a particular piece of music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the development of European [[classical music]], the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance. In as much as the role of the composer in western art music has seen continued solidification, in alternative idioms (i.e. [[jazz]], [[experimental music]]) it has in some ways become increasingly complex or vague. For instance, in certain contexts the line between composer and [[performer]], [[sound designer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], [[Record producer|producer]], and other roles, can be quite blurred.\n\n[[File:Seikilos1.tif|thumb|upright|Ancient Greek marble [[stele]], the so-called [[Seikilos epitaph]], with poetry and musical notation engraved on the stone]]\nThe term \"composer\" is often used to refer to composers of [[Instrumental|instrumental music]], such as those found in classical, jazz or other forms of [[Art music|art]] and [[traditional music]]. In [[popular music|popular]] and [[folk music]], the composer is usually called a [[songwriter]], since the music generally takes the form of a [[song]]. Since the mid-20th century, the term has expanded to accommodate creators of [[electroacoustic music]], in which composers directly create sonic material in any of the various [[electronic media]], such as [[reel-to-reel tape]] and electronic [[effects unit]]s, which may be presented to an audience by replaying a tape or other sound recording, or by having live instrumentalists and singers perform with prerecorded material. This is distinct from a 19th-century conception of instrumental composition, where the work was represented solely by a [[Sheet music|musical score]] to be interpreted by [[performers]].\n\n===Ancient Greece===\nMusic was an important part of social and cultural life in [[Ancient Greece]]. We know that composers wrote notated music during the Ancient Greek era because scholars have found the [[Seikilos epitaph]]. The epitaph, written sometime between 200 BC and 100 AD,<ref>{{cite book |last=Landels |first=John G. |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDBMPo1VkhYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Music in Ancient Greece and Rome |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415167765}}</ref> is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, in the world. The song, the melody of which is recorded, alongside its lyrics, in the [[Musical notation#Ancient Greece|ancient Greek musical notation]], was found engraved on a tombstone, a [[stele]], near [[Ayd\u0131n]], [[Turkey]] (not far from [[Ephesus]]). It is a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Ionia|Ionic]] song in either the [[Mode (music)#Greek scales|Phrygian]] [[octave species]] or [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Ionian (Iastian)|Iastian tonos]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[L\u00e9onin]] or [[P\u00e9rotin]]<br /><small>Breves dies hominis</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:#dcdcdc;\" | [[File:Breves dies hominis.ogg|100px]]\n|}\n[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c. 1310\u20131320]]\nDuring the [[Medieval Music|Medieval music]] era (476 to 1400), composers wrote [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. Western Music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation.<!--?--> The only European Medieval repertory that survives from before about 800 is the monophonic [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant.<!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &c.?--> Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[L\u00e9onin]], [[P\u00e9rotin]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].\n\n===Renaissance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|T.L. de Victoria]]<br /><small>Amicus meus</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:#dcdcdc;\" | [[File:AmicusMeus.ogg|100px]]\n|}\n[[File:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''Allegory of Music'' by [[Filippino Lippi]]]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) composers tended to focus more on writing songs about secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread composers' musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. By the middle of the 15th century, composers were writing richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.\n\n===Baroque===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

The Baroque music era began when composers looked back to [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]] for the inspiration to create [[opera]]s (dramatic vocal music accompanied by [[orchestra]]). Another key style of music composers used during this era was [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music. This style of writing required composers to have an advanced knowledge of music theory, as contrapuntal music involves multiple, independent melody lines played by instruments or sung by voices. There were strict counterpoint rules that composers had to learn. German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as [[choir]]s and for keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period, composers developed several major music forms that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the [[concerto]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=Baroque Music |last1=Thornburgh |first1=Elaine |last2=Logan |first2=Jack |work=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=2015-10-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=2015-09-05}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Some of the best-known composers from the Baroque era include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]].\n\n===Classicism===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W.A.

Apart from when writing religious works, composers moved towards writing in a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture, using instrumental melodies that tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed by composers. The main style was [[homophony]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Blume |first=Friedrich |title=Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey |url=https://archive.org/details/classicromanticm00blum |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton & Company |year=1970}}</ref> where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct.\n\nComposers focused on [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the [[concerto]], and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata.\n\nOne of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to [[ballet]] and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as [[opera]] and [[oratorio]] became more popular.\n\nThe best known composers of Classicism are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.\n\n===Romanticism===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[Richard Wagner|R. Wagner]]<br /><small>''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]''</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:silver;\" | [[File:Wagner - die walkure fantasie.ogg|100px]]\n|}\nDuring the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), composers turned the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces. Composers attempted to increase emotional expression and power of their music, and they tried to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. For composers, the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over following textbooks and tradition. Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as [[literature]]), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, composers explored new approaches to use for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, composers created new forms that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. [[Opera]] and [[ballet]] continued to develop.<ref>{{cite web |last=Savage |first=Roger |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43289 |title=Incidental music |work=Grove Music Online |accessdate=2012-08-13 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nIn the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound \"colours\". Composers in the Romantic era increased the size of the orchestra by adding players and using new instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Some Wagnerian orchestras included multiple harps, massive string sections and [[Wagner tuba]]s.\n\n===20th- and 21st-century music===\n[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|[[Jazz]] group consisting of double bassist [[Reggie Workman]], tenor saxophone player [[Pharoah Sanders]], and drummer [[Idris Muhammad]], performing in 1978]]\nIn the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. With [[20th-century music]], there was a vast increase in music listening as the [[radio]] gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music. In the 20th century, [[contemporary classical composer]]s were also influenced by the [[African-American]] [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based [[jazz]] music. The jazz influence can be seen in [[Third Stream]] music and in the compositions of [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The focus of [[art music]] was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. Cage wrote compositions for traditional classical instruments and unusual sound-producing devices not normally thought of as instruments, such as radios. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music on tape gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Schaeffer |first=Pierre |year=1966 |title=Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux |location=Paris |publisher=\u00c9ditions du Seuil}}</ref> and [[Musique concr\u00e8te]] schools of electronic composition, in which composers made pieces using [[reel-to-reel tape]] recorders and electronic equipment.\n\n==Role of women==\n{{Main article|Women in music#Composers|List of female composers by birth date}}\n[[File:Julius Giere - Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren (Lithographie 1835).jpg|thumb|upright|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]\nIn 1993, American [[musicologist]] [[Marcia Citron]] asked \"[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?\"<ref name=\"Citron, Marcia J 1993\">{{cite book|last=Citron|first=Marcia J.|authorlink=Marcia Citron|title=Gender and the Musical Canon|publisher=CUP Archive|year=1993|isbn=9780521392921}}</ref> Citron \"examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works.\" She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.<ref name=\"Citron, Marcia J 1993\" />\n\nAccording to Abbey Philips, \"women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve.\"<ref name=\"rvanews.com\">{{cite web |last=Philips |first=Abbey |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=The history of women and gender roles in music |website=Rvanews.com |date=September 1, 2011 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}</ref> During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer that is mentioned.<ref name=\"rvanews.com\" /> Philips states that \"[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts.\"<ref name=\"rvanews.com\" />\n\nWomen today are being taken more seriously in the realm of concert music, though the statistics of recognition, prizes, employment, and overall opportunities are still biased toward men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wqxr.org/story/her-music-emerging-female-composer-today/|publisher=[[WQXR-FM|WQXR]]|title=Her Music: Today's Emerging Female Composer|author=Alex Ambrose|date=21 August 2014|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Clustering==\nFamous composers have a tendency to cluster in certain cities throughout history.

Berlin appears in the top ten ranking only in the 18th century, and was ranked third most important city in both the 19th and 20th centuries. New York City entered the rankings in the 19th century (at fifth place) and stood at second rank in the 20th century. The patterns are very similar for a sample of 522 top composers.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Birth Location, Migration, and Clustering of Important Composers |journal=Historical Methods |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=81\u201390 |last1=O'Hagan |first1=John |last2=Borowiecki |first2=Karol |date=July 8, 2010 |doi=10.1080/01615441003729945}}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nProfessional classical composers often have a background in performing classical music during their childhood and teens, either as a [[singer]] in a [[choir]], as a player in a [[youth orchestra]], or as a performer on a solo instrument (e.g., [[piano]], [[pipe organ]], or [[violin]]). Teens aspiring to be composers can continue their [[postsecondary]] studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral and choral singing experience for composition students. Universities offer a range of composition programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to get coaching from composers.\n\n===Undergraduate===\nBachelor's degrees in composition (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual composition lessons, amateur orchestra/choral experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, composition students must complete significant pieces or songs before graduating. Not all composers hold a B.Mus. in composition; composers may also hold a B.Mus. in music performance or music theory.\n\n===Masters===\nMaster of music degrees (M.mus.) in composition consist of private lessons with a composition professor, ensemble experience, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two concerts featuring the composition student's pieces. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often a required minimum credential for people who wish to teach composition at a university or conservatory. A composer with an M.Mus. could be an adjunct professor or instructor at a university, but it would be difficult in the 2010s to obtain a [[tenure track]] [[professor]] position with this degree.\n\n===Doctoral===\nTo become a tenure track professor, many universities require a [[doctoral degree]]. In composition, the key doctoral degree is the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], rather than the [[PhD]]; the PhD is awarded in music, but typically for subjects such as [[musicology]] and [[music theory]].\n\nDoctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in composition provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Students must submit examples of their compositions. If available, some schools will also accept video or audio recordings of performances of the student's pieces. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination are required.\n\nStudents must prepare significant compositions under the guidance of faculty composition professors. Some schools require DMA composition students to present concerts of their works, which are typically performed by singers or musicians from the school. The completion of advanced coursework and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program. During a D.M.A. program, a composition student may get experience teaching undergraduate music students.\n\n===Other routes===\nSome classical composers did not complete composition programs, but focused their studies on performance of voice or an instrument or on [[music theory]], and developed their compositional skills over the course of a career in another musical occupation.\n\n==Employment==\nDuring the Middle Ages, most composers worked for the [[Catholic church]] and composed music for religious services such as [[plainchant]] melodies. During the [[Renaissance music]] era, composers typically worked for aristocratic employers. While aristocrats typically required composers to produce a significant amount of religious music, such as [[Mass (music)|Mass]]es, composers also penned many non-religious songs on the topic of [[courtly love]]: the respectful, reverential love of a great woman from afar. Courtly love songs were very popular during the Renaissance era. During the [[Baroque music]] era, many composers were employed by aristocrats or as church employees. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], composers began to organize more public concerts for profit, which helped composers to be less dependent on aristocratic or church jobs. This trend continued in the [[Romantic music]] era in the 19th century. In the 20th century, composers began to seek employment as professors in universities and conservatories. In the 20th century, composers also earned money from the sales of their works, such [[sheet music]] publications of their songs or pieces or as [[sound recording]]s of their works.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of composers]]\n* [[Kapellmeister]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Composers}}\n* {{dmoz|/Arts/Music/Organizations/By_Composer/|Composer societies}}\n* {{dmoz|/Arts/Music/Composition/Composers/|Composers}}\n* {{dmoz|/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music/Composers_and_Arrangers/|Composers and arrangers}}\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

A composer may create music in any [[music genre]], including, for example, [[classical music]], [[musical theatre]], [[blues]], [[folk music]], [[jazz]], and [[popular music]]. Composers often express their works in a written musical score using [[musical notation]].\n\nMany composers are, or were, also skilled performers of music.\n\n==Composers and performers==\n[[Musical notation]] serves as a set of directions for a performer, but there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in performance. \n\nEven in a conventional Western piece of instrumental music, in which all of the [[Melody|melodies]], [[Chord (music)|chords]], and [[bassline]]s are written out in musical notation, the performer has a degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work, by such means as by varying his or her articulation and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], choosing how long to make [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and \u2014 in the case of bowed string instruments, woodwinds or brass instruments \u2014 deciding whether to use expressive effects such as [[vibrato]] or [[portamento]]. For a singer or instrumental performer, the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed \"interpretation\". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nAlthough a [[musical composition]] often has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in [[musical theatre]], where the songs may be written by one person, the [[orchestration]] of the accompaniment parts and writing of the [[overture]] is done by an orchestrator, and the words may be written by a third person.\n\nA piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or, in the 20th and 21st century, computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples of this range from [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze, to avant-garde music from the 20th century that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]].\n\nThe nature and means of individual variation of the music is varied, depending on the musical culture in the country and time period it was written. For instance, music composed in the [[Baroque music|Baroque era]], particularly in slow tempos, often was written in bare outline, with the expectation that the performer would add [[musical improvisation|improvised]] [[ornamentation (music)|ornaments]] to the melody line during a performance. Such freedom generally diminished in later eras, correlating with the increased use by composers of more detailed scoring in the form of dynamics, articulation et cetera; composers becoming uniformly more explicit in how they wished their music to be interpreted, although how strictly and minutely these are dictated varies from one composer to another. Because of this trend of composers becoming increasingly specific and detailed in their instructions to the performer, a culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer's written intention came to be highly valued (see, for example, [[Urtext edition]]). This musical culture is almost certainly related to the high esteem (bordering on veneration) in which the leading classical composers are often held by performers.\n\nThe [[historically informed performance]] movement has revived to some extent the possibility of the performer elaborating in a serious way the music as given in the score, particularly for [[Baroque music]] and music from the early [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. The movement might be considered a way of creating ''greater'' faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise. In genres other than classical music, the performer generally has more freedom; thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a \"cover\" of an earlier song, there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original; nor is exact faithfulness necessarily highly valued (with the possible exception of \"note-for-note\" transcriptions of famous [[guitar solo]]s).\n\nIn Western art music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an [[arranger]] to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in his or her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough the creation of popular and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].\n\n==History==\nThe level of distinction between composers and other [[musician]]s varies, which affects issues such as [[copyright]]{{Specify|date=April 2010}} and the deference given to individual interpretations of a particular piece of music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In the development of European [[classical music]], the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance. In as much as the role of the composer in western art music has seen continued solidification, in alternative idioms (i.e. [[jazz]], [[experimental music]]) it has in some ways become increasingly complex or vague. For instance, in certain contexts the line between composer and [[performer]], [[sound designer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], [[Record producer|producer]], and other roles, can be quite blurred.\n\n[[File:Seikilos1.tif|thumb|upright|Ancient Greek marble [[stele]], the so-called [[Seikilos epitaph]], with poetry and musical notation engraved on the stone]]\nThe term \"composer\" is often used to refer to composers of [[Instrumental|instrumental music]], such as those found in classical, jazz or other forms of [[Art music|art]] and [[traditional music]]. In [[popular music|popular]] and [[folk music]], the composer is usually called a [[songwriter]], since the music generally takes the form of a [[song]]. Since the mid-20th century, the term has expanded to accommodate creators of [[electroacoustic music]], in which composers directly create sonic material in any of the various [[electronic media]], such as [[reel-to-reel tape]] and electronic [[effects unit]]s, which may be presented to an audience by replaying a tape or other sound recording, or by having live instrumentalists and singers perform with prerecorded material. This is distinct from a 19th-century conception of instrumental composition, where the work was represented solely by a [[Sheet music|musical score]] to be interpreted by [[performers]].\n\n===Ancient Greece===\nMusic was an important part of social and cultural life in [[Ancient Greece]]. We know that composers wrote notated music during the Ancient Greek era because scholars have found the [[Seikilos epitaph]]. The epitaph, written sometime between 200 BC and 100 AD,<ref>{{cite book |last=Landels |first=John G. |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PDBMPo1VkhYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Music in Ancient Greece and Rome |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415167765}}</ref> is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, in the world. The song, the melody of which is recorded, alongside its lyrics, in the [[Musical notation#Ancient Greece|ancient Greek musical notation]], was found engraved on a tombstone, a [[stele]], near [[Ayd\u0131n]], [[Turkey]] (not far from [[Ephesus]]). It is a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Ionia|Ionic]] song in either the [[Mode (music)#Greek scales|Phrygian]] [[octave species]] or [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Ionian (Iastian)|Iastian tonos]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[L\u00e9onin]] or [[P\u00e9rotin]]<br /><small>Breves dies hominis</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:#dcdcdc;\" | [[File:Breves dies hominis.ogg|100px]]\n|}\n[[File:Head of Christ1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Musical notation]] from a Catholic [[Missal]], c. 1310\u20131320]]\nDuring the [[Medieval Music|Medieval music]] era (476 to 1400), composers wrote [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. Western Music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation.<!--?--> The only European Medieval repertory that survives from before about 800 is the monophonic [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called Gregorian chant.<!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &c.?--> Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[L\u00e9onin]], [[P\u00e9rotin]] and [[Guillaume de Machaut]].\n\n===Renaissance===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|T.L. de Victoria]]<br /><small>Amicus meus</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:#dcdcdc;\" | [[File:AmicusMeus.ogg|100px]]\n|}\n[[File:Filippino Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''Allegory of Music'' by [[Filippino Lippi]]]]\nDuring the [[Renaissance music]] era (c. 1400 to 1600) composers tended to focus more on writing songs about secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread composers' musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. By the middle of the 15th century, composers were writing richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.\n\n===Baroque===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

The Baroque music era began when composers looked back to [[Music of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek music]] for the inspiration to create [[opera]]s (dramatic vocal music accompanied by [[orchestra]]). Another key style of music composers used during this era was [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music. This style of writing required composers to have an advanced knowledge of music theory, as contrapuntal music involves multiple, independent melody lines played by instruments or sung by voices. There were strict counterpoint rules that composers had to learn. German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as [[choir]]s and for keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period, composers developed several major music forms that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the [[concerto]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=Baroque Music |last1=Thornburgh |first1=Elaine |last2=Logan |first2=Jack |work=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=2015-10-27 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=2015-09-05}}</ref> The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Some of the best-known composers from the Baroque era include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Dieterich Buxtehude]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]].\n\n===Classicism===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W.A.

Molto allegro.ogg|100px]]\n|}\nComposers of music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical Period]] (1750 to 1830) looked to the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome, to the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. Apart from when writing religious works, composers moved towards writing in a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture, using instrumental melodies that tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed by composers. The main style was [[homophony]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Blume |first=Friedrich |title=Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey |url=https://archive.org/details/classicromanticm00blum |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton & Company |year=1970}}</ref> where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct.\n\nComposers focused on [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the [[concerto]], and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata.\n\nOne of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to [[ballet]] and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as [[opera]] and [[oratorio]] became more popular.\n\nThe best known composers of Classicism are [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.\n\n===Romanticism===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; float:left; margin-right:50px;\"\n|-\n! align=center | [[Richard Wagner|R. Wagner]]<br /><small>''[[Die Walk\u00fcre]]''</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; background:silver;\" | [[File:Wagner - die walkure fantasie.ogg|100px]]\n|}\nDuring the [[Romantic music]] era (c. 1810 to 1900), composers turned the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces. Composers attempted to increase emotional expression and power of their music, and they tried to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. For composers, the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over following textbooks and tradition. Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as [[literature]]), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, composers explored new approaches to use for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, composers created new forms that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. [[Opera]] and [[ballet]] continued to develop.<ref>{{cite web |last=Savage |first=Roger |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43289 |title=Incidental music |work=Grove Music Online |accessdate=2012-08-13 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nIn the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound \"colours\". Composers in the Romantic era increased the size of the orchestra by adding players and using new instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Some Wagnerian orchestras included multiple harps, massive string sections and [[Wagner tuba]]s.\n\n===20th- and 21st-century music===\n[[File:PharoahSanders.jpg|thumb|[[Jazz]] group consisting of double bassist [[Reggie Workman]], tenor saxophone player [[Pharoah Sanders]], and drummer [[Idris Muhammad]], performing in 1978]]\nIn the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other instruments. With [[20th-century music]], there was a vast increase in music listening as the [[radio]] gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music. In the 20th century, [[contemporary classical composer]]s were also influenced by the [[African-American]] [[jazz improvisation|improvisation]]-based [[jazz]] music. The jazz influence can be seen in [[Third Stream]] music and in the compositions of [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The focus of [[art music]] was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. Cage wrote compositions for traditional classical instruments and unusual sound-producing devices not normally thought of as instruments, such as radios. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music on tape gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Schaeffer |first=Pierre |year=1966 |title=Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux |location=Paris |publisher=\u00c9ditions du Seuil}}</ref> and [[Musique concr\u00e8te]] schools of electronic composition, in which composers made pieces using [[reel-to-reel tape]] recorders and electronic equipment.\n\n==Role of women==\n{{Main article|Women in music#Composers|List of female composers by birth date}}\n[[File:Julius Giere - Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren (Lithographie 1835).jpg|thumb|upright|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]\nIn 1993, American [[musicologist]] [[Marcia Citron]] asked \"[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?\"<ref name=\"Citron, Marcia J 1993\">{{cite book|last=Citron|first=Marcia J.|authorlink=Marcia Citron|title=Gender and the Musical Canon|publisher=CUP Archive|year=1993|isbn=9780521392921}}</ref> Citron \"examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works.\" She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.<ref name=\"Citron, Marcia J 1993\" />\n\nAccording to Abbey Philips, \"women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve.\"<ref name=\"rvanews.com\">{{cite web |last=Philips |first=Abbey |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=The history of women and gender roles in music |website=Rvanews.com |date=September 1, 2011 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}</ref> During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer that is mentioned.<ref name=\"rvanews.com\" /> Philips states that \"[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts.\"<ref name=\"rvanews.com\" />\n\nWomen today are being taken more seriously in the realm of concert music, though the statistics of recognition, prizes, employment, and overall opportunities are still biased toward men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wqxr.org/story/her-music-emerging-female-composer-today/|publisher=[[WQXR-FM|WQXR]]|title=Her Music: Today's Emerging Female Composer|author=Alex Ambrose|date=21 August 2014|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n==Clustering==\nFamous composers have a tendency to cluster in certain cities throughout history.

It was ranked fifth in the 15th and 16th centuries but first in the 17th to 20th centuries inclusive. London was the second most meaningful city: eighth in the 15th century, seventh in the 16th, fifth in the 17th, second in the 18th and 19th centuries, and fourth in the 20th century. Rome topped the rankings in the 15th century, dropped to second in the 16th and 17th centuries, eighth in the 18th century, ninth in the 19th century but back at sixth in the 20th century. Berlin appears in the top ten ranking only in the 18th century, and was ranked third most important city in both the 19th and 20th centuries. New York City entered the rankings in the 19th century (at fifth place) and stood at second rank in the 20th century. The patterns are very similar for a sample of 522 top composers.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Birth Location, Migration, and Clustering of Important Composers |journal=Historical Methods |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=81\u201390 |last1=O'Hagan |first1=John |last2=Borowiecki |first2=Karol |date=July 8, 2010 |doi=10.1080/01615441003729945}}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nProfessional classical composers often have a background in performing classical music during their childhood and teens, either as a [[singer]] in a [[choir]], as a player in a [[youth orchestra]], or as a performer on a solo instrument (e.g., [[piano]], [[pipe organ]], or [[violin]]). Teens aspiring to be composers can continue their [[postsecondary]] studies in a variety of formal training settings, including colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur orchestral and choral singing experience for composition students. Universities offer a range of composition programs, including bachelor's degrees, Master of Music degrees, and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees. As well, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and festivals, which give students the opportunity to get coaching from composers.\n\n===Undergraduate===\nBachelor's degrees in composition (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include individual composition lessons, amateur orchestra/choral experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Usually, composition students must complete significant pieces or songs before graduating. Not all composers hold a B.Mus. in composition; composers may also hold a B.Mus. in music performance or music theory.\n\n===Masters===\nMaster of music degrees (M.mus.) in composition consist of private lessons with a composition professor, ensemble experience, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two concerts featuring the composition student's pieces. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an M.Mus. or M.M.) is often a required minimum credential for people who wish to teach composition at a university or conservatory. A composer with an M.Mus. could be an adjunct professor or instructor at a university, but it would be difficult in the 2010s to obtain a [[tenure track]] [[professor]] position with this degree.\n\n===Doctoral===\nTo become a tenure track professor, many universities require a [[doctoral degree]]. In composition, the key doctoral degree is the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], rather than the [[PhD]]; the PhD is awarded in music, but typically for subjects such as [[musicology]] and [[music theory]].\n\nDoctor of Musical Arts (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in composition provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Students must submit examples of their compositions. If available, some schools will also accept video or audio recordings of performances of the student's pieces. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination are required.\n\nStudents must prepare significant compositions under the guidance of faculty composition professors. Some schools require DMA composition students to present concerts of their works, which are typically performed by singers or musicians from the school. The completion of advanced coursework and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D.M.A program. During a D.M.A. program, a composition student may get experience teaching undergraduate music students.\n\n===Other routes===\nSome classical composers did not complete composition programs, but focused their studies on performance of voice or an instrument or on [[music theory]], and developed their compositional skills over the course of a career in another musical occupation.\n\n==Employment==\nDuring the Middle Ages, most composers worked for the [[Catholic church]] and composed music for religious services such as [[plainchant]] melodies. During the [[Renaissance music]] era, composers typically worked for aristocratic employers. While aristocrats typically required composers to produce a significant amount of religious music, such as [[Mass (music)|Mass]]es, composers also penned many non-religious songs on the topic of [[courtly love]]: the respectful, reverential love of a great woman from afar. Courtly love songs were very popular during the Renaissance era. During the [[Baroque music]] era, many composers were employed by aristocrats or as church employees. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]], composers began to organize more public concerts for profit, which helped composers to be less dependent on aristocratic or church jobs. This trend continued in the [[Romantic music]] era in the 19th century. In the 20th century, composers began to seek employment as professors in universities and conservatories. In the 20th century, composers also earned money from the sales of their works, such [[sheet music]] publications of their songs or pieces or as [[sound recording]]s of their works.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of composers]]\n* [[Kapellmeister]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Composers}}\n* {{dmoz|/Arts/Music/Organizations/By_Composer/|Composer societies}}\n* {{dmoz|/Arts/Music/Composition/Composers/|Composers}}\n* {{dmoz|/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music/Composers_and_Arrangers/|Composers and arrangers}}\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

A tall, strong and powerfully built man, Hall was a genuine [[fast bowler]] and despite his very long run up, he was renowned for his ability to bowl long spells. Hall played 48 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] from 1958 to 1969. Hall's opening bowling partnership with fellow Barbadian [[Charlie Griffith]] was a feature of the strong West Indies teams throughout the 1960s. Hall was one of the most popular cricketers of his day and was especially popular in Australia, where he played two seasons in the [[Sheffield Shield]] with [[Queensland cricket team|Queensland]].\n\nA [[wicket-keeper]]/[[batsman]] as a schoolboy, Hall did not take up fast bowling until relatively late. He was included in the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1957|West Indies squad to tour England in 1957]] having only played one match of [[first-class cricket]]. He made his Test cricket debut against India in 1958 and was instantly successful. He took a [[List of Test cricket hat-tricks|Test hat-trick]] in Pakistan in 1959, the first West Indian cricketer to do so. Hall bowled the final over in two famous Test matches, the [[Tied Test]] against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] in 1960 and the [[Lord's]] Test against [[England cricket team|England]] in 1963. Years of non-stop cricket and resultant injury reduced Hall's effectiveness in the latter part of his Test career.\n\nAfter his playing days Hall entered Barbadian politics, serving in both the Barbados [[Senate of Barbados|Senate]] and [[House of Assembly]] and appointed [[Government of Barbados|Minister of Tourism]] in 1987. He was also involved in the administration of West Indies cricket as a [[Selector (sport)|selector]] and team manager and served as President of the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] from 2001 to 2003. Hall was later ordained a minister in the Christian [[Pentecostal Church]]. He is a member of the [[ICC Cricket Hall of Fame]] and the [[West Indies Cricket Hall of Fame]]. In 2012 he was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] for services to sport and the community.\n\n==Early life and career==\nHall was born in [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]], Barbados\u2014\"just outside the walls of [HM Prison] [[HMP Glendairy|Glendairy]]\"\u2014to a teenaged mother, his father a sometime light-heavyweight boxer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wes Hall|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1086/1086.html|work=Player Oracle|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=19 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=Hail>{{cite news|last=Spooner|first=Philip|title=All hail Hall!|url=http://barpublish.bits.baseview.com/story/294891617270184.php|accessdate=26 July 2011|newspaper=The Nation|date=14 October 2007}}</ref><ref name=favourite /> Hall began his schooling at St Giles' Boys' School and later obtained a place at the renowned [[Combermere School]] thanks to a free scholarship.<ref name=\"Hall19\">Hall (1965), pp. 19\u201320.</ref><ref name=Marshall>{{cite web|title=Cancer Claims Marshall|url=http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography/bio_MalcolmMarshall_lateWIbowler.htm|publisher=Trinidad & Tobago National Library and Information Service|accessdate=26 July 2011|date=5 November 1999}}</ref> At Combermere, he played for the school cricket team initially as a wicketkeeper/batsman. At the time the leading schools in Barbados played against grown men in the elite Division 1 of the [[Barbados Cricket Association]] and Hall was exposed to a high standard of cricket at an early age. One of his teammates at Combermere was the school groundskeeper, the West Indian Test cricketer [[Frank King (West Indian cricketer)|Frank King]].<ref name=\"Hall19\"/>\n\nAfter completing his schooling, Hall found employment with the cable office in [[Bridgetown]]. Hall played for the [[LIME Sports Club|Cable Office cricket team]] and it was there that Hall took up fast bowling. In a match against [[Wanderers Cricket Club|Wanderers]], Hall was asked to fill in when his team's regular opening bowler was absent.

A tall, strong and powerfully built man, Hall was a genuine [[fast bowler]] and despite his very long run up, he was renowned for his ability to bowl long spells. Hall played 48 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] from 1958 to 1969. Hall's opening bowling partnership with fellow Barbadian [[Charlie Griffith]] was a feature of the strong West Indies teams throughout the 1960s. Hall was one of the most popular cricketers of his day and was especially popular in Australia, where he played two seasons in the [[Sheffield Shield]] with [[Queensland cricket team|Queensland]].\n\nA [[wicket-keeper]]/[[batsman]] as a schoolboy, Hall did not take up fast bowling until relatively late. He was included in the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1957|West Indies squad to tour England in 1957]] having only played one match of [[first-class cricket]]. He made his Test cricket debut against India in 1958 and was instantly successful. He took a [[List of Test cricket hat-tricks|Test hat-trick]] in Pakistan in 1959, the first West Indian cricketer to do so. Hall bowled the final over in two famous Test matches, the [[Tied Test]] against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] in 1960 and the [[Lord's]] Test against [[England cricket team|England]] in 1963. Years of non-stop cricket and resultant injury reduced Hall's effectiveness in the latter part of his Test career.\n\nAfter his playing days Hall entered Barbadian politics, serving in both the Barbados [[Senate of Barbados|Senate]] and [[House of Assembly]] and appointed [[Government of Barbados|Minister of Tourism]] in 1987. He was also involved in the administration of West Indies cricket as a [[Selector (sport)|selector]] and team manager and served as President of the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] from 2001 to 2003. Hall was later ordained a minister in the Christian [[Pentecostal Church]]. He is a member of the [[ICC Cricket Hall of Fame]] and the [[West Indies Cricket Hall of Fame]]. In 2012 he was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] for services to sport and the community.\n\n==Early life and career==\nHall was born in [[Saint Michael, Barbados|Saint Michael]], Barbados\u2014\"just outside the walls of [HM Prison] [[HMP Glendairy|Glendairy]]\"\u2014to a teenaged mother, his father a sometime light-heavyweight boxer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wes Hall|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/1/1086/1086.html|work=Player Oracle|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=19 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=Hail>{{cite news|last=Spooner|first=Philip|title=All hail Hall!|url=http://barpublish.bits.baseview.com/story/294891617270184.php|accessdate=26 July 2011|newspaper=The Nation|date=14 October 2007}}</ref><ref name=favourite /> Hall began his schooling at St Giles' Boys' School and later obtained a place at the renowned [[Combermere School]] thanks to a free scholarship.<ref name=\"Hall19\">Hall (1965), pp. 19\u201320.</ref><ref name=Marshall>{{cite web|title=Cancer Claims Marshall|url=http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography/bio_MalcolmMarshall_lateWIbowler.htm|publisher=Trinidad & Tobago National Library and Information Service|accessdate=26 July 2011|date=5 November 1999}}</ref> At Combermere, he played for the school cricket team initially as a wicketkeeper/batsman. At the time the leading schools in Barbados played against grown men in the elite Division 1 of the [[Barbados Cricket Association]] and Hall was exposed to a high standard of cricket at an early age. One of his teammates at Combermere was the school groundskeeper, the West Indian Test cricketer [[Frank King (West Indian cricketer)|Frank King]].<ref name=\"Hall19\"/>\n\nAfter completing his schooling, Hall found employment with the cable office in [[Bridgetown]]. Hall played for the [[LIME Sports Club|Cable Office cricket team]] and it was there that Hall took up fast bowling. In a match against [[Wanderers Cricket Club|Wanderers]], Hall was asked to fill in when his team's regular opening bowler was absent. He took six wickets that day and decided that bowling would be his path to the West Indies team.<ref>Hall (1965), pp. 20\u201321.</ref> His talent was soon recognised and in 1956 he was included in the [[Barbados national cricket team|Barbados team]] to play [[E.

Hall, still very young and inexperienced, did not take a wicket in the match, his [[first-class cricket]] debut.<ref name=\"FCDebut\">{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21910.html|title=Barbados v EW Swanton's XI|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref> Hall was unlucky, however, not to pick up a wicket having [[Colin Cowdrey]] dropped by [[Kenneth Branker]] at first slip.<ref>Hall, p. 22.</ref> Despite the lack of success Hall did catch the eye of Swanton who marked him down as a bowler of \"great promise\".<ref>Hall, p. 22</ref>\n\nBased partly on this promise, Hall was selected in the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1957|West Indian squad to tour England in 1957]].

They are tied as the fifth-longest cantilever bridges in the world. Each span carries four general-use automobile lanes; additionally the westbound span has two reversible [[High-occupancy vehicle|HOV]] lanes across the river.\n\nIt is the farthest downstream bridge on the Mississippi River. It is also the widest and most heavily traveled bridge on the lower Mississippi; the only other comparable bridges on the Mississippi are in the [[St. Louis]] area, those being the [[Poplar Street Bridge]], the [[Jefferson Barracks Bridge]], and the [[Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge]].\n{{wide image|NewOrleansPanoramic.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|Skyline of New Orleans Central Business District from the Mississippi River facing west with the Crescent City Connection in the foreground to the left}}\n\n==History==\nWhat later became known as the Crescent City Connection was the second bridge to span the Mississippi south of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], the first being the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], a few miles upriver from the city, and it is the first bridge across the river in New Orleans itself.\n\nThe Mississippi River Bridge Authority, known since 1989 as the [[Crescent City Connection Division]] (CCCD), began construction of the first span in November 1954, which opened in April 1958 as the Greater New Orleans Bridge. At its opening, the bridge was the longest cantilever bridge in the world although in terms of main span length, it was third, after the [[Forth Bridge]] and the [[Quebec Bridge]]. It carried two lanes of traffic in each direction and spurred growth in the suburban area known as the West Bank (named for its location on the western bank of the river although it is geographically southeast of New Orleans). Construction of the second span began in March 1981. Despite promises that it would be ready for the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]], it did not open to traffic until September 1988. The second span was originally designated as the Greater New Orleans Bridge No. 2. Both bridges were designed by [[Ralph Modjeski|Modjeski & Masters, Inc.]]. As soon as the new span was opened, the old span was temporarily closed in phases to replace the asphalt-on-steel deck with concrete. All the exits and entrances to the bridge were replaced as well.\n\nAfter the completion of the second span, a public contest was held in 1989 to rename the bridges, which was won by Jennifer Grodsky, of St. Clement of Rome School in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], [[Louisiana]], on March 17.<ref name=\"March181999\">{{cite news |last = Marsh |first = Barri |title = Students Find a Name that Connects: Winning Class Savors Victory |location = New Orleans |work = [[The Times-Picayune]] |page = A1 |date = March 18, 1989 |url =  |access-date = }}</ref>{{Verify source|date=April 2020}} The name was selected over the second-place finisher, the Greater New Orleans Superspan, as the name for the spans.<ref name=\"March181999\"/> Other names voted on for the naming of the spans included: the Crescent City Twins, the Delta Twins, the Crescent City Bridge, the New Orleans Metro Span, the Crescent City Gateway, the Crescent City Twin Span, the Crescent City River Bridge, The Big Easy and the Li'l Easy, the Jazz City Bridge, the Big East Twin Spans, The Pelican Bridge, the Fleur-de-Lis, the Greater Mississippi River Bridge, the Unity Bridge, the Mississippi River Twins, The Friendship Connection, The Pelican Pride, the Riverview Bridge, the Creole Crossing, the Jazz Gate Bridge, the Greater New Orleans Twin Bridges, and the Crescent Bend Bridge.<ref name=\"February161989\">{{cite news |last = Atkinson |first = Paul |title = 25 Names Chosen for Bridge Contest |location = New Orleans |work = The Times-Picayune |page = A1 |date = February 16, 1989 |url =  |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nFollowing this contest, the Louisiana Legislature officially designated the bridges as the Crescent City Connection. (The bridge is commonly known among local [[Vietnamese Americans]] as {{lang|vi|C\u1ea7u Con C\u00f2}}, the \"Pelican Bridge\", due to blue signs at either end that feature a pelican from [[Flag of Louisiana|the state flag]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Orleans, N\u1eeda N\u0103m Sau B\u00e3o Katrina|trans-title=New Orleans half a year after Hurricane Katrina|author=\u0110\u00e0o Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Ph\u00fac|location=Westminster, California|work=Vi\u1ec7t B\u00e1o Daily News|date=February 15, 2006|accessdate=August 23, 2018|url=https://vietbao.com/a45919/new-orleans-nua-nam-sau-bao-katrina|language=vi}}</ref>) Beginning in 1989, it was maintained and policed as a toll bridge by the CCCD, a special division of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, although a 2013 vote removed the tolls, and the crossing is now overseen by the Louisiana Department of Public Safety. This separate state police agency used elsewhere in the state, is required because of the high traffic volume and the fact that the two spans briefly cross into Jefferson Parish and the city of Gretna, Louisiana. Since renaming of the twin bridges, some local residents refer to the bridge as \"The GNO\", in spite of the name change from decades past. Most people refer to it as the \"CCC\", whereas the proper name of \"Crescent City Connection\" is used mainly in the media.\n\nDue to the Mississippi River's winding course through the New Orleans area (the river is flowing north at the place where the two bridges cross), the bridge contains two [[wrong-way concurrency|wrong-way concurrencies]], with the ''east''bound span carrying Business US 90 ''West'', while the ''west''bound span carries Business US 90 ''East''. The Crescent City Connection was the fifth most traveled toll bridge in the United States in 2006, with annual traffic exceeding 63 million vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dotd.state.la.us/operations/cccd/bridges.asp |title = CCCD Bridges |access-date = August 16, 2006 |author = Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development |publisher = Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development }}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is the centerpiece of the Crescent Connection Road Race (CCRR)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ccff.org/site7.php |title = Crescent City Road Race |access-date = December 12, 2006 |author = Crescent City Fitness Foundation |publisher = Crescent City Fitness Foundation }}</ref> or Bridge Race as it is locally known, an annual event held on the first Saturday in September following Labor Day. The bridge remains open to vehicular traffic during the race, which only uses the two HOV lanes. The CCRR was originally started as a fundraiser for the bridge's decorative lights. These lights line the top profile lines of both bridges; 64 lights along each string for a total 256 lights.\n\n===Hurricane Katrina===\nAs [[Hurricane Katrina]] approached the city in August 2005, the CCCD halted toll collections on August 26 to aid in speed of evacuation of the Metro area. Two overhead signs were blown down on the older span, but no other damage occurred to either bridge. After the storm hit on August 29, 2005, much of the east bank of New Orleans flooded severely (see [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans]]). With all other major and minor highways out of town flooded in both directions, the CCC was the only open highway into or out of the east bank of [[Orleans Parish]]. (One other route, Leake Avenue/Old River Road, a small road along the Mississippi River levee, was initially blocked by debris but was cleared by local volunteer work). Two days after the storm passed, the Gretna police set up a roadblock on the bridge, refusing passage to evacuees.<ref name=\"Lawsuit\">{{cite news |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4200/is_20061009/ai_n16769340 |title = Gretna Police Blocking Passage of New Orleanians Seeking Refuge |access-date = April 23, 2007 |first = Richard A |last = Webster |work = New Orleans CityBusiness |year = 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn the initial weeks following the storm, only emergency personnel and contractors were permitted to use the bridge. The bridge reopened to traffic in mid-September as decreasing water levels on the East Bank of Orleans Parish allowed [[Interstate 10]] to reopen and residents to return, but then was temporarily closed to regular traffic again when another evacuation was declared due to [[Hurricane Rita]], with the bridge again reopening in late September. Toll collection resumed on October 10 after a six-week suspension, as the revenue was needed to maintain operations.<ref name=\"Tolls Resume\"/> Long lines at the toll booth lanes during non-rush times became common, due to a shortage of toll collectors and electronic toll tags, combined with heavy usage of the bridge due to the many New Orleanians staying with friends and relatives on the Westbank while they worked on gutting and repairing their flooded Eastbank homes.\n\n==={{Anchor|Interstate 49}}Proposed Future Interstate 49 designation===\n\nIn addition to the CCC's designation as Business US 90, the bridge, along with its approach roads, the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] and [[Westbank Expressway]] were proposed to also serve as [[Interstate 910]]. This proposed designation was federal only and no signs identify the bridge as I-910. This is a temporary designation until [[Interstate 49]] is completed between New Orleans and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], at which time the bridge will be signed as I-49.

They are tied as the fifth-longest cantilever bridges in the world. Each span carries four general-use automobile lanes; additionally the westbound span has two reversible [[High-occupancy vehicle|HOV]] lanes across the river.\n\nIt is the farthest downstream bridge on the Mississippi River. It is also the widest and most heavily traveled bridge on the lower Mississippi; the only other comparable bridges on the Mississippi are in the [[St. Louis]] area, those being the [[Poplar Street Bridge]], the [[Jefferson Barracks Bridge]], and the [[Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge]].\n{{wide image|NewOrleansPanoramic.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|Skyline of New Orleans Central Business District from the Mississippi River facing west with the Crescent City Connection in the foreground to the left}}\n\n==History==\nWhat later became known as the Crescent City Connection was the second bridge to span the Mississippi south of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], the first being the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], a few miles upriver from the city, and it is the first bridge across the river in New Orleans itself.\n\nThe Mississippi River Bridge Authority, known since 1989 as the [[Crescent City Connection Division]] (CCCD), began construction of the first span in November 1954, which opened in April 1958 as the Greater New Orleans Bridge. At its opening, the bridge was the longest cantilever bridge in the world although in terms of main span length, it was third, after the [[Forth Bridge]] and the [[Quebec Bridge]]. It carried two lanes of traffic in each direction and spurred growth in the suburban area known as the West Bank (named for its location on the western bank of the river although it is geographically southeast of New Orleans). Construction of the second span began in March 1981. Despite promises that it would be ready for the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]], it did not open to traffic until September 1988. The second span was originally designated as the Greater New Orleans Bridge No. 2. Both bridges were designed by [[Ralph Modjeski|Modjeski & Masters, Inc.]]. As soon as the new span was opened, the old span was temporarily closed in phases to replace the asphalt-on-steel deck with concrete. All the exits and entrances to the bridge were replaced as well.\n\nAfter the completion of the second span, a public contest was held in 1989 to rename the bridges, which was won by Jennifer Grodsky, of St. Clement of Rome School in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], [[Louisiana]], on March 17.<ref name=\"March181999\">{{cite news |last = Marsh |first = Barri |title = Students Find a Name that Connects: Winning Class Savors Victory |location = New Orleans |work = [[The Times-Picayune]] |page = A1 |date = March 18, 1989 |url =  |access-date = }}</ref>{{Verify source|date=April 2020}} The name was selected over the second-place finisher, the Greater New Orleans Superspan, as the name for the spans.<ref name=\"March181999\"/> Other names voted on for the naming of the spans included: the Crescent City Twins, the Delta Twins, the Crescent City Bridge, the New Orleans Metro Span, the Crescent City Gateway, the Crescent City Twin Span, the Crescent City River Bridge, The Big Easy and the Li'l Easy, the Jazz City Bridge, the Big East Twin Spans, The Pelican Bridge, the Fleur-de-Lis, the Greater Mississippi River Bridge, the Unity Bridge, the Mississippi River Twins, The Friendship Connection, The Pelican Pride, the Riverview Bridge, the Creole Crossing, the Jazz Gate Bridge, the Greater New Orleans Twin Bridges, and the Crescent Bend Bridge.<ref name=\"February161989\">{{cite news |last = Atkinson |first = Paul |title = 25 Names Chosen for Bridge Contest |location = New Orleans |work = The Times-Picayune |page = A1 |date = February 16, 1989 |url =  |access-date = }}</ref>\n\nFollowing this contest, the Louisiana Legislature officially designated the bridges as the Crescent City Connection. (The bridge is commonly known among local [[Vietnamese Americans]] as {{lang|vi|C\u1ea7u Con C\u00f2}}, the \"Pelican Bridge\", due to blue signs at either end that feature a pelican from [[Flag of Louisiana|the state flag]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New Orleans, N\u1eeda N\u0103m Sau B\u00e3o Katrina|trans-title=New Orleans half a year after Hurricane Katrina|author=\u0110\u00e0o Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Ph\u00fac|location=Westminster, California|work=Vi\u1ec7t B\u00e1o Daily News|date=February 15, 2006|accessdate=August 23, 2018|url=https://vietbao.com/a45919/new-orleans-nua-nam-sau-bao-katrina|language=vi}}</ref>) Beginning in 1989, it was maintained and policed as a toll bridge by the CCCD, a special division of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, although a 2013 vote removed the tolls, and the crossing is now overseen by the Louisiana Department of Public Safety. This separate state police agency used elsewhere in the state, is required because of the high traffic volume and the fact that the two spans briefly cross into Jefferson Parish and the city of Gretna, Louisiana. Since renaming of the twin bridges, some local residents refer to the bridge as \"The GNO\", in spite of the name change from decades past. Most people refer to it as the \"CCC\", whereas the proper name of \"Crescent City Connection\" is used mainly in the media.\n\nDue to the Mississippi River's winding course through the New Orleans area (the river is flowing north at the place where the two bridges cross), the bridge contains two [[wrong-way concurrency|wrong-way concurrencies]], with the ''east''bound span carrying Business US 90 ''West'', while the ''west''bound span carries Business US 90 ''East''. The Crescent City Connection was the fifth most traveled toll bridge in the United States in 2006, with annual traffic exceeding 63 million vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dotd.state.la.us/operations/cccd/bridges.asp |title = CCCD Bridges |access-date = August 16, 2006 |author = Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development |publisher = Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development }}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is the centerpiece of the Crescent Connection Road Race (CCRR)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ccff.org/site7.php |title = Crescent City Road Race |access-date = December 12, 2006 |author = Crescent City Fitness Foundation |publisher = Crescent City Fitness Foundation }}</ref> or Bridge Race as it is locally known, an annual event held on the first Saturday in September following Labor Day. The bridge remains open to vehicular traffic during the race, which only uses the two HOV lanes. The CCRR was originally started as a fundraiser for the bridge's decorative lights. These lights line the top profile lines of both bridges; 64 lights along each string for a total 256 lights.\n\n===Hurricane Katrina===\nAs [[Hurricane Katrina]] approached the city in August 2005, the CCCD halted toll collections on August 26 to aid in speed of evacuation of the Metro area. Two overhead signs were blown down on the older span, but no other damage occurred to either bridge. After the storm hit on August 29, 2005, much of the east bank of New Orleans flooded severely (see [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans]]). With all other major and minor highways out of town flooded in both directions, the CCC was the only open highway into or out of the east bank of [[Orleans Parish]]. (One other route, Leake Avenue/Old River Road, a small road along the Mississippi River levee, was initially blocked by debris but was cleared by local volunteer work). Two days after the storm passed, the Gretna police set up a roadblock on the bridge, refusing passage to evacuees.<ref name=\"Lawsuit\">{{cite news |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4200/is_20061009/ai_n16769340 |title = Gretna Police Blocking Passage of New Orleanians Seeking Refuge |access-date = April 23, 2007 |first = Richard A |last = Webster |work = New Orleans CityBusiness |year = 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn the initial weeks following the storm, only emergency personnel and contractors were permitted to use the bridge. The bridge reopened to traffic in mid-September as decreasing water levels on the East Bank of Orleans Parish allowed [[Interstate 10]] to reopen and residents to return, but then was temporarily closed to regular traffic again when another evacuation was declared due to [[Hurricane Rita]], with the bridge again reopening in late September. Toll collection resumed on October 10 after a six-week suspension, as the revenue was needed to maintain operations.<ref name=\"Tolls Resume\"/> Long lines at the toll booth lanes during non-rush times became common, due to a shortage of toll collectors and electronic toll tags, combined with heavy usage of the bridge due to the many New Orleanians staying with friends and relatives on the Westbank while they worked on gutting and repairing their flooded Eastbank homes.\n\n==={{Anchor|Interstate 49}}Proposed Future Interstate 49 designation===\n\nIn addition to the CCC's designation as Business US 90, the bridge, along with its approach roads, the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] and [[Westbank Expressway]] were proposed to also serve as [[Interstate 910]]. This proposed designation was federal only and no signs identify the bridge as I-910. This is a temporary designation until [[Interstate 49]] is completed between New Orleans and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], at which time the bridge will be signed as I-49. This proposed designation currently does not have funding to support all the needed infrastructure to accomplish the plan and has largely been dropped.\n\n{{Wide image|New Orleans Convention Center.jpeg|1000px|The [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center]] in front of the Crescent City Connection in 2001}}\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Tolls==\n[[Image:CrescentCityConnectionTolls16Mch07.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Westbank toll plaza in March 2007]]\n\nThe tolls collected on the Crescent City Connection were defined in Louisiana state law R.S. 47:820.5(B).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.legis.state.la.us/lss/lss.asp?doc=102576 |title = RS 47:820.5 |access-date = August 16, 2006 |publisher = State of Louisiana }}</ref> This law said that from October 1, 1994 through December 31, 2012, tolls were to be collected at a rate of $0.20 per axle for toll tag users, and $0.50 per axle for cash users.

{"title_page": "Kurtosis", "text_new": "{{Short description|fourth standardized moment in statistics}}\n{{Use American English|date = January 2019}}\n\nIn [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], '''kurtosis''' (from {{lang-el|\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}, ''kyrtos'' or ''kurtos'', meaning \"curved, arching\") is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the [[probability distribution]] of a [[real number|real]]-valued [[random variable]]. Like [[skewness]], kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different measures of kurtosis may have different [[#Interpretation|interpretations]].\n\nThe standard measure of a distribution's kurtosis, originating with [[Karl Pearson]],{{r|Pearson1905}} is a scaled version of the fourth [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of the distribution. This number is related to the tails of the distribution, not its peak;{{r|Westfall2014}} hence, the sometimes-seen characterization of kurtosis as \"peakedness\" is incorrect. For this measure, higher kurtosis corresponds to greater extremity of [[Deviation (statistics)|deviations]] (or outliers), and not the configuration of data near the mean.\n\nThe kurtosis of any univariate [[normal distribution]] is&nbsp;3.  It is common to compare the kurtosis of a distribution to this value.  Distributions with kurtosis less than&nbsp;3 are said to be ''platykurtic'', although this does not imply the distribution is \"flat-topped\" as is sometimes stated. Rather, it means the distribution produces fewer and less extreme outliers than does the normal distribution. An example of a platykurtic distribution is the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]], which does not produce outliers.  Distributions with kurtosis greater than 3 are said to be ''leptokurtic''.  An example of a leptokurtic distribution is the [[Laplace distribution]], which has tails that asymptotically approach zero more slowly than a Gaussian, and therefore produces more outliers than the normal distribution. It is also common practice to use an adjusted version of Pearson's kurtosis, the excess kurtosis, which is the kurtosis minus 3, to provide the comparison to the [[normal distribution]].  Some authors use \"kurtosis\" by itself to refer to the excess kurtosis.  For clarity and generality, however, this article follows the non-excess convention and explicitly indicates where excess kurtosis is meant.\n\nAlternative measures of kurtosis are: the [[L-kurtosis]], which is a scaled version of the fourth [[L-moment]]; measures based on four population or sample [[quantiles]].{{r|Joanes1998}} These are analogous to the alternative measures of [[skewness]] that are not based on ordinary moments.{{r|Joanes1998}}\n\n== Pearson moments ==\nThe kurtosis is the fourth [[standardized moment]], defined as\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Kurt}[X] = \\operatorname{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^4\\right] = \\frac{\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu)^4]}{(\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu)^2])^2} = \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4},\n</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc''<sub>4</sub> is the fourth [[central moment]] and \u03c3 is the [[standard deviation]]. Several letters are used in the literature to denote the kurtosis.  A very common choice is ''\u03ba'', which is fine as long as it is clear that it does not refer to a [[cumulant]].  Other choices include ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub>, to be similar to the notation for skewness, although sometimes this is instead reserved for the excess kurtosis.\n\nThe kurtosis is bounded below by the squared [[skewness]] plus 1:{{r|Pearson1916|p=432}}\n:<math> \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4} \\geq \\left(\\frac{\\mu_3}{\\sigma^3}\\right)^2 + 1,</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc''<sub>3</sub> is the third [[central moment]]. The lower bound is realized by the [[Bernoulli distribution]]. There is no upper limit to the kurtosis of a general probability distribution, and it may be infinite.\n\nA reason why some authors favor the excess kurtosis is that cumulants are [[intensive and extensive properties|extensive]].  Formulas related to the extensive property are more naturally expressed in terms of the excess kurtosis.  For example, let ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> be independent random variables for which the fourth moment exists, and let ''Y'' be the random variable defined by the sum of the ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>.  The excess kurtosis of ''Y'' is\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] - 3 =  \\frac{1}{( \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sigma_j^{\\,2})^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sigma_i^{\\,4} \\cdot \\left(\\operatorname{Kurt}[X_i] - 3\\right),</math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma_i</math> is the standard deviation of <math>X_i</math>.  In particular if all of the ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> have the same variance, then this simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] - 3 = {1 \\over n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\operatorname{Kurt}[X_i] - 3).</math>\n\nThe reason not to subtract off 3 is that the bare [[fourth moment]] better generalizes to [[multivariate distribution]]s, especially when independence is not assumed.  The [[cokurtosis]] between pairs of variables is an order four [[tensor]].  For a bivariate normal distribution, the cokurtosis tensor has off-diagonal terms that are neither 0 nor 3 in general, so attempting to \"correct\" for an excess becomes confusing.  It is true, however, that the joint cumulants of degree greater than two for any [[multivariate normal distribution]] are zero.\n\nFor two random variables, ''X'' and ''Y'', not necessarily independent, the kurtosis of the sum, ''X''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''Y'', is\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Kurt}[X+Y] = {1 \\over \\sigma_{X+Y}^4} \\big( & \\sigma_X^4\\operatorname{Kurt}[X] + 4\\sigma_X^3\\sigma_Y\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,X,X,Y] \\\\\n& {} + 6\\sigma_X^2\\sigma_Y^2\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,X,Y,Y] \\\\[6pt]\n& {} + 4\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y^3\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,Y,Y,Y] + \\sigma_Y^4\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] \\big).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nNote that the [[binomial coefficient]]s appear in the above equation.\n\n=== Interpretation ===\nThe exact interpretation of the Pearson measure of kurtosis (or excess kurtosis) used to be disputed, but is now settled. As Westfall notes in 2014{{r|Westfall2014}}, ''\"...its only unambiguous interpretation is in terms of tail extremity; i.e., either existing outliers (for the sample kurtosis) or propensity to produce outliers (for the kurtosis of a probability distribution).\"'' The logic is simple: Kurtosis is the average (or [[expected value]]) of the [[standardized data]] raised to the fourth power. Any standardized values that are less than 1 (i.e., data within one standard deviation of the mean, where the \"peak\" would be), contribute virtually nothing to kurtosis, since raising a number that is less than 1 to the fourth power makes it closer to zero. The only data values (observed or observable) that contribute to kurtosis in any meaningful way are those outside the region of the peak; i.e., the outliers. Therefore, kurtosis measures outliers only; it measures nothing about the \"peak\".\n\nMany incorrect interpretations of kurtosis that involve notions of peakedness have been given. One is that kurtosis measures both the \"peakedness\" of the distribution and the [[heavy-tailed distribution|heaviness of its tail]].{{r|Balanda1988}} Various other incorrect interpretations have been suggested, such as \"lack of shoulders\" (where the \"shoulder\" is defined vaguely as the area between the peak and the tail, or more specifically as the area about one [[standard deviation]] from the mean) or \"bimodality\".{{r|Darlington1970}} Balanda and [[Helen MacGillivray|MacGillivray]] assert that the standard definition of kurtosis \"is a poor measure of the kurtosis, peakedness, or tail weight of a distribution\"{{r|Balanda1988|p=114}} and instead propose to \"define kurtosis vaguely as the location- and scale-free movement of [[probability mass]] from the [[shoulders of a distribution]] into its center and tails\".{{r|Balanda1988}}\n\n===Moors' interpretation===\n\nIn 1986 Moors gave an interpretation of kurtosis.{{r|Moors1986}} Let\n  \n:<math> Z = \\frac{ X - \\mu } \\sigma, </math> \n \nwhere ''X'' is a random variable, ''\u03bc'' is the mean and ''\u03c3'' is the standard deviation.\n\nNow by definition of the kurtosis <math> \\kappa </math>, and by the well-known identity <math> E[V^2] = \\operatorname{var}[V] + [E[V]]^2, </math>\n\n:<math> \\kappa = E[ Z^4 ]  = \\operatorname{var}[ Z^2 ] + [E[Z^2]]^2  = \\operatorname{var}[ Z^2 ] + [\\operatorname{var}[Z]]^2 = \\operatorname{var}[ Z^2 ] + 1 </math>.\n\nThe kurtosis can now be seen as a measure of the dispersion of ''Z''<sup>2</sup> around its expectation. Alternatively it can be seen to be a measure of the dispersion of ''Z'' around +1 and&nbsp;\u22121. ''\u03ba'' attains its minimal value in a symmetric two-point distribution. In terms of the original variable ''X'', the kurtosis is a measure of the dispersion of ''X'' around the two values ''\u03bc''&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;''\u03c3''.\n\nHigh values of ''\u03ba'' arise in two circumstances:\n \n* where the probability mass is concentrated around the mean and the data-generating process produces occasional values far from the mean, \n* where the probability mass is concentrated in the tails of the distribution.\n\n== Excess kurtosis ==\n\nThe ''excess kurtosis'' is defined as kurtosis minus&nbsp;3. There are 3 distinct regimes as described below.\n\n=== Mesokurtic ===\nDistributions with zero excess kurtosis are called '''mesokurtic''', or mesokurtotic. The most prominent example of a mesokurtic distribution is the normal distribution family, regardless of the values of its [[parameter]]s. A few other well-known distributions can be mesokurtic, depending on parameter values: for example, the [[binomial distribution]] is mesokurtic for <math>p = 1/2 \\pm \\sqrt{1/12}</math>.\n\n=== Leptokurtic ===\nA distribution with [[Positive number|positive]] excess kurtosis is called '''leptokurtic''', or leptokurtotic. \"Lepto-\" means \"slender\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lepto- | title=Lepto-}}</ref> In terms of shape, a leptokurtic distribution has ''[[Fat-tailed distribution|fatter tails]]''. Examples of leptokurtic distributions include the [[Student's t-distribution]], [[Rayleigh distribution]],  [[Laplace distribution]], [[exponential distribution]], [[Poisson distribution]] and the [[logistic distribution]].  Such distributions are sometimes termed ''super-Gaussian''.{{r|Beneviste1980}}\n\n=== Platykurtic ===\n[[File:1909 US Penny.jpg|thumb|The [[coin toss]] is the most platykurtic distribution]]\nA distribution with [[Negative number|negative]] excess kurtosis is called '''platykurtic''', or platykurtotic. \"Platy-\" means \"broad\".<ref>http://www.yourdictionary.com/platy-prefix</ref> In terms of shape, a platykurtic distribution has ''thinner tails''. Examples of platykurtic distributions include the [[Continuous uniform distribution|continuous]] and [[discrete uniform distribution]]s, and the [[raised cosine distribution]]. The most platykurtic distribution of all is the [[Bernoulli distribution]] with ''p'' = 1/2 (for example the number of times one obtains \"heads\" when flipping a coin once, a [[coin toss]]), for which the excess kurtosis is \u22122. Such distributions are sometimes termed ''[[sub-Gaussian distribution]]'', originally proposed by [[Jean-Pierre Kahane]]{{r|Kahane1960}} and further described by Buldygin and Kozachenko.{{r|Buldygin1980}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Graphical examples ==\n\n=== The Pearson type VII family ===\n[[Image:Pearson type VII distribution PDF.png|300px|thumb|[[Probability density function|pdf]] for the Pearson type VII distribution with excess kurtosis of infinity (red); 2 (blue); and 0 (black)]]\n[[Image:Pearson type VII distribution log-PDF.png|300px|thumb|log-pdf for the Pearson type VII distribution with excess kurtosis of infinity (red); 2 (blue); 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 (gray); and 0 (black)]]\n\nThe effects of kurtosis are illustrated using a [[parametric family]] of distributions whose kurtosis can be adjusted while their lower-order moments and cumulants remain constant. Consider the [[Pearson distribution|Pearson type VII family]], which is a special case of the [[Pearson distribution|Pearson type IV family]] restricted to symmetric densities. The [[probability density function]] is given by\n\n:<math>f(x; a, m) = \\frac{\\Gamma(m)}{a\\,\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\Gamma(m-1/2)} \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^2 \\right]^{-m}, \\!</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is a [[scale parameter]] and ''m'' is a [[shape parameter]].\n\nAll densities in this family are symmetric. The ''k''th moment exists provided ''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;(''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2. For the kurtosis to exist, we require ''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;5/2. Then the mean and [[skewness]] exist and are both identically zero. Setting ''a''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''m''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3 makes the variance equal to unity. Then the only free parameter is ''m'', which controls the fourth moment (and cumulant) and hence the kurtosis.  One can reparameterize with <math>m = 5/2 + 3/\\gamma_2</math>, where <math>\\gamma_2</math> is the excess kurtosis as defined above. This yields a one-parameter leptokurtic family with zero mean, unit variance, zero skewness, and arbitrary non-negative excess kurtosis. The reparameterized density is\n\n:<math>g(x; \\gamma_2) = f\\left(x;\\; a = \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{6}{\\gamma_2}},\\; m = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{\\gamma_2}\\right). \\!</math>\n\nIn the limit as <math>\\gamma_2 \\to \\infty</math> one obtains the density\n\n:<math>g(x) = 3\\left(2 + x^2\\right)^{-\\frac{5}{2}}, \\!</math>\n\nwhich is shown as the red curve in the images on the right.\n\nIn the other direction as <math>\\gamma_2 \\to 0</math> one obtains the [[normal distribution|standard normal]] density as the limiting distribution, shown as the black curve.\n\nIn the images on the right, the blue curve represents the density <math>x \\mapsto g(x; 2)</math> with excess kurtosis of 2.  The top image shows that leptokurtic densities in this family have a higher peak than the mesokurtic normal density, although this conclusion is only valid for this select family of distributions. The comparatively fatter tails of the leptokurtic densities are illustrated in the second image, which plots the natural logarithm of the Pearson type VII densities: the black curve is the logarithm of the standard normal density, which is a [[parabola]]. One can see that the normal density allocates little probability mass to the regions far from the mean (\"has thin tails\"), compared with the blue curve of the leptokurtic Pearson type VII density with excess kurtosis of 2.  Between the blue curve and the black are other Pearson type VII densities with ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16.  The red curve again shows the upper limit of the Pearson type VII family, with <math>\\gamma_2 = \\infty</math> (which, strictly speaking, means that the fourth moment does not exist). The red curve decreases the slowest as one moves outward from the origin (\"has fat tails\").\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Other well-known distributions ===\n[[Image:Standard symmetric pdfs.png|300px|thumb|[[Probability density function]]s for selected distributions with [[expected value|mean]] 0, [[variance]] 1 and different excess kurtosis]]\n[[Image:Standard symmetric pdfs logscale.png|300px|thumb|[[Logarithm]]s of [[probability density function]]s for selected distributions with [[expected value|mean]] 0, [[variance]] 1 and different excess kurtosis]]\n\nSeveral well-known, unimodal and symmetric distributions from different parametric families are compared here.  Each has a mean and skewness of zero. The parameters have been chosen to result in a variance equal to 1 in each case. The images on the right show curves for the following seven densities, on a [[linear scale]] and [[logarithmic scale]]:\n\n* D: [[Laplace distribution]], also known as the double exponential distribution, red curve (two straight lines in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 3\n* S: [[hyperbolic secant distribution]], orange curve, excess kurtosis = 2\n* L: [[logistic distribution]], green curve, excess kurtosis = 1.2\n* N: [[normal distribution]], black curve (inverted parabola in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 0\n* C: [[raised cosine distribution]], cyan curve, excess kurtosis = \u22120.593762...\n* W: [[Wigner semicircle distribution]], blue curve, excess kurtosis = \u22121\n* U: [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]], magenta curve (shown for clarity as a rectangle in both images), excess kurtosis = \u22121.2.\n\nNote that in these cases the platykurtic densities have bounded [[Support (mathematics)|support]], whereas the densities with positive or zero excess kurtosis are supported on the whole [[real line]].\n\nOne cannot infer that high or low kurtosis distributions have the characteristics indicated by these examples. There exist platykurtic densities with infinite support,\n*e.g., [[exponential power distribution]]s with sufficiently large shape parameter ''b''\n\nand there exist leptokurtic densities with finite support.\n*e.g., a distribution that is uniform between \u22123 and \u22120.3, between \u22120.3 and 0.3, and between 0.3 and 3, with the same density in the (\u22123, \u22120.3) and (0.3, 3) intervals, but with 20 times more density in the (\u22120.3, 0.3) interval\n\nAlso, there exist platykurtic densities with infinite peakedness,\n*e.g., an equal mixture of the [[beta distribution]] with parameters 0.5 and 1 with its reflection about 0.0 \n\nand there exist leptokurtic densities that appear flat-topped,\n*e.g., a mixture of distribution that is uniform between -1 and 1 with a T(4.0000001) [[Student's t-distribution]], with mixing probabilities 0.999 and 0.001.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sample kurtosis ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nFor a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of ''n'' values the '''sample excess kurtosis''' is\n\n:<math> g_2 = \\frac{m_4}{m_2^2} -3 = \\frac{\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^4}{\\left[\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2\\right]^2} - 3 </math>\n\nwhere ''m''<sub>4</sub> is the fourth sample [[moment about the mean]], ''m''<sub>2</sub> is the second sample moment about the mean (that is, the [[sample variance]]), ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> is the ''i''<sup>th</sup> value, and <math>\\overline{x}</math> is the [[sample mean]].\n\nThis formula has the simpler representation,\n\n:<math> g_2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n z_i^4  - 3 </math>\n\nwhere the <math> z_i </math> values are the standardized data values using the standard deviation defined using ''n'' rather than ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 in the denominator.\n\nFor example, suppose the data values are 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 999.\n\nThen the  <math> z_i </math> values are \u22120.239, \u22120.225, \u22120.221, \u22120.234, \u22120.230, \u22120.225, \u22120.239, \u22120.230, \u22120.234, \u22120.225, \u22120.230, \u22120.239, \u22120.230, \u22120.230, \u22120.225, \u22120.230, \u22120.216, \u22120.230, \u22120.225, 4.359\n\nand the <math> z_i^4 </math> values are  0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 360.976.\n\nThe average of these values is 18.05 and the excess kurtosis is thus 18.05&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;15.05.  This example makes it clear that data near the \"middle\" or \"peak\" of the distribution do not contribute to the kurtosis statistic, hence kurtosis does not measure \"peakedness\".

Like [[skewness]], kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and, like skewness, there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different measures of kurtosis may have different [[#Interpretation|interpretations]].\n\nThe standard measure of a distribution's kurtosis, originating with [[Karl Pearson]],{{r|Pearson1905}} is a scaled version of the fourth [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of the distribution. This number is related to the tails of the distribution, not its peak;{{r|Westfall2014}} hence, the sometimes-seen characterization of kurtosis as \"peakedness\" is incorrect. For this measure, higher kurtosis corresponds to greater extremity of [[Deviation (statistics)|deviations]] (or outliers), and not the configuration of data near the mean.\n\nThe kurtosis of any univariate [[normal distribution]] is&nbsp;3.  It is common to compare the kurtosis of a distribution to this value.  Distributions with kurtosis less than&nbsp;3 are said to be ''platykurtic'', although this does not imply the distribution is \"flat-topped\" as is sometimes stated. Rather, it means the distribution produces fewer and less extreme outliers than does the normal distribution. An example of a platykurtic distribution is the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]], which does not produce outliers.  Distributions with kurtosis greater than 3 are said to be ''leptokurtic''.  An example of a leptokurtic distribution is the [[Laplace distribution]], which has tails that asymptotically approach zero more slowly than a Gaussian, and therefore produces more outliers than the normal distribution. It is also common practice to use an adjusted version of Pearson's kurtosis, the excess kurtosis, which is the kurtosis minus 3, to provide the comparison to the [[normal distribution]].  Some authors use \"kurtosis\" by itself to refer to the excess kurtosis.  For clarity and generality, however, this article follows the non-excess convention and explicitly indicates where excess kurtosis is meant.\n\nAlternative measures of kurtosis are: the [[L-kurtosis]], which is a scaled version of the fourth [[L-moment]]; measures based on four population or sample [[quantiles]].{{r|Joanes1998}} These are analogous to the alternative measures of [[skewness]] that are not based on ordinary moments.{{r|Joanes1998}}\n\n== Pearson moments ==\nThe kurtosis is the fourth [[standardized moment]], defined as\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Kurt}[X] = \\operatorname{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^4\\right] = \\frac{\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu)^4]}{(\\operatorname{E}[(X-\\mu)^2])^2} = \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4},\n</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc''<sub>4</sub> is the fourth [[central moment]] and \u03c3 is the [[standard deviation]]. Several letters are used in the literature to denote the kurtosis.  A very common choice is ''\u03ba'', which is fine as long as it is clear that it does not refer to a [[cumulant]].  Other choices include ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub>, to be similar to the notation for skewness, although sometimes this is instead reserved for the excess kurtosis.\n\nThe kurtosis is bounded below by the squared [[skewness]] plus 1:{{r|Pearson1916|p=432}}\n:<math> \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\sigma^4} \\geq \\left(\\frac{\\mu_3}{\\sigma^3}\\right)^2 + 1,</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc''<sub>3</sub> is the third [[central moment]]. The lower bound is realized by the [[Bernoulli distribution]]. There is no upper limit to the kurtosis of a general probability distribution, and it may be infinite.\n\nA reason why some authors favor the excess kurtosis is that cumulants are [[intensive and extensive properties|extensive]].  Formulas related to the extensive property are more naturally expressed in terms of the excess kurtosis.  For example, let ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> be independent random variables for which the fourth moment exists, and let ''Y'' be the random variable defined by the sum of the ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>.  The excess kurtosis of ''Y'' is\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] - 3 =  \\frac{1}{( \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sigma_j^{\\,2})^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sigma_i^{\\,4} \\cdot \\left(\\operatorname{Kurt}[X_i] - 3\\right),</math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma_i</math> is the standard deviation of <math>X_i</math>.  In particular if all of the ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> have the same variance, then this simplifies to\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] - 3 = {1 \\over n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\operatorname{Kurt}[X_i] - 3).</math>\n\nThe reason not to subtract off 3 is that the bare [[fourth moment]] better generalizes to [[multivariate distribution]]s, especially when independence is not assumed.  The [[cokurtosis]] between pairs of variables is an order four [[tensor]].  For a bivariate normal distribution, the cokurtosis tensor has off-diagonal terms that are neither 0 nor 3 in general, so attempting to \"correct\" for an excess becomes confusing.  It is true, however, that the joint cumulants of degree greater than two for any [[multivariate normal distribution]] are zero.\n\nFor two random variables, ''X'' and ''Y'', not necessarily independent, the kurtosis of the sum, ''X''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''Y'', is\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Kurt}[X+Y] = {1 \\over \\sigma_{X+Y}^4} \\big( & \\sigma_X^4\\operatorname{Kurt}[X] + 4\\sigma_X^3\\sigma_Y\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,X,X,Y] \\\\\n& {} + 6\\sigma_X^2\\sigma_Y^2\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,X,Y,Y] \\\\[6pt]\n& {} + 4\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y^3\\operatorname{Cokurt}[X,Y,Y,Y] + \\sigma_Y^4\\operatorname{Kurt}[Y] \\big).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nNote that the [[binomial coefficient]]s appear in the above equation.\n\n=== Interpretation ===\nThe exact interpretation of the Pearson measure of kurtosis (or excess kurtosis) used to be disputed, but is now settled. As Westfall notes in 2014{{r|Westfall2014}}, ''\"...its only unambiguous interpretation is in terms of tail extremity; i.e., either existing outliers (for the sample kurtosis) or propensity to produce outliers (for the kurtosis of a probability distribution).\"'' The logic is simple: Kurtosis is the average (or [[expected value]]) of the [[standardized data]] raised to the fourth power. Any standardized values that are less than 1 (i.e., data within one standard deviation of the mean, where the \"peak\" would be), contribute virtually nothing to kurtosis, since raising a number that is less than 1 to the fourth power makes it closer to zero. The only data values (observed or observable) that contribute to kurtosis in any meaningful way are those outside the region of the peak; i.e., the outliers. Therefore, kurtosis measures outliers only; it measures nothing about the \"peak\".\n\nMany incorrect interpretations of kurtosis that involve notions of peakedness have been given. One is that kurtosis measures both the \"peakedness\" of the distribution and the [[heavy-tailed distribution|heaviness of its tail]].{{r|Balanda1988}} Various other incorrect interpretations have been suggested, such as \"lack of shoulders\" (where the \"shoulder\" is defined vaguely as the area between the peak and the tail, or more specifically as the area about one [[standard deviation]] from the mean) or \"bimodality\".{{r|Darlington1970}} Balanda and [[Helen MacGillivray|MacGillivray]] assert that the standard definition of kurtosis \"is a poor measure of the kurtosis, peakedness, or tail weight of a distribution\"{{r|Balanda1988|p=114}} and instead propose to \"define kurtosis vaguely as the location- and scale-free movement of [[probability mass]] from the [[shoulders of a distribution]] into its center and tails\".{{r|Balanda1988}}\n\n===Moors' interpretation===\n\nIn 1986 Moors gave an interpretation of kurtosis.{{r|Moors1986}} Let\n  \n:<math> Z = \\frac{ X - \\mu } \\sigma, </math> \n \nwhere ''X'' is a random variable, ''\u03bc'' is the mean and ''\u03c3'' is the standard deviation.\n\nNow by definition of the kurtosis <math> \\kappa </math>, and by the well-known identity <math> E[V^2] = \\operatorname{var}[V] + [E[V]]^2, </math>\n\n:<math> \\kappa = E[ Z^4 ]  = \\operatorname{var}[ Z^2 ] + [E[Z^2]]^2  = \\operatorname{var}[ Z^2 ] + [\\operatorname{var}[Z]]^2 = \\operatorname{var}[ Z^2 ] + 1 </math>.\n\nThe kurtosis can now be seen as a measure of the dispersion of ''Z''<sup>2</sup> around its expectation. Alternatively it can be seen to be a measure of the dispersion of ''Z'' around +1 and&nbsp;\u22121. ''\u03ba'' attains its minimal value in a symmetric two-point distribution. In terms of the original variable ''X'', the kurtosis is a measure of the dispersion of ''X'' around the two values ''\u03bc''&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;''\u03c3''.\n\nHigh values of ''\u03ba'' arise in two circumstances:\n \n* where the probability mass is concentrated around the mean and the data-generating process produces occasional values far from the mean, \n* where the probability mass is concentrated in the tails of the distribution.\n\n== Excess kurtosis ==\n\nThe ''excess kurtosis'' is defined as kurtosis minus&nbsp;3. There are 3 distinct regimes as described below.\n\n=== Mesokurtic ===\nDistributions with zero excess kurtosis are called '''mesokurtic''', or mesokurtotic. The most prominent example of a mesokurtic distribution is the normal distribution family, regardless of the values of its [[parameter]]s. A few other well-known distributions can be mesokurtic, depending on parameter values: for example, the [[binomial distribution]] is mesokurtic for <math>p = 1/2 \\pm \\sqrt{1/12}</math>.\n\n=== Leptokurtic ===\nA distribution with [[Positive number|positive]] excess kurtosis is called '''leptokurtic''', or leptokurtotic. \"Lepto-\" means \"slender\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/lepto- | title=Lepto-}}</ref> In terms of shape, a leptokurtic distribution has ''[[Fat-tailed distribution|fatter tails]]''. Examples of leptokurtic distributions include the [[Student's t-distribution]], [[Rayleigh distribution]],  [[Laplace distribution]], [[exponential distribution]], [[Poisson distribution]] and the [[logistic distribution]].  Such distributions are sometimes termed ''super-Gaussian''.{{r|Beneviste1980}}\n\n=== Platykurtic ===\n[[File:1909 US Penny.jpg|thumb|The [[coin toss]] is the most platykurtic distribution]]\nA distribution with [[Negative number|negative]] excess kurtosis is called '''platykurtic''', or platykurtotic. \"Platy-\" means \"broad\".<ref>http://www.yourdictionary.com/platy-prefix</ref> In terms of shape, a platykurtic distribution has ''thinner tails''. Examples of platykurtic distributions include the [[Continuous uniform distribution|continuous]] and [[discrete uniform distribution]]s, and the [[raised cosine distribution]]. The most platykurtic distribution of all is the [[Bernoulli distribution]] with ''p'' = 1/2 (for example the number of times one obtains \"heads\" when flipping a coin once, a [[coin toss]]), for which the excess kurtosis is \u22122. Such distributions are sometimes termed ''[[sub-Gaussian distribution]]'', originally proposed by [[Jean-Pierre Kahane]]{{r|Kahane1960}} and further described by Buldygin and Kozachenko.{{r|Buldygin1980}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Graphical examples ==\n\n=== The Pearson type VII family ===\n[[Image:Pearson type VII distribution PDF.png|300px|thumb|[[Probability density function|pdf]] for the Pearson type VII distribution with excess kurtosis of infinity (red); 2 (blue); and 0 (black)]]\n[[Image:Pearson type VII distribution log-PDF.png|300px|thumb|log-pdf for the Pearson type VII distribution with excess kurtosis of infinity (red); 2 (blue); 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16 (gray); and 0 (black)]]\n\nThe effects of kurtosis are illustrated using a [[parametric family]] of distributions whose kurtosis can be adjusted while their lower-order moments and cumulants remain constant. Consider the [[Pearson distribution|Pearson type VII family]], which is a special case of the [[Pearson distribution|Pearson type IV family]] restricted to symmetric densities. The [[probability density function]] is given by\n\n:<math>f(x; a, m) = \\frac{\\Gamma(m)}{a\\,\\sqrt{\\pi}\\,\\Gamma(m-1/2)} \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^2 \\right]^{-m}, \\!</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is a [[scale parameter]] and ''m'' is a [[shape parameter]].\n\nAll densities in this family are symmetric. The ''k''th moment exists provided ''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;(''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2. For the kurtosis to exist, we require ''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;5/2. Then the mean and [[skewness]] exist and are both identically zero. Setting ''a''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''m''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3 makes the variance equal to unity. Then the only free parameter is ''m'', which controls the fourth moment (and cumulant) and hence the kurtosis.  One can reparameterize with <math>m = 5/2 + 3/\\gamma_2</math>, where <math>\\gamma_2</math> is the excess kurtosis as defined above. This yields a one-parameter leptokurtic family with zero mean, unit variance, zero skewness, and arbitrary non-negative excess kurtosis. The reparameterized density is\n\n:<math>g(x; \\gamma_2) = f\\left(x;\\; a = \\sqrt{2 + \\frac{6}{\\gamma_2}},\\; m = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{3}{\\gamma_2}\\right). \\!</math>\n\nIn the limit as <math>\\gamma_2 \\to \\infty</math> one obtains the density\n\n:<math>g(x) = 3\\left(2 + x^2\\right)^{-\\frac{5}{2}}, \\!</math>\n\nwhich is shown as the red curve in the images on the right.\n\nIn the other direction as <math>\\gamma_2 \\to 0</math> one obtains the [[normal distribution|standard normal]] density as the limiting distribution, shown as the black curve.\n\nIn the images on the right, the blue curve represents the density <math>x \\mapsto g(x; 2)</math> with excess kurtosis of 2.  The top image shows that leptokurtic densities in this family have a higher peak than the mesokurtic normal density, although this conclusion is only valid for this select family of distributions. The comparatively fatter tails of the leptokurtic densities are illustrated in the second image, which plots the natural logarithm of the Pearson type VII densities: the black curve is the logarithm of the standard normal density, which is a [[parabola]]. One can see that the normal density allocates little probability mass to the regions far from the mean (\"has thin tails\"), compared with the blue curve of the leptokurtic Pearson type VII density with excess kurtosis of 2.  Between the blue curve and the black are other Pearson type VII densities with ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16.  The red curve again shows the upper limit of the Pearson type VII family, with <math>\\gamma_2 = \\infty</math> (which, strictly speaking, means that the fourth moment does not exist). The red curve decreases the slowest as one moves outward from the origin (\"has fat tails\").\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Other well-known distributions ===\n[[Image:Standard symmetric pdfs.png|300px|thumb|[[Probability density function]]s for selected distributions with [[expected value|mean]] 0, [[variance]] 1 and different excess kurtosis]]\n[[Image:Standard symmetric pdfs logscale.png|300px|thumb|[[Logarithm]]s of [[probability density function]]s for selected distributions with [[expected value|mean]] 0, [[variance]] 1 and different excess kurtosis]]\n\nSeveral well-known, unimodal and symmetric distributions from different parametric families are compared here.

The images on the right show curves for the following seven densities, on a [[linear scale]] and [[logarithmic scale]]:\n\n* D: [[Laplace distribution]], also known as the double exponential distribution, red curve (two straight lines in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 3\n* S: [[hyperbolic secant distribution]], orange curve, excess kurtosis = 2\n* L: [[logistic distribution]], green curve, excess kurtosis = 1.2\n* N: [[normal distribution]], black curve (inverted parabola in the log-scale plot), excess kurtosis = 0\n* C: [[raised cosine distribution]], cyan curve, excess kurtosis = \u22120.593762...\n* W: [[Wigner semicircle distribution]], blue curve, excess kurtosis = \u22121\n* U: [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]], magenta curve (shown for clarity as a rectangle in both images), excess kurtosis = \u22121.2.\n\nNote that in these cases the platykurtic densities have bounded [[Support (mathematics)|support]], whereas the densities with positive or zero excess kurtosis are supported on the whole [[real line]].\n\nOne cannot infer that high or low kurtosis distributions have the characteristics indicated by these examples. There exist platykurtic densities with infinite support,\n*e.g., [[exponential power distribution]]s with sufficiently large shape parameter ''b''\n\nand there exist leptokurtic densities with finite support.\n*e.g., a distribution that is uniform between \u22123 and \u22120.3, between \u22120.3 and 0.3, and between 0.3 and 3, with the same density in the (\u22123, \u22120.3) and (0.3, 3) intervals, but with 20 times more density in the (\u22120.3, 0.3) interval\n\nAlso, there exist platykurtic densities with infinite peakedness,\n*e.g., an equal mixture of the [[beta distribution]] with parameters 0.5 and 1 with its reflection about 0.0 \n\nand there exist leptokurtic densities that appear flat-topped,\n*e.g., a mixture of distribution that is uniform between -1 and 1 with a T(4.0000001) [[Student's t-distribution]], with mixing probabilities 0.999 and 0.001.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sample kurtosis ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nFor a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of ''n'' values the '''sample excess kurtosis''' is\n\n:<math> g_2 = \\frac{m_4}{m_2^2} -3 = \\frac{\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^4}{\\left[\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2\\right]^2} - 3 </math>\n\nwhere ''m''<sub>4</sub> is the fourth sample [[moment about the mean]], ''m''<sub>2</sub> is the second sample moment about the mean (that is, the [[sample variance]]), ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> is the ''i''<sup>th</sup> value, and <math>\\overline{x}</math> is the [[sample mean]].\n\nThis formula has the simpler representation,\n\n:<math> g_2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n z_i^4  - 3 </math>\n\nwhere the <math> z_i </math> values are the standardized data values using the standard deviation defined using ''n'' rather than ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 in the denominator.\n\nFor example, suppose the data values are 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 999.\n\nThen the  <math> z_i </math> values are \u22120.239, \u22120.225, \u22120.221, \u22120.234, \u22120.230, \u22120.225, \u22120.239, \u22120.230, \u22120.234, \u22120.225, \u22120.230, \u22120.239, \u22120.230, \u22120.230, \u22120.225, \u22120.230, \u22120.216, \u22120.230, \u22120.225, 4.359\n\nand the <math> z_i^4 </math> values are  0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.003, 0.002, 0.003, 0.003, 360.976.\n\nThe average of these values is 18.05 and the excess kurtosis is thus 18.05&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;15.05.  This example makes it clear that data near the \"middle\" or \"peak\" of the distribution do not contribute to the kurtosis statistic, hence kurtosis does not measure \"peakedness\". It is simply a measure of the outlier, 999 in this example.\n\n=== Upper bound ===\nAn upper bound for the sample kurtosis of ''n'' (''n'' > 2) real numbers is{{r|Sharma2015}}\n:<math> g_2 \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{n-3}{n-2} g_1^2 + \\frac{n}{2} - 3.</math>\nwhere <math>g_1</math> is the sample skewness <math>m_3/m_2^{3/2}</math>.\n\n=== Variance under normality ===\nThe variance of the sample kurtosis of a sample of size ''n'' from the [[normal distribution]] is{{r|Fisher1930}}\n:<math>  \\operatorname{var}(g_2) = \\frac{24n(n-1)^2}{(n-3)(n-2)(n+3)(n+5)} </math>\n\nStated differently, under the assumption that the underlying random variable <math>X</math> is normally distributed, it can be shown that <math>\\sqrt{n} g_2 \\xrightarrow{d} \\mathcal{N}(0, 24)</math>.{{r|Kendall1969|p=Page number needed}}\n\n== Estimators of population kurtosis ==\nGiven a sub-set of samples from a population, the sample excess kurtosis above is a [[biased estimator]] of the population excess kurtosis. An alternative estimator of the population excess kurtosis is defined as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nG_2 & = \\frac{k_4}{k_2^2} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n^2\\,[(n+1)\\,m_4 - 3\\,(n-1)\\,m_{2}^2]}{(n-1)\\,(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{(n-1)^2}{n^2\\,m_2^2} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n-1}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\left[(n+1)\\,\\frac{m_4}{m_{2}^2} - 3\\,(n-1) \\right] \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{n-1}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\left[(n+1)\\,g_2 + 6 \\right] \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{(n+1)\\,n\\,(n-1)}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2\\right]^2} - 3\\,\\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\\\[6pt]\n& = \\frac{(n+1)\\,n}{(n-1)\\,(n-2)\\,(n-3)} \\; \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^4}{k_2^2} - 3\\,\\frac{(n-1)^2}{(n-2) (n-3)}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>4</sub> is the unique symmetric [[bias of an estimator|unbiased]] estimator of the fourth [[cumulant]], ''k''<sub>2</sub> is the unbiased estimate of the second cumulant (identical to the unbiased estimate of the sample variance), ''m''<sub>4</sub> is the fourth sample moment about the mean, ''m''<sub>2</sub> is the second sample moment about the mean, ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> is the ''i''<sup>th</sup> value, and <math>\\bar{x}</math> is the sample mean. Unfortunately, <math>G_2</math> is itself generally biased. For the [[normal distribution]] it is unbiased.{{r|Joanes1998}}\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\nThe sample kurtosis is a useful measure of whether there is a problem with outliers in a data set. Larger kurtosis indicates a more serious outlier problem, and may lead the researcher to choose alternative statistical methods.\n\n[[D'Agostino's K-squared test]] is a [[goodness-of-fit]] [[normality test]] based on a combination of the sample skewness and sample kurtosis, as is the [[Jarque\u2013Bera test]] for normality.\n\nFor non-normal samples, the variance of the sample variance depends on the kurtosis; for details, please see [[Variance#Distribution of the sample variance|variance]].\n\nPearson's definition of kurtosis is used as an indicator of intermittency in [[turbulence]].{{r|Sandborn1959}}\n\n===Kurtosis convergence===\nApplying [[band-pass filter]]s to [[digital image]]s, kurtosis values tend to be uniform, independent of the range of the filter. This behavior, termed ''kurtosis convergence'', can be used to detect image splicing in [[forensic analysis]].{{r|Pan2012}}\n\n== Other measures ==\nA different measure of \"kurtosis\" is provided by using [[L-moment]]s instead of the ordinary moments.{{r|Hosking1992|Hosking2006}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Kurtosis}}\n* [[Kurtosis risk]]\n* [[Maximum entropy probability distribution]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist\n|refs=\n<ref name=\"Pearson1905\">\n{{citation\n |last=Pearson |first=Karl\n |title=Das Fehlergesetz und seine Verallgemeinerungen durch Fechner und Pearson.

In his first season, he was drafted by the Blackhawks, but he played two more years in junior, culminating in an all-star selection at the end of the 1990\u201391 season.  He turned professional immediately after the junior season ended, fitting in three games with the [[Indianapolis Ice]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|IHL]].\nBennett spent the next two seasons splitting time in the IHL and the NHL, before finally being dealt to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] at the start of the [[1993\u201394 NHL season]].
