Through the years the band has lived through several line-up changes and the two brothers were the only stable members until Giuseppe's death in 2002. The band's name came from [[The Stooges|The Stooges\u2019s]] [[Raw Power|third album]]. Previously, the Codeluppi brothers had played in another band called Off Limits. Other members in Raw Power's first line-up were Silvio (guitar and vocals), bassist Maurizio Dodi (who came from punk band Chelsea Hotel) and teenager drummer Helder Stefanini.<ref>Raw Power's info in the back cover of 1983's ''Raptus'' compilation.</ref> \n\nIn 1983 they recorded a 19-track demo (sometimes referred as ''Brown Studio Tape'') and two songs appeared in the Italian punk compilation, ''Raptus''. The tape also included the song \u00abFuck authority\u00bb, which appeared in [[Maximumrocknroll]]'s international punk and hardcore compilation, ''[[Welcome to 1984]]''. Their debut album, ''You Are The Victim'', was released in 1983 (or 1984, depending on sources) through the same small independent Italian label that released the ''Raptus'' compilation (Meccano Records). Raw Power had another two tracks in the second ''Raptus'' compilation, ''Raptus: Negazione e superamento'' (1984). \n\nA small tape label from [[San Diego]], USA, called [[Bad Compilation Tapes / Borderless Countries Tapes | BCT Tapes]] released in 1984 their demo (untitled, aka ''Brown Studio Tape'') and some of their live stuff in the [[Last White Christmas]] compilations (recorded in December 1983).<ref>[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/italy/rawpower_main.html Article about Rawpower] in [http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/mainpage.html Kill from the Heart site].</ref> Through the BCT contact, in the same year the band flew over to the States for their first US tour, which happened in August\u2013September 1984<ref>[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/italy/info/rawpower_tour.html 1984 USA Tour report by Chris BCT]</ref> (the band have since then returned to tour the USA a total of six times). Second guitarist Silvio was replaced by Davide (ex Chelsea Hotel) before the tour.\n\nWhile touring in the USA in 1984, the band played in Los Angeles with punk legends Dead Kennedys. It was at that show that they were spotted by Bill Sassenberger, owner of [[Toxic Shock Records]]. The band signed a record deal with Bill, which resulted in the album [[Screams From the Gutter]], which sold more than 40,000 copies strictly through independent distribution and shops.<ref name=\"bio\">[http://www.rawpowerhc.com/bio.html Band's story on Raw Power's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311002859/http://www.rawpowerhc.com/bio.html |date=2009-03-11 }}</ref> Almost simultaneously, BCT released a ''Live in the USA'' tape (BCT 17, 3/85), compiling some of their best shows.\n\nIn 1986, [[Toxic Shock Records|Toxic Shock]] released the EP ''Wop Hour'' and the LP ''After Your Brain''. \n\nIn 1987, Raw Power appeared on the compilation album \"Rat Music For Rat People\", recorded in San Francisco by producer [[Sylvia Massy]] at [[CD Presents]].\n\nIn the years to come, other records including ''Mine To Kill'' (Southern Records, 1989), ''Live Danger'' (TVOR Records, 1991) and ''Too Tough to Burn'' (Contempo Records, 1992) were released, but none of them sold as respectively as the first two recordings on [[Toxic Shock Records|Toxic Shock]].\n\nDuring their tours in the U.S.A. Raw Power have shared the stage with the [[Circle Jerks]], [[Adolescents]], [[DOA (band)|D.O.A.]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Agnostic Front]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], among many others. In 1986 in a small club in Seattle, [[Guns N' Roses]] opened for Raw Power.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nIn 1995 they recorded the ''Fight'' album for Godhead Records, trying to achieve a sound more akin to their live shows. A video clip was made to promote the album, which was broadcast by [[MTV]].<ref name=\"bio\"/> Their next album for Godhead was ''Live from the gutter'', recorded live on March 1, 1996 in the Maffia Club from Reggio Emilia (Italy). It contains twenty-seven songs with no overdubs. \n\nIn 1998 the band came back to Bill and [[Toxic Shock Records|Toxic Shock]], who had changed its name to Toxic Ranch Records, releasing ''Reptile House''. Reviews of the record were all incredible, calling it the best thing the band had done since their debut release. With that, the band decided to return to the U.S. for their first American tour in several years. It was at that time that they met a long time Raw Power fan named Tony Patino. A person that would be instrumental for the band in the next few years.\n\nThe 1998 tour, which was organized by Patino, started and ended in New York City, and covered most of the eastern states. It was on the first night of that tour that the band stored some of their gear in the support bands vehicle, only to find out the next day that some of their guitars were stolen. The support band, Infected, a then unknown band from Lexington, Kentucky, had mistakenly parked their van and left it unattended in New Jersey, and had to explain how they did not have Giuseppe's Gibson Les Paul that he had played for roughly twenty years. \n\nIn the late 1998, Marco Massarenti joined the band, replacing bassist Alessandro Paolucci.\n\nAnother tour of the states was underway the following year, but had to be scrapped midway through when Mauro was hospitalized in Indianapolis. He was suffering from kidney stones and had to have a stone surgically removed. Several dates on the tour had to be canceled due to the nature of his illness, which made it nearly impossible for him to sing.\n\nIn 2000 Alessandro Ronchini replaced Marco Massarenti and Raw Power released their next album \"Trust Me\" on Hello Records, a label that Patino, their American booking agent had started. This was the first recording since \"Fight\" that Silvio played guitar for the band. Just as the album was released, they hit American soil once again. This time, the tour support was a radical band from Los Angeles called Tongue, featuring a female vocalist/artist named Liz Mcgrath. The tour started in Los Angeles rather than New York, and the West coast welcomed the band with open arms. It was their most successful American tour since the first one in 1984. \n\nThe following year, in 2001, the band toured the states once again, supporting the \"Trust Me\" release. This time with old 1985 tour mates, Decry supporting. The tour started in Atlanta and ended in Denver, and was the last time founding member Giuseppe would ever see the United States. Band members from that tour have said that it was the most redeeming tour of the states ever for him.\n\nIn 2002, Raw Power went back into the studio to record ''Still Screaming After 20 Years'', a celebration of their two decades as a band. Shortly after finishing it, on October 6, guitarist and founding member Giuseppe Codeluppi suffered a heart attack while playing soccer, and died. The cover of the \"Still Screaming\" album was the only record cover where the band used a photo, rather than artistic images. It's a photo taken by Patino at [[Meteor Crater, Arizona]], where a meteor had allegedly hit the earth over 50,000 years prior. It was the last photo of Giuseppe with his band ever taken in America.\n\nAfter his death, the remaining members debated on keeping on. In the end, it was decided that Giuseppe would have wanted the band to continue, with or without him. \n\nEuropean tours followed in 2004-2005. In 2005 Roberto the drummer was replaced by Fabio because of health reasons.\n\nIn 2007 Tommi Prodi was back in the band replacing guitarist Luca Carpi.\n\nIn 2008 Marco Massarenti was back in the band replacing bassist Alessandro Ronchini.\n\nApril 13, 2010 Beer City Records released the first 'Raw Power' box set entitled 'The Reagan Years'. This set contains\n1 DVD and 2 CD's. All the material featured in this set compiles most of the material recorded by the band during the 1980s. Henceforth the title ' The Reagan Years'.Also included is a full DVD sized lyric book with liner notes by Mauro 'singer' and co founder of 'Raw Power'.Beer City also brought back Vince 'Rancid' Packard to do the cover art. Packard had done both the covers for 'Screams From the Gutter' and 'After Your Brain'. The cover features the monster (being torn apart by Ronald Reagan complete with a monkey on his shoulder with Oliver North's face) seen on many 'Raw Power' covers along with the familiar sewer setting and rat. The CD's total 63 tracks and the DVD contains 2 live performances. One from 1986 and one from 1987. Both were filmed on US tours the band had done.\n\nOctober 2010 P.I.G. records released the band's new album, ''Resuscitate'', 8 years after ''Still Screaming...''. It's been recorded in Seattle's Studio Litho (owned by Pearl Jam's Stone Gossard) during the 2009 US tour. It features 24 new songs  plus two stooges covers (\"I wanna be your dog\" and \"Raw power\") and a remake of the band's 1988 classic \"mine to kill\" as ghost track.\n\nIn 2012, the Italian F.O.A.D. Records starts reprinting all of the classic albums of Raw Power, starting with the first Demo Tape printed for the first time on vinyl, entitled Birth, passing through the first four records, and adding for the first time totally new audio material, including the discovery of a totally unknown Demo dating back to 1982. For the same label, the same year, the split 7 \u201d with DRI released in 2001 is reprinted , this time in double flexi 7\u2033 colored, with a previously unreleased bonus track . The same year also sees the release of \u201dNo More Borders\u201d, a 4-way split 7 \u201ctogether with MDC, Som-Hi Noise and Naked Aggression.

Through the years the band has lived through several line-up changes and the two brothers were the only stable members until Giuseppe's death in 2002. The band's name came from [[The Stooges|The Stooges\u2019s]] [[Raw Power|third album]]. Previously, the Codeluppi brothers had played in another band called Off Limits. Other members in Raw Power's first line-up were Silvio (guitar and vocals), bassist Maurizio Dodi (who came from punk band Chelsea Hotel) and teenager drummer Helder Stefanini.<ref>Raw Power's info in the back cover of 1983's ''Raptus'' compilation.</ref> \n\nIn 1983 they recorded a 19-track demo (sometimes referred as ''Brown Studio Tape'') and two songs appeared in the Italian punk compilation, ''Raptus''. The tape also included the song \u00abFuck authority\u00bb, which appeared in [[Maximumrocknroll]]'s international punk and hardcore compilation, ''[[Welcome to 1984]]''. Their debut album, ''You Are The Victim'', was released in 1983 (or 1984, depending on sources) through the same small independent Italian label that released the ''Raptus'' compilation (Meccano Records). Raw Power had another two tracks in the second ''Raptus'' compilation, ''Raptus: Negazione e superamento'' (1984). \n\nA small tape label from [[San Diego]], USA, called [[Bad Compilation Tapes / Borderless Countries Tapes | BCT Tapes]] released in 1984 their demo (untitled, aka ''Brown Studio Tape'') and some of their live stuff in the [[Last White Christmas]] compilations (recorded in December 1983).<ref>[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/italy/rawpower_main.html Article about Rawpower] in [http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/mainpage.html Kill from the Heart site].</ref> Through the BCT contact, in the same year the band flew over to the States for their first US tour, which happened in August\u2013September 1984<ref>[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/italy/info/rawpower_tour.html 1984 USA Tour report by Chris BCT]</ref> (the band have since then returned to tour the USA a total of six times). Second guitarist Silvio was replaced by Davide (ex Chelsea Hotel) before the tour.\n\nWhile touring in the USA in 1984, the band played in Los Angeles with punk legends Dead Kennedys. It was at that show that they were spotted by Bill Sassenberger, owner of [[Toxic Shock Records]]. The band signed a record deal with Bill, which resulted in the album [[Screams From the Gutter]], which sold more than 40,000 copies strictly through independent distribution and shops.<ref name=\"bio\">[http://www.rawpowerhc.com/bio.html Band's story on Raw Power's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311002859/http://www.rawpowerhc.com/bio.html |date=2009-03-11 }}</ref> Almost simultaneously, BCT released a ''Live in the USA'' tape (BCT 17, 3/85), compiling some of their best shows.\n\nIn 1986, [[Toxic Shock Records|Toxic Shock]] released the EP ''Wop Hour'' and the LP ''After Your Brain''. \n\nIn 1987, Raw Power appeared on the compilation album \"Rat Music For Rat People\", recorded in San Francisco by producer [[Sylvia Massy]] at [[CD Presents]].\n\nIn the years to come, other records including ''Mine To Kill'' (Southern Records, 1989), ''Live Danger'' (TVOR Records, 1991) and ''Too Tough to Burn'' (Contempo Records, 1992) were released, but none of them sold as respectively as the first two recordings on [[Toxic Shock Records|Toxic Shock]].\n\nDuring their tours in the U.S.A. Raw Power have shared the stage with the [[Circle Jerks]], [[Adolescents]], [[DOA (band)|D.O.A.]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Agnostic Front]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], among many others. In 1986 in a small club in Seattle, [[Guns N' Roses]] opened for Raw Power.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nIn 1995 they recorded the ''Fight'' album for Godhead Records, trying to achieve a sound more akin to their live shows. A video clip was made to promote the album, which was broadcast by [[MTV]].<ref name=\"bio\"/> Their next album for Godhead was ''Live from the gutter'', recorded live on March 1, 1996 in the Maffia Club from Reggio Emilia (Italy). It contains twenty-seven songs with no overdubs. \n\nIn 1998 the band came back to Bill and [[Toxic Shock Records|Toxic Shock]], who had changed its name to Toxic Ranch Records, releasing ''Reptile House''. Reviews of the record were all incredible, calling it the best thing the band had done since their debut release. With that, the band decided to return to the U.S. for their first American tour in several years. It was at that time that they met a long time Raw Power fan named Tony Patino. A person that would be instrumental for the band in the next few years.\n\nThe 1998 tour, which was organized by Patino, started and ended in New York City, and covered most of the eastern states. It was on the first night of that tour that the band stored some of their gear in the support bands vehicle, only to find out the next day that some of their guitars were stolen. The support band, Infected, a then unknown band from Lexington, Kentucky, had mistakenly parked their van and left it unattended in New Jersey, and had to explain how they did not have Giuseppe's Gibson Les Paul that he had played for roughly twenty years. \n\nIn the late 1998, Marco Massarenti joined the band, replacing bassist Alessandro Paolucci.\n\nAnother tour of the states was underway the following year, but had to be scrapped midway through when Mauro was hospitalized in Indianapolis. He was suffering from kidney stones and had to have a stone surgically removed. Several dates on the tour had to be canceled due to the nature of his illness, which made it nearly impossible for him to sing.\n\nIn 2000 Alessandro Ronchini replaced Marco Massarenti and Raw Power released their next album \"Trust Me\" on Hello Records, a label that Patino, their American booking agent had started. This was the first recording since \"Fight\" that Silvio played guitar for the band. Just as the album was released, they hit American soil once again. This time, the tour support was a radical band from Los Angeles called Tongue, featuring a female vocalist/artist named Liz Mcgrath. The tour started in Los Angeles rather than New York, and the West coast welcomed the band with open arms. It was their most successful American tour since the first one in 1984. \n\nThe following year, in 2001, the band toured the states once again, supporting the \"Trust Me\" release. This time with old 1985 tour mates, Decry supporting. The tour started in Atlanta and ended in Denver, and was the last time founding member Giuseppe would ever see the United States. Band members from that tour have said that it was the most redeeming tour of the states ever for him.\n\nIn 2002, Raw Power went back into the studio to record ''Still Screaming After 20 Years'', a celebration of their two decades as a band. Shortly after finishing it, on October 6, guitarist and founding member Giuseppe Codeluppi suffered a heart attack while playing soccer, and died. The cover of the \"Still Screaming\" album was the only record cover where the band used a photo, rather than artistic images. It's a photo taken by Patino at [[Meteor Crater, Arizona]], where a meteor had allegedly hit the earth over 50,000 years prior. It was the last photo of Giuseppe with his band ever taken in America.\n\nAfter his death, the remaining members debated on keeping on. In the end, it was decided that Giuseppe would have wanted the band to continue, with or without him. \n\nEuropean tours followed in 2004-2005. In 2005 Roberto the drummer was replaced by Fabio because of health reasons.\n\nIn 2007 Tommi Prodi was back in the band replacing guitarist Luca Carpi.\n\nIn 2008 Marco Massarenti was back in the band replacing bassist Alessandro Ronchini.\n\nApril 13, 2010 Beer City Records released the first 'Raw Power' box set entitled 'The Reagan Years'. This set contains\n1 DVD and 2 CD's. All the material featured in this set compiles most of the material recorded by the band during the 1980s. Henceforth the title ' The Reagan Years'.Also included is a full DVD sized lyric book with liner notes by Mauro 'singer' and co founder of 'Raw Power'.Beer City also brought back Vince 'Rancid' Packard to do the cover art. Packard had done both the covers for 'Screams From the Gutter' and 'After Your Brain'. The cover features the monster (being torn apart by Ronald Reagan complete with a monkey on his shoulder with Oliver North's face) seen on many 'Raw Power' covers along with the familiar sewer setting and rat. The CD's total 63 tracks and the DVD contains 2 live performances. One from 1986 and one from 1987. Both were filmed on US tours the band had done.\n\nOctober 2010 P.I.G. records released the band's new album, ''Resuscitate'', 8 years after ''Still Screaming...''. It's been recorded in Seattle's Studio Litho (owned by Pearl Jam's Stone Gossard) during the 2009 US tour. It features 24 new songs  plus two stooges covers (\"I wanna be your dog\" and \"Raw power\") and a remake of the band's 1988 classic \"mine to kill\" as ghost track.\n\nIn 2012, the Italian F.O.A.D. Records starts reprinting all of the classic albums of Raw Power, starting with the first Demo Tape printed for the first time on vinyl, entitled Birth, passing through the first four records, and adding for the first time totally new audio material, including the discovery of a totally unknown Demo dating back to 1982. For the same label, the same year, the split 7 \u201d with DRI released in 2001 is reprinted , this time in double flexi 7\u2033 colored, with a previously unreleased bonus track . The same year also sees the release of \u201dNo More Borders\u201d, a 4-way split 7 \u201ctogether with MDC, Som-Hi Noise and Naked Aggression. The record is co-produced by different European and American  labels and contains an unreleased track for each band.\n\nOn October 7, 2012 Luca Carpi died at 34 of pulmonary embolism.\n\nThroughout 2013 the band plays continuously in their own country and across Europe, returned to the US in April and recorded a new album with Beer City records, \"Tired and Furious\", released in mid- 2014 .\n\nIn 2013 Paolo di Bernardo on guitar Gianmarco Agosti on drums joined the band.\n\nIn 2014 and in 2015 Raw Power toured the United States.\n\nIn 2016 the band toured Europe, playing with Agnostic Front and H2O.\n\nIn 2017 Indiebox Records released the new album \"Inferno\" and Raw Power played the biggest italian punk rock festivals. At the end of the year the band toured Australia for the first time.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\nRaw Power are considered to be one of the most seminal hardcore punk bands.

The model, packed into six crates, was shipped from [[Italy]] in a small sailing vessel in the spring of 1858. During the voyage, the ship began to leak and stopped in [[Gibraltar]] for repairs. After leaving Gibraltar, the ship began leaking again to the point that it could go no farther than [[Bermuda]], where the model was stored until other transportation could be arranged. Half of the crates finally arrived in [[New York City]] in December, but all sections were not in Washington, D.C. until late March 1859.\n\nBeginning in 1860, the statue was cast in five main sections by [[Clark Mills (sculptor)|Clark Mills]], whose bronze foundry was located on the outskirts of Washington. Work was halted in 1861 because of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but by the end of 1862, the statue was finished and temporarily displayed on the Capitol grounds. The cost of the statue, exclusive of installation, was $23,796.82.\n\nWhile ''Freedom'' was being cast at Mills' foundry, the foreman in charge of the casting went on strike. Instead of paying him the higher wages he demanded, Mills turned the project over to [[Philip Reid]], one of the [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] working at the facility.

It is also known as the '''University Boat Race''' and the '''Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race'''.\n\nThe men's race was first held in 1829 and has been held annually since 1856, except during the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars and the Corona crisis in 2020. The first [[Women's Boat Race|women's event]] was in 1927 and the race has been held annually since 1964. [[The Boat Races 2015|Since 2015]], the women's race has taken place on the same day and course, and since 2018 the combined event of the two races has been referred to as \"The Boat Race\". In the [[The Boat Race 2019|2019 race]], which took place on Sunday 7 April 2019, Cambridge won the men's and women's races as well as both reserve races.\n\n[[The Championship Course|The course]] covers a 4.2-mile (6.8&nbsp;km) stretch of the Thames in West London, from [[Putney]] to [[Mortlake]]. Members of both teams are traditionally known as ''[[University Sporting Blue|blues]]'' and each boat as a \"[[Blue Boat]]\", with Cambridge in [[Cambridge Blue (colour)|light blue]] and Oxford in [[Oxford Blue (colour)|dark blue]]. As of 2019, Cambridge has won the men's race 84 times and Oxford 80 times, with one [[dead heat]]. Cambridge has led Oxford in cumulative wins since 1930. In the women's race, Cambridge have won the race 44 times and Oxford 30 times. Cambridge has led Oxford in cumulative wins since 1966. A reserve boat race has been held since 1965 for the men and 1966 for the women.\n\nOver 250,000 people watch the race from the banks of the river each year.  In 2009, a record 270,000 people watched the race live.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23821000-record-crowd-for-easter-boat-race.do | title=Record crowd for Easter Boat Race | publisher=[[London Evening Standard]] | accessdate=31 August 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404061650/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23821000-record-crowd-for-easter-boat-race.do | archivedate=4 April 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>  A further 15&nbsp;million or more watch it on television.<ref name=\"University Boat Race 2014: spectators guide\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | title=University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=25 March 2014 | accessdate=7 April 2014 | author=Smith, Oliver}}</ref>\n\n==History of the men's race==\n\n===Origin===\n[[Image:1841 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race.jpg|thumb|right|An engraving of the 1841 Boat Race, with [[Lambeth Palace]]]]\nThe tradition was [[The Boat Race 1829|started in 1829]] by [[Charles Merivale]], a student at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and his [[Harrow School|Old Harrovian]] school friend [[Charles Wordsworth]] who was studying at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref name=\"The Boat Race origins\">{{cite web | url=http://theboatrace.org/men/origins | title=The Boat Race origins | publisher=The Boat Race Limited | accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> The [[University of Cambridge]] challenged the [[University of Oxford]] to a race at [[Henley-on-Thames]] but lost easily.<ref name=\"The Boat Race origins\" /> Oxford raced in dark blue because five members of the crew, including the stroke, were from Christ Church, then Head of the River, whose colours were dark blue.<ref name=\"BODS BR\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bookofdaystales.com/boat-race/ | title=Book of Days Tales \u2013 The Boat Race | publisher=Book of Days Tales | accessdate=12 October 2014 | author=Bosque, Juan Alejandro| date=10 June 2014 }}</ref> There is a dispute as to the source of the colour chosen by Cambridge.\n\n[[The Boat Race 1836|The second race]] was in 1836, with the venue moved to a course from Westminster to Putney.

With no clear way to determine who had surged forward at the exact finish line, Phelps could only pronounce it a dead heat. Koch believes that the press and Oxford supporters made up the stories about Phelps later, which Phelps had no chance to refute.<ref name=\"Oxford Won Cambridge Too\" />\n[[Image:Dead heat finish 1877.jpg|right|thumb|A portrayal of the dead heat finish in 1877.]]\n\n{{quote|Oxford, partially disabled, were making effort after effort to hold their rapidly waning lead, while Cambridge, who, curiously enough, had settled together again, and were rowing almost as one man, were putting on a magnificent spurt at 40 strokes to the minute, with a view of catching their opponents before reaching the winning-post. Thus struggling over the remaining portion of the course, the two eights raced past the flag alongside one another, and the gun fired amid a scene of excitement rarely equalled and never exceeded. Cheers for one crew were succeeded by counter-cheers for the other, and it was impossible to tell what the result was until the Press boat backed down to the Judge and inquired the issue.

The start and finish are marked by the [[University Boat Race Stones]] on the south bank. The clubs' presidents toss a coin (the 1829 sovereign) before the race for the right to choose which side of the river (station) they will row on: their decision is based on the day's weather conditions and how the various bends in the course might favour their crew's pace. The north station ('[[Middlesex]]') has the advantage of the first and last bends, and the south ('[[Surrey]]') station the longer middle bend.\n\nDuring the race the coxes compete for the fastest current, which lies at the deepest part of the river, frequently leading to clashes of [[Oar (sport rowing)|blades]] and warnings from the umpire. A crew that gets a lead of more than a boat's length can cut in front of their opponent, making it extremely difficult for the trailing crew to gain the lead. For this reason the tactics of the race are generally to go fast early on, and few races have a change of the lead after halfway (though this happened in 2003, 2007 and 2010).\n\nThe race is rowed [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]], but is timed to start on the incoming flood tide so that the crews are rowing with the fastest possible current.<ref name=\"The Boat Race course\">{{cite web | url=http://www.theboatrace.org/therace/guide/thecourse/ | title=The Boat Race course | date=28 November 2006 | accessdate=10 April 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128162341/http://www.theboatrace.org/therace/guide/thecourse/ | archivedate=28 November 2006}}</ref> If a strong wind is blowing from the west it will be against the tide in places along the course, causing the water to become very rough.

There have been a number of female coxes \u2013 the first to appear in the Boat Race was Sue Brown for Oxford in 1981 \u2013 but in practice the rowers are always male.\n\nAlthough the contest is strictly between amateurs, and the competitors must be students of the university for which they race, the training schedules the teams undertake are very gruelling. Typically each team trains for six days a week for six months before the event.\n\nSuch is the competitive spirit between the universities that it is common for Olympic standard rowers to compete, notably including four-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent, who rowed for Oxford in 1990, 1991, and 1993.

The reserves race takes place on the same day as the main race. The Oxford men's reserve crew is called ''Isis'' (after [[the Isis]], a section of the River Thames which passes through Oxford), and the Cambridge reserve men's crew is called [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|''Goldie'']] (the name comes from rower and Boat Club president [[John Goldie (barrister)|John Goldie]], 1849\u20131896, after whom the [[Goldie Boathouse]] is named). The women's reserve crews are ''Osiris ''(Oxford) and ''Blondie ''(Cambridge).\n\nThe [[Henley Boat Races]], usually held a week before the Boat Race, host the lightweight men's and women's races and their reserve races. There is also an intercollegiate men's and women's race.\n\nA veterans' boat race, usually held on a weekday before the main Boat Race, takes place on the Thames between Putney and Hammersmith.\n\n== Build-up ==\n;Men's race\nTraining for the Boat Race officially begins in September, before the start of term. The first public tests are in November at the [[British Indoor Rowing Championships]], where each university sends around 20 rowers to compete. Everyone races 2&nbsp;km on an [[indoor rower]] with the club presidents using adjacent machines. Both universities also send crews to the [[Head of the River Fours]] race in London, which is raced over the reverse Boat Race course, that is to say the Championship course from Mortlake to Putney.\n\nIn December, the coaches put out ''Trial Eights'' where two crews from the same university race each other over the full Boat Race course. These crews are given names such as ''Kara'' and ''Whakamanawa'' ([[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] words for strength and honour, Cambridge 2004) or ''Cowboys'' and ''Indians'' (Oxford 2004). Other trials boat names have included such pairings as ''Guns'' and ''Roses.''\n\nOver the Christmas period the squads go on training camps abroad, where final places for the blue boats are decided. After the final blue boat crews have been decided, they race against the top crews from the UK and abroad (e.g. in recent years the men's crew have raced [[Leander Club|Leander]], [[Molesey Boat Club|Molesey]], the German international crew, and a composite crew of Olympic scullers<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7959908.stm |work=BBC News | title=Students v Supermen | date=24 March 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010 | first=Martin | last=Gough}}</ref>). These races are only over part of the course (from Putney to [[Chiswick Eyot]]).\n\nIn case of injury or illness, each university men's crew has ten extra rowers, eight in the reserve boats ''Isis'' and ''Goldie'', and two as the spare pair. Isis and Goldie race 30&nbsp;mins before the Blue Boat event over the same course. As for the spare pair, in the week before the main event they race each other from the mile post to university stone (i.e. from a point one mile into the Championship Course back to the Boat Race start). In the final week, there is also an official weigh in and the average crew weights are announced. The perceived slight advantage of being the heavier crew leads to the practice of drinking large volumes of water directly before the weigh in order to artificially increase weight for a short period of time.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/03/25/socrac25.xml | title=Oxford bank on a flying start to counter light blues' finess | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=25 March 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010 | author=Cracknell, James | location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\n''Boat race'' became such a popular phrase that it was incorporated into [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]], for \"face\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kemmer|first1=Suzanne|title=Cockney Rhyming Slang|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Words04/usage/slang_cockney.html|website=Words in English|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the stories of [[P.

It is also known as the '''University Boat Race''' and the '''Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race'''.\n\nThe men's race was first held in 1829 and has been held annually since 1856, except during the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars. The first [[Women's Boat Race|women's event]] was in 1927 and the race has been held annually since 1964. [[The Boat Races 2015|Since 2015]], the women's race has taken place on the same day and course, and since 2018 the combined event of the two races has been referred to as \"The Boat Race\". In the [[The Boat Race 2019|2019 race]], which took place on Sunday 7 April 2019, Cambridge won the men's and women's races as well as both reserve races.\n\n[[The Championship Course|The course]] covers a 4.2-mile (6.8&nbsp;km) stretch of the Thames in West London, from [[Putney]] to [[Mortlake]]. Members of both teams are traditionally known as ''[[University Sporting Blue|blues]]'' and each boat as a \"[[Blue Boat]]\", with Cambridge in [[Cambridge Blue (colour)|light blue]] and Oxford in [[Oxford Blue (colour)|dark blue]]. As of 2019, Cambridge has won the men's race 84 times and Oxford 80 times, with one [[dead heat]]. Cambridge has led Oxford in cumulative wins since 1930. In the women's race, Cambridge have won the race 44 times and Oxford 30 times. Cambridge has led Oxford in cumulative wins since 1966. A reserve boat race has been held since 1965 for the men and 1966 for the women.\n\nOver 250,000 people watch the race from the banks of the river each year.  In 2009, a record 270,000 people watched the race live.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23821000-record-crowd-for-easter-boat-race.do | title=Record crowd for Easter Boat Race | publisher=[[London Evening Standard]] | accessdate=31 August 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404061650/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23821000-record-crowd-for-easter-boat-race.do | archivedate=4 April 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>  A further 15&nbsp;million or more watch it on television.<ref name=\"University Boat Race 2014: spectators guide\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | title=University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=25 March 2014 | accessdate=7 April 2014 | author=Smith, Oliver}}</ref>\n\n==History of the men's race==\n\n===Origin===\n[[Image:1841 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race.jpg|thumb|right|An engraving of the 1841 Boat Race, with [[Lambeth Palace]]]]\nThe tradition was [[The Boat Race 1829|started in 1829]] by [[Charles Merivale]], a student at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and his [[Harrow School|Old Harrovian]] school friend [[Charles Wordsworth]] who was studying at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref name=\"The Boat Race origins\">{{cite web | url=http://theboatrace.org/men/origins | title=The Boat Race origins | publisher=The Boat Race Limited | accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> The [[University of Cambridge]] challenged the [[University of Oxford]] to a race at [[Henley-on-Thames]] but lost easily.<ref name=\"The Boat Race origins\" /> Oxford raced in dark blue because five members of the crew, including the stroke, were from Christ Church, then Head of the River, whose colours were dark blue.<ref name=\"BODS BR\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bookofdaystales.com/boat-race/ | title=Book of Days Tales \u2013 The Boat Race | publisher=Book of Days Tales | accessdate=12 October 2014 | author=Bosque, Juan Alejandro| date=10 June 2014 }}</ref> There is a dispute as to the source of the colour chosen by Cambridge.\n\n[[The Boat Race 1836|The second race]] was in 1836, with the venue moved to a course from Westminster to Putney.

He did have to judge who had won without the assistance of finish posts (which were installed in time for the next year's race).<ref name=\"Start of the annual race\"/> Some newspapers had believed Oxford won a narrow victory but their viewpoint was from downstream; Phelps considered that the boats were essentially level with each surging forward during the stroke cycle. With no clear way to determine who had surged forward at the exact finish line, Phelps could only pronounce it a dead heat. Koch believes that the press and Oxford supporters made up the stories about Phelps later, which Phelps had no chance to refute.<ref name=\"Oxford Won Cambridge Too\" />\n[[Image:Dead heat finish 1877.jpg|right|thumb|A portrayal of the dead heat finish in 1877.]]\n\n{{quote|Oxford, partially disabled, were making effort after effort to hold their rapidly waning lead, while Cambridge, who, curiously enough, had settled together again, and were rowing almost as one man, were putting on a magnificent spurt at 40 strokes to the minute, with a view of catching their opponents before reaching the winning-post. Thus struggling over the remaining portion of the course, the two eights raced past the flag alongside one another, and the gun fired amid a scene of excitement rarely equalled and never exceeded. Cheers for one crew were succeeded by counter-cheers for the other, and it was impossible to tell what the result was until the Press boat backed down to the Judge and inquired the issue.

The start and finish are marked by the [[University Boat Race Stones]] on the south bank. The clubs' presidents toss a coin (the 1829 sovereign) before the race for the right to choose which side of the river (station) they will row on: their decision is based on the day's weather conditions and how the various bends in the course might favour their crew's pace. The north station ('[[Middlesex]]') has the advantage of the first and last bends, and the south ('[[Surrey]]') station the longer middle bend.\n\nDuring the race the coxes compete for the fastest current, which lies at the deepest part of the river, frequently leading to clashes of [[Oar (sport rowing)|blades]] and warnings from the umpire. A crew that gets a lead of more than a boat's length can cut in front of their opponent, making it extremely difficult for the trailing crew to gain the lead. For this reason the tactics of the race are generally to go fast early on, and few races have a change of the lead after halfway (though this happened in 2003, 2007 and 2010).\n\nThe race is rowed [[Source (river or stream)|upstream]], but is timed to start on the incoming flood tide so that the crews are rowing with the fastest possible current.<ref name=\"The Boat Race course\">{{cite web | url=http://www.theboatrace.org/therace/guide/thecourse/ | title=The Boat Race course | date=28 November 2006 | accessdate=10 April 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128162341/http://www.theboatrace.org/therace/guide/thecourse/ | archivedate=28 November 2006}}</ref> If a strong wind is blowing from the west it will be against the tide in places along the course, causing the water to become very rough.

The reserves race takes place on the same day as the main race. The Oxford men's reserve crew is called ''Isis'' (after [[the Isis]], a section of the River Thames which passes through Oxford), and the Cambridge reserve men's crew is called [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|''Goldie'']] (the name comes from rower and Boat Club president [[John Goldie (barrister)|John Goldie]], 1849\u20131896, after whom the [[Goldie Boathouse]] is named). The women's reserve crews are ''Osiris ''(Oxford) and ''Blondie ''(Cambridge).\n\nThe [[Henley Boat Races]], usually held a week before the Boat Race, host the lightweight men's and women's races and their reserve races. There is also an intercollegiate men's and women's race.\n\nA veterans' boat race, usually held on a weekday before the main Boat Race, takes place on the Thames between Putney and Hammersmith.\n\n== Build-up ==\n;Men's race\nTraining for the Boat Race officially begins in September, before the start of term. The first public tests are in November at the [[British Indoor Rowing Championships]], where each university sends around 20 rowers to compete. Everyone races 2&nbsp;km on an [[indoor rower]] with the club presidents using adjacent machines. Both universities also send crews to the [[Head of the River Fours]] race in London, which is raced over the reverse Boat Race course, that is to say the Championship course from Mortlake to Putney.\n\nIn December, the coaches put out ''Trial Eights'' where two crews from the same university race each other over the full Boat Race course. These crews are given names such as ''Kara'' and ''Whakamanawa'' ([[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] words for strength and honour, Cambridge 2004) or ''Cowboys'' and ''Indians'' (Oxford 2004). Other trials boat names have included such pairings as ''Guns'' and ''Roses.''\n\nOver the Christmas period the squads go on training camps abroad, where final places for the blue boats are decided. After the final blue boat crews have been decided, they race against the top crews from the UK and abroad (e.g. in recent years the men's crew have raced [[Leander Club|Leander]], [[Molesey Boat Club|Molesey]], the German international crew, and a composite crew of Olympic scullers<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7959908.stm |work=BBC News | title=Students v Supermen | date=24 March 2009 | accessdate=27 March 2010 | first=Martin | last=Gough}}</ref>). These races are only over part of the course (from Putney to [[Chiswick Eyot]]).\n\nIn case of injury or illness, each university men's crew has ten extra rowers, eight in the reserve boats ''Isis'' and ''Goldie'', and two as the spare pair. Isis and Goldie race 30&nbsp;mins before the Blue Boat event over the same course. As for the spare pair, in the week before the main event they race each other from the mile post to university stone (i.e. from a point one mile into the Championship Course back to the Boat Race start). In the final week, there is also an official weigh in and the average crew weights are announced. The perceived slight advantage of being the heavier crew leads to the practice of drinking large volumes of water directly before the weigh in order to artificially increase weight for a short period of time.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/03/25/socrac25.xml | title=Oxford bank on a flying start to counter light blues' finess | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=25 March 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010 | author=Cracknell, James | location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Popular culture ==\n''Boat race'' became such a popular phrase that it was incorporated into [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]], for \"face\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kemmer|first1=Suzanne|title=Cockney Rhyming Slang|url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~kemmer/Words04/usage/slang_cockney.html|website=Words in English|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the stories of [[P.
