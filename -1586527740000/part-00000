[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] within [[Cheshire]], Leasowe was part of the old County Borough of Wallasey, and is now within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral]], the [[Wallasey (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallasey parliamentary constituency]] and the New Wallasey Regeneration programme. However, it also has its own characteristics and is often regarded as a separate town. At the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]], Leasowe had a population of 6,180 (2,890 males, 3,290 females).<ref name=wirral2001census>{{citation|url=http://www.wirral.gov.uk/factsandfigures/census2001/oneward2recset.asp?ref=TS21|title=Wirral 2001 Census: Leasowe|publisher=Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|accessdate=5 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005242/http://www.wirral.gov.uk/factsandfigures/census2001/oneward2recset.asp?ref=TS21|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> By the time of the 2011 Census figures for Leasowe were no longer maintained. However, there was an [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] called Leasowe and Moreton East. The population of the ward at this Census was 14,640.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13689470&c=Hoylake&d=14&e=62&g=6352595&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1433165886362&enc=1|title=Ward population 2011|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe name 'Leasowe' comes from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Leasowes'' or 'Meadow Pastures'. Its [[sand dunes]] are the largest such system on the Wirral. Much of the area is at or below sea level and is protected by the coastal embankment. Houses built in the early 20th century were often flooded and unsanitary, but after about 1926, new roads and drainage were put in by the Borough Council, and much new housing was developed. Along the embankment between Leasowe and Moreton are the remains of fortifications built during the Second World War.\n\nThe world's first passenger [[hovercraft]] service operated in 1961\u201362. The service travelled from Moreton Common, and was advertised as between Wallasey and [[Rhyl]] in North Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/people/the_hovercraft_history_of_the_wirral_and_north_wales_1_1570160|title=The hovercraft history of the Wirral and North Wales|work=Cheshire Life|date=4 June 2012|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> However, the service was not profitable and soon ceased.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[River Fender]] merges with [[the Birket]] at Leasowe. The Birket then continues towards [[Great Float|West Float]] at the site of the former Wallasey Pool.\n\n{{Geographic location|width=auto\n|title = '''Neighbouring places'''\n|Northwest = [[Liverpool Bay]] ''([[Irish Sea]])''\n|North = [[Liverpool Bay]] ''([[Irish Sea]])''\n|Northeast = [[Liverpool Bay]] ''([[Irish Sea]])''\n|West = [[North Wirral Coastal Park]]\n|Centre = Leasowe\n|East = [[Wallasey]]\n|Southwest = [[Moreton, Merseyside|Moreton]]\n|South = [[Moreton, Merseyside|Moreton]]\n|Southeast = [[Bidston]]\n}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n===Solar School===\nOn Leasowe Road is the first building in the world to be heated entirely by [[solar heating|solar]] energy. At 53.4\u00b0N, it is also the most northerly. The [http://wikimapia.org/4031698/Solar-Campus \"Solar Campus\"] was formerly St George's Secondary School and was built in 1961<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-georges-school.co.uk/georges_profile.html|title=St Georges|work=St Georges School|accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref> to the designs of Emslie Morgan, the Assistant Borough Architect, who spent a lifetime looking into ways of harnessing the sun's rays. His research resulted in a matchbox like building with, on one side a drab, windowless fa\u00e7ade and on the other {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|-3}} of glass, a giant solar wall. The wall is built of glass leaves two feet apart. These draw the ultra violet rays from sunshine and bounce them around the walls of the classrooms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The walls become warm and heat the air. Hardly any warmth escapes through the school's massively thick roof and walls covered with slabs of plastic foam. On the coldest days it is always 60 degrees Fahrenheit inside, and in summer the school is cooler than its more conventional neighbours, for panels inside the glass wall can be turned to deflect heat or absorb it.\n\nIn practice, the large convector ducts which direct the warmed air to the colder north side of the building are a major safety hazard, and fire breaks have had to be inserted to reduce or cut off the air flow. The result is that on sunny days the south, glazed side of the building reaches unbearable temperatures in excess of 40&nbsp;\u00b0C while for most of the time the unglazed north side never reaches a comfortable temperature nor receives much natural light.\n\nA secondary, small single-pipe heating system was installed to give additional heating on cold winter days with very few hours of sunlight. The system is fuelled by oil, which was cheap at the time. Today, the secondary heating has to be used very often, and is very expensive.\n\nThe property is maintained by the Children & Young People's Department of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, which struggles to find the necessary revenue and capital to fully maintain this Grade II* [[listed building]].\n\n===Leasowe Castle===\n[[File:Leasowe Castle.jpg|200px|thumb|Leasowe Castle]]\n'''Leasowe Castle''' may have been built for [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]]<ref name=Randall>{{harvnb|Randall|1984|pp=44\u201346}}</ref> \u2013 a patron of [[Shakespeare]] \u2013 in 1593, possibly (though this is disputed) as an observation platform for the Wallasey races which took place on the sands in the 16th and 17th centuries, and which are regarded as a forerunner of the [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]] races. Ferdinando's brother [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|William, the 6th Earl]], was described as a noted sportsman and is remembered as a keen supporter of the Wallasey races.\n\nAt first the castle consisted only of an octagonal tower. This had become disused by 1700, and it became known as \"Mockbeggar Hall\", a term often used for an ornate but derelict building.<ref name=\"Castle\">{{cite web\n|title=Leasowe Castle web site\n|url=http://www.leasowecastle.com/about-us.html\n|accessdate=28 June 2012\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408205330/http://www.leasowecastle.com/about-us.html\n|archive-date=8 April 2012\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> The term \"Mockbeggar Wharf\" is still used for the adjoining foreshore. The \"Mockbeggar Hall\" is also the name of a [[Wetherspoons]] pub in neighbouring Moreton.\n\nIn 1821 ownership passed to the Cust family.<ref name=Randall /> After 1826 the building was used as a hotel for some years. The ceiling of the [[Star Chamber]] at the [[Palace of Westminster]] was brought to the castle in 1836 along with panelling and other furnishings; they had been salvaged from the old Palace of Westminster before the Star Chamber was demolished in an 1806 building project.<ref>http://leasowecastle.com/dine/</ref> The Star Chamber was so called because the ceiling was decorated with bright stars. The ceiling and four tapestries depicting the four seasons still remain.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] within [[Cheshire]], Leasowe was part of the old County Borough of Wallasey, and is now within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral]], the [[Wallasey (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallasey parliamentary constituency]] and the New Wallasey Regeneration programme. However, it also has its own characteristics and is often regarded as a separate town. At the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]], Leasowe had a population of 6,180 (2,890 males, 3,290 females).<ref name=wirral2001census>{{citation|url=http://www.wirral.gov.uk/factsandfigures/census2001/oneward2recset.asp?ref=TS21|title=Wirral 2001 Census: Leasowe|publisher=Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|accessdate=5 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005242/http://www.wirral.gov.uk/factsandfigures/census2001/oneward2recset.asp?ref=TS21|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> By the time of the 2011 Census figures for Leasowe were no longer maintained.

Its [[sand dunes]] are the largest such system on the Wirral. Much of the area is at or below sea level and is protected by the coastal embankment. Houses built in the early 20th century were often flooded and unsanitary, but after about 1926, new roads and drainage were put in by the Borough Council, and much new housing was developed. Along the embankment between Leasowe and Moreton are the remains of fortifications built during the Second World War.\n\nThe world's first passenger [[hovercraft]] service operated in 1961\u201362. The service travelled from Moreton Common, and was advertised as between Wallasey and [[Rhyl]] in North Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/people/the_hovercraft_history_of_the_wirral_and_north_wales_1_1570160|title=The hovercraft history of the Wirral and North Wales|work=Cheshire Life|date=4 June 2012|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref> However, the service was not profitable and soon ceased.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[River Fender]] merges with [[the Birket]] at Leasowe. The Birket then continues towards [[Great Float|West Float]] at the site of the former Wallasey Pool.\n\n{{Geographic location|width=auto\n|title = '''Neighbouring places'''\n|Northwest = [[Liverpool Bay]] ''([[Irish Sea]])''\n|North = [[Liverpool Bay]] ''([[Irish Sea]])''\n|Northeast = [[Liverpool Bay]] ''([[Irish Sea]])''\n|West = [[North Wirral Coastal Park]]\n|Centre = Leasowe\n|East = [[Wallasey]]\n|Southwest = [[Moreton, Merseyside|Moreton]]\n|South = [[Moreton, Merseyside|Moreton]]\n|Southeast = [[Bidston]]\n}}\n\n==Landmarks==\n===Solar School===\nOn Leasowe Road is the first building in the world to be heated entirely by [[solar heating|solar]] energy. At 53.4\u00b0N, it is also the most northerly. The [http://wikimapia.org/4031698/Solar-Campus \"Solar Campus\"] was formerly St George's Secondary School and was built in 1961<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-georges-school.co.uk/georges_profile.html|title=St Georges|work=St Georges School|accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref> to the designs of Emslie Morgan, the Assistant Borough Architect, who spent a lifetime looking into ways of harnessing the sun's rays. His research resulted in a matchbox like building with, on one side a drab, windowless fa\u00e7ade and on the other {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|-3}} of glass, a giant solar wall. The wall is built of glass leaves two feet apart. These draw the ultra violet rays from sunshine and bounce them around the walls of the classrooms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The walls become warm and heat the air. Hardly any warmth escapes through the school's massively thick roof and walls covered with slabs of plastic foam. On the coldest days it is always 60 degrees Fahrenheit inside, and in summer the school is cooler than its more conventional neighbours, for panels inside the glass wall can be turned to deflect heat or absorb it.\n\nIn practice, the large convector ducts which direct the warmed air to the colder north side of the building are a major safety hazard, and fire breaks have had to be inserted to reduce or cut off the air flow. The result is that on sunny days the south, glazed side of the building reaches unbearable temperatures in excess of 40&nbsp;\u00b0C while for most of the time the unglazed north side never reaches a comfortable temperature nor receives much natural light.\n\nA secondary, small single-pipe heating system was installed to give additional heating on cold winter days with very few hours of sunlight. The system is fuelled by oil, which was cheap at the time. Today, the secondary heating has to be used very often, and is very expensive.\n\nThe property is maintained by the Children & Young People's Department of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, which struggles to find the necessary revenue and capital to fully maintain this Grade II* [[listed building]].\n\n===Leasowe Castle===\n[[File:Leasowe Castle.jpg|200px|thumb|Leasowe Castle]]\n'''Leasowe Castle''' may have been built for [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]]<ref name=Randall>{{harvnb|Randall|1984|pp=44\u201346}}</ref> \u2013 a patron of [[Shakespeare]] \u2013 in 1593, possibly (though this is disputed) as an observation platform for the Wallasey races which took place on the sands in the 16th and 17th centuries, and which are regarded as a forerunner of the [[Derby (horse race)|Derby]] races. Ferdinando's brother [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|William, the 6th Earl]], was described as a noted sportsman and is remembered as a keen supporter of the Wallasey races.\n\nAt first the castle consisted only of an octagonal tower.

He built quarters for servants and men at arms on the double courtyard that was surrounded by a moat. He also added state and family apartments on the second courtyard. The Chapel, which would become St. Mary's, and the tithe barn were also built under Boteler.

Richard used the castle as a base for the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]]. He later exchanged this property for [[Richmond Castle]], making Sudeley property of the crown. Ownership of the castle returned to Richard when he became king in 1483. During his reign, the Banqueting Hall, with [[oriel window]]s, and the adjoining state rooms, now in ruins, were built in place of the eastern range of Boteler's inner court as part of a royal suite.\n\nAfter King Richard's death at the [[Battle of Bosworth]], Sudeley passed to the new king, [[Henry VII of England]], who then gave it to his uncle, [[Jasper Tudor|Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford]].  By the time King [[Henry VIII of England]] succeeded to the throne, the castle was the property of the Crown again. In 1535, King Henry VIII and his second wife, Queen [[Anne Boleyn]], visited the castle, which had been empty and unattended for some time.\n\n[[File:Sudeley Gatehouse.png|thumb|left|The Gatehouse]]\nWhen King Henry VIII died, the castle became the property of his son, King [[Edward VI of England]], who gave it to his uncle, [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]], whom he made Baron of Sudeley. In early Spring 1547, Lord Seymour married King Edward's stepmother, the Dowager Queen [[Catherine Parr]]. At the announcement of her pregnancy in late 1547, Seymour began to renovate the castle for Catherine's use, but only one room that he built remains today. Lord Seymour and Catherine decided that she should move to Sudeley for the final months of her pregnancy. At about six months, Catherine was accompanied by [[Lady Jane Grey]] and a large retinue of ladies to attend on her, as well as over one hundred gentlemen of the household and Yeomen of the guard. Catherine's sister [[Anne Herbert, Countess of Pembroke|Anne, Countess of Pembroke]], also came and attended upon her as her chief lady and groom of the stool. Catherine gave birth to her daughter, Lady [[Mary Seymour]], on 30 August 1548, only to die on 5 September of that year. She was buried in the Chapel. Her grave was later discovered in 1782, after the castle and the chapel had been left in ruins by the [[English Civil War]]. She was later reinterred by the Rector of Sudeley in 1817, and an elaborate tomb was erected in her honour.\n\nIn 1549, Lord Seymour's ambitions led him to be arrested and beheaded; after which, Sudeley Castle became the property of Catherine's brother, [[William Parr, 1st Marquess of Northampton]]. After Parr's involvement with the plot to put [[Lady Jane Grey]] on the throne, he was stripped of his property and title by Queen [[Mary I of England]]. Parr would regain his titles later on under Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], but the Castle remained property of the Crown.\n\nIn 1554, Queen Mary I gave Sudeley Castle to [[John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos]], and it remained his property throughout her reign and the reign of Queen Elizabeth I as well. It was at Sudeley that Queen Elizabeth was entertained three times. Also, a spectacular three-day feast was held there to celebrate the anniversary of the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1592, and [[Elizabeth Brydges]] was presented to the queen in the guise of [[Daphne]].<ref>Elizabeth Zeman Kolkovich, ''The Elizabethan Country House Entertainment'' (Cambridge, 2016), pp. 73-8.</ref> John Brydges is buried in the chapel, as is [[Giles Brugge, 6th Baron Chandos]].\n\nIn 1877, the then owner described the castle thus:\n<blockquote>Few residences can boast a greater antiquity, or have witnessed more striking changes. A mansum, or manor-house, before the Conquest, a baronial castle in the time of Stephen, then alternately going to decay, or rising into additional magnificence, with stately towers to overlook the vale \u2014 again suffering from neglect, and once more right royally restored and beautified to receive the widowed Queen as Seymour's Bride, with all her lordly retinue.<ref>Emma Dent, ''Annals of Winchcombe and Sudeley'' (London: John Murray, 1877)[https://archive.org/stream/annalswinchcomb00dentgoog/annalswinchcomb00dentgoog_djvu.txt p. 1.]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Current ownership==\nThe current owners are Elizabeth, Lady Ashcombe, widow of [[Henry Cubitt, 4th Baron Ashcombe]], and her two children: Henry Dent-Brocklehurst and [[Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst]]. After the death of Lady Ashcombe's first husband [[Mark Dent-Brocklehurst]] in 1972, she owns 50 percent of the equity, while her children each own 25 percent.\n\nMark inherited Sudeley in 1949 after the death of his father. His mother decided to stay at the castle though until 1969.

Visitors can also visit Katherine Parr's tomb in St Mary's Church \u2013 Sudeley is notable for being the only private castle to have a queen buried in its grounds.\n\nTextiles Exhibition: This features a collection of textiles from Sudeley's history displaying textile techniques spanning over 400 years. This exhibition has been described{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as one of the best in the country and includes a 17th-century stumpwork casket, delicate lace and a Sheldon tapestry.\n\n==Cultural references==\n* Sudeley is regarded by many as the model for [[Blandings Castle]] in the novels by [[P.

More than 1,200 box hedges form its intricate geometric design, interspersed with coloured gravel and a Moorish mosaic fountain at the centre.\n\nThe ruins of the 15th-century tithe barn form the centre of a garden, featuring a carp pond surrounded by wisteria, primroses, hollyhocks and cardoons.\n\nOther gardens at Sudeley include the Secret Garden, the Mulberry Garden and the Herb Garden Walk. In the Mulberry Garden, country flowers and greenery surrounds the mulberry tree planted in 1865 by Emma Dent. The Herb Garden Walk takes visitors through a fine collection of plants which have been cultivated for their medical properties for thousands of years.\n\n==Cottages==\nSudeley Castle Country Cottages are located on the edge of the estate, midway between the castle and the historic town of Winchcombe.

It was at Sudeley that Queen Elizabeth was entertained three times. Also, a spectacular three-day feast was held there to celebrate the anniversary of the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1592, and [[Elizabeth Brydges]] was presented to the queen in the guise of [[Daphne]].<ref>Elizabeth Zeman Kolkovich, ''The Elizabethan Country House Entertainment'' (Cambridge, 2016), pp. 73-8.</ref> John Brydges is buried in the chapel, as is [[Giles Brugge, 6th Baron Chandos]].\n\nIn 1877, the then owner described the castle thus:\n<blockquote>Few residences can boast a greater antiquity, or have witnessed more striking changes. A mansum, or manor-house, before the Conquest, a baronial castle in the time of Stephen, then alternately going to decay, or rising into additional magnificence, with stately towers to overlook the vale \u2014 again suffering from neglect, and once more right royally restored and beautified to receive the widowed Queen as Seymour's Bride, with all her lordly retinue.<ref>Emma Dent, ''Annals of Winchcombe and Sudeley'' (London: John Murray, 1877)[https://archive.org/stream/annalswinchcomb00dentgoog/annalswinchcomb00dentgoog_djvu.txt p. 1.]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Current ownership==\nThe current owners are Elizabeth, Lady Ashcombe, widow of [[Henry Cubitt, 4th Baron Ashcombe]], and her two children: Henry Dent-Brocklehurst and [[Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst]]. After the death of Lady Ashcombe's first husband [[Mark Dent-Brocklehurst]] in 1972, she owns 50 percent of the equity, while her children each own 25 percent.\n\nMark inherited Sudeley in 1949 after the death of his father. His mother decided to stay at the castle though until 1969. It was at this time that Mark and his American-born wife, Elizabeth, decided to open up the castle to the public.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2012/jun/01/tea-lady-ashcombe-emma-kennedy?newsfeed=true |title=Emma's Eccentric Britain: afternoon tea with Lady Ashcombe |date=June 1, 2012 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |author=Emma Kennedy}}</ref> It took two years to convert the home into a tourist attraction, but Mark died in 1972, leaving a large amount of both debts and death duties.

The exhibition also features her love letters to Thomas Seymour and the eyewitness account of the discovery of her body at Sudeley in 1782. These, together with items taken from her tomb, help to illustrate Dr David Starkey's film \u2018The Life and Loves of Katherine Parr, Queen of England and Mistress of Sudeley\u2019, which is shown alongside the exhibition. Visitors can also visit Katherine Parr's tomb in St Mary's Church \u2013 Sudeley is notable for being the only private castle to have a queen buried in its grounds.\n\nTextiles Exhibition: This features a collection of textiles from Sudeley's history displaying textile techniques spanning over 400 years. This exhibition has been described{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as one of the best in the country and includes a 17th-century stumpwork casket, delicate lace and a Sheldon tapestry.\n\n==Cultural references==\n* Sudeley is regarded by many as the model for [[Blandings Castle]] in the novels by [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>N. T. P. Murphy (1981) ''In Search of Blandings''</ref> The adaptation for [[BBC]] television of Wodehouse's ''[[Heavy Weather (TV)|Heavy Weather]]'' (1995) was filmed there.\n* Scenes in series 1, episode 5 of the BBC series ''[[Father Brown (2013 TV series)|Father Brown]]'' was filmed at Sudeley.\n* Sudeley represented Matching Priory, home of Plantagenet Palliser and his wife Lady Glencora, in the 1974 BBC classic serial ''[[The Pallisers]]'', based on six novels by [[Anthony Trollope]].\n* Sudeley provided the location for [[BBC Two]] show ''The Great Chelsea Garden Challenge'' in May 2015.\n* The castle featured on [[BBC One]] show ''[[Antiques Road Trip]]'' in September 2015.\n\n==Gardens==\n[[File:sudeley-castle-uk.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[knot garden]]]]\n\nSudeley Castle's has nine individual gardens. The centrepiece is the Queens Garden, so named because four of England's queens&nbsp;\u2013 Anne Boleyn, Katherine Parr, Lady Jane Grey and Elizabeth I&nbsp;\u2013 once admired the hundreds of varieties of roses found in the garden.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Queens' Garden | url=http://www.sudeleycastle.co.uk/gardens/queens-garden/ | accessdate=27 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nSt Mary's Church, in which Katherine Parr is buried, is bordered by the White Garden, rich with peonies, clematis, roses and tulips, where Katherine and her companion, Lady Jane Grey would have entered the church for daily prayers.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe Knot Garden is based on a dress pattern worn by Elizabeth I in a portrait that hangs in the castle. More than 1,200 box hedges form its intricate geometric design, interspersed with coloured gravel and a Moorish mosaic fountain at the centre.\n\nThe ruins of the 15th-century tithe barn form the centre of a garden, featuring a carp pond surrounded by wisteria, primroses, hollyhocks and cardoons.\n\nOther gardens at Sudeley include the Secret Garden, the Mulberry Garden and the Herb Garden Walk. In the Mulberry Garden, country flowers and greenery surrounds the mulberry tree planted in 1865 by Emma Dent. The Herb Garden Walk takes visitors through a fine collection of plants which have been cultivated for their medical properties for thousands of years.\n\n==Cottages==\nSudeley Castle Country Cottages are located on the edge of the estate, midway between the castle and the historic town of Winchcombe. This small attractive complex of Cotswold stone cottages is set around a central courtyard with landscaped gardens and parking. The eleven cottages are all named for royal or significant people associated with the castle, and are available all year round.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Louisa Pitt]]\n* [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland]]\n* [[List of castles in England]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sudeleycastle.co.uk/home Sudeley Castle official website]\n\n{{coord|51|56|50|N|1|57|22|W|display=title|region:GB_type:city_source:dewiki}}\n\n[[Category:Castles in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Gardens in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Houses in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed buildings in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Textile museums in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Grade II* listed parks and gardens in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Burial sites of the Brydges/Brugge family]]\n[[Category:Winchcombe]]\n", "name_user": "Sirjestalot", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCultural references:Corrected own typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudeley_Castle"}

Persian coats consist of a woolly under coat and a long, hairy outer coat. The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, \"inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body.\" The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement.

Some organizations, including the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA), consider the peke-face type as their modern standard for the Persian breed. Thus the [[retronym]] Traditional Persian was created to refer to the original type, which is still bred, mirroring the renaming of the original-style [[Siamese cat]] as the Traditional Siamese or [[Thai cat|Thai]], to distinguish it from the long-faced modern development which has taken over as simply \"the Siamese\".\n\nNot all cat fancier groups recognize the Traditional Persian (at all, or as distinct), or give it that specific name.

Despite this, breeders took a liking to the look and started breeding towards the peke-face look. The over-accentuation of the breed's characteristics by selective breeding (called ''extreme-'' or ''ultra-typing'') produced results similar to the peke-faced Persians. The term peke-face has been used to refer to the ultra-typed Persian but it is properly used only to refer to red and red tabby Persians bearing the mutation.

This is a type of face which is definitely recognized in the United States, and helps to form a special group within the show classification for the [Persian] breed. There are certainly disadvantages when the face has become too short, for this exaggeration of type is inclined to produce a deformity of the tear ducts, and running eyes may be the result. A cat with running eyes will never look at its best because in time the fur on each side of the nose becomes stained, and thus detracts from the general appearance [...] The nose should be short, but perhaps a plea may be made here that the nose is better if it is not too short and at the same time uptilted. A nose of this type creates an impression of grotesqueness which is not really attractive, and there is always a danger of running eyes.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Stephanie 2.jpg|thumb|right|A smoke Persian with moderate features]]\n\nWhile the looks of the Persian changed, the Persian Breed Council's standard for the Persian had remained basically the same.

This was to make it easy for breeders who do not want Himalayan blood in their breeding lines to avoid individuals who, while not necessarily exhibiting the colorpoint pattern, may be carrying the point coloration gene recessively. Persians with Himalayan ancestry has registration numbers starting with 3 and are commonly referred to by breeders as colorpoint carriers (CPC) or 3000-series cats, although not all will actually carry the recessive gene.

The [[crossbreed]] look gained recognition in the show ring, but other breeders unhappy with the changes successfully pushed for new breed standards that would disqualify ASH that showed signs of crossbreeding.\n\nOne ASH breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/ASH cross proposed, and eventually managed, to get the CFA to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name [[Exotic Shorthair]]. Regular outcrossing to the Persian has made present-day Exotic Shorthair similar to the Persian in every way, including temperament and conformation, with the exception of the short dense coat. It has even inherited much of the Persian's health problems. The easier to manage coat has made some label the Exotic Shorthair \"the lazy person's Persian\".\n\nBecause of the regular use of Persians as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a one in four chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by CFA, although [[The International Cat Association]] accepts them as Persians. Other associations register them as a separate Exotic Longhair breed.<ref name=\"Helgren4\">{{cite web |last=Helgren|first=J.

In [[South Africa]], the attempt to separate the breed was more successful; the [[Southern Africa Cat Council]] (SACC) registers cats with five generations of purebred Chinchilla as a Chinchilla Longhair. The Chinchilla Longhair has a slightly longer nose than the Persian, resulting in healthy breathing and less eye tearing. Its hair is translucent with only the tips carrying black pigment, a feature that gets lost when out-crossed to other colored Persians. Out-crossing also may result in losing nose and lip liner, which is a fault in the Chinchilla Longhair breed standard.

If classified as the Himalayan sub-breed, full [[point coloration]] is required, the fourth TICA color division, with a \"pale and creamy colored\" body even lighter than mink, with intense coloration on the face an extremities. The four TICA categories are essentially a graduated scale of color distribution from evenly colored to mostly colored only at the points.  Within each, the coloration may be further classified as solid, [[Tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] (or \"tortie\"), [[Tabby cat|tabby]], silver or smoke, solid-and-white, tortoiseshell-and-white, tabby-and-white, or silver/smoke-and-white, with various specific colors and modifiers (e.g. chocolate tortoiseshell point, or fawn shaded mink marbled tabby-torbie). TICA-recognized tabby patterns include classic, mackerel, marbled, spotted, and ticked (in two genetic forms), while other patterns include shaded, chinchilla, and two tabbie-tortie variations, golden, and grizzled.  Basic colors include white, black, brown, ruddy, bronze, \"blue\" (grey), chocolate, cinnamon, lilac, fawn, red, cream, with a silver or shaded variant of most. Not counting bi-color (piebald) or parti-color coats, nor combinations that are genetically impossible, there are nearly 1,000 named coat pattern variations in the TICA system for which the Persian/Himalayan qualifies. The Exotic Shorthair sub-breed qualifies for every cat coat variation that TICA recognizes.<ref name=\"TICA std\" />\n<!-- FIFe here -->\n<!-- Australian Cat Federation here.-->\n\nEye colors range widely, and may include blue, copper, [[Odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] blue and copper, green, blue-green, and hazel.

Hair on the shoulders and upper part of the hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, \"inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body.\" The Angora's hair is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement. However, Bell says the Angora \"fails to the Persian in head,\" Angoras having a more wedge-shaped head and Persians having a rounder head.\n\nBell notes that Angoras and Persians have been crossbred, resulting in a decided improvement to each breed, but claimed the long-haired cat of 1909 had significantly more Persian influence than Angora.\n\nChampion lamented the lack of distinction among various long-haired types by English fanciers, who in 1887, decided to group them under the umbrella term \"Long-haired Cats\".<ref name=\"champion\"/><ref name=\"Helgren2\">{{cite web |last=Helgren|first=J.

Some organizations, including the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA), consider the peke-face type as their modern standard for the Persian breed.

The over-accentuation of the breed's characteristics by selective breeding (called ''extreme-'' or ''ultra-typing'') produced results similar to the peke-faced Persians.

This is a type of face which is definitely recognized in the United States, and helps to form a special group within the show classification for the [Persian] breed. There are certainly disadvantages when the face has become too short, for this exaggeration of type is inclined to produce a deformity of the tear ducts, and running eyes may be the result. A cat with running eyes will never look at its best because in time the fur on each side of the nose becomes stained, and thus detracts from the general appearance [...] The nose should be short, but perhaps a plea may be made here that the nose is better if it is not too short and at the same time uptilted.

The [[crossbreed]] look gained recognition in the show ring, but other breeders unhappy with the changes successfully pushed for new breed standards that would disqualify ASH that showed signs of crossbreeding.\n\nOne ASH breeder who saw the potential of the Persian/ASH cross proposed, and eventually managed, to get the CFA to recognize them as a new breed in 1966, under the name [[Exotic Shorthair]]. Regular outcrossing to the Persian has made present-day Exotic Shorthair similar to the Persian in every way, including temperament and conformation, with the exception of the short dense coat. It has even inherited much of the Persian's health problems. The easier to manage coat has made some label the Exotic Shorthair \"the lazy person's Persian\".\n\nBecause of the regular use of Persians as outcrosses, some Exotics may carry a copy of the recessive longhair gene. When two such cats mate, there is a one in four chance of each offspring being longhaired. Longhaired Exotics are not considered Persians by CFA, although [[The International Cat Association]] accepts them as Persians.

If classified as the Himalayan sub-breed, full [[point coloration]] is required, the fourth TICA color division, with a \"pale and creamy colored\" body even lighter than mink, with intense coloration on the face an extremities. The four TICA categories are essentially a graduated scale of color distribution from evenly colored to mostly colored only at the points.  Within each, the coloration may be further classified as solid, [[Tortoiseshell cat|tortoiseshell]] (or \"tortie\"), [[Tabby cat|tabby]], silver or smoke, solid-and-white, tortoiseshell-and-white, tabby-and-white, or silver/smoke-and-white, with various specific colors and modifiers (e.g. chocolate tortoiseshell point, or fawn shaded mink marbled tabby-torbie). TICA-recognized tabby patterns include classic, mackerel, marbled, spotted, and ticked (in two genetic forms), while other patterns include shaded, chinchilla, and two tabbie-tortie variations, golden, and grizzled.  Basic colors include white, black, brown, ruddy, bronze, \"blue\" (grey), chocolate, cinnamon, lilac, fawn, red, cream, with a silver or shaded variant of most. Not counting bi-color (piebald) or parti-color coats, nor combinations that are genetically impossible, there are nearly 1,000 named coat pattern variations in the TICA system for which the Persian/Himalayan qualifies.
