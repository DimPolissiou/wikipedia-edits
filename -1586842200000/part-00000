In 2003, ''MVP'' became the official successor to EA's long-running ''[[Triple Play series|Triple Play Baseball]]'' series, and it simulated [[Major League Baseball]] from 2003 to 2005. However, an exclusive licensing deal between [[Major League Baseball]] and [[Take-Two Interactive]] in 2005 prohibited EA Sports from making another MLB game until 2012. In response, EA made [[NCAA]] [[college baseball]] games in 2006 and 2007, but discontinued the series in 2008 because of poor sales.\n\n==History==\n\n===''MVP Baseball 2003''===\n''MVP Baseball 2003'' was released in 2003 as the successor to EA's ''Triple Play'' games, though it bore little more than a graphical similarity to its predecessors, which had been heavily maligned by critics in the series' final years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/objects/017/017371.html|title=Triple Play 2002 (PlayStation 2)|website=IGN}}</ref>\n\nIntroducing an innovative pitch meter and zone-based hitting system (see below), ''MVP 2003'' was well received by critics, most of whom considered the game's overhaul to be a major improvement over ''Triple Play''\u2032s last entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/11/mvp-baseball-2003|title=MVP Baseball 2003|first=Jon|last=Robinson|date=11 March 2003|publisher=}}</ref> At the review-aggregation site [[Metacritic]], ''MVP 2003'' was given a score of 81/100 for the [[PlayStation 2]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/mvp-baseball-2003|title=MVP Baseball 2003|website=Metacritic}}</ref> and 82/100 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/mvp-baseball-2003/critic-reviews|title=MVP Baseball 2003|website=Metacritic}}</ref>\n\n[[Randy Johnson]] and [[Miguel Tejada]] were the cover players.\n\nThe 2003 game is the last game that uses a points system for player's salary, starting with the 2004 game an actual dollar amount is used for salaries. The 2003 game does not penalize a user for releasing a player during the season in franchise mode, whereas the 2004 and 2005 games invoke a salary penalty for releasing a player under contract.\n\n===''MVP Baseball 2004'' & ''2005''===\n{{Main|MVP Baseball 2005}}\n\nBuilding on ''MVP 2003''{{'}}s surprisingly successful rookie effort, the 2004 edition made major refinements to both the game's control scheme and its dynasty mode.

The agreement, which ran from Spring 2006 to 2012, allowed only Take-Two Interactive and the [[video game console|console]] manufacturers [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]], [[Microsoft Game Studios|Microsoft]], and [[Nintendo]] to produce MLB titles for their respective platforms, but barred other [[third-party developer|third party developers]] such as EA Sports from continuing or developing their own MLB games.\n\n''MVP Baseball 2005'' was the last official MLB release from EA Sports, also [[End-of-life (product)|official support for the game ended]].

[[Barry Bonds]], while an MLBPA member, did not sign the common MLBPA licensing agreement and was replaced by the fictional Jon Dowd. Some players who are not members of the MLBPA were omitted completely. For example, [[Kevin Millar]], who is not a member of the MLBPA, was omitted completely from the 2004 edition, with [[David Ortiz]] leaving his real-life [[Designated hitter]] spot and filling at [[First baseman|first base]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]]. In ''MVP Baseball 2005'', he was replaced by the fictional Anthony Friese.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mvpbaseball04cover.jpg|thumb|MVP Baseball 2004 for the [[Personal computer|PC]]]] -->''MVP Baseball 2004'' featured a unique addition to any baseball game, allowing users to play as the [[Minor league baseball|Minor League]] affiliations of [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] teams, a feature that was expanded in the following year. Various editions of the game have featured [[Randy Johnson]], [[Miguel Tejada]], [[Albert Pujols]], and [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]] on its cover. Of those four, Tejada and Pujols have won [[Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) awards during their careers, and the other two have been named MVPs of the World series. [[Randy Johnson]] has also won the [[Cy Young Award]] five times.\n\n===Innovations===\nUpon its release in 2003, one of the game's most inventive aspects was its [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]]/throw meter. Until then, most baseball games' pitching schemes required players simply to press the button corresponding to the pitch they wanted to throw, and hold the button down for a certain length of time to determine how hard the pitch was thrown. In ''MVP Baseball'', the player first holds down the pitch button (or throw button) to judge the power; once the desired power level is attained, the player must release the button and attempt to tap the same button within a target area. The closer the player gets to the target area, the more accurate the pitch or throw will be. While innovative within the field of baseball games, EA in fact adapted this feature from [[golf]] games, which often feature a moving meter to determine the power and accuracy of shots (golf games largely abandoned shot meters around the time that ''MVP Baseball'' introduced it).\n\nThe game also incorporated a strike zone divided into nine areas of the plate designed as \"hot and cold zones\". The feature uses color-coding with the colors red, white, and blue to represent the player's ability to hit pitches in the given area; red, white, and blue indicate whether the player hits well, neutrally, or poorly, respectively, in the given segment of the strike zone.\n\n===Soundtracks===\nLike all recent EA Sports games, the soundtrack to each ''MVP Baseball'' title contains licensed songs, called [[EA Trax]]. The ''MVP Baseball'' series typically featured [[alternative rock]], ranging from mainstream artists like [[Sum 41]] to [[indie rock|indie]] acts like [[stellastarr*]]. The games featured several minor hits before they became popular such as \"C'mon C'mon\" by [[The Von Bondies]] which is also used as the theme song for the TV show ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]''.\n\n2003 Soundtrack:\n*[[The All-American Rejects]] \u2013 [[Swing, Swing]]\n*[[Boy Sets Fire]] \u2013 Handful of Redemption\n*[[The Donnas]] \u2013 Who Invited You\n*[[The Exies]] \u2013 Without\n*[[Hed PE]] \u2013 Blackout\n*[[Revis]] \u2013 Caught in the Rain\n*[[Burning Brides]] \u2013 Arctic Snow\n*[[OK Go]] \u2013 [[Don't Ask Me (OK Go song)|Don't Ask Me]]\n*[[Pacifier (band)|Pacifier]] \u2013 Bulletproof\n*[[Shinedown]] \u2013 [[Fly From the Inside]]\n*[[socialburn]] \u2013 Everyone\n*[[Soundtrack of Our Lives]] \u2013 Sister Surround\n*[[Sum 41]] \u2013 All Messed Up\n*[[Taproot (band)|Taproot]] \u2013 [[Poem (song)|Poem]]\n\n2004 Soundtrack:\n*[[Chronic Future]] \u2013 Time and Time Again\n*[[Hoodoo Gurus]] \u2013 [[Bittersweet (Hoodoo Gurus song)|Bittersweet]]\n*[[Lucky Boys Confusion]] \u2013 Hey Driver\n*[[Maxeen]] \u2013 Please\n*[[Seven Wiser]] \u2013 Take Me As I Am\n*[[Snow Patrol]] \u2013 [[Spitting Games]]\n*[[stellastar*|stellastarr]] \u2013 My Coco\n*[[Steriogram]] \u2013 [[Walkie Talkie Man]]\n*[[To My Surprise]] \u2013 Get It to Go\n*[[Trust Company (band)|Trust Company]] \u2013 Surfacing\n*[[The Von Bondies]] \u2013 [[C'mon C'mon (The Von Bondies song)|C'mon C'mon]]\n*Jonny Lives! \u2013 Get Steady\n*[[Home Town Hero]] \u2013 Robbers\n\n2005 Soundtrack:\n*[[...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead]] (Called \"...Trail of Dead\" in the game) \u2013 Let It Dive\n*[[The Bravery]] \u2013 [[An Honest Mistake]]\n*[[Donots]] \u2013 We Got the Noise\n*[[Dropkick Murphys]] \u2013 [[Tessie]]\n*[[The High Speed Scene]] \u2013 The IROC-Z Song\n*[[Hot Hot Heat]] \u2013 You Owe Me an IOU\n*[[Louis XIV (band)|Louis XIV]] \u2013 Finding Out True Love Is Blind\n*[[Rock n Roll Soldiers]] \u2013 Funny Little Feeling\n*[[The Zutons]] \u2013 [[Pressure Point (song)|Pressure Point]]\n\n2006 Soundtrack:\n*[[Action Action]]: Paper Cliche\n*[[Aiden]]: Die Romantic\n*[[Bayside (band)|Bayside]]: Devotion And Desire\n*[[Hawthorne Heights]]: This Is Who We Are\n*[[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]]: Smile In Your Sleep\n*[[The Forecast]]: These Lights\n*[[The Audition (band)|The Audition]]: Approach The Bench\n*[[The Black Maria]]: Organs\n*[[The Junior Varsity]]: Get Comfortable\n*[[Waterdown]]: Repeater\n\n==See also==\n*''[[MVP Baseball 2005]]''\n*''[[MVP 06: NCAA Baseball]]''\n*''[[MVP 07: NCAA Baseball]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Electronic Arts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mvp Baseball}}\n[[Category:Major League Baseball video games]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:EA Sports games]]\n[[Category:Electronic Arts franchises]]\n[[Category:NCAA video games|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the award|Most Valuable Player (baseball)}}\n{{short description|Video game series}}\n{{Italic title}}\n'''''MVP Baseball''''' was a [[baseball]] [[Video game|game]] series published by [[EA Sports]], running from 2003 to 2007 with five games produced.

In response, EA made [[NCAA]] [[college baseball]] games in 2006 and 2007, but discontinued the series in 2008 because of poor sales.\n\n==History==\n\n===''MVP Baseball 2003''===\n''MVP Baseball 2003'' was released in 2003 as the successor to EA's ''Triple Play'' games, though it bore little more than a graphical similarity to its predecessors, which had been heavily maligned by critics in the series' final years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/objects/017/017371.html|title=Triple Play 2002 (PlayStation 2)|website=IGN}}</ref>\n\nIntroducing an innovative pitch meter and zone-based hitting system (see below), ''MVP 2003'' was well received by critics, most of whom considered the game's overhaul to be a major improvement over ''Triple Play''\u2032s last entry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/11/mvp-baseball-2003|title=MVP Baseball 2003|first=Jon|last=Robinson|date=11 March 2003|publisher=}}</ref> At the review-aggregation site [[Metacritic]], ''MVP 2003'' was given a score of 81/100 for the [[PlayStation 2]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/mvp-baseball-2003|title=MVP Baseball 2003|website=Metacritic}}</ref> and 82/100 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/mvp-baseball-2003/critic-reviews|title=MVP Baseball 2003|website=Metacritic}}</ref>\n\n[[Randy Johnson]] and [[Miguel Tejada]] were the cover players.\n\nThe 2003 game is the last game that uses a points system for player's salary, starting with the 2004 game an actual dollar amount is used for salaries. The 2003 game does not penalize a user for releasing a player during the season in franchise mode, whereas the 2004 and 2005 games invoke a salary penalty for releasing a player under contract.\n\n===''MVP Baseball 2004'' & ''2005''===\n{{Main|MVP Baseball 2005}}\n\nBuilding on ''MVP 2003''{{'}}s surprisingly successful rookie effort, the 2004 edition made major refinements to both the game's control scheme and its dynasty mode. In a baseball gaming first, ''MVP 2004'' was licensed by both the MLB and [[Minor League Baseball]], featuring real minor-league teams at the Class AA & AAA levels. These improvements netted the PS2 and Xbox versions of ''MVP 2004'' twin scores of 90/100 at [[Metacritic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/mvp-baseball-2004|title=MVP Baseball 2004|website=Metacritic}}</ref> far outpacing the competing ''[[All-Star Baseball 2005]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/all-star-baseball-2005|title=All-Star Baseball 2005|website=Metacritic}}</ref> and ''[[2K Sports Major League Baseball series|ESPN Major League Baseball]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/espn-major-league-baseball|title=ESPN Major League Baseball|website=Metacritic}}</ref>\n\n[[Albert Pujols]] was the cover player for the 2004 installment of the series.\n\n''MVP Baseball 2005'' brought subtle changes to the ''MVP 2004'' formula, including a \"hitter's eye\" system with color codes that helped players identify pitch types out of the pitcher's hand, as well as an owner mode, the addition of Class A minor-league teams to dynasty mode, and [[spring training]] minigames. Reviewers continued to rate ''MVP'' highly, with [[Metacritic]] scores of 86 and 87 for the Xbox and PS2 versions, respectively,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/mvp-baseball-2005|title=MVP Baseball 2005|website=Metacritic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox/mvp-baseball-2005?recent-sort=userscore|title=MVP Baseball 2005|website=Metacritic}}</ref> though ''MVP 2005''\u2032s marks were slightly lower than those of its predecessor.

The agreement, which ran from Spring 2006 to 2012, allowed only Take-Two Interactive and the [[video game console|console]] manufacturers [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]], [[Microsoft Game Studios|Microsoft]], and [[Nintendo]] to produce MLB titles for their respective platforms, but bared other [[third-party developer|third party developers]] such as EA Sports from continuing or developing their own MLB games.\n\n''MVP Baseball 2005'' was the last official MLB release from EA Sports, also [[End-of-life (product)|official support for the game ended]].

How the Best Baseball Video Game Ever Has Refused to Retire for 10 Years|first=Ben|last=Lindbergh|date=14 April 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Players===\nUntil 2005, the game featured all players in the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA), as well as fictionalized counterparts for players who are not in the union.  [[Barry Bonds]], while an MLBPA member, did not sign the common MLBPA licensing agreement and was replaced by the fictional Jon Dowd. Some players who are not members of the MLBPA were omitted completely. For example, [[Kevin Millar]], who is not a member of the MLBPA, was omitted completely from the 2004 edition, with [[David Ortiz]] leaving his real-life [[Designated hitter]] spot and filling at [[First baseman|first base]] for the [[Boston Red Sox]]. In ''MVP Baseball 2005'', he was replaced by the fictional Anthony Friese.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mvpbaseball04cover.jpg|thumb|MVP Baseball 2004 for the [[Personal computer|PC]]]] -->''MVP Baseball 2004'' featured a unique addition to any baseball game, allowing users to play as the [[Minor league baseball|Minor League]] affiliations of [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] teams, a feature that was expanded in the following year. Various editions of the game have featured [[Randy Johnson]], [[Miguel Tejada]], [[Albert Pujols]], and [[Manny Ram\u00edrez]] on its cover. Of those four, Tejada and Pujols have won [[Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) awards during their careers, and the other two have been named MVPs of the World series. [[Randy Johnson]] has also won the [[Cy Young Award]] five times.\n\n===Innovations===\nUpon its release in 2003, one of the game's most inventive aspects was its [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]]/throw meter. Until then, most baseball games' pitching schemes required players simply to press the button corresponding to the pitch they wanted to throw, and hold the button down for a certain length of time to determine how hard the pitch was thrown. In ''MVP Baseball'', the player first holds down the pitch button (or throw button) to judge the power; once the desired power level is attained, the player must release the button and attempt to tap the same button within a target area. The closer the player gets to the target area, the more accurate the pitch or throw will be. While innovative within the field of baseball games, EA in fact adapted this feature from [[golf]] games, which often feature a moving meter to determine the power and accuracy of shots (golf games largely abandoned shot meters around the time that ''MVP Baseball'' introduced it).\n\nThe game also incorporated a strike zone divided into nine areas of the plate designed as \"hot and cold zones\". The feature uses color-coding with the colors red, white, and blue to represent the player's ability to hit pitches in the given area; red, white, and blue indicate whether the player hits well, neutrally, or poorly, respectively, in the given segment of the strike zone.\n\n===Soundtracks===\nLike all recent EA Sports games, the soundtrack to each ''MVP Baseball'' title contains licensed songs, called [[EA Trax]]. The ''MVP Baseball'' series typically featured [[alternative rock]], ranging from mainstream artists like [[Sum 41]] to [[indie rock|indie]] acts like [[stellastarr*]]. The games featured several minor hits before they became popular such as \"C'mon C'mon\" by [[The Von Bondies]] which is also used as the theme song for the TV show ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]''.\n\n2003 Soundtrack:\n*[[The All-American Rejects]] \u2013 [[Swing, Swing]]\n*[[Boy Sets Fire]] \u2013 Handful of Redemption\n*[[The Donnas]] \u2013 Who Invited You\n*[[The Exies]] \u2013 Without\n*[[Hed PE]] \u2013 Blackout\n*[[Revis]] \u2013 Caught in the Rain\n*[[Burning Brides]] \u2013 Arctic Snow\n*[[OK Go]] \u2013 [[Don't Ask Me (OK Go song)|Don't Ask Me]]\n*[[Pacifier (band)|Pacifier]] \u2013 Bulletproof\n*[[Shinedown]] \u2013 [[Fly From the Inside]]\n*[[socialburn]] \u2013 Everyone\n*[[Soundtrack of Our Lives]] \u2013 Sister Surround\n*[[Sum 41]] \u2013 All Messed Up\n*[[Taproot (band)|Taproot]] \u2013 [[Poem (song)|Poem]]\n\n2004 Soundtrack:\n*[[Chronic Future]] \u2013 Time and Time Again\n*[[Hoodoo Gurus]] \u2013 [[Bittersweet (Hoodoo Gurus song)|Bittersweet]]\n*[[Lucky Boys Confusion]] \u2013 Hey Driver\n*[[Maxeen]] \u2013 Please\n*[[Seven Wiser]] \u2013 Take Me As I Am\n*[[Snow Patrol]] \u2013 [[Spitting Games]]\n*[[stellastar*|stellastarr]] \u2013 My Coco\n*[[Steriogram]] \u2013 [[Walkie Talkie Man]]\n*[[To My Surprise]] \u2013 Get It to Go\n*[[Trust Company (band)|Trust Company]] \u2013 Surfacing\n*[[The Von Bondies]] \u2013 [[C'mon C'mon (The Von Bondies song)|C'mon C'mon]]\n*Jonny Lives! \u2013 Get Steady\n*[[Home Town Hero]] \u2013 Robbers\n\n2005 Soundtrack:\n*[[...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead]] (Called \"...Trail of Dead\" in the game) \u2013 Let It Dive\n*[[The Bravery]] \u2013 [[An Honest Mistake]]\n*[[Donots]] \u2013 We Got the Noise\n*[[Dropkick Murphys]] \u2013 [[Tessie]]\n*[[The High Speed Scene]] \u2013 The IROC-Z Song\n*[[Hot Hot Heat]] \u2013 You Owe Me an IOU\n*[[Louis XIV (band)|Louis XIV]] \u2013 Finding Out True Love Is Blind\n*[[Rock n Roll Soldiers]] \u2013 Funny Little Feeling\n*[[The Zutons]] \u2013 [[Pressure Point (song)|Pressure Point]]\n\n2006 Soundtrack:\n*[[Action Action]]: Paper Cliche\n*[[Aiden]]: Die Romantic\n*[[Bayside (band)|Bayside]]: Devotion And Desire\n*[[Hawthorne Heights]]: This Is Who We Are\n*[[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]]: Smile In Your Sleep\n*[[The Forecast]]: These Lights\n*[[The Audition (band)|The Audition]]: Approach The Bench\n*[[The Black Maria]]: Organs\n*[[The Junior Varsity]]: Get Comfortable\n*[[Waterdown]]: Repeater\n\n==See also==\n*''[[MVP Baseball 2005]]''\n*''[[MVP 06: NCAA Baseball]]''\n*''[[MVP 07: NCAA Baseball]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Electronic Arts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mvp Baseball}}\n[[Category:Major League Baseball video games]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:EA Sports games]]\n[[Category:Electronic Arts franchises]]\n[[Category:NCAA video games|*]]\n", "name_user": "Morriswa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExclusive licensing deal:Corrected spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVP_Baseball_series"}

Defence Commission]] was created in 1972 as per the 1972 Constitution, originally the commission's mandate was to supervise national defence matters within North Korea.\n\nPer the 4th plenary session of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] in June 2016 the National Defence Commission was officially replaced by the ''State Affairs Commission'', with an expanded focus towards other national concerns aside from defence and security.\n\nToday, the state affairs commission serves to fund all branches of the military.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Powers and responsibilities==\nArticle 106 of the [[Constitution of North Korea]] defines the State Affairs Commission as the highest leadership body.{{sfn|Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|2016|loc=Article 106}} Article 109 of the Constitution states that the SAC's powers are to:{{sfn|Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|2016|loc=Article 109}}\n*deliberate and decide on major policies of the State including defence;\n*exercise supervision over the fulfillment of the orders of the [[Chairman of the State Affairs Commission]] of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the decisions and directives of the Commission, and take measures for their fulfillment;\n*abrogate decisions and directives of State organs which run counter to the orders of the Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the decisions and directives of the Commission.\n\nIn practice, SAC supervises the [[Cabinet of North Korea]]. It also directly supervises the three ministries that are not under the Cabinet, namely the [[Ministry of People's Armed Forces]], [[Ministry of State Security (North Korea)|Ministry of State Security]] and the [[Ministry of People's Security]] as well as the [[Korean People's Army]], mainly the [[General Staff Department of the Korean People's Army]] and [[General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army]]. The [[Supreme Guard Command]] which is responsible for the top leadership and government protection is also under it's command. One additional entity, the [[State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission]], is also under the SAC as its Chairman is appointed by the Commission.<ref name=unikorea>{{Cite web|title=Organizational Chart of North Korean Leadership|location=Seoul|publisher=Political and Military Analysis Division, Intelligence and Analysis Bureau; Ministry of Unification |date=January 2018|accessdate=17 October 2018|url=https://www.unikorea.go.kr/cms/getFile.do?file=2018012913454378143.pdf&orgname=north_korean_Leadership.pdf&mgmtId=MGMT_0000000754&siteId=SITE_00003&filePath=eng_unikorea/common/file/&count=Y#.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\nThe following are the current members of the State Affairs Commission as of its election by the 14th Supreme People's Assembly on 11 April 2019:<ref name=1stSession14thSPA>{{Cite web |title=In full: promotions and demotions at North Korea\u2019s 14th SPA |publisher=Korea Risk Group |work=NK PRO |date=12 April 2019 |access-date=17 April 2019 |url= https://www.nknews.org/pro/in-full-promotions-and-demotions-at-north-koreas-14th-spa/ }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"6\" |[[Chairman of the State Affairs Commission]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Chairman\n! colspan=\"2\" |Political party\n!Member since\n!

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

In 1994, the castle, church and old town were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]].\n\nQuedlinburg has a population of more than 24,000. The town was the capital of the [[Quedlinburg (district)|district of Quedlinburg]] until 2007, when the district was dissolved. Several locations in the town are designated stops along a scenic holiday route, the [[Romanesque Road]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Quedlinburg asv2018-10 img41 Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Castle]]\n\nThe town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as ''Gross Orden'' on the eastern bank of the River [[Bode River|Bode]]. It was first mentioned as a town in 922 as part of a donation by King [[Henry the Fowler]] (''Heinrich der Vogler''). The records of this donation were held by the abbey of [[Corvey]].\n\nAccording to legend, Henry had been offered the German crown at Quedlinburg in 919 by Franconian nobles, giving rise to the town being called the \"cradle of the German Reich\".<ref name=\"Booklet\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nAfter Henry's death in 936, his widow [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Saint Matilda]] founded a religious community for women (''[[Frauenstift]]'') on the castle hill, where daughters of the higher nobility were educated. The main task of this collegiate foundation, [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], was to pray for the memory of King Henry and the rulers who came after him. The ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]'' were also compiled there. The first abbess was Matilda, a granddaughter of King Henry and St. Matilda.\n\nThe Quedlinburg castle complex, founded by King Henry I and built up by [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]] in 936, was an imperial ''[[Kaiserpfalz|Pfalz]]'' of the Saxon emperors. The ''Pfalz'', including the  male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of ''St. Wiperti'' is situated, while the women's convent was located on the castle hill.\n\nIn 973, shortly before the death of [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]], a ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Imperial Convention) was held at the imperial court in which [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]], duke of [[Polans (western)|Polans]], and [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslav]], duke of [[Bohemia]], as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as [[Byzantium]] and [[Bulgaria]], gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law [[Theophanu]], a Byzantine princess whose marriage to [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.\n\nIn 994, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.\n\nThe town became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the [[Bishopric of Halberstadt]]. In 1477, [[Hedwig, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Hedwig]], aided by her brothers [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]], broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishop's forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. Both town and abbey converted to [[Lutheranism]] in 1539 during the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 1697, Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]] of Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]] for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]'s claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the [[German Mediatisation]], and Quedlinburg passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg.<!--(? -- this might be Halberstadt as there is no evidence that Quedlinburg ever became a principality) --> Part of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807\u201313, it was included within the new Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without \"taking the veil\"; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for women's rights, [[Sophia Albertina, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Sofia Albertina]].\n\nDuring the [[Nazism|Nazi regime]], the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as [[Heinrich Himmler]] saw himself as the reincarnation of the \"most German of all German\" rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed from 1938 and during the war. The local [[crematory]] was kept busy burning the victims of the [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] concentration camp. [[Georg Ay]] was local party chief from 1931 until the end of the war. Liberation in 1945 brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was taken down from the tower.\n\nDuring the last months of World War II, the [[United States military]] had occupied Quedlinburg. In the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the [[theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg]] came to light.\n\nQuedlinburg was administered within [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic|Bezirk]] [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] while part of the Communist [[East Germany]] from 1949 to 1990. It became part of the state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] upon [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nDuring Quedlinburg's Communist era, restoration specialists from [[Poland]] were called in during the 1980s to carry out repairs on the old architecture. Today, Quedlinburg is a center of restoration of [[Timber framing#German tradition or Fachwerkh\u00e4user|''Fachwerk'']] houses.\n[[File:Quedlinburg asv2018-10 img27 Roland.jpg|thumb|[[Roland]]]]\n\nQuedlinburg is the setting for the 2016 [[Frantz (film)]],serving as a quintessential small German town in the wake of WWI, home to the family who is reeling from the death of a son in the war.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nThe town is located north of the [[Harz]] mountains, about 123 m above [[Normalh\u00f6hennull|NHN]].

In 1994, the castle, church and old town were added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]].\n\nQuedlinburg has a population of more than 24,000. The town was the capital of the [[Quedlinburg (district)|district of Quedlinburg]] until 2007, when the district was dissolved. Several locations in the town are designated stops along a scenic holiday route, the [[Romanesque Road]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Quedlinburg asv2018-10 img41 Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Castle]]\n\nThe town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as ''Gross Orden'' on the eastern bank of the River [[Bode River|Bode]]. It was first mentioned as a town in 922 as part of a donation by King [[Henry the Fowler]] (''Heinrich der Vogler''). The records of this donation were held by the abbey of [[Corvey]].\n\nAccording to legend, Henry had been offered the German crown at Quedlinburg in 919 by Franconian nobles, giving rise to the town being called the \"cradle of the German Reich\".<ref name=\"Booklet\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nAfter Henry's death in 936, his widow [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Saint Matilda]] founded a religious community for women (''[[Frauenstift]]'') on the castle hill, where daughters of the higher nobility were educated. The main task of this collegiate foundation, [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], was to pray for the memory of King Henry and the rulers who came after him. The ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]'' were also compiled there. The first abbess was Matilda, a granddaughter of King Henry and St. Matilda.\n\nThe Quedlinburg castle complex, founded by King Henry I and built up by [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]] in 936, was an imperial ''[[Kaiserpfalz|Pfalz]]'' of the Saxon emperors. The ''Pfalz'', including the  male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of ''St. Wiperti'' is situated, while the women's convent was located on the castle hill.\n\nIn 973, shortly before the death of [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]], a ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Imperial Convention) was held at the imperial court in which [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]], duke of [[Polans (western)|Polans]], and [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslav]], duke of [[Bohemia]], as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as [[Byzantium]] and [[Bulgaria]], gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law [[Theophanu]], a Byzantine princess whose marriage to [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.\n\nIn 994, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.\n\nThe town became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the [[Bishopric of Halberstadt]]. In 1477, [[Hedwig, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Hedwig]], aided by her brothers [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]], broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishop's forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. Both town and abbey converted to [[Lutheranism]] in 1539 during the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 1697, Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]] of Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]] for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]'s claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the [[German Mediatisation]], and Quedlinburg passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg.<!--(? -- this might be Halberstadt as there is no evidence that Quedlinburg ever became a principality) --> Part of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807\u201313, it was included within the new Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without \"taking the veil\"; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for women's rights, [[Sophia Albertina, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Sofia Albertina]].\n\nDuring the [[Nazism|Nazi regime]], the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as [[Heinrich Himmler]] saw himself as the reincarnation of the \"most German of all German\" rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed from 1938 and during the war. The local [[crematory]] was kept busy burning the victims of the [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] concentration camp. [[Georg Ay]] was local party chief from 1931 until the end of the war. Liberation in 1945 brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was taken down from the tower.\n\nDuring the last months of World War II, the [[United States military]] had occupied Quedlinburg. In the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the [[theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg]] came to light.\n\nQuedlinburg was administered within [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic|Bezirk]] [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] while part of the Communist [[East Germany]] from 1949 to 1990. It became part of the state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] upon [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nDuring Quedlinburg's Communist era, restoration specialists from [[Poland]] were called in during the 1980s to carry out repairs on the old architecture. Today, Quedlinburg is a center of restoration of [[Timber framing#German tradition or Fachwerkh\u00e4user|''Fachwerk'']] houses.\n[[File:Quedlinburg asv2018-10 img27 Roland.jpg|thumb|[[Roland]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nThe town is located north of the [[Harz]] mountains, about 123 m above [[Normalh\u00f6hennull|NHN]]. The nearest mountains reach 181 m above NHN. The largest part of the town is located in the western part of the [[Bode (river)|Bode]] river valley.

The church is a prime example of German [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. The treasure of the church, containing ancient Christian religious artifacts and books, was stolen by an American soldier but brought back to Quedlinburg in 1993 and is again on display here.\n\nThe former ''Stiftskirche St. Wiperti'' was established in 936 when the ''Kanonikerstift St. Wigpertus'' (of male canons) was moved from the castle hill to make way for what became Quedlinburg Abbey. The church was built at the location of the first Ottonian Royal palace at Quedlinburg. Around 1020, a three-aisled crypt was added to the basilica. The crypt, which survived all later alterations to the church, is also a designated stop on the Romanesque Road today.<ref name=\"Booklet\">{{cite book|last=Antz (ed.)|first=Christian|title=Strasse der Romanik (German)|publisher=Verlag Janos Stekovics|year=2001|isbn=3-929330-89-X|page=}}</ref>{{rp|91}}\n\n<!-- Economy-->\n<!-- Sports-->\n<!-- Government-->\n<!-- == Education ==-->\n<!-- == Healthcare ==-->\n<!-- == Utilities ==-->\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Transport===\n\n====Air====\nThe  nearest airports to Quedlinburg are [[Hannover-Langenhagen Airport|Hannover]], {{convert|120|km|abbr=off}} northwest, and [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], {{convert|90|km|abbr=off}} southeast.
