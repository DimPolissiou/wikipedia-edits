Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R.

Gierek, a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] figure than his predecessor, was determined to make [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a [[Planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade was eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in [[GDP]] and an improvement in living conditions. \n\nGierek maintained close ties with the [[United States]], which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from [[creditors]] in the [[Western Bloc]]. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for [[export]]. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the [[debt]]. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on [[social housing]] and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational [[highway]] linking Warsaw with industrial [[Silesia]] was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million [[plattenbau]] flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by 22% between 1971 and 1975. Gierek also initiated the construction of [[Warszawa Centralna]], Europe's most modern railway station at the time.\n\n===Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)===\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A ration card for sugar, 1976]]\nAs expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]], [[June 1976 protests]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] surged. New factories and state enterprises required fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread [[shortages]]. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. \n\nIn 1976, the communist government introduced [[ration cards]] for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy. Confectionery, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee, rice, [[tobacco]] and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the county was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. [[Power outage]]s were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's [[nominal GDP]].        \n\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|right|230px|[[Edward Gierek]] (right) with President [[Jimmy Carter]] (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed]]\n\nAt the same time, the newly-founded [[Solidarity movement]] encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual lack of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production stopped due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. \n\nOn 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with [[corruption]]. A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%. The import of [[diesel fuel|diesel]] from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti-communist sentiment. A [[civil war]] was hanging by a thread.\n\nIn 1981, Poland notified [[Club de Paris]] (a group of Western-European central banks) about its [[insolvency]], which caught the attention of the entire world.<ref>http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/traitements/poland-27-04-1981/en</ref>\n\n==Introduction, restrictions, patrols==\n===Secret preparations and provocation===\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] was determined to suppress any opposition along with the [[Solidarity Movement]]]]\nAfter the short tenure of [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]], General and Minister of Defence [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] was chosen as the new First Secretary. Before assuming office, Jaruzelski ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for a nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii</ref> In November 1980, the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] planned to potentially facilitate around 12,900 members of the opposition in state prisons and places of internment. \n\nOn 5 December 1980, Kania spoke of the preparations relating to martial law at the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Pact Summit]] in [[Moscow]]. He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \"psychological-operational method\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong [[propaganda]] against the movement and deploying [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Services (SB)]] to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis\u0142aw Kania warned [[Brezhnev]] that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc.     \n\n[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief security advisor to US President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated that \"if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a [[riposte]] manner\". According to historian and publicist [[Paul Kengor]], the then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by [[Richard Pipes]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> \n\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A censored regional newspaper that reported about the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Militia]] abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services]] \n\nIn February 1981, the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Ministry of National Defence]] and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society. It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized [[Fighting Solidarity]] and its allies organize a [[general strike]] that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a [[National Council (Poland)|Regional National Council]] meeting in [[Bydgoszcz]] to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the [[Citizens' Militia]] (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a [[provocation (legal)|provocation]], was concealed by [[censors]]. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] met with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski]] and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period.\n\nIn July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at [[Borne Sulinowo]], where the [[Red Army]] stationed per [[Warsaw Pact]] agreement as in all other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, [[Viktor Kulikov]], requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover [[KGB]] agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective. His request, however, was immediately denied by the Polish government.<ref name=\"Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne\">{{cite book |surname=Benjamin Weiser |title=Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne |publisher=\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki |location=Warszawa |year=2005 |isbn = 83-7391-673-3}}</ref> \n\nOver 25,000 posters announcing martial law were secretly printed in the USSR, transported to Poland by airplane and hidden in the large building housing the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>[[Ryszard Terlecki]]: ''Miecz i tarcza komunizmu.

They were then placed in previously-prepared detention facilities. In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's Army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action. Around 1,750 tanks, 1,900 armoured combat vehicles, 500 militarized transport units, 9,000 cars and several [[helicopter]] [[squadron]]s were in service.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne.

Per Azalea, the SB secret services, paramilitary troops, the Militia, ZOMO and [[Border Protection Troops]] stormed 451 [[telephone exchange|telecommunications exchange facilities]] and cut telephone lines to allegedly prevent the spread of misinformation. However, the operation's true purpose was to prevent Solidarity from contacting its branches in other cities to mobilize protesters. Radio and television stations were also besieged.

In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed [[postal censorship]], all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.\n\nDuring the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed.

As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \"verification\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions.

Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration.

The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair.

Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R. Ford, First Secretary Edward Gierek of Poland, and Mrs. Stanislawa Gierek Waving from the Blue Room Balcony during a State Arrival Ceremony - NARA - 7462054.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Gierek in the [[White House]] with President [[Gerald Ford]], 1974]]\nWhen [[Edward Gierek]] succeeded [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka|Gomu\u0142ka]] as the head of state in 1970, he took decisive measures to boost economic growth and develop modern infrastructure. Gierek, a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] figure than his predecessor, was determined to make [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] the wealthiest and most economically significant communist country of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, these ideas prompted resistance from hardline communist leadership as the reform would effectively abandon the fundamental principles of a [[Planned economy|centrally planned]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] economy. The grip and emphasis on state-owned enterprises and state-controlled prices or trade was eventually loosened. Small private businesses began to appear and Poland recorded temporary growth in [[GDP]] and an improvement in living conditions. \n\nGierek maintained close ties with the [[United States]], which he subsequently used for diplomatic and economic purposes. In order to continue with the reforms, large sums of money were borrowed from [[creditors]] in the [[Western Bloc]]. These sequential and uninterrupted loans were primarily targeted at establishing heavy industry, mines or manufacturing facilities that would produce goods for [[export]]. The projected income from the exports would then be used to pay off the [[debt]]. Apart from financing the economic sector, the money was spent on [[social housing]] and on expanding road connections, for example the first fully operational [[highway]] linking Warsaw with industrial [[Silesia]] was opened for traffic in 1976. Furthermore, over 1.8 million [[plattenbau]] flats were constructed to house the growing population. Agricultural output rose by 22% between 1971 and 1975. Gierek also initiated the construction of [[Warszawa Centralna]], Europe's most modern railway station at the time.\n\n===Crisis; debt, rationing and shortages (1976-1981)===\n[[File:Kartka cukier 1kg 07-76.jpg|thumb|left|140px|A ration card for sugar, 1976]]\nAs expenditures increased and debts accumulated, the West would no longer grant Poland loans. Moreover, the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]], [[June 1976 protests]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] affected the fragile economy. Due to previous GDP growth, higher income and expanded industries, the demand for certain goods and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] surged. New factories and state enterprises required fuel, materials and a workforce to operate production lines. Soon, the country started exporting locally-produced stock designated for the Polish populace, thus resulting in widespread [[shortages]]. Because the remaining assets were directed at production, exports and debt repayment, the state also reduced imports to minimize expenses. \n\nIn 1976, the communist government introduced [[ration cards]] for sugar, meat, processed food and dairy. Confectionery, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee, rice, [[tobacco]] and other goods not produced in Poland were so heavily rationed that they were almost permanently unavailable. The living standards began to sharply decline; the supply of imported goods was kept to a low minimum and the county was forced to export everything it could, including coal necessary for basic heating and power plants. [[Power outage]]s were commonplace. By 1980, the debt accounted to over US$23 billion, then almost half of Poland's [[nominal GDP]].        \n\n[[File:Jimmy Carter and Edward Gierek First Secretary of Poland - NARA - 177308.tif|thumb|right|230px|[[Edward Gierek]] (right) with President [[Jimmy Carter]] (left) during his state visit to Warsaw, 1977. The loans and Solidarity were among the chief topics discussed]]\n\nAt the same time, the newly-founded [[Solidarity movement]] encouraged farmers to refrain from selling agricultural products (wheat, grain, fruit and others) to the state as a sign of protest. The actual lack of goods on the market and in stores was caused by the fact that production stopped due to the strikes organized by Solidarity. In 1980, the national income fell by 6% compared to previous year, and in 1981 by 12%. The number of exports declined by 4.2%. Mismanagement and wastefulness were abundant. \n\nOn 6 September 1980, Gierek was dismissed from his office, expelled from the Polish United Workers' Party (possibly under the pressure from the Soviet Union) and falsely charged with [[corruption]]. A year later, on 10 September 1981, the Soviet authorities informed the Polish government that in connection with the prevailing situation in Poland the USSR would cut oil supply to Poland by 64% and gas by 47%. The import of [[diesel fuel|diesel]] from the Soviet Union was terminated immediately. This action was intended to force the Polish communist authorities to suppress the demonstrations and dissolve Solidarity. The situation was already dire and gradually worsened, which only fueled anti-communist sentiment. A [[civil war]] was hanging by a thread.\n\nIn 1981, Poland notified [[Club de Paris]] (a group of Western-European central banks) about its [[insolvency]], which caught the attention of the entire world.<ref>http://www.clubdeparis.org/en/traitements/poland-27-04-1981/en</ref>\n\n==Introduction, restrictions, patrols==\n===Secret preparations and provocation===\n[[File:Wojciech Jaruzelski.jpg|thumb|left|150px|General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski]] was determined to suppress any opposition along with the [[Solidarity Movement]]]]\nAfter the short tenure of [[Stanis\u0142aw Kania]], General and Minister of Defence [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] was chosen as the new First Secretary. Before assuming office, Jaruzelski ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for a nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii</ref> In November 1980, the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] planned to potentially facilitate around 12,900 members of the opposition in state prisons and places of internment. \n\nOn 5 December 1980, Kania spoke of the preparations relating to martial law at the [[Warsaw Pact|Warsaw Pact Summit]] in [[Moscow]]. He presented his own view of how to weaken Solidarity and insisted that a \"psychological-operational method\" would be most appropriate to prevent violence. This method entailed strong [[propaganda]] against the movement and deploying [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|Secret Services (SB)]] to go undercover and infiltrate Solidarity headquarters in the hope of creating internal conflicts within the opposition. General Jaruzelski was not fully satisfied with the plan, and, in case of failure, already planned radical actions involving the army. Stanis\u0142aw Kania warned [[Brezhnev]] that an armed intervention from the Soviet side to aid Jaruzelski would be met \"with a violent reaction, or even with a national uprising\" that would shake the politics of the Eastern Bloc.     \n\n[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief security advisor to US President [[Jimmy Carter]], stated that \"if the Soviet Union would undertake an armed intervention in Poland, the US would strike back in a [[riposte]] manner\". According to historian and publicist [[Paul Kengor]], the then US President [[Ronald Reagan]] considered sending American troops to Poland to scare off the Soviets.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> This claim was not supported by Brzezinski nor by [[Richard Pipes]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> Kengor then elaborated that Reagan eventually abandoned the plan after he was convinced by his own advisors that the US army stationed across Europe is less capable and much weaker than the Soviet forces.<ref>https://wyborcza.pl/1,75399,3976852.html</ref> \n\n[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|right|240px|A censored regional newspaper that reported about the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Militia]] abused Solidarity members. The censorship was to prevent the slander of state services]] \n\nIn February 1981, the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Ministry of National Defence]] and Ministry of the Internal Affairs carried out a training scenario, the purpose of which was to explore how martial law will be introduced. The ministries agreed that martial law should be preceded by appropriate propaganda calling for its support, and the decision itself should be based on a pretext that it would bring peace and stability for the society. It was also highlighted that martial law must occur before the fully mobilized [[Fighting Solidarity]] and its allies organize a [[general strike]] that would paralyze the entire country. By March, the situation escalated after the [[Bydgoszcz events]], in which local Solidarity delegates invited for a [[National Council (Poland)|Regional National Council]] meeting in [[Bydgoszcz]] to discuss potential strikes were beaten and abused by the [[Citizens' Militia]] (MO). The event, which was to feature in newspapers as a [[provocation (legal)|provocation]], was concealed by [[censors]]. On 27 March, Solidarity organized a warning strike directed at the government, but, on 30 March, [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] met with [[Mieczys\u0142aw Rakowski]] and a compromise was achieved. The general strike was called off and the situation stabilized for a short period.\n\nIn July, the Soviets increased their military presence in the military base at [[Borne Sulinowo]], where the [[Red Army]] stationed per [[Warsaw Pact]] agreement as in all other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. Without notifying the Polish authorities, the Soviets unexpectedly sent over 600 tanks to Borne Sulinowo. A month later, commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact, [[Viktor Kulikov]], requested that Soviet military advisors are to be placed in the Polish General Staff and assigned to nearly all Polish regiments. It is suspected that Kulikov, acting on behalf of the Soviet Union, was tasked with sending undercover [[KGB]] agents to monitor the situation in Poland from the Polish military's perspective. His request, however, was immediately denied by the Polish government.<ref name=\"Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne\">{{cite book |surname=Benjamin Weiser |title=Ryszard Kukli\u0144ski. \u017bycie \u015bci\u015ble tajne |publisher=\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki |location=Warszawa |year=2005 |isbn = 83-7391-673-3}}</ref> \n\nOver 25,000 posters announcing martial law were secretly printed in the USSR, transported to Poland by airplane and hidden in the large building housing the Ministry of Internal Affairs.<ref>[[Ryszard Terlecki]]: ''Miecz i tarcza komunizmu.

They were then placed in previously-prepared detention facilities. In total, between 70,000 and 80,000 soldiers of the People's Army and 30,000 functionaries of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (including SB, ZOMO and the Militia) were deployed for action. Around 1,750 tanks, 1,900 armoured combat vehicles, 500 militarized transport units, 9,000 cars and several [[helicopter]] [[squadron]]s were in service.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne.

Per Azalea, the SB secret services, paramilitary troops, the Militia, ZOMO and [[Border Protection Troops]] stormed 451 [[telephone exchange|telecommunications exchange facilities]] and cut telephone lines to allegedly prevent the spread of misinformation. However, the operation's true purpose was to prevent Solidarity from contacting its branches in other cities to mobilize protesters. Radio and television stations were also besieged.

I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Able Archer 83]]\n* [[Fighting Solidarity]]\n* [[Pacification of Wujek]]\n* [[Polish 1970 protests]]\n* [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests]]\n* [[Romanian Revolution]], 1989\n* [[Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981]]\n* [[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Leopold Labedz, ''Poland Under Jaruzelski: A Comprehensive Sourcebook on Poland During and After Martial Law''\n* George Sanford, ''Military Rule in Poland: The Rebuilding of Communist Power, 1981\u20131983''\n{{Portal|Poland|History|Communism|War|1980s}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Martial law in Poland}}\n* [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB211/index.htm Solidarity and Martial Law in Poland: 25 Years Later], [[National Security Archive]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112170636/http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr80/fpoland1981.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981-1983]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080105033603/http://www.tenetour.com/history9.php Martial Law in Poland]\n* [http://www.videofact.com/english/stanwoj2.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKhITm9-5TU Video of Jaruzelski declaring martial law], [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]/[[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/zyziza/martial_law_in_poland Photo Gallery by zyziza at pbase.com]\n\n{{History of the People's Republic of Poland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martial Law In Poland}}\n[[Category:1980s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n[[Category:1981 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1981 in politics]]\n[[Category:1982 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1982 in politics]]\n[[Category:1983 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1983 in politics]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1982]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1983]]\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Martial law|Poland]]\n[[Category:Military coups in Poland]]\n[[Category:Military dictatorships|Poland]]\n[[Category:Poland\u2013Soviet Union relations]]\n[[Category:Solidarity (Polish trade union)]]\n", "name_user": "Oliszydlowski", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e13 December 1981; Operations Fir and Azalea", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland"}

His teacher has Leo take a picture of the object that he then sends to astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf. Wolf realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Unfortunately, Wolf dies in a car accident on his way to try to alert the authorities.\n\nOne year later, [[MSNBC]] journalist Jenny Lerner investigates the sudden resignation of [[Secretary of the Treasury]] Alan Rittenhouse and his connection to \"Ellie\", supposedly a mistress. After interviewing Rittenhouse, she is taken by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to see President Tom Beck. After this, she finds out that Ellie is really an acronym: \"E.L.E.\" ([[extinction event|\"extinction-level event\"]]). Due to Lerner's investigation, President Beck makes an announcement earlier than planned: the comet, that has been named Wolf-Biederman, is headed for Earth and it is {{convert|7|mi}} long, large enough to cause a mass extinction, and possibly wipe out humanity. He also reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing an [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion spacecraft]] called the ''Messiah'' in orbit that will transport a team, led by Mission Commander Oren Monash and including veteran astronaut Captain Spurgeon \"Fish\" Tanner, to the comet, hoping to alter its path with nuclear weapons.\n\nAfter landing on the comet, the crew rigs nuclear bombs beneath the surface, but are caught in outgassing explosions when sunlight heats up the comet. Monash is permanently blinded by unfiltered sunlight and suffers severe facial burns, while Dr. Gus Partenza is flung into space by an outflow of gas. When the bombs detonate, the ship is damaged by the blast and the team loses contact with Earth. President Beck announces that the bombs only split the comet into two smaller pieces, nicknamed \"Biederman\" ({{convert|1.5|mi}} long) and \"Wolf\" ({{convert|6|mi}} long), both still heading for Earth.\n\nBeck then imposes [[martial law]] and reveals that governments worldwide have been building underground shelters. The United States' shelter is in the [[Geography of Missouri#Caves|limestone caves of Missouri]]. A lottery selects 800,000 Americans under age 50 to join 200,000 selected individuals, as well as a massive supply of food, populations of significant animals, and the seeds of plant species. Lerner and the Biederman family are chosen, but Leo's girlfriend Sarah Hotchner and her family are not. Leo marries Sarah to try to save her family but fails. Sarah refuses to leave without her parents.\n\nA last-ditch effort to deflect the comets with [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] fails. Biederman will strike the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off [[Cape Hatteras]], generating [[megatsunami]]s of 3,500&nbsp;ft (1,100 m) high. Wolf will hit western Canada, creating a huge cloud of dust and molten particles that will block out the Sun for two years, killing all life on the surface in only a matter of weeks. Leo returns home looking for Sarah, but her family has left for the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and are stuck in a massive traffic jam. Leo catches up to them on a motorcycle. Sarah's parents tell Leo to take Sarah and her baby brother to higher ground.\n\nMeanwhile, Lerner gives up her seat in the last evacuation helicopter to her friend Beth and Beth's young daughter. She joins her estranged father Jason at their family beach house, where they reconcile. Biederman hits the water, creating a megatsunami that destroys the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Lerner, Jason, and Sarah's parents are among the thousands that are killed by the tsunami. Leo, Sarah, and her baby brother are able to reach the higher grounds of the Appalachian Mountains safely.\n\nUnable to safely attempt a second landing, the crew of ''Messiah'' decide to obliterate Wolf by undertaking a suicide mission. After they say goodbye to their loved ones by video conference, they fly directly into a large deep crevasse created by out-gassing, and use their remaining nuclear warheads to blow Wolf into smaller pieces that burn up harmlessly in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAfter the waters recede, President Beck speaks to a large crowd at the US Capitol which is being rebuilt, encouraging them to remember and honor the heroes for their sacrifice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Captain Spurgeon \"Fish\" Tanner, a veteran astronaut who becomes the rendezvous pilot of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Jenny Lerner, an MSNBC Journalist.\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Leo Biederman, a teenage astronomer who discovers the Wolf-Biederman comet.\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Robin Lerner, the mother of Jenny.\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Jason Lerner, the estranged father of Jenny.\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Tom Beck, the President of the United States.\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Alan Rittenhouse, the Secretary of the Treasury who resigns in light of the Wolf-Biederman comet threat.\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as Commander Oren Monash, the Mission Commander for the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Dr. Gus Partenza, the medical officer of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Laura Innes]] as Beth Stanley, the co-worker of Jenny.\n* [[Bruce Weitz]] as Stuart Caley, Jenny's boss at MSNBC.\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Andrea \"Andy\" Baker, the pilot of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Don Biederman, the father of Leo.\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Ellen Biederman, the mother of Leo.\n* Katie Hagan as Jane Biederman, the younger sister of Leo.\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Sarah Hotchner, the girlfriend of Leo.\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Mark Simon, the navigator of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Eric Vennekor, the co-worker of Jenny.\n* [[Mark Moses]] as Tim Urbanski, another co-worker of Jenny\n* [[Aleksandr Baluev]] as Colonel Michail Tulchinsky, a nuclear specialist from Russia and crew member of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Mike Perry, Leo's teacher.\n* [[Rya Kihlstedt]] as Chloe, the fianc\u00e9 of Jason.\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Dr. Marcus Wolf, an astronomer that Leo contacts about the comet.\n* [[Francis X.

Spielberg planned to produce and direct ''The Hammer of God'' himself for his then-fledgling [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] studio, but opted to merge the two projects with Zanuck and Brown, and they commissioned a screenplay for what would become ''Deep Impact''.<ref name=\"starlog\"/> In 1995, the forthcoming film was announced in industry publications as \"Screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin, based on the film ''When Worlds Collide'' and ''The Hammer of God'' by Arthur C Clarke\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WwLsAAAAMAAJ |title=Deep Impact |work=The Film Journal |volume=98 |issue=1\u20136 |publisher=Pubsun Corporation |year=1995 |accessdate=July 14, 2017}}</ref> though ultimately, following a subsequent redraft by Michael Tolkin, neither source work would be credited in the final film.

His teacher has Leo take a picture of the object that he then sends to astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf. Wolf realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Unfortunately, Wolf dies in a car accident on his way to try to alert the authorities.\n\nOne year later, [[MSNBC]] journalist Jenny Lerner investigates the sudden resignation of [[Secretary of the Treasury]] Alan Rittenhouse and his connection to \"Ellie\", supposedly a mistress. After interviewing Rittenhouse, she is taken by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to see President Tom Beck. After this, she finds out that Ellie is really an acronym: \"E.L.E.\" ([[extinction event|\"extinction-level event\"]]). Due to Lerner's investigation, President Beck makes an announcement earlier than planned: the comet, that has been named Wolf-Biederman, is headed for Earth and it is {{convert|7|mi}} long, large enough to cause a mass extinction, and possibly wipe out humanity. He also reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing an [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Orion spacecraft]] called the ''Messiah'' in orbit that will transport a team, led by Mission Commander Oren Monash and including veteran astronaut Captain Spurgeon \"Fish\" Tanner, to the comet, hoping to alter its path with nuclear weapons.\n\nAfter landing on the comet, the crew rigs nuclear bombs beneath the surface, but are caught in outgassing explosions when sunlight heats up the comet. Monash is permanently blinded by unfiltered sunlight and suffers severe facial burns, while Dr. Gus Partenza is flung into space by an outflow of gas. When the bombs detonate, the ship is damaged by the blast and the team loses contact with Earth. President Beck announces that the bombs only split the comet into two smaller pieces, nicknamed \"Biederman\" ({{convert|1.5|mi}} long) and \"Wolf\" ({{convert|6|mi}} long), both still heading for Earth.\n\nBeck then imposes [[martial law]] and reveals that governments worldwide have been building underground shelters. The United States' shelter is in the [[Geography of Missouri#Caves|limestone caves of Missouri]]. A lottery selects 800,000 Americans under age 50 to join 200,000 selected individuals, as well as a massive supply of food, populations of significant animals, and the seeds of plant species. Lerner and the Biederman family are chosen, but Leo's girlfriend Sarah Hotchner and her family are not. Leo marries Sarah to try to save her family but fails. Sarah refuses to leave without her parents.\n\nA last-ditch effort to deflect the comets with [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] fails. Biederman will strike the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off [[Cape Hatteras]], generating [[megatsunami]]s of 3,500&nbsp;ft (1,100 m) high. Wolf will hit western Canada, creating a huge cloud of dust and molten particles that will block out the Sun for two years, killing all life on the surface in only a matter of weeks. Leo returns home looking for Sarah, but her family has left for the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and are stuck in a massive traffic jam. Leo catches up to them on a motorcycle. Sarah's parents tell Leo to take Sarah and her baby brother to higher ground.\n\nMeanwhile, Lerner gives up her seat in the last evacuation helicopter to her friend Beth and Beth's young daughter. She joins her estranged father Jason at their family beach house, where they reconcile. Biederman hits the water, creating a megatsunami that destroys the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Lerner, Jason, and Sarah's parents are among the thousands that are killed by the tsunami. Leo, Sarah, and her baby brother are able to reach the higher grounds of the Appalachian Mountains safely.\n\nUnable to safely attempt a second landing, the crew of ''Messiah'' decide to obliterate Wolf by undertaking a suicide mission. After they say goodbye to their loved ones by video conference, they fly directly into a large deep crevasse created by out-gassing, and use their remaining nuclear warheads to blow Wolf into smaller pieces that burn up harmlessly in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAfter the waters recede, President Beck speaks to a large crowd at the US Capitol which is being rebuilt, encouraging them to remember and honor the heroes for their sacrifice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as Captain Spurgeon \"Fish\" Tanner, a veteran astronaut who becomes the rendezvous pilot of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[T\u00e9a Leoni]] as Jenny Lerner, an MSNBC Journalist.\n* [[Elijah Wood]] as Leo Biederman, a teenage astronomer who discovers the Wolf-Biederman comet.\n* [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as Robin Lerner, the mother of Jenny.\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Jason Lerner, the estranged father of Jenny.\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as Tom Beck, the President of the United States.\n* [[James Cromwell]] as Alan Rittenhouse, the Secretary of the Treasury who resigns in light of the Wolf-Biederman comet threat.\n* [[Ron Eldard]] as Commander Oren Monash, the Mission Commander for the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Jon Favreau]] as Dr. Gus Partenza, the medical officer of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Laura Innes]] as Beth Stanley, the co-worker of Jenny.\n* [[Bruce Weitz]] as Stuart Caley, Jenny's boss at MSNBC.\n* [[Mary McCormack]] as Andrea \"Andy\" Baker, the pilot of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Richard Schiff]] as Don Biederman, the father of Leo.\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Ellen Biederman, the mother of Leo.\n* Katie Hagan as Jane Biederman, the younger sister of Leo.\n* [[Leelee Sobieski]] as Sarah Hotchner, the girlfriend of Leo.\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Mark Simon, the navigator of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Dougray Scott]] as Eric Vennekor, the co-worker of Jenny.\n* [[Mark Moses]] as Tim Urbanski, another fo-worker of Jenny\n* [[Aleksandr Baluev]] as Colonel Michail Tulchinsky, a nuclear specialist from Russia and crew member of the ''Messiah''.\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Mike Perry, Leo's teacher.\n* [[Rya Kihlstedt]] as Chloe, the fianc\u00e9 of Jason.\n* [[Charles Martin Smith]] as Dr. Marcus Wolf, an astronomer that Leo contacts about the comet.\n* [[Francis X.

In the level, the player controls Joseph Allen, an undercover [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent who participates in a [[mass shooting]] at a [[Moscow]] airport to gain the trust of a Russian [[terrorist]] group. The leader of the terrorists, Vladimir Makarov, tells his co-conspirators, \"Remember, no Russian\", implying that speaking Russian would reveal their ethnic origins and affiliation to the Russian [[ultranationalist]]s. At the end of the level, Makarov kills Allen and reveals that he intended for Russian officials to find Allen's body and believe that the attack was instigated by the United States.\n\nThe level itself is preceded by a warning that the level contains \"disturbing content which may offend some players\".

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Joseph joined the [[29th Connecticut Infantry Regiment (Colored)]] and William joined the [[14th Rhode Island Heavy Artillery (Colored)]]. Joseph was killed in Virginia in 1864, and was buried in Rockville just days before his regiment returned home. William became seriously ill with [[malaria]] and was granted a disability discharge in January 1865.<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" />\n\nPorter was his family's first child to attend high school, graduating in 1865.<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" /> Porter left Rockville in 1868 to study painting in [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts]], a town twenty miles north of Rockville. In 1869, after two years of art study at Wesleyan Academy (now known as the Wilbraham & Monson Academy), Porter enrolled at the prestigious [[National Academy of Design]] in October 1869, becoming the first African-American admitted to the school.<ref name=\"Conn History web page\" />\n\nPorter attended  the art school until the spring of 1873. While at the school, and for the first time, Porter began exhibiting his work. A painting titled ''Autumn Leaves'' was shown in the school's summer exhibition. In May 1870, Porter was among eight art students whose drawings, as part of a large school exhibition, were given special mention in the ''New York Times''.<ref name=\"Seattle Pacific University\" /> Porter received widespread praise and attention for his work during his four years at the [[National Academy of Design|National Academy]], earning the support of prominent benefactors such as [[Frederic Edwin Church]] and famous author [[Mark Twain]], who lived in [[Hartford]].<ref name=\"Seattle Pacific University\" /><ref name=\"African American Art and Artists Book\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Samella |title=African American Art and Artists |date=2003 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0520239357 |page=39}}</ref><ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" />\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Peonies in a bowl 1885.jpg|thumb|left|''Peonies in a Bowl, 1885,]] \nIn the fall of 1873, Porter studied art with [[Joseph Oriel Eaton]], a prominent portrait and landscape painter, for a year. Every year, he studied and painted in [[New York City]] from fall through spring but returned to Rockville in the summer to paint and teach art classes. From 1873 to 1875, Porter started to sell his work. One painting sold for $175, a high price for that time and for the artist's level of experience. Little else is known about Porter during this period. Art collectors were losing interest in American artists and traveling overseas, buying contemporary French art and [[Old Masters]]. Many young American artists, during the economic downturn, began studying overseas in the 1870s. Sales by American artists would not recover until the 1890s.<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" />\n\nIn 1878, Porter moved to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and established a studio. The city was experiencing tremendous growth, and its wealthy citizens were interested in art and culture and had the money to begin or add to art collections. Porter's traditional academic art education made him a standout compared to the many self-taught artists who had recently moved to Hartford. He was one of the few artists at the time, and the only man, to specialize in [[still life]] painting.<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" /><ref name=\"Conn History web page\" /> While in Hartford, Porter created many of the still life paintings that he is known for today. A number of his paintings of fruit were not typical of the period, as they did not include tableware, porcelain, and glassware and unusual touches such as insects. His apple paintings were a commercial success and he painted apples for much of his career.<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" />\n\nPorter spent a good deal of time outdoors. He was very interested in nature, which is reflected in his paintings of butterflies, dead birds, insects, and plants. In 1879, his work gained the attention of influential landscape painter [[Frederic Edwin Church]]. Church visited Porter, purchased a few paintings, and declared Porter to \"have no superior as a colorist in the United States.\" Church encouraged Porter to study and paint landscapes. In 1880, Porter visited the [[Adirondacks]] for two months of sketching and painting. He declared at the time that he would focus his work primarily on landscapes, except for commissioned [[still life]] paintings.<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" />\n[[File:Yellow roses in a vase Charles E Porter.jpg|thumb|left|''Yellow Roses in a Vase, 1890]]\n\nOn March 19, 1881, the ''Hartford Daily Courant'' reported that Porter was planning to move to Europe for two years to study art. The article stated that Porter would be selling at auction his entire inventory of paintings. Half of the paintings sold immediately for a total of $1062; additional sales resulted in a total of $1800. In early November 1881, Porter sailed for Liverpool. After an art tour of London, he traveled to Paris, with letters of introduction from Hartford's most prominent citizens, including [[Samuel Clemens]], the author known as [[Mark Twain]].<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" />\n[[File:Apples on the ground by Charles Porter.jpg|thumb|''Apples on the ground'', 1878]]\nIn Paris he studied the works of the influential artists of the [[Barbizon school]] of painting. He enrolled in the [[Ecole des Arts Decoratifs]], where he studied until 1884, when he ran out of money and returned to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. In December 1884, he hosted an art exhibition and auction of 100 paintings from his time in France. His new work was praised by the ''Hartford Evening Post'', but the auction did not get the attendance or make the sales that Porter had hoped for.<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" />\n\nIn early 1885, Porter returned to [[New York City]] and opened a studio. He exhibited his work at the [[National Academy of Design]] and continued to paint. He spent the summer of 1885 in [[Rockville, Connecticut]], teaching art and painting landscapes. By November 1886, Porter was back in Hartford again. He partnered with local artist Daniel Wentworth to hold auctions in 1887 and 1888, Wentworth contributing landscapes and Porter contributing primarily still lifes. The paintings sold for prices ranging from $6 to $100.<ref name=\"Charles Ethan Porter book\" /><ref name=\"African American Art and Artists Book\" />\n\nBy 1889, Porter had left Hartford for the last time. He spent most of the year in [[New York City]] and summers in [[Rockville, Connecticut]] until 1897, when he settled permanently in Rockville. The quality of Porter's work declined after 1900 and interest in his work subsided.

During the World Cup, Halfpenny impressed in many positions, particularly at fullback. It was also in this game that Halfpenny became first choice kicker, ahead of fly-halves [[Rhys Priestland]] and [[James Hook (rugby union)|James Hook]]. In the semi-final against France, Halfpenny attempted a 47-yard penalty that would have taken Wales to the final. However, the kick fell just short.\n\n===2012\u2013present===\nDuring the 2012 Six Nations, Halfpenny cemented his place at fullback and became one of the standout players of the tournament, finishing as top point scorer of the tournament. Some of his points came at crucial points within the tournament. Down 21\u201320 to Ireland in the 80th minutes, Halfpenny sent a penalty over to give Wales a 23\u201321 win over the hosts, and subsequently completed another four penalties and a conversion as Wales toppled England. Then, in the final match against France, Wales got a 16\u20139 win, with Halfpenny converting three further penalties and a conversion.\n\nIn the final match of the [[2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2012 Winter Test series]] against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], Halfpenny suffered a neck injury while attempting to stop the winning try.

During the World Cup, Halfpenny impressed in many positions, particularly at fullback. It was also in this game that Halfpenny became first choice kicker, ahead of fly-halves [[Rhys Priestland]] and [[James Hook (rugby union)|James Hook]]. In the semi-final against France, Halfpenny attempted a 47-yard penalty that would have taken Wales to the final. However, the kick fell just short.\n\n===2012\u2013present===\nDuring the 2012 Six Nations, Halfpenny cemented his place at fullback and became one of the standout players of the tournament, finishing as top point scorer of the tournament. Some of his points came at crucial points within the tournament. Down 21\u201320 to Ireland in the 80th minutes, Halfpenny sent a penalty over to give Wales a 23\u201321 win over the hosts, and subsequently completed another four penalties and a conversion as Wales toppled England. Then, in the final match against France, Wales got a 16\u20139 win, with Halfpenny converting three further penalties and a conversion.\n\nIn the final match of the [[2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals|2012 Winter Test series]] against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], Halfpenny suffered a neck injury while attempting to stop the winning try.

L]] 90-618 and subsequent amendments established a detailed Federal program governing the distribution of firearms. The GCA prohibited firearms ownership by certain broad categories of individuals thought to pose a threat to public safety: convicted felons, convicted misdemeanor domestic violence or stalking offenders, persons with an outstanding felony warrant, fugitives from justice, unlawful aliens, persons with court-mandated protective orders issued against them, persons who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, adjudicated mentally ill by a court, and others.\n\nPersons disqualified from firearms ownership for mental health reasons can apply to have this disability removed.  States that do not maintain an application process to allow persons disqualified for mental health reasons to obtain relief from firearms prohibition face Justice Assistance Grant penalties.  Section 105 of the [http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/PUBLAW/HTML/PUBLAW/0-0-0-38245.html NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007] (NIAA), cited as Pub. L. 110\u2013180, \u00a7 105, provides for restoration of firearm ownership rights in mental health cases.  Under NIAA it is up to each U.S. state to come up with its own application process; thus the procedure to regain one's rights vary from state-to-state.\n\n===The Brady Act===\nOn November 30, 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, Pub. L. 103\u2013159, amending the 1968 Gun Control Act. This \"Brady Bill\" required the [[United States Attorney General]] to establish an electronic or phone-based [[background check]] to prevent firearms sales to persons already prohibited from owning firearms.  This check, entitled the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS), went into effect as required on November 30, 1998.\n\n===Interim provisions===\nThe Act also immediately put in place certain interim provisions until that system became operative. Under the interim provisions, a firearms dealer who proposes to transfer a handgun must receive from the transferee a statement (the Brady Form), containing the name, address and date{{Clarify|reason=Date of birth?|date=November 2014}} of the proposed transfer along with a sworn statement that the transferee is not among any of the classes of prohibited purchasers, verify the identity of the transferee by examining an identification document, and provide the \"chief law enforcement officer\" (CLEO) of the transferee's residence with notice of the contents (and a copy) of the Brady Form.\n\nWhen a CLEO receives the required notice of a proposed transfer, they must \"make a reasonable effort to ascertain within 5 business days whether receipt or possession would be in violation of the law, including research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems are available and in a national system designated by the Attorney General.\"\n\n===The plaintiffs===\nPetitioners Sheriffs Jay Printz and [[Richard Mack]], the Chief Law Enforcement Officers for [[Ravalli County, Montana]], and [[Graham County, Arizona]], represented by [[Stephen Halbrook]] and [[David T.

The Court explained\n:We have thus far discussed the effect that federal control of state officers would have upon the first element of the \"double security\" alluded to by Madison: the division of power between State and Federal Governments. It would also have an effect upon the second element: the separation and equilibration of powers between the three branches of the Federal Government itself. The Constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by Congress; the President, it says, \"shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" Art.

II, \u00a72. The Brady Act effectively transfers this responsibility to thousands of CLEOs in the 50 States, who are left to implement the program without meaningful Presidential control (if indeed meaningful Presidential control is possible without the power to appoint and remove). The insistence of the Framers upon unity in the Federal Executive&mdash;to insure both vigor and accountability&mdash;is well known. See ''The [[Federalist No. 70]]'' (A. Hamilton); 2 ''Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution'' 495 (M.

United States''''', 521 U.S. 898 (1997), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that certain interim provisions of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] violated the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].\n\n==Background==\n===The Gun Control Act of 1968===\nThe [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA), [[Act of Congress|Pub. L]] 90-618 and subsequent amendments established a detailed Federal program governing the distribution of firearms. The GCA prohibited firearms ownership by certain broad categories of individuals thought to pose a threat to public safety: convicted felons, convicted misdemeanor domestic violence or stalking offenders, persons with an outstanding felony warrant, fugitives from justice, unlawful aliens, persons with court-mandated protective orders issued against them, persons who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility, adjudicated mentally ill by a court, and others.\n\nPersons disqualified from firearms ownership for mental health reasons can apply to have this disability removed.  States that do not maintain an application process to allow persons disqualified for mental health reasons to obtain relief from firearms prohibition face Justice Assistance Grant penalties.  Section 105 of the [http://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/PUBLAW/HTML/PUBLAW/0-0-0-38245.html NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007] (NIAA), cited as Pub. L. 110-180, \u00a7 105, provides for restoration of firearm ownership rights in mental health cases.  Under NIAA it is up to each U.S. state to come up with its own application process; thus the procedure to regain one's rights vary from state-to-state.\n\n===The Brady Act===\nOn November 30, 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]], Pub. L. 103-159, amending the 1968 Gun Control Act. This \"Brady Bill\" required the [[United States Attorney General]] to establish an electronic or phone-based [[background check]] to prevent firearms sales to persons already prohibited from owning firearms.  This check, entitled the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS), went into effect as required on November 30, 1998.\n\n===Interim provisions===\nThe Act also immediately put in place certain interim provisions until that system became operative. Under the interim provisions, a firearms dealer who proposes to transfer a handgun must receive from the transferee a statement (the Brady Form), containing the name, address and date{{Clarify|reason=Date of birth?|date=November 2014}} of the proposed transfer along with a sworn statement that the transferee is not among any of the classes of prohibited purchasers, verify the identity of the transferee by examining an identification document, and provide the \"chief law enforcement officer\" (CLEO) of the transferee's residence with notice of the contents (and a copy) of the Brady Form.\n\nWhen a CLEO receives the required notice of a proposed transfer, they must \"make a reasonable effort to ascertain within 5 business days whether receipt or possession would be in violation of the law, including research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems are available and in a national system designated by the Attorney General.\"\n\n===The plaintiffs===\nPetitioners Sheriffs Jay Printz and [[Richard Mack]], the Chief Law Enforcement Officers for [[Ravalli County, Montana]], and [[Graham County, Arizona]], represented by [[Stephen Halbrook]] and [[David T. Hardy]] respectively, filed separate actions challenging the constitutionality of the Brady Act's interim provisions. They objected to the use of congressional action to compel state officers to execute Federal law.\n\n===Lower court decisions===\nOn May 16, 1994, United States District Judge [[Charles C. Lovell]] granted the Sheriff [[declaratory judgment]], finding that the provision requiring CLEOs to perform background checks violated the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], but also concluding that provision was [[severability|severable]] from the remainder of the Act, effectively leaving a voluntary background check system in place.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9683318148026459805&hl=en&as_sdt=2006 ''Printz v.
