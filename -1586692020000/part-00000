It was discovered in 1995 by Darko Novakovi\u0107 and he states that in comparison with Maruli\u0107's known carmina minora the poems in the codex introduce three thematic novelties. Unexpectedly vehement, satirical epigrams are featured and the intensity of his satirical impulse is startling: even in such conventional poems as epitaphs. Three poems reveal his love of animals. The greatest revelation are the verses which show Maruli\u0107 as the author of love poems. This aspect represents the most serious challenge to our traditional picture of the Poet: the last epigram in the collection is a true Priapeum marked with lascivious ambiguity.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/9568|title=Dva nepoznata Maruli\u0107eva rukopisa u Velikoj Britaniji: MS.

His other works in Croatian are:\n\n* ''Suzana'' (Susan) \u2013 biblical poem in 780 stanzas, listing Croatian works at the end and theming Babylon Jewish woman falsely accused on adultery\n* ''Poklad i korizma'' (Carnival and Lent), ''Spovid koludric od sedam smrtnih grihov'' (Nun's confession of seven deadly sins), ''Anka satir'' (Anka the satire) \u2013 secular [[poetry]], poems dedicated to his sister ''Bira''\n* ''Tu\u017eenje grada Hjerosolima'' (Jerusalem's Lament) \u2013 anti-Turkish laments\n* ''Molitva suprotiva Turkom'' (Prayer against the Turks) \u2013 poem in 172 doubly rhymed [[dodecasyllable|dodecasyllablic]] stanzas of anti-Turkish theme, written between 1493 and 1500. Poem has a hidden [[acrostic]] ''Solus deus potes nos liberare de tribulatione inimicorum nostrorum Turcorum sua potentia infinita'', \"Only God with his infinite might can save us from the misery of our enemies Turks\", discovered by [[Luko Paljetak]]. The poem is assumed to exhibit influence of [[Juraj \u0160i\u017egori\u0107]]'s  ''Elegija o pusto\u0161enju \u0160ibenskog polja'' and medieval song ''Spasi, Marije, tvojih vjernih'' from [[Tkonski miscellany]].

It was discovered in 1995 by Darko Novakovi\u0107 and he states that in comparison with Maruli\u0107's known carmina minora the poems in the codex introduce three thematic novelties. Unexpectedly vehement, satirical epigrams are featured and the intensity of his satirical impulse is startling: even in such conventional poems as epitaphs. Three poems reveal his love of animals. The greatest revelation are the verses which show Maruli\u0107 as the author of love poems. This aspect represents the most serious challenge to our traditional picture of the Poet: the last epigram in the collection is a true Priapeum marked with lascivious ambiguity.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://hrcak.srce.hr/9568|title=Dva nepoznata Maruli\u0107eva rukopisa u Velikoj Britaniji: MS.

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family later settled in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the ''[[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist [[Diane Barwick]] met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family were to later settle in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported the Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the ''[[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist [[Diane Barwick]] met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

The manga has been serialized in [[Kodansha]]\u2019s ''[[good! Afternoon]]'' magazine since March 2010 and the chapters collected into 14 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. An [[anime]] television series adaptation animated by [[J.C.Staff]] aired in Japan from January to March 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nHonoka Takamiya is a seemingly ordinary high school student who is living a normal life. However, his main problem in life is him sitting with Ayaka Kagari, the beautiful idol and 'princess' of the school. Not only that, he even sits next to her in class and resumes the same class cleaning duties as she does. Even the tiniest interaction between them leads to Honoka getting beaten up by her fanclub.\n\nBut one day, however, while taking out the trash, a school building is mysteriously flung towards him. Luckily, a Witch swings to his rescue and wards off the attack. This Witch is revealed to be none other than Ayaka herself, who has been observing and protecting him ever since.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Honoka Takamiya|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae \u4ec4|Takamiya Honoka}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi (voice actor)|Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi]]}}\n:The main character, Honoka is a second year student in high school. At first he often wonders about the frequent coincidences that happen to him. One day, he is attacked by a group called the Tower Witches who had been covertly making attempts on him. However, the attack is thwarted by Ayaka who turns out to be a Workshop Witch and has been protecting Honoka for quite some time. No longer having to hide her mission, Ayaka decides to become friendlier with him, much to the chagrin of a majority of his classmates. He has a high regard for her and a feeling that there is some sort of special connection between them as well as history, but can't remember anything past vague feelings.\n:Shortly after Ayaka reveals her secrets, Honoka asks to be taken as her apprentice so he can help support her. One of the main reasons Honoka has been targeted is due to a mysterious, eldritch entity inside him called {{nihongo|'''Evermillion'''|\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30df\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|extra=voiced by [[Mamiko Noto]]}}, also known as the {{nihongo|White Princess|\u767d\u59eb|Shirohime}}. Occasionally, this being can manifest into a physical form and can also give Honoka enormous amounts of magical power, though Ayaka forbids him from doing so (as Evermillion will demand some form of 'payment' from him.) Through some kind of spell, Ayaka is able to draw upon that power making her practically powerful, but any damage that Honoka takes gets transferred directly to her instead.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ayaka Kagari|\u706b\u3005\u91cc \u7dbe\u706b|Kagari Ayaka}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Asami Set\u014d]]}}\n:The school idol and the chairwoman's daughter, Ayaka is a beautiful, intelligent, and statuesque girl, standing over a head taller than Honoka. However she is extremely stoic and has a low social IQ, rarely changing her facial expression. She is Honoka's classmate, and the official \"Princess\" of the entire school, with authority over everybody in the school except for the chairwoman. Unknown to many she is a {{Nihongo|\"Fire Witch\"|\u708e\u306e\u9b54\u5973}} who is capable of manipulating and controlling fire. Through unrevealed circumstances there is a powerful spell between herself and Honoka, where she can't be killed, can literally ignore wounds such as being impaled by multiple blades, and receives an inexhaustible, enormous power as long as Honoka is nearby. However, powerful attacks like Medusa's petrification can still affect her if Honoka's belief in her falters, and any direct damage that Honoka receives is instantly transferred to her. Even without magic she is a formidable fighter physically, due to her mother's harsh training.\n:Her mission is to protect Honoka from the tower witches, but she extends this mission to anyone she perceives as harassing or bullying him. According to Ayaka, she is certain she and Honoka knew each other as children though her memories from that time are missing, most likely erased by someone.\n\n===Workshop Witches===\n;{{Nihongo|Kasumi Takamiya|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae \u971e|Takamiya Kasumi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ai Kayano]]}}\n:Honoka's little sister, who also happens to be a Workshop Witch, has a teddy bear familiar that can transform into a gigantic combat mech she named {{nihongo|\"Maka-ron\"|\u6469\u8a36\u30ed\u30f3}} or Macaroon (depending on the translator). She also has an extreme brother complex with Honoka, their mother recounting how she jumps into his bed or tries to take baths with him every two days despite them both being teenagers. As such, she's extremely jealous of Ayaka and often gets into fights with her, especially when she finds her and Honoka in very suggestive situations. At some point she became a Workshop Witch with the task of protecting her brother when Ayaka wasn't around. Since her master is Rinon she is a strong hand to hand fighter as well. For some reason she can only bring out her full magic by using bears given to her by Honoka as mediums, which is why Macaroon is occasionally seen running errands in the background.\n;{{Nihongo|Kazane Kagari|\u706b\u3005\u91cc \u304b\u3056\u306d|Kagari Kazane}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sayaka Ohara]]}}\n:Ayaka's mother, head of the Workshop Witches in the city, and the chairwoman of T\u014dgetsu High School who has been alive as far back as the [[Crusades]]. Kazane has earned multiple nicknames over her lifetime, including \"Dragon Tooth,\" \"Torturer,\" and most infamously, \"Bad End.\"\n:In sharp contrast to her daughter, Kazane is a short-tempered, violent, chain-smoking woman with little tolerance for issues. While somewhat intelligent, she tends to handle things with raw power rather than thinking them through resulting in wild misunderstandings and missing important details. As head of the local Workshop, Kazane possesses magic so powerful that ensures when anything gets destroyed by magic, any people nearby will survive un-harmed, though large enough magic damage to a large part of the city can drain her reserves.\n:Kazane has been acquainted with Honoka's family for years, having attended high school with Komachi Takamiya, Honoka and Kasumi's mother. During her high school years she was a violent delinquent, frequently being suspended. The first time she and Komachi met was after Kazane beat up her entire class for bullying Komachi. They became close friends afterwards, even getting into a romantic relationship. However, since they couldn't get married they decided to marry Honoka and Ayaka off to each other. While it is revealed that she not only knew, but had taken Honoka places while he was in elementary school, its still unclear on what happened or why his and Ayaka's memories were removed.\n;{{Nihongo|Ky\u014dichir\u014d Mikage| |Mikage Ky\u014dichir\u014d }}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kazuyuki Okitsu]]}}\n:A [[chemistry]] teacher at Honoka's high school who helps manage the memories of the non-witch population whenever parts of the city get destroyed by magic. He also recruits witches throughout the city for the Workshop. Mikage has his own plans for Honoka and his \"white stuff,\" but his true motives are unknown.\n;{{Nihongo|Touko Hio|\u6c37\u5c3e \u51cd\u5b50|Hio T\u014dko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kana Asumi]]}}\n:A Workshop Witch who specializes in ice-based magic that can increase in proportion to a perceived threat, even bringing a sweeping cold front over the entire city if she finds herself in mortal danger. Touko was a childhood friend of Ayaka, being asked by Kazane herself (along with Houzuki, Ayaka's fanclub leader) to watch over her as Ayaka had almost no social intelligence to speak of, and continues watching her into the present. Touko works part-time at several different jobs around the city to help support her family of 12 siblings, including maid cafe waitress to bartender, which conveniently allows her to provide important information to Ayaka when necessary. Until Ayaka took over the position she was the Student Council's Vice President, and is now the \"Vice-Vice President.\"\n;{{Nihongo|Rinon Otometachibana|\u4e59\u5973\u6a58 \u308a\u306e\u3093|Otometachibana Rinon}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Noriko Shitaya]]}}\n:A Workshop Witch and Kasumi's teacher in the Workshop hierarchy, who also runs a gang of delinquents that dress up in hamster-themed costumes. Nicknamed \"Bear Killer\" after allegedly choking a tiger (named \"Bear-eye\") to death with her bare hands. Publicly challenged Honoka for control of the school's Student Council until she was defeated. Honoka almost beat her himself, but refused to land the final blow when he had a chance so Ayaka and the Ivory Quintet finished her off. Unlike other witches, Rinon doesn't use visible magic at all, preferring to instead use it to enhance her immense physical strength. In the anime, it is implied that she underwent Kazane's harsh training alongside Ayaka.\n;{{Nihongo|Atori Kuramine|\u660f\u5cf0 \u3042\u3068\u308a|Kuramine Atori}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ikumi Hayama]]}}\n:A soft-spoken witch with cat-like ears who wields a large sword. Atori prefers to talk through a small, magical ventriloquist doll she keeps nearby at almost all times. Has a questionable understanding of first-aid.\n\n===Tower Witches===\n\n====Ivory Quintet====\n;{{Nihongo|Tanpopo Kuraishi|\u5009\u77f3 \u305f\u3093\u307d\u307d|Kuraishi Tanpopo}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Shiori Izawa]]}}\n:One of the Tower Witches who transferred to the same school where Honoka and Ayaka are studying. She is a {{nihongo|\"Shikigami User\"|\u5f0f\u795e\u4f7f\u3044|Shikigami Tsukai}} and her familiars are an army of paper rabbits which she can magically turn into mechanized soldier bunnies. She is the unofficial head of the \"Ivory Quintet\" (a.k.a. \"Furry-eared Gang\", or KMM-dan in Japanese), a group of witches who were given the task to transfer to T\u014dgetsu High School and capture Honoka Takamiya.\n:According to the author, Tanpopo's last name was originally written to be \"Crisis,\" but felt that would be too foreign in context, so instead she localized the name as Kuraishi. This became a running joke in the story, where Honoka constantly forgets how to pronounce her last name.\n;{{Nihongo|Kanna Utsugi|\u5b87\u6d25\u6728 \u74b0\u90a3|Utsugi Kanna}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Shiina Natsukawa]]}}\n:She is a member of Ivory Quintet, despite of her natural mad-looking face, she is actually has normal emotions. Her power is to summon and use demons by the book called {{nihongo|\"Black Vice\"|\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b9|Burakku Vaisu}} that she carries on her back, though this power is rarely shown.\n;{{Nihongo|Rin Kazari|\u98fe \u9234|Kazari Rin}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Momo Asakura]]}}\n:A soft-voiced member of Ivory Quintet, who wields a scythe. She has a power called {{nihongo|\"Bone Animator\"|\u9aa8\u4f7f\u3044\uff08\u30dc\u30fc\u30f3\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff09|Hone Tsukai (Bon Animeta)|lit. Bone User}}, which can only be used to revive dead skeletons of any size and use it as her weapons.\n;{{Nihongo|Kotetsu Katsura|\u6842 \u864e\u9244|Katsura Kotetsu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Natsumi Hioka]]}}\n:A member of the Ivory Quintet and T\u014dgetsu High School's [[Kendo]] club. Her given name is based on a same-named Japanese sword that she wields.\n;{{Nihongo|Mei Menowa|\u76ee\u91ce\u8f2a \u51a5|Menowa Mei}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yuko Iida]]}}\n:One of the Tower Witches that form the Ivory Quintet. She has the ability to pass through walls and create a defensive barrier. She wears a complete wolf pelt called \"Coast Fenrir,\" a sort of baby wolf formed from the feather of a fallen angel that functions as both extra appendage and semi-sentient weapon.\n\n====Others====\n;{{Nihongo|Chronoire Schwarz VI|\u30af\u30ed\u30ce\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30c4\u30fb\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9|Kuronow\u0101rushuvarutsu Shikkusu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Rie Kugimiya]]}}\n:A powerful Tower Witch who specializes in crafting potions and often walks around with a well-dressed [[crocodile]] familiar named Sebastian. Has her own plans for Honoka's \"white stuff.\" Chronoire is on relatively neutral terms with Kazane despite officially being her enemy; sometimes Kazane physically beats and tortures her for information, other times Kazane entrusts her as temporary chairman of the school while she's on other business. Chronoire also has earned the nickname \"Dead End\" for her ability to turn into a part-crocodile monster and literally eat other witches if she wants.\n;{{Nihongo|[[Medusa]]|\u30e1\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5|Medy\u016bsa}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Miyuki Sawashiro]]}}\n:A high-ranking Tower Witch who controls the KMM Gang and their associates in order to steal Honoka's \"white stuff\" for herself. Has the power to petrify her enemies into stone statues, but has been weakened after being trapped in a magic prison.\n;{{Nihongo|Weekend|\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9|W\u012bkuendo}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Aya Hirano]]}}\n:A Tower Witch whose main strength is meticulous planning and preparation as opposed to any overtly magic power. Though Weekend is not her real name, she uses it anyways for the notoriety it brings her. Weekend's specialty involves setting up explosives of both magic and non-magic varieties. Runs her own small faction to kidnap Honoka for his \"white stuff\" as well.\n;{{Nihongo|Komachi Takamiya|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae \u5c0f\u753a|Takamiya Komachi}}\n:Honoka and Kasumi's mother. Rather a cheerful and supportive mother, she was easily broken emotionally. She fell in love with Kazane during her school years, and promised to marry her (instead, they arrange marriage their future children). She works as an office lady. She also has an open arms, which was evident that she took the Ivory Quintet on her home.\n\n==Media==\n\n=== Manga ===\n''Witchcraft Works'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by Ry\u016b Mizunagi.

Ayaka uses the puppet to blow up a section of the wall and break out, but Ayaka remarks that neither of them have their magic power.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Takamiya-kun and the Weekend (Part 1)\n| AltTitle        = Takamiya-kun to W\u012bkuendo (Zen-pen)\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae\u541b\u3068\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u3000\uff08\u524d\u7de8\uff09}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|9}}\n| ShortSummary    = The Workshop Witches are in crisis mode as Ayaka and Honoka emerge to find themselves in a broken city. Without Kazane's powers, the Workshop Witches in the city are unable to use any magic and no outside help will arrive in time. To make matters worse, Weekend captures a group of Workshop Witches and straps magical bombs to them, demanding that they hand over Honoka in 30 minutes or she will detonate her hostages one by one. While Rinon and Atori try to defuse the situation, Ayaka takes Honoka down to the core of the city to renew the contract using Honoka's latent powers. At the very last second, Honoka completes the contract, allowing the Workshop Witches to rescue the hostages and capture Weekend. However, after being thrown in a magic-nullifying cell, Weekend reveals that she let herself be captured so she could destroy the Workshop from within, which she does with more hidden bombs. Honoka uses his new powers to revive the wounded witches, but Ayaka knocks him out before the strain kills him.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| Title           = Takamiya-kun and the Weekend (Part 2)\n| AltTitle        = Takamiya-kun to W\u012bkuendo (Ch\u016b-hen)\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae\u541b\u3068\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u3000\uff08\u4e2d\u7de8\uff09}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = As Ayaka lays Honoka to rest in what remains of his home, Honoka views several of Kazane's memories. Honoka then gets word from the science teacher Mikage that they are in an alternate reality created by the city due to the contract Honoka just made, and takes him down to a shelter where the residents of the city are stuck in suspended animation until they can be safely revived. Suddenly, one of Weekend's underlings attacks Honoka at the shelter. Meanwhile, Ayaka heads off to fight Weekend herself at a church. However, Weekend uses several bombs she planted around the church to drain Ayaka's power, then captures her using giant monster golems, revealing that she planted the bombs in the city months ago as part of her plan.\n\nBack at Honoka's house, Mikage ends up reviving Honoka while Atori is attending to him. Mikage then delivers a message that Weekend plans to destroy the shelter unless Honoka is delivered to her in 30 minutes. Honoka and Atori race to the scene of a large explosion to find a drained Ayaka, and Honoka gives her some more power to defeat Weekend before she can destroy the shelter. However, Weekend reveals that she already set off her bomb.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| Title           = Takamiya-kun and the Weekend (Part 3)\n| AltTitle        = Takamiya-kun to W\u012bkuendo (K\u014d-hen)\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae\u541b\u3068\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u3000\uff08\u5f8c\u7de8\uff09}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|23}}\n| ShortSummary    = As Tanpopo decides to carry Kasumi out from the wreckage, Weekend's bomb wipes out all the townspeople inside the shelter, including Mikage.

All of the people and buildings in the city are restored as if nothing happened, including Weekend, who stabs Honoka with a knife.\n\nWeekend decides to have Honoka healed and acknowledges her defeat, shortly before running into Chronoire. In the restored church, Honoka, Atori and Mikage work on a way to bring Ayaka back to life, using some of Honoka's blood and a kiss. Miraculously, Ayaka regains consciousness. Meanwhile, Chronoire is shown impaling Weekend and most of her underlings on sharp poles, when Kazane shows up. Kazane then demands Chronoire hand Weekend over for questioning, but Chronoire responds that Weekend is her \"dinner,\" and the two fight each other to settle the score.\n\nLater, an unconscious Honoka and Mikage visit Evermillion as she talks about the renewed contract that Honoka has formed with her, warning him about the consequences he will have to face if he tries a similar action in the future. As he wakes up, Ayaka greets him at the bedroom door. The two then walk to school when the reformed KMM Gang threatens them en route.

After collecting some Tower Witches who were defeated by Ayaka in the past, Kasumi and Tanpopo's new gang confront Ayaka in her room, only to be swiftly beaten by her strength alone. The next day, Kasumi watches an anime DVD with her friend Tanuma, but the more risque scenes from the show conflict with her ideas of what a romantic relationship with her brother would mean.\n\nSuddenly, Rinon appears and carries both Kasumi and Tanpopo to a site where a giant penguin is wreaking havoc on the town. Rinon tells Kasumi to fight the penguin with her own giant teddy bear, and soon Kasumi and Tanpopo find themselves in a tag-team match against the giant penguin and one of Weekend's followers, all using enlarged familiars. Finally, Kasumi ends the fight by growing her teddy bear so large its head reaches the stratosphere, then smashes the penguin. After finding that the giant penguin was somehow spawned from a penguin idol her brother carved, she hides the evidence in her teddy bear and heads home.\n}}\n|}\n\n==Reception==\nThe fourth volume of the manga series ranked #25 in the Oricon charts on November 2012 with a total of 27,389 copies sold in under a week.<ref name=\"WCW-4-oricon\">{{cite web |title= Japanese Comic Ranking, November 5\u201311 |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-11-14/japanese-comic-ranking-november-5-11 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2012-11-14 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}</ref> The fifth volume ranked #28 in the Oricon charts on May 2013 with a total of 31,678 copies sold in under a week.<ref name=\"WCW-5-oricon\">{{cite web |title= Japanese Comic Ranking, May 6\u201312 |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-15/japanese-comic-ranking-may-5-11 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}</ref> The sixth volume ranked #29 in the Oricon charts on November 2013 with a total of 27,573 copies sold in under a week.<ref name=\"WCW-6-oricon\">{{cite web |title= Japanese Comic Ranking, November 4\u201310 |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-11-13/japanese-comic-ranking-november-4-10 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2013-11-13 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.witch-cw-anime.jp|Official anime website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|manga|14867}}\n\n{{Afternoon}}\n{{J.C.Staff}}\n\n[[Category:2011 manga]]\n[[Category:J.C.Staff]]\n[[Category:Kodansha manga]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Anime series based on manga]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in television]]\n[[Category:Vertical (company) titles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Witchcraft Works\n| image           = Witchcraft Works manga vol 1.jpg\n| caption         = Cover of the first manga volume.Showing Main Character Takamiya Honoka and Kagari Ayaka\n| ja_kanji        = \u30a6\u30a3\u30c3\u30c1\u30af\u30e9\u30d5\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\n| ja_romaji       = Witchikurafuto W\u0101kusu\n| genre           = <!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

The manga has been serialized in [[Kodansha]]\u2019s ''[[good! Afternoon]]'' magazine since March 2010 and the chapters collected into 14 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. An [[anime]] television series adaptation animated by [[J.C.Staff]] aired in Japan from January to March 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nHonoka Takamiya is a seemingly ordinary high school student who is living a normal life. However, his main problem in life is him sitting with Ayaka Kagari, the beautiful idol and 'princess' of the school. Not only that, he even sits next to her in class and resumes the same class cleaning duties as she does. Even the tiniest interaction between them leads to Honoka getting beaten up by her fanclub.\n\nBut one day, however, while taking out the trash, a school building is mysteriously flung towards him. Luckily, a Witch swings to his rescue and wards off the attack. This Witch is revealed to be none other than Ayaka herself, who has been observing and protecting him ever since.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Honoka Takamiya|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae \u4ec4|Takamiya Honoka}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi (voice actor)|Y\u016bsuke Kobayashi]]}}\n:The main character, Honoka is a second year student in high school. At first he often wonders about the frequent coincidences that happen to him. One day, he is attacked by a group called the Tower Witches who had been covertly making attempts on him. However, the attack is thwarted by Ayaka who turns out to be a Workshop Witch and has been protecting Honoka for quite some time. No longer having to hide her mission, Ayaka decides to become friendlier with him, much to the chagrin of a majority of his classmates. He has a high regard for her and a feeling that there is some sort of special connection between them as well as history, but can't remember anything past vague feelings.\n:Shortly after Ayaka reveals her secrets, Honoka asks to be taken as her apprentice so he can help support her. One of the main reasons Honoka has been targeted is due to a mysterious, eldritch entity inside him called {{nihongo|'''Evermillion'''|\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30df\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|extra=voiced by [[Mamiko Noto]]}}, also known as the {{nihongo|White Princess|\u767d\u59eb|Shirohime}}. Occasionally, this being can manifest into a physical form and can also give Honoka enormous amounts of magical power, though Ayaka forbids him from doing so (as Evermillion will demand some form of 'payment' from him.) Through some kind of spell, Ayaka is able to draw upon that power making her practically powerful, but any damage that Honoka takes gets transferred directly to her instead.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Ayaka Kagari|\u706b\u3005\u91cc \u7dbe\u706b|Kagari Ayaka}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Asami Set\u014d]]}}\n:The school idol and the chairwoman's daughter, Ayaka is a beautiful, intelligent, and statuesque girl, standing over a head taller than Honoka. However she is extremely stoic and has a low social IQ, rarely changing her facial expression. She is Honoka's classmate, and the official \"Princess\" of the entire school, with authority over everybody in the school except for the chairwoman. Unknown to many she is a {{Nihongo|\"Fire Witch\"|\u708e\u306e\u9b54\u5973}} who is capable of manipulating and controlling fire. Through unrevealed circumstances there is a powerful spell between herself and Honoka, where she can't be killed, can literally ignore wounds such as being impaled by multiple blades, and receives an inexhaustible, enormous power as long as Honoka is nearby. However, powerful attacks like Medusa's petrification can still affect her if Honoka's belief in her falters, and any direct damage that Honoka receives is instantly transferred to her. Even without magic she is a formidable fighter physically, due to her mother's harsh training.\n:Her mission is to protect Honoka from the tower witches, but she extends this mission to anyone she perceives as harassing or bullying him. According to Ayaka, she is certain she and Honoka knew each other as children though her memories from that time are missing, most likely erased by someone.\n\n===Workshop Witches===\n;{{Nihongo|Kasumi Takamiya|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae \u971e|Takamiya Kasumi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ai Kayano]]}}\n:Honoka's little sister, who also happens to be a Workshop Witch, has a teddy bear familiar that can transform into a gigantic combat mech she named {{nihongo|\"Maka-ron\"|\u6469\u8a36\u30ed\u30f3}} or Macaroon (depending on the translator). She also has an extreme brother complex with Honoka, their mother recounting how she jumps into his bed or tries to take baths with him every two days despite them both being teenagers. As such, she's extremely jealous of Ayaka and often gets into fights with her, especially when she finds her and Honoka in very suggestive situations. At some point she became a Workshop Witch with the task of protecting her brother when Ayaka wasn't around. Since her master is Rinon she is a strong hand to hand fighter as well. For some reason she can only bring out her full magic by using bears given to her by Honoka as mediums, which is why Macaroon is occasionally seen running errands in the background.\n;{{Nihongo|Kazane Kagari|\u706b\u3005\u91cc \u304b\u3056\u306d|Kagari Kazane}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sayaka Ohara]]}}\n:Ayaka's mother, head of the Workshop Witches in the city, and the chairwoman of T\u014dgetsu High School who has been alive as far back as the [[Crusades]]. Kazane has earned multiple nicknames over her lifetime, including \"Dragon Tooth,\" \"Torturer,\" and most infamously, \"Bad End.\"\n:In sharp contrast to her daughter, Kazane is a short-tempered, violent, chain-smoking woman with little tolerance for issues. While somewhat intelligent, she tends to handle things with raw power rather than thinking them through resulting in wild misunderstandings and missing important details. As head of the local Workshop, Kazane possesses magic so powerful that ensures when anything gets destroyed by magic, any people nearby will survive un-harmed, though large enough magic damage to a large part of the city can drain her reserves.\n:Kazane has been acquainted with Honoka's family for years, having attended high school with Komachi Takamiya, Honoka and Kasumi's mother. During her high school years she was a violent delinquent, frequently being suspended. The first time she and Komachi met was after Kazane beat up her entire class for bullying Komachi. They became close friends afterwards, even getting into a romantic relationship. However, since they couldn't get married they decided to marry Honoka and Ayaka off to each other. While it is revealed that she not only knew, but had taken Honoka places while he was in elementary school, its still unclear on what happened or why his and Ayaka's memories were removed.\n;{{Nihongo|Ky\u014dichir\u014d Mikage| |Mikage Ky\u014dichir\u014d }}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kazuyuki Okitsu]]}}\n:A [[chemistry]] teacher at Honoka's high school who helps manage the memories of the non-witch population whenever parts of the city get destroyed by magic. He also recruits witches throughout the city for the Workshop. Mikage has his own plans for Honoka and his \"white stuff,\" but his true motives are unknown.\n;{{Nihongo|Touko Hio|\u6c37\u5c3e \u51cd\u5b50|Hio T\u014dko}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kana Asumi]]}}\n:A Workshop Witch who specializes in ice-based magic that can increase in proportion to a perceived threat, even bringing a sweeping cold front over the entire city if she finds herself in mortal danger. Touko was a childhood friend of Ayaka, being asked by Kazane herself (along with Houzuki, Ayaka's fanclub leader) to watch over her as Ayaka had almost no social intelligence to speak of, and continues watching her into the present. Touko works part-time at several different jobs around the city to help support her family of 12 siblings, including maid cafe waitress to bartender, which conveniently allows her to provide important information to Ayaka when necessary. Until Ayaka took over the position she was the Student Council's Vice President, and is now the \"Vice-Vice President.\"\n;{{Nihongo|Rinon Otometachibana|\u4e59\u5973\u6a58 \u308a\u306e\u3093|Otometachibana Rinon}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Noriko Shitaya]]}}\n:A Workshop Witch and Kasumi's teacher in the Workshop hierarchy, who also runs a gang of delinquents that dress up in hamster-themed costumes. Nicknamed \"Bear Killer\" after allegedly choking a tiger (named \"Bear-eye\") to death with her bare hands. Publicly challenged Honoka for control of the school's Student Council until she was defeated. Honoka almost beat her himself, but refused to land the final blow when he had a chance so Ayaka and the Ivory Quintet finished her off. Unlike other witches, Rinon doesn't use visible magic at all, preferring to instead use it to enhance her immense physical strength. In the anime, it is implied that she underwent Kazane's harsh training alongside Ayaka.\n;{{Nihongo|Atori Kuramine|\u660f\u5cf0 \u3042\u3068\u308a|Kuramine Atori}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Ikumi Hayama]]}}\n:A soft-spoken witch with cat-like ears who wields a large sword. Atori prefers to talk through a small, magical ventriloquist doll she keeps nearby at almost all times. Has a questionable understanding of first-aid.\n\n===Tower Witches===\n\n====Ivory Quintet====\n;{{Nihongo|Tanpopo Kuraishi|\u5009\u77f3 \u305f\u3093\u307d\u307d|Kuraishi Tanpopo}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Shiori Izawa]]}}\n:One of the Tower Witches who transferred to the same school where Honoka and Ayaka are studying. She is a {{nihongo|\"Shikigami User\"|\u5f0f\u795e\u4f7f\u3044|Shikigami Tsukai}} and her familiars are an army of paper rabbits which she can magically turn into mechanized soldier bunnies. She is the unofficial head of the \"Ivory Quintet\" (a.k.a. \"Furry-eared Gang\", or KMM-dan in Japanese), a group of witches who were given the task to transfer to T\u014dgetsu High School and capture Honoka Takamiya.\n:According to the author, Tanpopo's last name was originally written to be \"Crisis,\" but felt that would be too foreign in context, so instead she localized the name as Kuraishi. This became a running joke in the story, where Honoka constantly forgets how to pronounce her last name.\n;{{Nihongo|Kanna Utsugi|\u5b87\u6d25\u6728 \u74b0\u90a3|Utsugi Kanna}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Shiina Natsukawa]]}}\n:She is a member of Ivory Quintet, despite of her natural mad-looking face, she is actually has normal emotions. Her power is to summon and use demons by the book called {{nihongo|\"Black Vice\"|\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b9|Burakku Vaisu}} that she carries on her back, though this power is rarely shown.\n;{{Nihongo|Rin Kazari|\u98fe \u9234|Kazari Rin}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Momo Asakura]]}}\n:A soft-voiced member of Ivory Quintet, who wields a scythe. She has a power called {{nihongo|\"Bone Animator\"|\u9aa8\u4f7f\u3044\uff08\u30dc\u30fc\u30f3\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\uff09|Hone Tsukai (Bon Animeta)|lit. Bone User}}, which can only be used to revive dead skeletons of any size and use it as her weapons.\n;{{Nihongo|Kotetsu Katsura|\u6842 \u864e\u9244|Katsura Kotetsu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Natsumi Hioka]]}}\n:A member of the Ivory Quintet and T\u014dgetsu High School's [[Kendo]] club. Her given name is based on a same-named Japanese sword that she wields.\n;{{Nihongo|Mei Menowa|\u76ee\u91ce\u8f2a \u51a5|Menowa Mei}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yuko Iida]]}}\n:One of the Tower Witches that form the Ivory Quintet. She has the ability to pass through walls and create a defensive barrier. She wears a complete wolf pelt called \"Coast Fenrir,\" a sort of baby wolf formed from the feather of a fallen angel that functions as both extra appendage and semi-sentient weapon.\n\n====Others====\n;{{Nihongo|Chronoire Schwarz VI|\u30af\u30ed\u30ce\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30b7\u30e5\u30f4\u30a1\u30eb\u30c4\u30fb\u30b7\u30c3\u30af\u30b9|Kuronow\u0101rushuvarutsu Shikkusu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Rie Kugimiya]]}}\n:A powerful Tower Witch who specializes in crafting potions and often walks around with a well-dressed [[crocodile]] familiar named Sebastian. Has her own plans for Honoka's \"white stuff.\" Chronoire is on relatively neutral terms with Kazane despite officially being her enemy; sometimes Kazane physically beats and tortures her for information, other times Kazane entrusts her as temporary chairman of the school while she's on other business. Chronoire also has earned the nickname \"Dead End\" for her ability to turn into a part-crocodile monster and literally eat other witches if she wants.\n;{{Nihongo|[[Medusa]]|\u30e1\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30b5|Medy\u016bsa}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Miyuki Sawashiro]]}}\n:A high-ranking Tower Witch who controls the KMM Gang and their associates in order to steal Honoka's \"white stuff\" for herself. Has the power to petrify her enemies into stone statues, but has been weakened after being trapped in a magic prison.\n;{{Nihongo|Weekend|\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9|W\u012bkuendo}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Aya Hirano]]}}\n:A Tower Witch whose main strength is meticulous planning and preparation as opposed to any overtly magic power. Though Weekend is not her real name, she uses it anyways for the notoriety it brings her. Weekend's specialty involves setting up explosives of both magic and non-magic varieties. Runs her own small faction to kidnap Honoka for his \"white stuff\" as well.\n;{{Nihongo|Komachi Takamiya|\u591a\u83ef\u5bae \u5c0f\u753a|Takamiya Komachi}}\n:Honoka and Kasumi's mother. Rather a cheerful and supportive mother, she was easily broken emotionally. She fell in love with Kazane during her school years, and promised to marry her (instead, they arrange marriage their future children). She works as an office lady. She also has an open arms, which was evident that she took the Ivory Quintet on her home.\n\n==Media==\n\n=== Manga ===\n''Witchcraft Works'' began as a [[manga]] series written and illustrated by Ry\u016b Mizunagi.
