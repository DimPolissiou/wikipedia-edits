After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company's ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'' program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE's developmental territories [[Deep South Wrestling]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]], and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Charles DeMott II<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> was born on November 10, 1966,<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html|title=Bill DeMott|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221053236/http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html| archivedate= 21 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> He grew up in [[Paramus, New Jersey]], graduating from [[Paramus High School]] in 1983.<ref>Levine, Cecilia.

DeMott graduated from Paramus High School in 1983, and went on to become a pro wrestler, earning himself the title of world heavyweight champion, and more.\"</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (1988\u20131994)===\nDeMott was trained by [[Johnny Rodz]] in his [[New York City]] wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the [[American Wrestling Federation]] and started using the [[ring name|name]] Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF Heavyweight title from Steve Strong in [[Puerto Rico]], before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with [[Mr. Pogo]]. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nWhen DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] at a [[Monday Night Raw]] taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]] and [[Wrestling Challenge]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref> He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].  Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1995\u20132001)===\n\n====The Dungeon of Doom and The First Family (1995\u20132000)====\n{{Main|The First Family (professional wrestling)|l1=The First Family}}\nIn 1995, DeMott was signed to a [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) contract at the behest of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who had been impressed by him. He debuted in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of [[The Dungeon of Doom]] as \"The Laughing Man\" Hugh Morrus (a [[pun]] on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his ([[kayfabe]]) father, [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]], that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him \"the man from the Isle of Nowhere.\"\n\nUpon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to [[Bill Goldberg]] during the September 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''. As a part of the growing [[hardcore wrestling]] style in WCW, Morrus joined [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]]. Although the Family found success and received a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] following a victory over their rivals [[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]], the stable was suddenly disbanded.\n\nAt this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squashing]] a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when [[Vince Russo]] and [[Eric Bischoff]] took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.\n\n====The Misfits In Action (2000\u20132001)====\n{{Main|The Misfits In Action}}\nAfter getting on Russo's bad side (in [[kayfabe]]), Morrus was fired from his [[The New Blood|New Blood]] stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]) formed the comedic [[The Misfits In Action|Misfits In Action]] stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against [[The Filthy Animals]].\n\nThe group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]], the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lance Storm]], with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a [[turncoat]] [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] in a handicap match on October 29 at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]] to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at [[Mayhem (2000)|Mayhem]].\n\nAfter his feud with Storm, the next night on ''Nitro'', DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; [[Bill Goldberg]] grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said \"Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend.\"\n\nAt [[WCW Sin|Sin]] on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to [[Shane Douglas]]. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]], which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) bought out WCW.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001\u20132007)===\n\n====The Alliance (2001\u20132002)====\nWhen WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' by attacking [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. Aside from a [[pay-per-view]] match at [[WWF Invasion|Invasion]] on July 22 where he, [[Shawn Stasiak]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeated [[Big Show]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match on the August 27 episode of ''Raw'' which he lost to [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was [[kayfabe]] fired by [[Vince McMahon]]. While off television, Morrus performed at [[house show]]s and worked in company's developmental territory [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to defeat [[Lance Cade]] and [[Steve Bradley]] to win the [[HWA Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Champions]] on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later.\n\n====SmackDown! (2002\u20132004)====\nIn April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' alongside fellow WCW alumnus [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] and defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on ''Jakked'' and later ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' until late July 2002, when he was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', WWE's [[reality television]] show.\n\nWhen he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of ''Velocity'' under his real name. DeMott made his ''SmackDown!'' debut on December 5 as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], where he defeated Funaki in a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, [[Shannon Moore]], [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Crash Holly]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] weekly on ''SmackDown!''. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to ''Velocity'' beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that also saw him tell [[knock-knock joke]]s as part of the turn. As the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] failed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|get over]], he remained on ''Velocity'' while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of ''Velocity'', where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus [[Chris Kanyon]]. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the [[color commentator]] for ''Velocity'',<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31 31]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31}}</ref> beginning on the November 1 episode,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_5901.shtml|title=10/11 WWE Velocity review: Bill Demott debuts on color commentary}}</ref> and remained in that position until December 11, 2004.\n\n====Deep South Wrestling (2004\u20132007)====\nWhen ''[[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (Season 4)|Tough Enough 4]]'' wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''.

He is best known for his appearances with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) as '''Hugh Morrus''' and [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment]] (WWF/E) under his real name.<ref name=WWEbio/> DeMott also performed as '''Crash the Terminator''' in both [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) and [[Puroresu|Japan]].<ref name=WWEbio/> He was most recently the head trainer for WWE's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental system]] [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] until his resignation in 2015 following allegations of misconduct, which he denied.\n\nGenerally used as a [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobber to the stars]] in WCW, he attained championship success during the promotion's dying days in late 2000 and early 2001, holding the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] [[List of WWE United States Champions|twice]]. After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company's ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'' program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE's developmental territories [[Deep South Wrestling]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]], and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Charles DeMott II<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> was born on November 10, 1966,<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html|title=Bill DeMott|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221053236/http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html| archivedate= 21 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> He grew up in [[Paramus, New Jersey]], graduating from [[Paramus High School]] in 1983.<ref>Levine, Cecilia.

Accessed November 18, 2017. \"Oct. 10, 2015 was the day life both stopped and started for Paramus native Bill DeMott.... DeMott graduated from Paramus High School in 1983, and went on to become a pro wrestler, earning himself the title of world heavyweight champion, and more.\"</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (1988\u20131994)===\nDeMott was trained by [[Johnny Rodz]] in his [[New York City]] wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the [[American Wrestling Federation]] and started using the [[ring name|name]] Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF Heavyweight title from Steve Strong in [[Puerto Rico]], before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with [[Mr. Pogo]]. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nWhen DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] at a [[Monday Night Raw]] taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]] and [[Wrestling Challenge]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref> He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].  Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1995\u20132001)===\n\n====The Dungeon of Doom and The First Family (1995\u20132000)====\n{{Main|The First Family (professional wrestling)|l1=The First Family}}\nIn 1995, DeMott was signed to a [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) contract at the behest of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who had been impressed by him. He debuted in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of [[The Dungeon of Doom]] as \"The Laughing Man\" Hugh Morrus (a [[pun]] on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his ([[kayfabe]]) father, [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]], that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him \"the man from the Isle of Nowhere.\"\n\nUpon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to [[Bill Goldberg]] during the September 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''. As a part of the growing [[hardcore wrestling]] style in WCW, Morrus joined [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]]. Although the Family found success and received a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] following a victory over their rivals [[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]], the stable was suddenly disbanded.\n\nAt this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squashing]] a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when [[Vince Russo]] and [[Eric Bischoff]] took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.\n\n====The Misfits In Action (2000\u20132001)====\n{{Main|The Misfits In Action}}\nAfter getting on Russo's bad side (in [[kayfabe]]), Morrus was fired from his [[The New Blood|New Blood]] stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]) formed the comedic [[The Misfits In Action|Misfits In Action]] stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against [[The Filthy Animals]].\n\nThe group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]], the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lance Storm]], with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a [[turncoat]] [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] in a handicap match on October 29 at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]] to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at [[Mayhem (2000)|Mayhem]].\n\nAfter his feud with Storm, the next night on ''Nitro'', DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; [[Bill Goldberg]] grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said \"Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend.\"\n\nAt [[WCW Sin|Sin]] on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to [[Shane Douglas]]. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]], which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) bought out WCW.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001\u20132007)===\n\n====The Alliance (2001\u20132002)====\nWhen WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' by attacking [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. Aside from a [[pay-per-view]] match at [[WWF Invasion|Invasion]] on July 22 where he, [[Shawn Stasiak]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeated [[Big Show]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match on the August 27 episode of ''Raw'' which he lost to [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was [[kayfabe]] fired by [[Vince McMahon]]. While off television, Morrus performed at [[house show]]s and worked in company's developmental territory [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to defeat [[Lance Cade]] and [[Steve Bradley]] to win the [[HWA Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Champions]] on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later.\n\n====SmackDown! (2002\u20132004)====\nIn April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' alongside fellow WCW alumnus [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] and defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on ''Jakked'' and later ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' until late July 2002, when he was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', WWE's [[reality television]] show.\n\nWhen he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of ''Velocity'' under his real name. DeMott made his ''SmackDown!'' debut on December 5 as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], where he defeated Funaki in a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, [[Shannon Moore]], [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Crash Holly]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] weekly on ''SmackDown!''. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to ''Velocity'' beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that also saw him tell [[knock-knock joke]]s as part of the turn. As the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] failed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|get over]], he remained on ''Velocity'' while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of ''Velocity'', where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus [[Chris Kanyon]]. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the [[color commentator]] for ''Velocity'',<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31 31]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31}}</ref> beginning on the November 1 episode,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_5901.shtml|title=10/11 WWE Velocity review: Bill Demott debuts on color commentary}}</ref> and remained in that position until December 11, 2004.\n\n====Deep South Wrestling (2004\u20132007)====\nWhen ''[[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (Season 4)|Tough Enough 4]]'' wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''.

Nicholson described an incident where [[Drew Hankinson]] was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stink Face|stinkface]]s to [[Zack Ryder]] and [[Melissa Coates]] while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces.

However, while the ability to kill another player existed in many MUDs, it was usually frowned upon because of general strict adherences and heavy influences from [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. The term PvP originated in text based MUDs played on bulletin board systems like [[MajorMUD]] and Usurper. These games had open worlds where any player could attack any other player as long as they were not at a safe spot in town like the Bank. Player versus player was coined sometime in the late 1980s to refer to the combat between players that resulted in the loser being penalized in some way.\n\nThe first graphical MMORPG was ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'', which began development in 1989 and ran on [[America Online|AOL]] 1991\u20131997, and which included PvP. PvP was initially limited to magical attacks in the game. Later modifications expanded its use to limited areas so that players who wished to avoid it could do so. Much of the PvP activity was coordinated events by the game's guilds, which were the first such organized user groups in MMORPG's.\n\n{{Anchor|Pure PK}}''[[Genocide (online game)|Genocide]]'', an [[LPMud]] founded in 1992, was a pioneer in PvP conflict as the first \"pure PK\" MUD,<ref name=\"reese1\">{{cite web\n |last        = Reese\n |first       = George\n |url         = http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud_timeline.htm\n |title       = LPMud Timeline\n |date        = 1996-03-11\n |accessdate  = 2010-04-14\n |quote       = January 1992 \u00b6 _Genocide_ starts as the first MUD dedicated totally to inter-player conflict, which is a fancy way of saying that its theme is creatively player-killing.\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120226122409/http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud_timeline.htm\n |archivedate = 2012-02-26\n}}</ref> removing all non-PvP gameplay and discarding the [[Roleplaying game|RPG-style]] character development normally found in [[MUDs]] in favor of placing characters on an even footing, with only player skill providing an advantage.<ref name=\"ywwr\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Towers | first1 = J.

In ''Ultima Online'', the goal was to allow players to police themselves in a \"[[frontier justice]]\" way.  This system also exists in ''Tibia'', where death includes significant penalty, and killing someone inflicts considerable harm to their character. In ''Meridian 59'', the game tried to focus PvP by having different political factions for players to join. The later ''[[Eve Online]]'' (2003) refined ''Ultima Online'''s (original) approach of \"PvP anywhere but in town\" (where attacking another player is dangerous in and around towns due to interference from NPC \"guards\").  However, these games tended to be unfriendly to more casual players. With the popularity of ''[[EverQuest]]'' in 1999, primarily consisting of [[PvE]] elements (with the exception of limited PvP on one specific server), PvP became a negative for some newer/casual MMORPG players and developers looking to draw a larger crowd. In 2000, in response to complaints about malicious player-killers, ''Ultima Online'' controversially added an extra copy of the game world to each server in which open PvP was disabled.\n\nIn addition to this, not all PvP games feature a players' avatar experiencing death. An example of this type of PvP element can be found on MMOs such as ''[[Audition Online]]'' (2004) where while players are not directly killing each other's avatars as traditionally found in MMOs, they are still competing against each other during certain game modes in a Player versus Player setting.\n\nPvP has been included in other games such as ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in late 1999, ''[[Diablo II]]'' in 2000, ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]'' and ''[[RuneScape]]'' in 2001, ''[[Asheron's Call 2]]'' in 2002, ''[[Shadowbane]]'' in 2003, and ''[[Dragon Nest]]'' in 2011. While these games included PvP, they still contained large portions of prerequisite PvE, mostly to build characters.\n\n==Classifications==\n===Player killing===<!-- This section is linked from [[PK]] -->\n'''Player killing''', or '''PKing''', is unrestricted PvP resulting in a character's death. Some games offer '''open PvP''' (also sometimes called '''world PvP'''), where one player can attack another without warning anywhere in the game world.  A '''pure PK''' game is one where PvP conflict is the only gameplay offered.  '''Ganking''' (short for '''gang killing''') is a type of PKing in which the killer has a significant advantage over his victim, such as being part of a group, being a higher level, or attacking the victim while they are at low health.\n\nPvP can also create additional facets in the community. In ''[[Ultima Online]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'', a rift formed between those who enjoyed PKing, those who enjoyed hunting the PKs and those who simply did not want to fight at all.  The ''[[Ultima Online: Renaissance|Renaissance]]'' expansion later added a ''Trammel'' facet where PvP was not allowed, giving some out to the UO crowd that did not wish to engage in PvP at all.  ''Asheron's Call'' contained a server that was completely unrestricted in player interactions where massive \"PK\" and \"Anti (PK)\" dynasties formed.\n\nCharacter death in an online game usually comes with a penalty (though some games remove it from PvP combat), so habitual PKers can find themselves ostracized by the local community.  In some games a character will die many times and the player must often sacrifice some experience points (XP) or in-game currency to restore that character to life.  [[Permanent death]] (such that the player must create a new character) is relatively uncommon in online games, especially if PKing is permitted. An example of such a mode is Hardcore mode on the game ''[[Diablo II]]''.\n\nA rarer form of player killing involves inciting a monster or monsters to attack another player. The reason this is rare is because the monster is more likely to attack the one who is trying to do the killing. Often a player will have to lure the monster towards the other player and run away, so that the monster (if it is aggressive) will look for a new target, which may be the other player. This behavior is often found in otherwise purely 'PVE' games such as ''[[Realm of the Mad God]]''.\n\nIn some MMORPGs PvP comes with extra penalties such as the player killer will not be able to form/join a group (party), receive help from other players and may have an increased loss of experience on death. Usually a player's name who has initiated a PvP recently will be in a bright color. In ''[[Lineage II]]'' a player would turn purple if they initiated combat and anyone who killed someone who was not purple (had fought back) would turn red. Turning red had a much higher chance of one's gear dropping off for others to loot when they die. Arguably the most severe penalty came on ''Asheron's Call'' where a killed player incurred a 5% loss in all stats and abilities per death, stacking up to 40%. This, combined with probably being naked from item loss, was very difficult to come back from.\n\nSome MMORPGs{{Specify|date=July 2010}} set a certain level requirement to engage in PvP combat in order for [[Newbie|new players]] to enjoy, experience and explore the game before actually getting PK'ed by other players. Other MMORPGs, such as ''[[Anarchy Online]]'' and Everquest Original on the 'Zek' servers, only allow a player to PvP with another if they are within a certain level range of each other, to prevent \"ganking\" (see above).\n\n====Anti-player killing====\nAnti-PKing, also known as Player Killer Killing, PK Killing, or '''PKK''',<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle\n | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]]\n | publisher = New Riders\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-13-101816-7\n | pages = 518\n | quote = Vigilantism, defending the innocent from PKs ... The killing of PKers is known as PKKing\n}}</ref> is a form of in-game player justice. Often motivated by an overpopulation of in-game player killers, [[vigilante]] Anti-PKs hunt Player Killers and Player Griefers with vengeance.\n\n===Dueling===\nDueling is both voluntary and competitive. Dueling ladders and leagues set up by fans are common for most MMORPGs that have PvP. ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]'' was the first graphical MMORPG to debut a formal dueling system ingame (Ballista); other MMORPGs such as ''[[City of Heroes]]'', ''[[Anarchy Online]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'',  ''[[Guild Wars]]'',  ''[[Lineage 2]]'', ''[[Wurm Online]]'', and ''[[RuneScape]]'' feature PvP as competitive dueling in a group setting.\n\n===Flagging===\nThrough various means, \"flags\" can be turned on or off, allowing PvP combat with other people who have also turned on their flag. In Everquest, there is no way to turn the flag off once it has been turned on. In Star Wars Galaxies, the flag may be turned off by interacting with faction specific NPCs located throughout the game or by typing an ingame command (/pvp). In World of Warcraft, flagging is selectable or can be activated by attacking certain flagged players until a cool-off period ends, though this can be exploited by [[griefers]] via [[corpse camping]].  Some games have a [[bounty system]] where players that kill or heal other players open themselves up to being killed in return. This is sometimes called the \"revenge flag\". Use of this 'bounty' system is not standardized among MMORPGs, and there are debates raging about how to 'police' the system to avoid abuse.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nSometimes the PvP flag gets automatically 'ON' on any player who initiates a PK. Other players who attacks a player who has the PvP flag on will NOT get their PvP flag 'ON'.\n\n==RvR (realm versus realm) combat==\n{{Main|Realm versus Realm}}\nIn 2001, [[Mythic Entertainment]] introduced a new team-based form of PvP combat with the release of ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]''.<ref name=\"bartle1\">{{cite book\n | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle\n | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]]\n | publisher = New Riders\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-13-101816-7\n | pages = 407\n | quote = ''Group versus Group'' (GvG). Players are members of groups that are in conflict with other groups.  In a combat situation, this means PCs can fight any PCs who are members of enemy groups but not those who are members of their own (or a neutral) group.<sup>63</sup> [...] <sup>63</sup>This is often known as Realm versus Realm (RvR), as it was popularized under this name in ''Dark Age of Camelot''.\n}}</ref> In RvR, players of each realm team up to fight against players from the opposing realms in team-based combat.  This can include normal skirmishes between rival groups that is common in other PvP systems, but also consists of objective-based battles such as taking and holding keeps or capturing enemy relics.\n\nThis was a new concept to graphical MMORPGs, but was first introduced in the game that preceded ''DAoC'', ''Darkness Falls: The Crusade'', which has since been shut down in favor of building on ''DAoC''.  Other MMORPG games now also feature this type of gameplay.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle\n | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]]\n | publisher = New Riders\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-13-101816-7\n | pages = 411\n | quote = The term RvR comes from Dark Age of Camelot, but it's not the only virtual world to use this approach; indeed, it's not the only big, graphical world to do so.  ''Anarchy Online'' has characters divided into three groups, with people meeting in PvP areas for combat.  ''Lineage'' has clan-like groups called ''bloodpledges'', which can conquer castles from one another in (scheduled) sieges; success here has material results, in that owners of castles get tax income they can invest in preparing for the next siege.\n}}</ref>\n\n== PvP in tabletop roleplaying games ==\n\nTabletop roleplaying games have also often featured PvP action. These are usually considered a reasonable part of play so long as the fight is based on \"in-character\" reasons.  Games are often written so [[player characters]] will not be unbalanced, ensuring that the players are genuinely scared of the other players, even when they would normally kill most [[non-player character]]s easily.\n\nThis approach to PvP in tabletop games is not universal.  For example, in the highly satirical ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'', lethal PvP conflict is a core game element, considered normal and heavily encouraged by the rules and support materials.\n\n== Ethical issues ==\nPlayer-vs-player dynamics involve ethical issues with players. Because of ganking, some game developers view PvP with contempt.

PvP can be broadly used to describe any game, or aspect of a game, where players compete against each other. PvP is often controversial when used in role-playing games. In most cases, there are vast differences in abilities between experienced and [[novice]] players. PvP can even encourage experienced players to immediately attack and kill inexperienced players.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Ethics of Computer Games|last = Sicart|first = Michael|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780262261531|location = |pages = 179\u2013184}}</ref> PvP is sometimes called [[player killing]].\n\n==History==\nPvP combat in CRPGs has its roots in various [[MUD]]s like ''[[Gemstone IV|Gemstone II]]'' and ''[[Avalon (MUD)|Avalon: The Legend Lives.]]''. However, while the ability to kill another player existed in many MUDs, it was usually frowned upon because of general strict adherences and heavy influences from [[role-playing game]]s like ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. The term PvP originated in text based MUDs played on bulletin board systems like [[MajorMUD]] and Usurper. These games had open worlds where any player could attack any other player as long as they were not at a safe spot in town like the Bank. Player versus player was coined sometime in the late 1980s to refer to the combat between players that resulted in the loser being penalized in some way.\n\nThe first graphical MMORPG was ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'', which began development in 1989 and ran on [[America Online|AOL]] 1991-1997, and which included PvP. PvP was initially limited to magical attacks in the game. Later modifications expanded its use to limited areas so that players who wished to avoid it could do so. Much of the PvP activity was coordinated events by the game's guilds, which were the first such organized user groups in MMORPG's.\n\n{{Anchor|Pure PK}}''[[Genocide (online game)|Genocide]]'', an [[LPMud]] founded in 1992, was a pioneer in PvP conflict as the first \"pure PK\" MUD,<ref name=\"reese1\">{{cite web\n |last        = Reese\n |first       = George\n |url         = http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud_timeline.htm\n |title       = LPMud Timeline\n |date        = 1996-03-11\n |accessdate  = 2010-04-14\n |quote       = January 1992 \u00b6 _Genocide_ starts as the first MUD dedicated totally to inter-player conflict, which is a fancy way of saying that its theme is creatively player-killing.\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120226122409/http://www.rpgmud.com/lpmud_timeline.htm\n |archivedate = 2012-02-26\n}}</ref> removing all non-PvP gameplay and discarding the [[Roleplaying game|RPG-style]] character development normally found in [[MUDs]] in favor of placing characters on an even footing, with only player skill providing an advantage.<ref name=\"ywwr\">{{cite book\n | last1 = Towers | first1 = J.

In ''Ultima Online'', the goal was to allow players to police themselves in a \"[[frontier justice]]\" way.  This system also exists in ''Tibia'', where death includes significant penalty, and killing someone inflicts considerable harm to their character. In ''Meridian 59'', the game tried to focus PvP by having different political factions for players to join. The later ''[[Eve Online]]'' (2003) refined ''Ultima Online'''s (original) approach of \"PvP anywhere but in town\" (where attacking another player is dangerous in and around towns due to interference from NPC \"guards\").  However, these games tended to be unfriendly to more casual players. With the popularity of ''[[EverQuest]]'' in 1999, primarily consisting of [[PvE]] elements (with the exception of limited PvP on one specific server), PvP became a negative for some newer/casual MMORPG players and developers looking to draw a larger crowd. In 2000, in response to complaints about malicious player-killers, ''Ultima Online'' controversially added an extra copy of the game world to each server in which open PvP was disabled.\n\nIn addition to this, not all PvP games feature a players' avatar experiencing death. An example of this type of PvP element can be found on MMOs such as ''[[Audition Online]]'' (2004) where while players are not directly killing each other's avatars as traditionally found in MMOs, they are still competing against each other during certain game modes in a Player versus Player setting.\n\nPvP has been included in other games such as ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in late 1999, ''[[Diablo II]]'' in 2000, ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]'' and ''[[RuneScape]]'' in 2001, ''[[Asheron's Call 2]]'' in 2002, ''[[Shadowbane]]'' in 2003, and ''[[Dragon Nest]]'' in 2011. While these games included PvP, they still contained large portions of prerequisite PvE, mostly to build characters.\n\n==Classifications==\n===Player killing===<!-- This section is linked from [[PK]] -->\n'''Player killing''', or '''PKing''', is unrestricted PvP resulting in a character's death. Some games offer '''open PvP''' (also sometimes called '''world PvP'''), where one player can attack another without warning anywhere in the game world.  A '''pure PK''' game is one where PvP conflict is the only gameplay offered.  '''Ganking''' (short for '''gang killing''') is a type of PKing in which the killer has a significant advantage over his victim, such as being part of a group, being a higher level, or attacking the victim while they are at low health.\n\nPvP can also create additional facets in the community. In ''[[Ultima Online]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'', a rift formed between those who enjoyed PKing, those who enjoyed hunting the PKs and those who simply did not want to fight at all.  The ''[[Ultima Online: Renaissance|Renaissance]]'' expansion later added a ''Trammel'' facet where PvP was not allowed, giving some out to the UO crowd that did not wish to engage in PvP at all.  ''Asheron's Call'' contained a server that was completely unrestricted in player interactions where massive \"PK\" and \"Anti (PK)\" dynasties formed.\n\nCharacter death in an online game usually comes with a penalty (though some games remove it from PvP combat), so habitual PKers can find themselves ostracized by the local community.  In some games a character will die many times and the player must often sacrifice some experience points (XP) or in-game currency to restore that character to life.  [[Permanent death]] (such that the player must create a new character) is relatively uncommon in online games, especially if PKing is permitted. An example of such a mode is Hardcore mode on the game ''[[Diablo II]]''.\n\nA rarer form of player killing involves inciting a monster or monsters to attack another player. The reason this is rare is because the monster is more likely to attack the one who is trying to do the killing. Often a player will have to lure the monster towards the other player and run away, so that the monster (if it is aggressive) will look for a new target, which may be the other player. This behavior is often found in otherwise purely 'PVE' games such as ''[[Realm of the Mad God]]''.\n\nIn some MMORPGs PvP comes with extra penalties such as the player killer will not be able to form/join a group (party), receive help from other players and may have an increased loss of experience on death. Usually a player's name who has initiated a PvP recently will be in a bright color. In ''[[Lineage II]]'' a player would turn purple if they initiated combat and anyone who killed someone who was not purple (had fought back) would turn red. Turning red had a much higher chance of one's gear dropping off for others to loot when they die. Arguably the most severe penalty came on ''Asheron's Call'' where a killed player incurred a 5% loss in all stats and abilities per death, stacking up to 40%. This, combined with probably being naked from item loss, was very difficult to come back from.\n\nSome MMORPGs{{Specify|date=July 2010}} set a certain level requirement to engage in PvP combat in order for [[Newbie|new players]] to enjoy, experience and explore the game before actually getting PK'ed by other players. Other MMORPGs, such as ''[[Anarchy Online]]'' and Everquest Original on the 'Zek' servers, only allow a player to PvP with another if they are within a certain level range of each other, to prevent \"ganking\" (see above).\n\n====Anti-player killing====\nAnti-PKing, also known as Player Killer Killing, PK Killing, or '''PKK''',<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle\n | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]]\n | publisher = New Riders\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-13-101816-7\n | pages = 518\n | quote = Vigilantism, defending the innocent from PKs ... The killing of PKers is known as PKKing\n}}</ref> is a form of in-game player justice. Often motivated by an overpopulation of in-game player killers, [[vigilante]] Anti-PKs hunt Player Killers and Player Griefers with vengeance.\n\n===Dueling===\nDueling is both voluntary and competitive. Dueling ladders and leagues set up by fans are common for most MMORPGs that have PvP. ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]'' was the first graphical MMORPG to debut a formal dueling system ingame (Ballista); other MMORPGs such as ''[[City of Heroes]]'', ''[[Anarchy Online]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'',  ''[[Guild Wars]]'',  ''[[Lineage 2]]'', ''[[Wurm Online]]'', and ''[[RuneScape]]'' feature PvP as competitive dueling in a group setting.\n\n===Flagging===\nThrough various means, \"flags\" can be turned on or off, allowing PvP combat with other people who have also turned on their flag. In Everquest, there is no way to turn the flag off once it has been turned on. In Star Wars Galaxies, the flag may be turned off by interacting with faction specific NPCs located throughout the game or by typing an ingame command (/pvp). In World of Warcraft, flagging is selectable or can be activated by attacking certain flagged players until a cool-off period ends, though this can be exploited by [[griefers]] via [[corpse camping]].  Some games have a [[bounty system]] where players that kill or heal other players open themselves up to being killed in return. This is sometimes called the \"revenge flag\". Use of this 'bounty' system is not standardized among MMORPGs, and there are debates raging about how to 'police' the system to avoid abuse.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nSometimes the PvP flag gets automatically 'ON' on any player who initiates a PK. Other players who attacks a player who has the PvP flag on will NOT get their PvP flag 'ON'.\n\n==RvR (realm versus realm) combat==\n{{Main|Realm versus Realm}}\nIn 2001, [[Mythic Entertainment]] introduced a new team-based form of PvP combat with the release of ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]''.<ref name=\"bartle1\">{{cite book\n | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle\n | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]]\n | publisher = New Riders\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-13-101816-7\n | pages = 407\n | quote = ''Group versus Group'' (GvG). Players are members of groups that are in conflict with other groups.  In a combat situation, this means PCs can fight any PCs who are members of enemy groups but not those who are members of their own (or a neutral) group.<sup>63</sup> [...] <sup>63</sup>This is often known as Realm versus Realm (RvR), as it was popularized under this name in ''Dark Age of Camelot''.\n}}</ref> In RvR, players of each realm team up to fight against players from the opposing realms in team-based combat.  This can include normal skirmishes between rival groups that is common in other PvP systems, but also consists of objective-based battles such as taking and holding keeps or capturing enemy relics.\n\nThis was a new concept to graphical MMORPGs, but was first introduced in the game that preceded ''DAoC'', ''Darkness Falls: The Crusade'', which has since been shut down in favor of building on ''DAoC''.  Other MMORPG games now also feature this type of gameplay.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Bartle | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Bartle\n | title = [[Designing Virtual Worlds]]\n | publisher = New Riders\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-13-101816-7\n | pages = 411\n | quote = The term RvR comes from Dark Age of Camelot, but it's not the only virtual world to use this approach; indeed, it's not the only big, graphical world to do so.  ''Anarchy Online'' has characters divided into three groups, with people meeting in PvP areas for combat.  ''Lineage'' has clan-like groups called ''bloodpledges'', which can conquer castles from one another in (scheduled) sieges; success here has material results, in that owners of castles get tax income they can invest in preparing for the next siege.\n}}</ref>\n\n== PvP in tabletop roleplaying games ==\n\nTabletop roleplaying games have also often featured PvP action. These are usually considered a reasonable part of play so long as the fight is based on \"in-character\" reasons.  Games are often written so [[player characters]] will not be unbalanced, ensuring that the players are genuinely scared of the other players, even when they would normally kill most [[non-player character]]s easily.\n\nThis approach to PvP in tabletop games is not universal.  For example, in the highly satirical ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'', lethal PvP conflict is a core game element, considered normal and heavily encouraged by the rules and support materials.\n\n== Ethical issues ==\nPlayer-vs-player dynamics involve ethical issues with players. Because of ganking, some game developers view PvP with contempt. Despite the advantage experienced players have over new players, many game developers have assumed an honor code would prevent PKing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Player versus All]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{MUDs|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Player Versus Player}}\n[[Category:Competitive video game terminology]]\n[[Category:MUD terminology]]\n[[Category:Role-playing game terminology]]\n[[Category:Video game gameplay]]\n[[Category:Video game terminology]]\n[[Category:Video game culture]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: 1991-1997 \u2192 1991\u20131997", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player"}

They became big money wrestlers by the end of the decade.\n\n===NWA Championship Wrestling from Florida (1970\u20131982)===\n[[File:Terry Funk NWA Champion.jpg|thumb|Funk as [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] in 1976]]\nIn 1975, Terry defeated [[Jack Brisco]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in Miami, when Dory failed to appear for a title shot. He began a fourteen-month title reign defending the title against Jack Brisco, Dusty Rhodes, Carlos Rocha, Giant Baba and Pat O`Connor. In addition to North America, he defended the belt in Australia, Japan and Singapore. The historic reign ended in [[Toronto]] when he was defeated by \"Handsome\" [[Harley Race]], who had earlier beaten Dory, Jr., for NWA World Heavyweight Championship before losing it to Jack Brisco. Race lifted Funk for a shinbreaker and then trapped him in an Indian death leglock. When Funk failed to respond to referee [[Fred Atkins]] the match was stopped.\n\nDuring 1981, Terry spent some time in the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] feuding with [[Jerry Lawler]]. The most memorable match in this feud happened in April 1981 at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee. The match took place in the empty arena, with only [[Lance Russell]], a cameraman, and a photographer present. Funk had challenged Lawler to this match at this time because he felt he was getting unfairly treated in Memphis.  The confrontation only lasted a few minutes, and ended with Funk trying to put Lawler's eye out with a broken 2x4. But Lawler kicked Funk's elbow, causing him to hit himself in the eye. The tape aired on April 25, 1981.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2peOLg5gqKY</ref>\n\n===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1972\u20131991)===\nTerry and Dory, Jr. also made a name for themselves in [[Japan]]. Terry became a star in the eyes of the Japanese fans with his over the top mannerisms, sometimes colorful get-ups, and his brawling ability. In Japan, the Funks were heels until they faced The Sheik and Abdullah The Butcher in Tokyo. The two later faced Stan Hansen, Bruiser Brody, and Giant Baba in memorable feuds as well.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation (1985\u20131986) ===\nTerry Funk made his [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) debut in 1985 after a brief run in the AWA. In his televised debut on ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]'', he not only beat [[Aldo Ortiz|Aldo Marino]], but he also beat on ring announcer Mel Phillips. Funk attacked Phillips, after Phillips made the mistake of putting on Funk's cowboy hat. Funk also had a gimmick of carrying a [[Livestock branding|branding iron]] with him to ringside and using it to \"brand\" his fallen opponents. The attack on Phillips lead to a feud with Junkyard Dog. In the mid-1980s, Funk teamed with Dory (calling himself \"Hoss\" Funk) and [[Ferrin Barr Jr.|Jimmy Jack Funk]], a storyline \"brother.\" They were managed by [[Jimmy Hart]]. At the time, he had a heated rivalry with the [[Junkyard Dog]] which led to a match between Terry Funk and Hoss Funk and the team of [[Tito Santana]] and Junkyard Dog at [[WrestleMania 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania2.html|title=WrestleMania 2: Caged Heat|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM!

He began feuding with [[Ric Flair]], who had defeated [[Ricky Steamboat]] at [[WrestleWar (1989)|WrestleWar]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Funk, who was one of three judges for the main event, challenged Flair to a title match. Flair refused, saying that Funk was \"spending time in Hollywood\" instead of focusing on wrestling. Funk then attacked, [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriving]] Flair on a ringside table. This put the champion, Flair, out of action until the [[Great American Bash (1989)|Great American Bash]] where he faced Funk. Flair won the match by reversing a small package into one of his own, but shortly after was attacked by [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] and [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]]. [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] came to aid Flair and the two brawled with Funk and Muta to close the show. Funk got injured but returned to continue feuding with Ric Flair. The two then had an [[\"I Quit\" match]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions IX:]]'', which Funk lost after yelling \"Yes, I quit!\" after Flair put on the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|Figure four leglock]]. This match received a [[Dave Meltzer#Rating system|5-star rating]] from [[Dave Meltzer]]. A notable part of the feud occurred when Funk used an actual plastic shopping bag to suffocate Flair on television after Flair and Sting defeated Muta and [[Dick Slater]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions VIII]]''. After losing a ''Clash of Champions'' match against Flair, he shook Flair's hand, and was attacked by Gary Hart's stable. Soon after he became a color commentator and the host of his own segment ''Funk's Grill'' where a tuxedo clad Funk would amiably interview the top stars of WCW, both face and heel. This did not last long and he left soon after for the USWA.\n\nIn 1994, Funk reappeared in WCW and wrestled [[Tully Blanchard]] to a double disqualification at [[Slamboree 1994]] and later that night, he became a member of [[Robert Fuller (wrestler)|Colonel Robert Parker's]] [[Stud Stable]].<ref name=Stud>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/stud-stable.html|title=Stud Stable|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> Along with [[Bunkhouse Buck]], [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]], the stable would focus their energies on [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]], as well as [[The Nasty Boys]], culminating in a [[War Games match]] at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]].\n\n===IWA Japan and the King of the Death Match tournament (1994\u20131995)===\nIn 1994, Terry Funk would join the fledgling [[IWA Japan]] wrestling promotion. Funk would go on to be a participant in IWA's most famous event the King of the Death Match Tournament, held on August 20, 1995 in Kawasaki. Funk would first defeat Leatherface and Tiger Jeet Singh in extreme-style matches which featured barbed wire covered boards, glass, and chains before moving on to the finals of the tournament. In the finals, Funk was defeated by prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Cactus Jack, later known by US audiences as [[Mick Foley]], in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Exploding Barbed Wire Boards & Exploding Ring Time Bomb Death Match. Terry would also participate in several other deathmatches throughout 1995.\n\n===NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993\u20131997)===\nLater in Funk's career, his style changed from wrestling traditional southern style wrestling matches to the more violent style of [[hardcore wrestling]]. In 1993, after a special appearance against Blanchard at World Championship Wrestling's Slamboree, Funk promised to help the fledgling Eastern Championship Wrestling (later renamed [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] or ECW) by lending his talent and notoriety to the promotion. On July 16, Terry and Dory Funk lost a barbed wire match against [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]]. Funk maintained a regular schedule of wrestling for ECW in its early days while also competing in Japan. He had many feuds and wrestled programs with wrestlers such as [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], [[Shane Douglas|\"The Franchise\" Shane Douglas]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], and Terry's own protege, [[Tommy Dreamer]].\n\nFunk further elevated ECW by headlining their first pay-per-view, [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]] on April 13, 1997, winning the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. Earlier in the night, he defeated The Sandman and [[Stevie Richards]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], thus earning him the match with Raven. He was later defeated for the title by Sabu in a barbed wire match at ''Born to Be Wired'', in which the ropes of the ring were taken down and replaced with barbed wire. Both men had to be cut out of the wires at the end of the match. Sabu had his biceps visibly torn open by the barbed wire \u2013 as a result, the wound was taped up and the match continued. In September of that same year, a show was held in Funk's hometown of Amarillo. It was called \"WrestleFest \u2013 50 Years of Funk\" and was both his own show and a celebration of the careers of Terry, his father, and his brother. Terry lost to then [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bret Hart]] in the main event, a non-title match. However, before the match, ECW owner Paul Heyman presented Terry with a belt, paid for through a collection taken up by wrestlers on the ECW roster, that declared him the ''Lifetime ECW World Heavyweight Champion''.\n\n===Return to WWF (1997\u20131998)===\nFunk's retirement lasted just three months before he began taking bookings again. After several independent matches, most notable ones against Rik Ratchet that drew many fans on the east coast, Funk returned on the December 29, 1997 episode of ''Raw''. Funk returned to WWF as '''Chainsaw Charlie''', although his true identity was soon acknowledged by the announcers, teaming with [[Mick Foley]], who was wrestling under his Cactus Jack persona. Charlie and Jack would enter a feud with [[The New Age Outlaws]], where they were defeated by them on the January 26, 1998 episode of ''Raw'' by disqualification. The following week on ''Raw'', Charlie and Jack would have a match against each other, with the match ending in a no contest after the Outlaws would attack both men, placing them both in a dumpster and then pushing it off the stage. At [[No Way Out of Texas: In Your House]], Charlie and Jack would team with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Owen Hart]], defeating the team of [[Triple H]], [[Savio Vega]] and the Outlaws. At [[WrestleMania XIV]], Charlie and Jack would defeat the Outlaws in a [[professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Dumpster match]] to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/mar29_wrestlemania.html|title=Austin wins WWF World Title at WrestleMania|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM!

At ''Hardcore Homecoming'', Funk lost a three-way barbed wire match to Sabu.\n\n===Second return to WWE (2006, 2009, 2013, 2016)===\nFunk made a brief return to WWE in 2006, when he appeared on the May 15 episode of ''Raw'', confronting [[Mick Foley]] over the attack on [[Tommy Dreamer]] on the previous weeks episode of ''Raw''.

They became big money wrestlers by the end of the decade.\n\n===NWA Championship Wrestling from Florida (1970\u20131982)===\n[[File:Terry Funk NWA Champion.jpg|thumb|Funk as [[NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] in 1976]]\nIn 1975, Terry defeated [[Jack Brisco]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] in Miami, when Dory failed to appear for a title shot. He began a fourteen-month title reign defending the title against Jack Brisco, Dusty Rhodes, Carlos Rocha, Giant Baba and Pat O`Connor. In addition to North America, he defended the belt in Australia, Japan and Singapore. The historic reign ended in [[Toronto]] when he was defeated by \"Handsome\" [[Harley Race]], who had earlier beaten Dory, Jr., for NWA World Heavyweight Championship before losing it to Jack Brisco. Race lifted Funk for a shinbreaker and then trapped him in an Indian death leglock. When Funk failed to respond to referee [[Fred Atkins]] the match was stopped.\n\nDuring 1981, Terry spent some time in the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] feuding with [[Jerry Lawler]]. The most memorable match in this feud happened in April 1981 at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee. The match took place in the empty arena, with only [[Lance Russell]], a cameraman, and a photographer present. Funk had challenged Lawler to this match at this time because he felt he was getting unfairly treated in Memphis.  The confrontation only lasted a few minutes, and ended with Funk trying to put Lawler's eye out with a broken 2x4. But Lawler kicked Funk's elbow, causing him to hit himself in the eye. The tape aired on April 25, 1981.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2peOLg5gqKY</ref>\n\n===All Japan Pro Wrestling (1972\u20131991)===\nTerry and Dory, Jr. also made a name for themselves in [[Japan]]. Terry became a star in the eyes of the Japanese fans with his over the top mannerisms, sometimes colorful get-ups, and his brawling ability. In Japan, the Funks were heels until they faced The Sheik and Abdullah The Butcher in Tokyo. The two later faced Stan Hansen, Bruiser Brody, and Giant Baba in memorable feuds as well.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation (1985\u20131986) ===\nTerry Funk made his [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) debut in 1985 after a brief run in the AWA. In his televised debut on ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]'', he not only beat [[Aldo Ortiz|Aldo Marino]], but he also beat on ring announcer Mel Phillips. Funk attacked Phillips, after Phillips made the mistake of putting on Funk's cowboy hat. Funk also had a gimmick of carrying a [[Livestock branding|branding iron]] with him to ringside and using it to \"brand\" his fallen opponents. The attack on Phillips lead to a feud with Junkyard Dog. In the mid-1980s, Funk teamed with Dory (calling himself \"Hoss\" Funk) and [[Ferrin Barr Jr.|Jimmy Jack Funk]], a storyline \"brother.\" They were managed by [[Jimmy Hart]]. At the time, he had a heated rivalry with the [[Junkyard Dog]] which led to a match between Terry Funk and Hoss Funk and the team of [[Tito Santana]] and Junkyard Dog at [[WrestleMania 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania2.html|title=WrestleMania 2: Caged Heat|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref> Terry also had a series of WWF title matches against Hulk Hogan.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1989\u20131990, 1994)===\nFunk joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1989 and became part of the [[J-Tex Corporation]]. He began feuding with [[Ric Flair]], who had defeated [[Ricky Steamboat]] at [[WrestleWar (1989)|WrestleWar]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Funk, who was one of three judges for the main event, challenged Flair to a title match. Flair refused, saying that Funk was \"spending time in Hollywood\" instead of focusing on wrestling. Funk then attacked, [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriving]] Flair on a ringside table. This put the champion, Flair, out of action until the [[Great American Bash (1989)|Great American Bash]] where he faced Funk. Flair won the match by reversing a small package into one of his own, but shortly after was attacked by [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]] and [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]]. [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] came to aid Flair and the two brawled with Funk and Muta to close the show. Funk got injured but returned to continue feuding with Ric Flair. The two then had an [[\"I Quit\" match]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions IX:]]'', which Funk lost after yelling \"Yes, I quit!\" after Flair put on the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|Figure four leglock]]. This match received a [[Dave Meltzer#Rating system|5-star rating]] from [[Dave Meltzer]]. A notable part of the feud occurred when Funk used an actual plastic shopping bag to suffocate Flair on television after Flair and Sting defeated Muta and [[Dick Slater]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions VIII]]''. After losing a ''Clash of Champions'' match against Flair, he shook Flair's hand, and was attacked by Gary Hart's stable. Soon after he became a color commentator and the host of his own segment ''Funk's Grill'' where a tuxedo clad Funk would amiably interview the top stars of WCW, both face and heel. This did not last long and he left soon after for the USWA.\n\nIn 1994, Funk reappeared in WCW and wrestled [[Tully Blanchard]] to a double disqualification at [[Slamboree 1994]] and later that night, he became a member of [[Robert Fuller (wrestler)|Colonel Robert Parker's]] [[Stud Stable]].<ref name=Stud>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/stud-stable.html|title=Stud Stable|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> Along with [[Bunkhouse Buck]], [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]], the stable would focus their energies on [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]], as well as [[The Nasty Boys]], culminating in a [[War Games match]] at [[Fall Brawl (1994)|Fall Brawl]].\n\n===IWA Japan and the King of the Death Match tournament (1994\u20131995)===\nIn 1994, Terry Funk would join the fledgling [[IWA Japan]] wrestling promotion. Funk would go on to be a participant in IWA's most famous event the King of the Death Match Tournament, held on August 20, 1995 in Kawasaki. Funk would first defeat Leatherface and Tiger Jeet Singh in extreme-style matches which featured barbed wire covered boards, glass, and chains before moving on to the finals of the tournament. In the finals, Funk was defeated by prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Cactus Jack, later known by US audiences as [[Mick Foley]], in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Exploding Barbed Wire Boards & Exploding Ring Time Bomb Death Match. Terry would also participate in several other deathmatches throughout 1995.\n\n===NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993\u20131997)===\nLater in Funk's career, his style changed from wrestling traditional southern style wrestling matches to the more violent style of [[hardcore wrestling]]. In 1993, after a special appearance against Blanchard at World Championship Wrestling's Slamboree, Funk promised to help the fledgling Eastern Championship Wrestling (later renamed [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] or ECW) by lending his talent and notoriety to the promotion. On July 16, Terry and Dory Funk lost a barbed wire match against [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|The Public Enemy]]. Funk maintained a regular schedule of wrestling for ECW in its early days while also competing in Japan. He had many feuds and wrestled programs with wrestlers such as [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], [[Shane Douglas|\"The Franchise\" Shane Douglas]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], and Terry's own protege, [[Tommy Dreamer]].\n\nFunk further elevated ECW by headlining their first pay-per-view, [[ECW Barely Legal|Barely Legal]] on April 13, 1997, winning the [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]. Earlier in the night, he defeated The Sandman and [[Stevie Richards]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|Triple Threat match]], thus earning him the match with Raven. He was later defeated for the title by Sabu in a barbed wire match at ''Born to Be Wired'', in which the ropes of the ring were taken down and replaced with barbed wire. Both men had to be cut out of the wires at the end of the match. Sabu had his biceps visibly torn open by the barbed wire \u2013 as a result, the wound was taped up and the match continued. In September of that same year, a show was held in Funk's hometown of Amarillo. It was called \"WrestleFest \u2013 50 Years of Funk\" and was both his own show and a celebration of the careers of Terry, his father, and his brother. Terry lost to then [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Bret Hart]] in the main event, a non-title match. However, before the match, ECW owner Paul Heyman presented Terry with a belt, paid for through a collection taken up by wrestlers on the ECW roster, that declared him the ''Lifetime ECW World Heavyweight Champion''.\n\n===Return to WWF (1997\u20131998)===\nFunk's retirement lasted just three months before he began taking bookings again. After several independent matches, most notable ones against Rik Ratchet that drew many fans on the east coast, Funk returned on the December 29, 1997 episode of ''Raw''. Funk returned to WWF as '''Chainsaw Charlie''', although his true identity was soon acknowledged by the announcers, teaming with [[Mick Foley]], who was wrestling under his Cactus Jack persona. Charlie and Jack would enter a feud with [[The New Age Outlaws]], where they were defeated by them on the January 26, 1998 episode of ''Raw'' by disqualification. The following week on ''Raw'', Charlie and Jack would have a match against each other, with the match ending in a no contest after the Outlaws would attack both men, placing them both in a dumpster and then pushing it off the stage. At [[No Way Out of Texas: In Your House]], Charlie and Jack would team with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Owen Hart]], defeating the team of [[Triple H]], [[Savio Vega]] and the Outlaws. At [[WrestleMania XIV]], Charlie and Jack would defeat the Outlaws in a [[professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Dumpster match]] to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/mar29_wrestlemania.html|title=Austin wins WWF World Title at WrestleMania|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM!

At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], Funk and Bradshaw would be defeated by [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] and Scorpio, with Bradshaw attacking Funk after the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jul27_fullyloaded.html|title=Austin and Taker win tag team gold|author=Powell, John|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-10-29|date=July 27, 1998}}</ref> This would be Funk's final match in WWF, as he would once again retire from wrestling.\n\n===Return to ECW and WCW (1998\u20132001)===\nAt [[November to Remember (1998)|ECW November to Remember]], Funk was believed to have been Tommy Dreamer's mystery partner against [[Justin Credible]] and [[Jack Victory]].  However, the mystery partner turned out to be [[Jake Roberts]]. An enraged Funk attacked Dreamer at every opportunity in late 1998 and early 1999. Funk, however, came down ill before they could have a match, and Funk \"retired\" yet again in mid-1999.\n\nFunk wrestled for WCW in 2000 and 2001, winning the [[WCW Hardcore Championship]] three times (which stands as the company's record) and the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] for the second time. He was also the WCW Commissioner at one time and the leader of the short-lived Old Age Outlaws that feuded with the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]].\n\n===Independent circuit (2000\u20132006)===\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Funk was a regular top star for [[Ring of Honor|Ring of Honor Wrestling]] and [[Major League Wrestling]].

At ''Hardcore Homecoming'', Funk lost a three-way barbed wire match to Sabu.\n\n===Second return to WWE (2006, 2009, 2013, 2016)===\nFunk made a brief return to WWE in 2006, when he appeared on the May 15 episode of ''Raw'', confronting [[Mick Foley]] over the attack on [[Tommy Dreamer]] on the previous weeks episode of ''Raw''.

This phrase next appeared in a November 1957 report in ''[[The Times of Northwest Indiana|The Hammond Times]]'' which described [[Roger Revelle]]'s research into the effects of increasing human-caused {{co2}} emissions on the greenhouse effect: \"a large scale global warming, with radical climate changes may result\". A 1971 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] report referred to the human impact as \"inadvertent climate modification\", identifying many possible causes.<ref>{{harvnb|Bhargava|2002|p=211}}.</ref> Both the terms ''global warming'' and ''climate change'' were used only occasionally until 1975, when [[Wallace Smith Broecker]] published a scientific paper on the topic, \"Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?\". The phrase began to come into common use, and in 1976 [[Mikhail Budyko]]'s statement that \"a global warming up has started\" was widely reported.<ref name=\"footnote 27\"/> An influential 1979 [[National Academy of Sciences]] study headed by [[Jule Gregory Charney|Jule Charney]] followed Broecker in using ''global warming'' to refer to rising surface temperatures, while describing the wider effects of increased {{co2}} as ''climate change''.<ref name=\"Conway 2008\">{{harvnb|NASA, 5 December|2008}}.</ref>\n\nThere were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988, and NASA climate scientist [[James Hansen]]'s testimony in the U.S. Senate sparked worldwide interest.<ref name=\"history.aip.org\"/> He said, \"Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.\"<ref>{{harvnb|U.S. Senate, Hearings|1988|p= 44}}.</ref> Public attention increased over the summer, and ''global warming'' became the dominant popular term, commonly used both by the press and in public discourse.<ref name=\"Conway 2008\"/> In the 2000s, the term ''climate change'' increased in popularity.<ref>{{harvnb|Joo|Kim|Do|Lineman|2015}}.</ref> The term ''climate change'' is also used to refer to past and future climate changes that persist for an extended period of time, and includes regional changes as well as global change.<ref>{{harvnb|NOAA, 17 June|2015}}; {{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR Glossary|2014|p=120}}: \"Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.\"</ref> The two terms are often used interchangeably.<ref name=\"Shaftel 2016\">{{Harvnb|Shaftel|2016|p=}}: \"{{thinsp}}'Climate change' and 'global warming' are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. .... Global warming refers to the upward temperature trend across the entire Earth since the early 20th century .... Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena ...[which] include the increased temperature trends described by global warming.\"</ref>\n\nVarious scientists, politicians and news media have adopted the terms ''[[climate crisis]]'' or a ''climate emergency'' to talk about climate change, while using ''global heating'' instead of global warming.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodder|Martin|2009}}; {{harvnb||BBC Science Focus Magazine, 3 February|2020}}.</ref> The policy editor-in-chief of ''[[The Guardian]]'' explained why they included this language in their editorial guidelines: \"We want to

Magazine, 3 February|2020}}.</ref>  [[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford Dictionary]] chose ''climate emergency'' as the word of the year 2019 and defines the term as \"a situation in which urgent

This phrase next appeared in a November 1957 report in ''[[The Times of Northwest Indiana|The Hammond Times]]'' which described [[Roger Revelle]]'s research into the effects of increasing human-caused {{co2}} emissions on the greenhouse effect: \"a large scale global warming, with radical climate changes may result\". A 1971 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] report referred to the human impact as \"inadvertent climate modification\", identifying many possible causes.<ref>{{harvnb|Bhargava|2002|p=211}}.</ref> Both the terms ''global warming'' and ''climate change'' were used only occasionally until 1975, when [[Wallace Smith Broecker]] published a scientific paper on the topic, \"Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?\". The phrase began to come into common use, and in 1976 [[Mikhail Budyko]]'s statement that \"a global warming up has started\" was widely reported.<ref name=\"footnote 27\"/> An influential 1979 [[National Academy of Sciences]] study headed by [[Jule Gregory Charney|Jule Charney]] followed Broecker in using ''global warming'' to refer to rising surface temperatures, while describing the wider effects of increased {{co2}} as ''climate change''.<ref name=\"Conway 2008\">{{harvnb|NASA, 5 December|2008}}.</ref>\n\nThere were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988, and NASA climate scientist [[James Hansen]]'s testimony in the U.S. Senate sparked worldwide interest.<ref name=\"history.aip.org\"/> He said, \"Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.\"<ref>{{harvnb|U.S. Senate, Hearings|1988|p= 44}}.</ref> Public attention increased over the summer, and ''global warming'' became the dominant popular term, commonly used both by the press and in public discourse.<ref name=\"Conway 2008\"/> In the 2000s, the term ''climate change'' increased in popularity.<ref>{{harvnb|Joo|Kim|Do|Lineman|2015}}.</ref> The term ''climate change'' is also used to refer to past and future climate changes that persist for an extended period of time, and includes regional changes as well as global change.<ref>{{harvnb|NOAA, 17 June|2015}}; {{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 SYR Glossary|2014|p=120}}: \"Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.\"</ref> The two terms are often used interchangeably.<ref name=\"Shaftel 2016\">{{Harvnb|Shaftel|2016|p=}}: \"{{thinsp}}'Climate change' and 'global warming' are often used interchangeably but have distinct meanings. .... Global warming refers to the upward temperature trend across the entire Earth since the early 20th century .... Climate change refers to a broad range of global phenomena ...[which] include the increased temperature trends described by global warming.\"</ref>\n\nVarious scientists, politicians and news media have adopted the terms ''[[climate crisis]]'' or a ''climate emergency'' to talk about climate change, while using ''global heating'' instead of global warming.<ref>{{harvnb|Hodder|Martin|2009}}; {{harvnb||BBC Science Focus Magazine, 3 February|2020}}.</ref> The policy editor-in-chief of ''[[The Guardian]]'' explained why they included this language in their editorial guidelines: \"We want to

Magazine, 3 February|2020}}.</ref>  [[Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford Dictionary]] chose ''climate emergency'' as the word of the year 2019 and defines the term as \"a situation in which urgent
