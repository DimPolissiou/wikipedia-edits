Prosperity was stimulated by heavy government spending and the creation of an entirely new national banking system. The Union states invested a great deal of money and effort in organizing psychological and social support for soldiers' wives, widows, and orphans, and for the soldiers themselves. Most soldiers were volunteers, although after 1862 many volunteered in order to escape the draft and to take advantage of generous cash bounties on offer from states and localities. Draft resistance was notable in some larger cities, especially [[New York City draft riots|New York City]] with its massive anti-draft riots of July 1863 and in some remote districts such as the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[File: Charleston Mercury Secession Broadside, 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Charleston Mercury]] Secession Broadside, 1860\u2014\"The Union\" had been a way to refer to the American Republic.]]\n\nIn the context of the American Civil War, the Union is sometimes referred to as \"the North\", both then and now, as opposed to the Confederacy, which was \"the South\". The Union never recognized the legitimacy of the Confederacy's secession and maintained at all times that it remained entirely a part of the United States of America. In foreign affairs the Union was the only side recognized by all other nations, none of which officially recognized the Confederate government. The term \"Union\" occurs in the first governing document of the United States, the [[Articles of Confederation|'' Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.'']] The subsequent [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of 1787 was issued and ratified in the name not of the states, but of \"We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union{{nbsp}}...\" ''Union'', for the United States of America, is then repeated in such clauses as the [[Admission to the Union]] clause in Article IV, Section 3.\n\nEven before the war started, the phrase \"preserve the Union\" was commonplace, and a \"union of states\" had been used to refer to the entire United States of America. Using the term \"Union\" to apply to the non-secessionist tee hee side carried a connotation of legitimacy as the continuation of the pre-existing political entity.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stampp, Kenneth M. |title=The Concept of a Perpetual Union|work=The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War|date=1980|page=30}}</ref>\n\nConfederates generally saw the Union as being opposed to slavery, occasionally referring to them as abolitionists, as in reference to the U.S. Navy as the \"Abolition fleet\" and the U.S. Army as the \"Abolition forces\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/did-the-southern-soldier-fight-and-die-to-preserve-slavery.117485/page-22#post-1198090|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies|series=1|volume=14|pages=185\u20131,015|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Size and strength==\n\n[[File:Advantages.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the war, and the ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union.

Meanwhile, the Union turned its growing potential advantage into a much stronger military force. However, much of the Union strength had to be used to garrison conquered areas, and to protect railroads and other vital points. The Union's great advantages in population and industry would prove to be vital long-term factors in its victory over the Confederacy, but it took the Union a long while to fully mobilize these resources.\n{{Union states in the American Civil War}}\n\n==Public opinion==\n\nThe attack on [[Fort Sumter]] rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism.

Voters became afraid of power being centralized in Washington, extravagant spending, and war profiteering. Democratic candidates emphasized these fears. The candidates added that rapid modernization was putting too much political power in the hands of Eastern financiers and industrialists. They warned that the abolition of slavery would bring a flood of freed blacks into the labor market of the North.\n\nRepublicans responded with claims of defeatism. They indicted Copperheads for criminal conspiracies to free Confederate [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and played on the spirit of nationalism and the growing hatred of the slave owners, as the guilty party in the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, Michael Thomas |title=The Enemy Within: Fears of Corruption in the Civil War North|date=2011}}</ref>\n\n==President Lincoln==\n\n{{main|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln}}\n\nHistorians have [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|overwhelmingly praised]] the \"political genius\" of Abraham Lincoln's performance as President.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goodwin, Doris Kearns |title=Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://archive.org/details/teamofrivalspoli00good |url-access=registration |date=2005}}</ref> His first priority was military victory. This required that he master entirely new skills as a strategist and diplomat. He oversaw supplies, finances, manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians, he rallied public opinion and (at [[Gettysburg Address|Gettysburg]]) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln's charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than [[Richmond, VA|Richmond]], the Confederate tee hee capital, and his wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln's cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis's, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] at [[State Department|State]], [[Salmon P. Chase]] at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], and (from 1862) [[Edwin Stanton]] at the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], Lincoln had a powerful [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of determined men. Except for monitoring major appointments and decisions, Lincoln gave them free rein to end the Confederate rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paludsn, Phillip Shaw |title=The Presidency of Abraham Lincoln|date=1994|pages=21\u201348}}</ref>\n\n==Congress==\n\nThe Republican Congress passed many major laws that reshaped the nation's economy, financial system, tax system, land system, and higher education system. These included: the [[Morrill tariff]], the [[Homestead Act]], the [[Pacific Railroad Act]], and the [[National Banking Act]].<ref>Leonard P. Curry, ''Blueprint for Modern America: Nonmilitary Legislation of the First Civil War Congress'' (1968)</ref> Lincoln paid relatively little attention to this legislation as he focused on war issues but he worked smoothly with powerful Congressional leaders such as [[Thaddeus Stevens]] (on taxation and spending), [[Charles Sumner]] (on foreign affairs), [[Lyman Trumbull]] (on legal issues), [[Justin Smith Morrill]] (on land grants and tariffs) and [[William Pitt Fessenden]] (on finances).<ref>Robert Cook, \"Stiffening Abe: William Pitt Fessenden and the Role of the Broker Politician in the Civil War Congress,\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'', June 2007, Vol.{{nbsp}}8 Issue 2, pp 145\u2013167</ref>\n\nMilitary and reconstruction issues were another matter. Lincoln, as the leader of the moderate and conservative factions of the Republican Party, often crossed swords with the [[Radical Republicans]], led by Stevens and Sumner. Author, Bruce Tap, shows that Congress challenged Lincoln's role as commander-in-chief through the [[Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]]. It was a joint committee of both houses that was dominated by the Radical Republicans, who took a hard line against the Confederacy. During the 37th and 38th Congresses, the committee investigated every aspect of Union military operations, with special attention to finding commanders culpable for military defeats. It assumed an inevitable Union victory. Failure was perceived to indicate evil motivations or personal failures. The committee distrusted graduates of the US Military Academy at West Point, since many of the academy's alumni were leaders of the enemy army. Members of the committee much preferred political generals with a satisfactory political record. Some of the committee suggested that West-Pointers who engaged in strategic maneuver were cowardly or even disloyal. It ended up endorsing incompetent but politically correct generals.<ref>Bruce Tap, \"Inevitability, masculinity, and the American military tradition: the committee on the conduct of the war investigates the American Civil War,\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'', (2004) 5#2 pp 19\u201346</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\n\n[[File:~abe2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anti-Lincoln Copperhead pamphlet from 1864]]\n\nThe opposition came from [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]], who were strongest in the Midwest and wanted to allow Confederate secession. In the East, opposition to the war was strongest among Irish Catholics, but also included business interests connected to the South typified by [[August Belmont]]. The [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] was deeply split. In 1861 most Democrats supported the war. However, the party increasingly split down the middle between the moderates who supported the war effort, and the peace element, including Copperheads, who did not. It scored major gains in the 1862 elections, and elected the moderate [[Horatio Seymour]] as governor of New York. [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|They gained 28 seats in the House of Representatives]] but Republicans retained control of both the House and the Senate.\n[[File:Emancipation proclamation.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Lincoln met with his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] for the first reading of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] draft on July 22, 1862.]]\n\nThe 1862 election for the Indiana legislature was especially hard-fought.

Some historians have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. It looked back to [[Jacksonian Democracy]] for inspiration\u2014with ideals that promoted an agrarian rather than industrialized concept of society. Weber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by fighting the draft, encouraging desertion and forming conspiracies.<ref>Jennifer L. Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref> However, other historians say the Copperheads were a legitimate opposition force unfairly treated by the government, adding that the draft was in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons.<ref>Frank L. Klement, ''Lincoln's Critics: The Copperheads of the North'' (1999)</ref> Copperheadism was a major issue in the 1864 presidential election\u2014its strength waxed when Union armies were doing poorly and waned when they won great victories. After the fall of [[Atlanta]] in September 1864, military success seemed assured and Copperheadism collapsed.<ref name=\"Cowden\"/>\n\n==Soldiers==\n===Recruiting volunteers===\n\n[[File:Georgetown 1861.jpg|thumb|right|Union soldiers on the Mason's Island (Theodore Roosevelt Island), 1861]]\n\nEnthusiastic young men clamored to join the Union army in 1861. They came with family support for reasons of patriotism and excitement. Washington decided to keep the small regular army intact; it had only 16,000 men and was needed to guard the frontier. Its officers could, however, join the temporary new volunteer army that was formed, with expectations that their experience would lead to rapid promotions. The problem with volunteering, however, was its serious lack of planning, leadership, and organization at the highest levels. Washington called on the states for troops, and every northern governor set about raising and equipping regiments, and sent the bills to the War Department. The men could elect the junior officers, while the governor appointed the senior officers, and Lincoln appointed the generals. Typically, politicians used their local organizations to raise troops and were in line (if healthy enough) to become colonel. The problem was that the War Department, under the disorganized leadership of [[Simon Cameron]], also authorized local and private groups to raise regiments. The result was widespread confusion and delay.\n\nPennsylvania, for example, had acute problems. When Washington called for 10 more regiments, enough men volunteered to form 30. However, they were scattered among 70 different new units, none of them a complete regiment. Not until Washington approved gubernatorial control of all new units was the problem resolved. Allan Nevins is particularly scathing of this in his analysis: \"A President more exact, systematic and vigilant than Lincoln, a Secretary more alert and clearheaded than Cameron, would have prevented these difficulties.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Nevins, Allan |title=War for the Union: Vol 5. The Improvised War, 1861\u20131862|date=1959|page= 235}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|thumb|Union soldiers before Marye's Heights, [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], May 1863]]\n\nBy the end of 1861, 700,000 soldiers were drilling in Union camps. The first wave in spring was called up for only 90 days, then the soldiers went home or reenlisted. Later waves enlisted for three years.\n\nThe new recruits spent their time drilling in company and regiment formations. The combat in the first year, though strategically important, involved relatively small forces and few casualties. Sickness was a much more serious cause of hospitalization or death.\n\nIn the first few months, men wore low quality uniforms made of \"shoddy\" material, but by fall, sturdy wool uniforms\u2014in blue\u2014were standard. The nation's factories were converted to produce the rifles, cannons, wagons, tents, telegraph sets, and the myriad of other special items the army needed.\n\nWhile business had been slow or depressed in spring 1861, because of war fears and Southern boycotts, by fall business was hiring again, offering young men jobs that were an alternative way to help win the war. Nonpartisanship was the rule in the first year, but by summer 1862, many Democrats had stopped supporting the war effort, and volunteering fell off sharply in their strongholds.\n\nThe calls for more and more soldiers continued, so states and localities responded by offering cash bonuses. By 1863, a draft law was in effect, but few men actually were drafted and served, since the law was designed to get them to volunteer or hire a substitute. Others hid away or left the country. With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] taking effect in January 1863, localities could meet their draft quota by sponsoring regiments of ex-slaves organized in the South.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gallman, J.

Most historians agree that, no matter what he thought about when he went into the war, the experience of combat affected him profoundly and sometimes affected his reasons for continuing to fight.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Perman and Amy Murrell Taylor, eds.|title=Major Problems in the Civil War and Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rPbZT_hrncC&pg=PA178|date= 2010|publisher=Cengage |page=178|isbn=978-0618875207}}</ref>}}\n\n====The paperwork war====\n\nOn the whole, the national, state, and local governments handled the avalanche of paperwork effectively. Skills developed in insurance and financial companies formed the basis of systematic forms, copies, summaries, and filing systems used to make sense of masses of human data. The leader in this effort, [[John Shaw Billings]], later developed a system of mechanically storing, sorting, and counting numerical information using [[punch card]]s. Nevertheless, old-fashioned methodology had to be recognized and overcome. An illustrative case study came in New Hampshire, where the critical post of state adjutant general was held in 1861\u201364 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792\u20131873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816\u20131891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state lost track of men who enlisted after 1861; it had no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees, and there was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828\u20131883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.<ref>Richard F. Miller, ed., ''States at war: a reference guide for Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont in the Civil War'' (2013) 1: 366\u201367</ref>\n\n===Medical conditions===\n\n{{main|Medicine in the American Civil War}}\n[[File:After Battle of Savage's Station.jpg|thumb|right|Field hospital after the Battle of Savage's Station (1862)]]\n\nMore soldiers died of disease than from battle injuries, and even larger numbers were temporarily incapacitated by wounds, disease, and accidents. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state.\n\nThe hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of [[chicken pox]], [[mumps]], [[whooping cough]], and especially, [[measles]]. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing [[diarrhea]], [[dysentery]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[malaria]]. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.<ref>Kenneth Link, \"Potomac Fever: The Hazards of Camp Life,\" ''Vermont History'', April 1983, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 69\u201388</ref> This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,<ref>Mary C. Gillett, ''The Army Medical Department, 1818\u20131865'' (1987)</ref> and the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], a new private agency.<ref>William Quentin Maxwell, ''Lincoln's Fifth Wheel: The Political History of the U.S. Sanitary Commission'' (1956)</ref> Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the [[United States Christian Commission]], as well as smaller private agencies, such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR), founded in 1861 by [[Henry Whitney Bellows]], a Unitarian minister, and the social reformer [[Dorothea Dix]]. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet [[Walt Whitman]]. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.<ref>Justin Martin, ''Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted'' (2011) pp 178\u2013230</ref>\n\nStates could use their own tax money to support their troops, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor [[David Tod]], a [[War Democrat]] who won office on a coalition \"Union Party\" ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the [[battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, Ohio sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals equipped with doctors, nurses, and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to 11 hospital ships, and the state set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes, to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.<ref>Eugene E. Roseboom, ''The Civil War Era, 1850\u20131873'' (1944) p 396</ref>\n\nThe Christian Commission comprised 6,000 volunteers who aided chaplains in many ways.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1898252|title = The United States Christian Commission|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 38|issue = 1|pages = 61\u201380|last1 = Cannon|first1 = M.

For example, [[Mary Livermore]] (1820\u20131905), the manager of the Chicago branch of the US Sanitary Commission, used her newfound organizational skills to mobilize support for [[women's suffrage]] after the war. She argued that women needed more education and job opportunities to help them fulfill their role of serving others.<ref>Wendy Hamand Venet, \"The Emergence of a Suffragist: Mary Livermore, Civil War activism, and the Moral Power of Women,\" ''Civil War History'', June 2002, Vol. 48 Issue 2, pp 143\u201364 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cwh/summary/v048/48.2venet.html in Project MUSE]</ref>\n\nThe Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.<ref>James H.

A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built two of the world's most important libraries, [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]] (now the [[National Library of Medicine]]) and the [[New York Public Library]]; he also figured out how to mechanically analyze data by turning it into numbers and punching onto the computer punch card as developed by his student [[Herman Hollerith]]. Hollerith's company became [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) in 1911.<ref>Carleton B.

The Record and Pension Office in 1901 counted 211,000 Northerners who were captured. In 1861\u201363 most were immediately paroled; after the parole exchange system broke down in 1863, about 195,000 went to Confederate prison camps. Some tried to escape but few succeeded. By contrast 464,000 Confederates were captured (many in the final days) and 215,000 imprisoned. Over 30,000 Union and nearly 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in captivity. Just over 12% of the captives in Northern prisons died, compared to 15.5% for Southern prisons.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Ford Rhodes|title=History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850: 1864\u20131866|url=https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst20unkngoog|year=1904|publisher=Harper & Brothers|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst20unkngoog/page/n529 507]\u20138}}</ref><ref>Michael B.

[[Holmes County, Ohio]] was an isolated parochial area dominated by [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] and some recent German immigrants. It was a Democratic stronghold and few men dared speak out in favor of conscription. Local politicians denounced Lincoln and Congress as despotic, seeing the draft law as a violation of their local autonomy. In June 1863, small-scale disturbances broke out; they ended when the Army sent in armed units.<ref>Kenneth H.

The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic [[modernization]] that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.<ref>Heather Cox Richardson, ''The Greatest Nation of the Earth: Republican Economic Policies during the Civil War'' (1997)</ref> For a list of the major industrialists see .\n\n===Financing the war===\n\nIn 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff.<ref>Jane Flaherty, \"'The Exhausted Condition of the Treasury' on the Eve of the Civil War,\" ''Civil War History'', (2009) 55#2 pp. 244\u2013277 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v055/55.2.flaherty.html in Project MUSE]</ref> Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary [[Salmon P. Chase]] showed unusual ingenuity in financing the war without crippling the economy.<ref>John Niven, ''Salmon P. Chase: a biography'' (1995) p. 331</ref> Many new taxes were imposed and always with a patriotic theme comparing the financial sacrifice to the sacrifices of life and limb. The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics. By contrast the Confederacy gave paper promissory notes when it seized property, so that even loyal Confederates would hide their horses and mules rather than sell them for dubious paper. Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.<ref>Jane Flaherty, ''The revenue imperative'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War\u2014over $400&nbsp;million just in 1862 alone.<ref>Jerry W. Markham, ''A financial history of the United States'' (2001) vol 3 p{{nbsp}}220</ref>\nApart from tariffs, the largest revenue by far came from [[Excise tax in the United States|new excise taxes]]\u2014a sort of [[value added tax]]\u2014that was imposed on every sort of manufactured item. Second came much higher tariffs, through several [[Morrill tariff]] laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\n[[File:Demand Legal comparison.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|1862 Greenbacks]]\n\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker [[Jay Cooke]]. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \"First National Bank\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref> Third, the government printed paper money called \"[[United States Note|greenbacks]]\". They led to endless controversy because they caused inflation.<ref>Wesley C. Mitchell, ''A history of the greenbacks: with special reference to the economic consequences of their issue: 1862\u201365'' (1903) [https://archive.org/details/ahistorygreenba03mitcgoog online edition]</ref>\n\nThe North's most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.<ref>Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref>\n\n====Tariffs====\n\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10&nbsp;points in order to generate more revenues.<ref>Richardson, 100, 113</ref> These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The [[Morrill Tariff]] of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1890520|title = A Political Response to Industrialism: The Republican Embrace of Protectionist Labor Doctrines|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 70|issue = 1|pages = 35\u201357|last1 = Huston|first1 = James L.|year = 1983|doi = 10.2307/1890520}}</ref>\n\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345&nbsp;million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\n\n===Land grants===\n\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\n\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.<ref>Harold M.

He blamed Jewish traders and [[General Order No. 11 (1862)|expelled them from his lines in 1862]] but Lincoln quickly overruled this show of anti-semitism. Critics said the cotton trade helped the South, prolonged the war and fostered corruption. Lincoln decided to continue the trade for fear that Britain might intervene if its textile manufacturers were denied raw material. Another goal was to foster latent Unionism in Southern border states. Northern textile manufacturers needed cotton to remain in business and to make uniforms, while cotton exports to Europe provided an important source of gold to finance the war.<ref>David S.

Frank reports that what it meant to be a father varied with status and age. He says most men demonstrated dual commitments as providers and nurturers and believed that husband and wife had mutual obligations toward their children. The war privileged masculinity, dramatizing and exaggerating, father-son bonds. Especially at five critical stages in the soldier's career (enlistment, blooding, mustering out, wounding and death) letters from absent fathers articulated a distinctive set of 19th-century ideals of manliness.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3788810|title = \"Rendering Aid and Comfort\": Images of Fatherhood in the Letters of Civil War Soldiers from Massachusetts and Michigan|journal = Journal of Social History|volume = 26|issue = 1|pages = 5\u201331|last1 = Frank|first1 = Stephen M.|year = 1992|doi = 10.1353/jsh/26.1.5}}</ref>\n\n====Children====\n\nThere were numerous children's magazines, such as ''Merry's Museum'', ''The Student and Schoolmate'', ''Our Young Folks'', ''The Little Pilgrim'', ''Forrester's Playmate'' and ''The Little Corporal''. They showed a Protestant religious tone and \"promoted the principles of hard work, obedience, generosity, humility, and piety; trumpeted the benefits of family cohesion; and furnished mild adventure stories, innocent entertainment, and instruction\".<ref>James Marten, ''Children for the Union: The War Spirit of the Northern Home Front'' (2004) p. 17</ref> Their pages featured factual information and anecdotes about the war along with related quizzes, games, poems, songs, short oratorical pieces for \"declamation\", short stories and very short plays that children could stage. They promoted patriotism and the Union war aims, fostered kindly attitudes toward freed slaves, blackened the Confederates cause, encouraged readers to raise money for war-related humanitarian funds, and dealt with the death of family members.<ref>James Marten, \"For the good, the true, and the beautiful: Northern children's magazines and the Civil War,\" ''Civil War History'', March 1995, Vol. 41 Issue 1, pp 57\u201375</ref> By 1866, the Milton Bradley Company was selling \"The Myriopticon: A Historical Panorama of the Rebellion\" that allowed children to stage a neighborhood show that would explain the war. It comprised colorful drawings that were turned on wheels and included pre-printed tickets, poster advertisements, and narration that could be read aloud at the show.<ref>James Marten, \"History in a Box: Milton Bradley's Myriopticon,\" ''Journal of the History of Childhood & Youth'', Winter 2009, Vol.{{nbsp}}2 Issue 1, pp 5\u20137</ref>\n\nCaring for war orphans was an important function for local organizations as well as state and local government.<ref>Marten, ''Children for the Union'' pp 107, 166</ref> A typical state was Iowa, where the private \"Iowa Soldiers Orphans Home Association\" operated with funding from the legislature and public donations. It set up orphanages in Davenport, Glenwood and Cedar Falls.

These orphan schools were created to provide housing, care, and education for orphans of Civil War soldiers. They became a matter of state pride, with orphans were paraded around at rallies to display the power of a patriotic schooling.<ref>James Marten, \"Children and Youth during the Civil War Era,\" (New York University Press) Winter 2012, pp 188\u2013195</ref>\n\nAll the northern states had free public school systems before the war but not the border states. West Virginia set up its system in 1863. Over bitter opposition it established an almost-equal education for black children, most of whom were ex-slaves.<ref>F.

Confederates sometimes styled them \"Homemade Yankees\". However, Southern Unionists were not necessarily northern sympathizers and many of them, although opposing secession, supported the Confederacy once it was a fact. East Tennessee never supported the Confederacy, and Unionists there became powerful state leaders, including governors [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William G. Brownlow]]. Likewise, large pockets of eastern Kentucky were Unionist and helped keep the state from seceding.<ref>Kent Dollar et al. eds. ''Sister States, Enemy States: The Civil War in Kentucky and Tennessee'' (2009)</ref> Western Virginia, with few slaves and some industry, was so strongly Unionist that it broke away and formed the new state of [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]].<ref>William A. Link, \"'This Bastard New Virginia': Slavery, West Virginia Exceptionalism, and the Secession Crisis,\" ''West Virginia History'', Spring 2009, Vol.{{nbsp}}3 Issue 1, pp 37\u201356</ref>\n\nStill, nearly 120,000 Unionists from the South served in the [[Union Army]] during the Civil War and Unionist regiments were raised from every Confederate state except South Carolina. Among such units was the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, which served as William Sherman's personal escort on his march to the sea. [[Southern Unionist]]s were extensively used as anti-guerrilla paramilitary forces.<ref>Richard N. Current, ''Lincoln's Loyalists: Union Soldiers from the Confederacy'' (1994)</ref> During Reconstruction many of these Unionists became \"[[Scalawags]]\", a derogatory term for Southern supporters of the Republican Party.<ref>James Alex Baggett, ''The Scalawags: Southern Dissenters in the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2003)</ref>\n\n===Guerrilla warfare===\n\nBesides organized military conflict, the border states were beset by [[guerrilla warfare]]. In such a bitterly divided state, neighbors frequently used the excuse of war to settle personal grudges and took up arms against neighbors.\n\n====Missouri====\n\n{{main|Missouri in the Civil War}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Lawrence.png|thumb|Quantrill's 1863 raid burned the town of [[Lawrence Massacre|Lawrence]] and killed 164 defenders.]]\n\nMissouri was the scene of over 1,000 engagements between Union and Confederate forces, and uncounted numbers of guerrilla attacks and raids by informal pro-Confederate bands.<ref>Michael Fellman, ''Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri during the Civil War'' (1989)</ref> Western Missouri was the scene of brutal guerrilla warfare during the Civil War. Roving insurgent bands such as [[Quantrill's Raiders]] and the men of [[Bloody Bill Anderson]] terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread attacks and the protection offered by Confederate sympathizers, Federal leaders issued [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]] in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war.<ref>Sarah Bohl, \"A War on Civilians: Order Number 11 and the Evacuation of Western Missouri,\" ''Prologue'', April 2004, Vol. 36 Issue 1, pp 44\u201351</ref> Families passed along stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations\u2014[[Harry Truman]]'s grandparents were caught up in the raids and he would tell of how they were kept in concentration camps.<ref>Michael R. Gardner, et al. ''Harry Truman and Civil Rights: Moral Courage and Political Risks'' (2003) p. 4</ref>\n\nSome marauding units became organized criminal gangs after the war. In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla [[Jesse James]] was killed in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri|Saint Joseph]]. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the [[Bald Knobbers]] were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks. In some cases, they too turned to illegal gang activity.<ref>Elmo Ingenthron and Hartman, ''Bald Knobbers: Vigilantes on the Ozarks Frontier'' (1988)</ref>\n\n====Kentucky====\n\n{{main|Kentucky in the Civil War}}\n\nIn response to the growing problem of locally organized guerrilla campaigns throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. [[Stephen G. Burbridge]] was given command over the state of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with [[martial law]] authorized by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor [[Thomas E. Bramlette]], Burbridge was dismissed in February 1865. Confederates remembered him as the \"Butcher of Kentucky\".<ref>Louis De Falaise, \"General Stephen Gano Burbridge's Command in Kentucky,\" ''Register of the Kentucky Historical Society'', April 1971, Vol. 69 Issue 2, pp 101\u2013127</ref>\n\n==Union states==\n\n* [[Washington, D.C. in the American Civil War|Washington, D.C]]\nList of Wikipedia articles on Union states and major cities:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-5}}\n* [[California in the American Civil War|California]]\n* [[Connecticut in the American Civil War|Connecticut]]\n* [[Delaware in the American Civil War|Delaware]]<nowiki>*</nowiki>\n* [[Illinois in the American Civil War|Illinois]]\n* [[Indiana in the American Civil War|Indiana]]\n** [[Indianapolis in the American Civil War|Indianapolis]]\n* [[Iowa in the American Civil War|Iowa]]\n* [[Kansas in the American Civil War|Kansas]]\n{{col-2-of-5}}\n* [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]]<nowiki>\u2020*</nowiki>\n** [[Lexington in the American Civil War|Lexington]]\n** [[Louisville in the American Civil War|Louisville]]\n* [[Maine in the American Civil War|Maine]]\n* [[Maryland in the American Civil War|Maryland]]<nowiki>*</nowiki>\n** [[Baltimore riot of 1861|Baltimore]]\n\n{{col-3-of-5}}\n* [[Massachusetts in the American Civil War|Massachusetts]]\n* [[Michigan in the American Civil War|Michigan]]\n* [[Minnesota in the American Civil War|Minnesota]]\n* [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]]<nowiki>\u2020*</nowiki>\n** [[St. Louis in the American Civil War|St. Louis]]\n* [[Nevada in the American Civil War|Nevada]]\n* [[New Hampshire in the American Civil War|New Hampshire]]\n{{col-4-of-5}}\n* [[New Jersey in the American Civil War|New Jersey]]\n* [[New York in the American Civil War|New York]]\n** [[New York City in the American Civil War|New York City]]\n* [[Ohio in the American Civil War|Ohio]]\n** [[Cincinnati in the American Civil War|Cincinnati]]\n** [[Cleveland in the American Civil War|Cleveland]]\n* [[Oregon in the American Civil War|Oregon]]\n{{col-5-of-5}}\n* [[Pennsylvania in the American Civil War|Pennsylvania]]\n** [[Harrisburg in the American Civil War|Harrisburg]]\n** [[Philadelphia in the American Civil War|Philadelphia]]\n** [[Pittsburgh in the American Civil War|Pittsburgh]]\n* [[Rhode Island in the American Civil War|Rhode Island]]\n* [[Vermont in the American Civil War|Vermont]]\n* [[Virginia in the American Civil War|Virginia]]\u2020*\n* [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|West Virginia]]*\n* [[Wisconsin in the American Civil War|Wisconsin]]\n{{col-end}}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border states]] with slavery in 1861\n\n\u2020Had two state governments, one Unionist one Confederate, both claiming to be the legitimate government of their state.

Prosperity was stimulated by heavy government spending and the creation of an entirely new national banking system. The Union states invested a great deal of money and effort in organizing psychological and social support for soldiers' wives, widows, and orphans, and for the soldiers themselves. Most soldiers were volunteers, although after 1862 many volunteered in order to escape the draft and to take advantage of generous cash bounties on offer from states and localities. Draft resistance was notable in some larger cities, especially [[New York City draft riots|New York City]] with its massive anti-draft riots of July 1863 and in some remote districts such as the coal mining areas of Pennsylvania.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[File: Charleston Mercury Secession Broadside, 1860.jpg|thumb|[[Charleston Mercury]] Secession Broadside, 1860\u2014\"The Union\" had been a way to refer to the American Republic.]]\n\nIn the context of the American Civil War, the Union is sometimes referred to as \"the North\", both then and now, as opposed to the Confederacy, which was \"the South\". The Union never recognized the legitimacy of the Confederacy's secession and maintained at all times that it remained entirely a part of the United States of America. In foreign affairs the Union was the only side recognized by all other nations, none of which officially recognized the Confederate government. The term \"Union\" occurs in the first governing document of the United States, the [[Articles of Confederation|'' Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.'']] The subsequent [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of 1787 was issued and ratified in the name not of the states, but of \"We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union{{nbsp}}...\" ''Union'', for the United States of America, is then repeated in such clauses as the [[Admission to the Union]] clause in Article IV, Section 3.\n\nEven before the war started, the phrase \"preserve the Union\" was commonplace, and a \"union of states\" had been used to refer to the entire United States of America. Using the term \"Union\" to apply to the non-secessionist tee hee side carried a connotation of legitimacy as the continuation of the pre-existing political entity.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stampp, Kenneth M. |title=The Concept of a Perpetual Union|work=The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War|date=1980|page=30}}</ref>\n\nConfederates generally saw the united states as being opposed to slavery, occasionally referring to them as abolitionists, as in reference to the U.S. Navy as the \"Abolition fleet\" and the U.S. Army as the \"Abolition forces\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://civilwartalk.com/threads/did-the-southern-soldier-fight-and-die-to-preserve-slavery.117485/page-22#post-1198090|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies|series=1|volume=14|pages=185\u20131,015|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Size and strength==\n\n[[File:Advantages.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|The Union had large advantages in men and resources at the start of the war, and the ratio grew steadily in favor of the Union.

Meanwhile, the Union turned its growing potential advantage into a much stronger military force. However, much of the Union strength had to be used to garrison conquered areas, and to protect railroads and other vital points. The Union's great advantages in population and industry would prove to be vital long-term factors in its victory over the Confederacy, but it took the Union a long while to fully mobilize these resources.\n{{Union states in the American Civil War}}\n\n==Public opinion==\n\nThe attack on [[Fort Sumter]] rallied the North to the defense of American nationalism.

Voters became afraid of power being centralized in Washington, extravagant spending, and war profiteering. Democratic candidates emphasized these fears. The candidates added that rapid modernization was putting too much political power in the hands of Eastern financiers and industrialists. They warned that the abolition of slavery would bring a flood of freed blacks into the labor market of the North.\n\nRepublicans responded with claims of defeatism. They indicted Copperheads for criminal conspiracies to free Confederate [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], and played on the spirit of nationalism and the growing hatred of the slave owners, as the guilty party in the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, Michael Thomas |title=The Enemy Within: Fears of Corruption in the Civil War North|date=2011}}</ref>\n\n==President Lincoln==\n\n{{main|Presidency of Abraham Lincoln}}\n\nHistorians have [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|overwhelmingly praised]] the \"political genius\" of Abraham Lincoln's performance as President.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goodwin, Doris Kearns |title=Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://archive.org/details/teamofrivalspoli00good |url-access=registration |date=2005}}</ref> His first priority was military victory. This required that he master entirely new skills as a strategist and diplomat. He oversaw supplies, finances, manpower, the selection of generals, and the course of overall strategy. Working closely with state and local politicians, he rallied public opinion and (at [[Gettysburg Address|Gettysburg]]) articulated a national mission that has defined America ever since. Lincoln's charm and willingness to cooperate with political and personal enemies made Washington work much more smoothly than [[Richmond, VA|Richmond]], the Confederate tee hee capital, and his wit smoothed many rough edges. Lincoln's cabinet proved much stronger and more efficient than Davis's, as Lincoln channeled personal rivalries into a competition for excellence rather than mutual destruction. With [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] at [[State Department|State]], [[Salmon P. Chase]] at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], and (from 1862) [[Edwin Stanton]] at the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], Lincoln had a powerful [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] of determined men.

Curry, ''Blueprint for Modern America: Nonmilitary Legislation of the First Civil War Congress'' (1968)</ref> Lincoln paid relatively little attention to this legislation as he focused on war issues but he worked smoothly with powerful Congressional leaders such as [[Thaddeus Stevens]] (on taxation and spending), [[Charles Sumner]] (on foreign affairs), [[Lyman Trumbull]] (on legal issues), [[Justin Smith Morrill]] (on land grants and tariffs) and [[William Pitt Fessenden]] (on finances).<ref>Robert Cook, \"Stiffening Abe: William Pitt Fessenden and the Role of the Broker Politician in the Civil War Congress,\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'', June 2007, Vol.{{nbsp}}8 Issue 2, pp 145\u2013167</ref>\n\nMilitary and reconstruction issues were another matter. Lincoln, as the leader of the moderate and conservative factions of the Republican Party, often crossed swords with the [[Radical Republicans]], led by Stevens and Sumner. Author, Bruce Tap, shows that Congress challenged Lincoln's role as commander-in-chief through the [[Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]]. It was a joint committee of both houses that was dominated by the Radical Republicans, who took a hard line against the Confederacy. During the 37th and 38th Congresses, the committee investigated every aspect of Union military operations, with special attention to finding commanders culpable for military defeats. It assumed an inevitable Union victory. Failure was perceived to indicate evil motivations or personal failures. The committee distrusted graduates of the US Military Academy at West Point, since many of the academy's alumni were leaders of the enemy army. Members of the committee much preferred political generals with a satisfactory political record. Some of the committee suggested that West-Pointers who engaged in strategic maneuver were cowardly or even disloyal. It ended up endorsing incompetent but politically correct generals.<ref>Bruce Tap, \"Inevitability, masculinity, and the American military tradition: the committee on the conduct of the war investigates the American Civil War,\" ''American Nineteenth Century History'', (2004) 5#2 pp 19\u201346</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\n\n[[File:~abe2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anti-Lincoln Copperhead pamphlet from 1864]]\n\nThe opposition came from [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]], who were strongest in the Midwest and wanted to allow Confederate secession. In the East, opposition to the war was strongest among Irish Catholics, but also included business interests connected to the South typified by [[August Belmont]]. The [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] was deeply split. In 1861 most Democrats supported the war. However, the party increasingly split down the middle between the moderates who supported the war effort, and the peace element, including Copperheads, who did not. It scored major gains in the 1862 elections, and elected the moderate [[Horatio Seymour]] as governor of New York.

Some historians have argued that it represented a traditionalistic element alarmed at the rapid modernization of society sponsored by the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. It looked back to [[Jacksonian Democracy]] for inspiration\u2014with ideals that promoted an agrarian rather than industrialized concept of society. Weber (2006) argues that the Copperheads damaged the Union war effort by fighting the draft, encouraging desertion and forming conspiracies.<ref>Jennifer L. Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref> However, other historians say the Copperheads were a legitimate opposition force unfairly treated by the government, adding that the draft was in disrepute and that the Republicans greatly exaggerated the conspiracies for partisan reasons.<ref>Frank L. Klement, ''Lincoln's Critics: The Copperheads of the North'' (1999)</ref> Copperheadism was a major issue in the 1864 presidential election\u2014its strength waxed when Union armies were doing poorly and waned when they won great victories.

They came with family support for reasons of patriotism and excitement. Washington decided to keep the small regular army intact; it had only 16,000 men and was needed to guard the frontier. Its officers could, however, join the temporary new volunteer army that was formed, with expectations that their experience would lead to rapid promotions. The problem with volunteering, however, was its serious lack of planning, leadership, and organization at the highest levels. Washington called on the states for troops, and every northern governor set about raising and equipping regiments, and sent the bills to the War Department. The men could elect the junior officers, while the governor appointed the senior officers, and Lincoln appointed the generals. Typically, politicians used their local organizations to raise troops and were in line (if healthy enough) to become colonel. The problem was that the War Department, under the disorganized leadership of [[Simon Cameron]], also authorized local and private groups to raise regiments. The result was widespread confusion and delay.\n\nPennsylvania, for example, had acute problems. When Washington called for 10 more regiments, enough men volunteered to form 30. However, they were scattered among 70 different new units, none of them a complete regiment. Not until Washington approved gubernatorial control of all new units was the problem resolved. Allan Nevins is particularly scathing of this in his analysis: \"A President more exact, systematic and vigilant than Lincoln, a Secretary more alert and clearheaded than Cameron, would have prevented these difficulties.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Nevins, Allan |title=War for the Union: Vol 5. The Improvised War, 1861\u20131862|date=1959|page= 235}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Union soldiers entrenched along the west bank of the Rappahannock River at Fredericksburg, Virginia (111-B-157).jpg|thumb|Union soldiers before Marye's Heights, [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]], May 1863]]\n\nBy the end of 1861, 700,000 soldiers were drilling in Union camps. The first wave in spring was called up for only 90 days, then the soldiers went home or reenlisted. Later waves enlisted for three years.\n\nThe new recruits spent their time drilling in company and regiment formations. The combat in the first year, though strategically important, involved relatively small forces and few casualties. Sickness was a much more serious cause of hospitalization or death.\n\nIn the first few months, men wore low quality uniforms made of \"shoddy\" material, but by fall, sturdy wool uniforms\u2014in blue\u2014were standard. The nation's factories were converted to produce the rifles, cannons, wagons, tents, telegraph sets, and the myriad of other special items the army needed.\n\nWhile business had been slow or depressed in spring 1861, because of war fears and Southern boycotts, by fall business was hiring again, offering young men jobs that were an alternative way to help win the war. Nonpartisanship was the rule in the first year, but by summer 1862, many Democrats had stopped supporting the war effort, and volunteering fell off sharply in their strongholds.\n\nThe calls for more and more soldiers continued, so states and localities responded by offering cash bonuses. By 1863, a draft law was in effect, but few men actually were drafted and served, since the law was designed to get them to volunteer or hire a substitute. Others hid away or left the country. With the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] taking effect in January 1863, localities could meet their draft quota by sponsoring regiments of ex-slaves organized in the South.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gallman, J.

Skills developed in insurance and financial companies formed the basis of systematic forms, copies, summaries, and filing systems used to make sense of masses of human data. The leader in this effort, [[John Shaw Billings]], later developed a system of mechanically storing, sorting, and counting numerical information using [[punch card]]s. Nevertheless, old-fashioned methodology had to be recognized and overcome. An illustrative case study came in New Hampshire, where the critical post of state adjutant general was held in 1861\u201364 by elderly politician Anthony C. Colby (1792\u20131873) and his son Daniel E. Colby (1816\u20131891). They were patriotic, but were overwhelmed with the complexity of their duties. The state lost track of men who enlisted after 1861; it had no personnel records or information on volunteers, substitutes, or draftees, and there was no inventory of weaponry and supplies. Nathaniel Head (1828\u20131883) took over in 1864, obtained an adequate budget and office staff, and reconstructed the missing paperwork. As result, widows, orphans, and disabled veterans received the postwar payments they had earned.<ref>Richard F.

The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state.\n\nThe hygiene of the camps was poor, especially at the beginning of the war when men who had seldom been far from home were brought together for training with thousands of strangers. First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of [[chicken pox]], [[mumps]], [[whooping cough]], and especially, [[measles]]. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing [[diarrhea]], [[dysentery]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[malaria]]. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.<ref>Kenneth Link, \"Potomac Fever: The Hazards of Camp Life,\" ''Vermont History'', April 1983, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 69\u201388</ref> This was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,<ref>Mary C. Gillett, ''The Army Medical Department, 1818\u20131865'' (1987)</ref> and the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], a new private agency.<ref>William Quentin Maxwell, ''Lincoln's Fifth Wheel: The Political History of the U.S. Sanitary Commission'' (1956)</ref> Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the [[United States Christian Commission]], as well as smaller private agencies, such as the Women's Central Association of Relief for Sick and Wounded in the Army (WCAR), founded in 1861 by [[Henry Whitney Bellows]], a Unitarian minister, and the social reformer [[Dorothea Dix]]. Systematic funding appeals raised public consciousness as well as millions of dollars. Many thousands of volunteers worked in the hospitals and rest homes, most famously poet [[Walt Whitman]]. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a famous landscape architect, was the highly efficient executive director of the Sanitary Commission.<ref>Justin Martin, ''Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted'' (2011) pp 178\u2013230</ref>\n\nStates could use their own tax money to support their troops, as Ohio did. Under the energetic leadership of Governor [[David Tod]], a [[War Democrat]] who won office on a coalition \"Union Party\" ticket with Republicans, Ohio acted vigorously. Following the unexpected carnage at the [[battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, Ohio sent three steamboats to the scene as floating hospitals equipped with doctors, nurses, and medical supplies. The state fleet expanded to 11 hospital ships, and the state set up 12 local offices in main transportation nodes, to help Ohio soldiers moving back and forth.<ref>Eugene E.

For example, [[Mary Livermore]] (1820\u20131905), the manager of the Chicago branch of the US Sanitary Commission, used her newfound organizational skills to mobilize support for [[women's suffrage]] after the war. She argued that women needed more education and job opportunities to help them fulfill their role of serving others.<ref>Wendy Hamand Venet, \"The Emergence of a Suffragist: Mary Livermore, Civil War activism, and the Moral Power of Women,\" ''Civil War History'', June 2002, Vol. 48 Issue 2, pp 143\u201364 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cwh/summary/v048/48.2venet.html in Project MUSE]</ref>\n\nThe Sanitary Commission collected enormous amounts of statistical data, and opened up the problems of storing information for fast access and mechanically searching for data patterns.<ref>James H.

The Record and Pension Office in 1901 counted 211,000 Northerners who were captured. In 1861\u201363 most were immediately paroled; after the parole exchange system broke down in 1863, about 195,000 went to Confederate prison camps. Some tried to escape but few succeeded. By contrast 464,000 Confederates were captured (many in the final days) and 215,000 imprisoned. Over 30,000 Union and nearly 26,000 Confederate prisoners died in captivity. Just over 12% of the captives in Northern prisons died, compared to 15.5% for Southern prisons.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Ford Rhodes|title=History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850: 1864\u20131866|url=https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst20unkngoog|year=1904|publisher=Harper & Brothers|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst20unkngoog/page/n529 507]\u20138}}</ref><ref>Michael B.

The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation.

Second came much higher tariffs, through several [[Morrill tariff]] laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\n[[File:Demand Legal comparison.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|1862 Greenbacks]]\n\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker [[Jay Cooke]]. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \"First National Bank\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref> Third, the government printed paper money called \"[[United States Note|greenbacks]]\".

Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.<ref>Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref>\n\n====Tariffs====\n\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10&nbsp;points in order to generate more revenues.<ref>Richardson, 100, 113</ref> These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The [[Morrill Tariff]] of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1890520|title = A Political Response to Industrialism: The Republican Embrace of Protectionist Labor Doctrines|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 70|issue = 1|pages = 35\u201357|last1 = Huston|first1 = James L.|year = 1983|doi = 10.2307/1890520}}</ref>\n\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345&nbsp;million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\n\n===Land grants===\n\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\n\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit. In addition the government sponsored fresh information, scientific methods and the latest techniques through the newly established [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] and the Morrill Land Grant College Act.<ref>Harold M.

The sellers were Southern planters who needed the cash, regardless of their patriotism. The Northern buyers could make heavy profits, which annoyed soldiers like Ulysses Grant. He blamed Jewish traders and [[General Order No. 11 (1862)|expelled them from his lines in 1862]] but Lincoln quickly overruled this show of anti-semitism. Critics said the cotton trade helped the South, prolonged the war and fostered corruption. Lincoln decided to continue the trade for fear that Britain might intervene if its textile manufacturers were denied raw material. Another goal was to foster latent Unionism in Southern border states. Northern textile manufacturers needed cotton to remain in business and to make uniforms, while cotton exports to Europe provided an important source of gold to finance the war.<ref>David S.

In general, the pietistic denominations such as the Methodists, Northern Baptists and Congregationalists strongly supported the war effort. Catholics, Episcopalians, Lutherans and conservative Presbyterians generally avoided any discussion of the war, so it would not bitterly divide their membership. The Quakers, while giving strong support to the abolitionist movement on a personal level, refused to take a denominational position.

Frank reports that what it meant to be a father varied with status and age. He says most men demonstrated dual commitments as providers and nurturers and believed that husband and wife had mutual obligations toward their children. The war privileged masculinity, dramatizing and exaggerating, father-son bonds.

Confederates sometimes styled them \"Homemade Yankees\". However, Southern Unionists were not necessarily northern sympathizers and many of them, although opposing secession, supported the Confederacy once it was a fact. East Tennessee never supported the Confederacy, and Unionists there became powerful state leaders, including governors [[Andrew Johnson]] and [[William G. Brownlow]]. Likewise, large pockets of eastern Kentucky were Unionist and helped keep the state from seceding.<ref>Kent Dollar et al. eds.

Roving insurgent bands such as [[Quantrill's Raiders]] and the men of [[Bloody Bill Anderson]] terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread attacks and the protection offered by Confederate sympathizers, Federal leaders issued [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]] in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war.<ref>Sarah Bohl, \"A War on Civilians: Order Number 11 and the Evacuation of Western Missouri,\" ''Prologue'', April 2004, Vol. 36 Issue 1, pp 44\u201351</ref> Families passed along stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations\u2014[[Harry Truman]]'s grandparents were caught up in the raids and he would tell of how they were kept in concentration camps.<ref>Michael R.

In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla [[Jesse James]] was killed in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri|Saint Joseph]]. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the [[Bald Knobbers]] were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks.

Gen. [[Stephen G. Burbridge]] was given command over the state of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with [[martial law]] authorized by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor [[Thomas E.

It premiered on 14 April 2003 on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV1]] in the United Kingdom, followed by its [[Nick Jr. (UK and Ireland)|Nick Jr. UK]] premiere on 30 September 2003.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060304094335/http://www.nickjr.co.uk/shows/boohbah/index.aspx</ref> It aired in the United States on [[PBS Kids]] from January 19, 2004 until January 31, 2010. In Canada it aired on [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]]. The series was produced by [[Ragdoll Productions]].\n\nThe series ran for three seasons, with a total of 104 episodes.\n\n==Characters==\nThe series focuses on the Boohbahs: five plump, fuzzy, furry, gumdrop-shaped creatures played by actors in full-body costumes. Their fur sparkles and shimmers with tiny lights, and they are hairless with big eyes and rows of lights for eyebrows. They do not speak; instead, they make noises such as squeaks, squeals, \"poofs\", and clicks. The Boohbahs can retract their heads into their furry necks. Each Boohbah is a different colour.\n\nA list of the Boohbahs is available below.\n* Humbah, portrayed by Emma Insley, is a yellow Boohbah.\n* Zumbah, portrayed by Alex Poulter, is a purple Boohbah.\n* Zing Zing Zingbah, portrayed by Cal Jaggers, is an orange Boohbah.\n* Jumbah, portrayed by [[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]], is a blue Boohbah.\n* Jingbah, portrayed by Laura Pero, is a pink Boohbah.\n\nThe Boohbahs can fly; part of their routine is to assemble into a circle, holding hands like skydivers. Each then emits a different musical note as a flash of coloured light (matching the Boohbah's colour) is sent out from their heads to a central point.\n\nThe Boohbahs were designed and made by costume and creature designer, Vin Burnham. \n\n===Storypeople===\nThe Storypeople are a diverse group of familial characters who inhabit Storyworld and there participate in various vignettes inspired by the presents (see below).  They are:\n\n* Grandmamma (Linda Kerr-Scott) \u2013 An elderly yet spry Caucasian woman. She has white banana hair and wears a dark pink housedress, pale blue sweater, white socks, and red [[trainers]].\n* Grandpappa ([[Robin Stevens]]) \u2013 An elderly yet spry Caucasian man. He has white hair and a white moustache; he wears a long-sleeved yellow shirt, dark grey slacks, red [[Braces (clothing)|braces]], and white trainers.\n* Mrs. Lady ([[Harvey Virdi]]) \u2013 An Indian woman. She has dark hair and wears a loose light blue blouse, loose bright pink trousers, and pink trainers.\n* Mr. Man (Mark Ramsey) \u2013 An African-American man. He wears a short-sleeved bright pink shirt, white trousers, and black trainers.\n* Brother (Manuel Bravo) and Sister (Vee Vimolmal) \u2013 ''Always'' paired, they both appear to be in their late teens. ''Brother:'' A [[Latin Americans|Latino]] boy with short black hair; he wears a bright blue T-shirt, bright red knee-length shorts, and white trainers with pink laces. ''Sister:'' A [[Thai people|Thai]] girl with hip-length black hair in a long [[ponytail]]; she wears a bright red T-shirt, bright blue [[capri pants]], and white trainers with pink laces.\n* Auntie (Sachi Kimura) \u2013 A Japanese woman. She has short black hair and wears a long-sleeved lavender blouse, black trousers, purple tights, and black shoes.\n* Little Dog Fido (Dash) \u2013 A [[Jack Russell Terrier]]. He wears a red collar.\n\nThe Storypeople do not speak. (When Little Dog Fido appears, he gives an \"arf!\")  Though they sometimes exhibit frustration or confusion, the Storypeople rarely, if ever, appear upset or sad.  The Storyworld segments are narrated by actor [[Chris Langham]]. In each episode the Storypeople magically receive an object sent to them by a child or group of children.\n\n==The Boohzone==\n \nThe main setting of ''Boohbah'' is the Boohzone, which is the Boohbahs' habitat. The Boohzone somewhat examples a multi-coloured dome with bubbles on its walls, and a rainbow streak leading up to the Boohball. In the middle of the Boohzone is a coloured walkway leading to a spot that resembles either a rainbow spiral or a blank circle when the Boohbahs come down to that area to dance. In the introductions to the \"Storyworld\" segments, some children will come into the Boohzone to give a present to the Storypeople, and the Boohball will pick it up and send it to Storyworld.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\n104 episodes were produced, including:{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n# \"Skipping Rope\" (14 April 2003)\n#

CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. \"They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'\" he said. \"In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.
