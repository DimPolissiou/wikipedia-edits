It is now used primarily for weddings, receptions, business gatherings and historical reenactment events.\n\n==History==\nThe house was built in 1899 by [[Alexander Dunsmuir]], son of [[Robert Dunsmuir]], a wealthy coal magnate from [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria, BC]]. Dunsmuir, who came to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1878 to manage the family business, intended the house to be a wedding gift for his new bride but didn't get to live in it with her as he fell ill and died while on his honeymoon in New York. His new bride returned to live in the home but soon died herself in 1901.\n\n[[Isaias W. Hellman|I.W. Hellman Jr.]] purchased the estate in 1906 as a summer home for his family and by 1913 the mansion was remodeled for the larger family's needs as well as to hold their growing acquisitions from European travel.\n\nMrs. Hellman kept the estate well into the 1950s after her husband's death in 1920. During this time additions included the swimming pool and Dinkelspiel House and a good deal of landscape development on the northern end of the estate.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the mansion and lands were purchased by the City of Oakland with the intention of using it as a conference center. When this project didn't work out, a non-profit organization was formed in 1971 to preserve and restore the estate for the public benefit and for many years, the non-profit group and the City jointly operated the estate.\n\nIn June 1989, the non-profit organization took over most of the administrative duties and dubbed the grounds the ''Dunsmuir House and Gardens'' with its primary function to be as an educational, historical, cultural, and horticultural resource.

In addition, the Hellman estate contained a golf course, formal croquet court, tennis court, swimming pool with Mission-style bathhouse, glass conservatory with grotto, an elaborate aviary, formal garden maze, and Japanese garden. Deer, wild turkeys and water fowl also make the estate their home.\n\n==Mansion==\nThe Dunsmuir mansion was designed by the San Francisco architect J. Eugene Freeman and is an example of Neoclassical-Revival architecture which was popular in the late 1800s. The 37-room mansion is 16,224 square feet and features 10 fireplaces, a Tiffany-style dome, wood paneled public rooms and inlaid parquet floors. The servant quarters in the house are designed to accommodate 12 live-in staff.\n\n==Current uses==\nDocents lead tours of the estate grounds and the 37-room Dunsmuir Mansion on Wednesdays and the first Sunday of the month from April \u2013 September (except for July).\n\nThe non-profit organization rents out all or part of the property for various occasions such as weddings, corporate engagements, auctions,<ref>[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=04-27-07&storyID=26918 Berkeley Daily article] announcing St. Paul's Episcopal School's yearly auction</ref> and historic reenactment gatherings.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dunsmuirgames.com/ |title=Dunsmuir Games |access-date=2007-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701085711/http://www.dunsmuirgames.com/ |archive-date=2007-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the estate has also been used as a location or background for several movies and television shows, such as:\n\n* ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[Phantasm (film)|Phantasm]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Partners in Crime (American TV series)|Partners in Crime]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[The Vineyard (film)|The Vineyard]]'' (1989)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/TheVineyard/|title=THE VINEYARD|website=www.filminamerica.com|accessdate=Apr 2, 2020}}</ref>\n* ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Gloria (1999 American film)|Gloria]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[True Crime (1999 film)|True Crime]]'' (1999)\n* ''Case #13'' (2014 film) <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3131050/|title=Delirium|accessdate=Apr 2, 2020|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n* ''[[Delirium (2018 film)|Delirium]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Nash Bridges]]'' (1996)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Dunsmuir House}}\n*[http://www.dunsmuirhellman.com/ Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070419144922/http://www.oaklandnet.com/parks/facilities/points_dunsmuir.asp City of Oakland page]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in California}}\n{{Oakland Attractions}}\n{{coord|37|44|34|N|122|08|28|W|type:landmark_region:US-CA_source:googlemaps|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in California]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Houses in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:History of Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in California]]\n[[Category:Museums in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Greek Revival houses in California]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in California]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1899]]\n[[Category:1899 establishments in California]]\n", "text_old": "{{container}}\n\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Dunsmuir House\n  | nrhp_type =\n  | image = Dunsmuir-house.jpg\n  | caption = \n  | location = [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]]\n  | locmapin            = United States Oakland#California#USA\n  | built = 1899\n  | architect = [[Eugene Freeman]]\n  | architecture = [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical Revival]]\n  | added = May 19, 1972\n  | refnum = 72000214\n  | governing_body = \n}}\n\nThe '''Dunsmuir House and Gardens ''' (also known by the name '''The Dunsmuir-Hellman Historic Estate''' and previously known as '''Oakvale Park''') is located in [[Oakland, California]] on a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} site.

The mansion has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/ca/Alameda/state.html|title=National Register of Historical Places - CALIFORNIA (CA), Alameda County|website=www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com|accessdate=Apr 2, 2020}}</ref> and both the mansion and the Carriage House have been designated Historic Landmarks by the City of Oakland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www77.dunsmuir.org/|title=Dunsmuir.org|website=www77.dunsmuir.org|accessdate=Apr 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Grounds and gardens==\nGolden Gate Park's landscape architect, [[John McLaren (park superintendent)|John McLaren]], is rumored to have assisted the Hellmans in designing the Dunsmuir gardens which includes a wide variety of trees, including Camperdown Elms, Bunya-Bunya and Hornbeam trees. In addition, the Hellman estate contained a golf course, formal croquet court, tennis court, swimming pool with Mission-style bathhouse, glass conservatory with grotto, an elaborate aviary, formal garden maze, and Japanese garden. Deer, wild turkeys and water fowl also make the estate their home.\n\n==Mansion==\nThe Dunsmuir mansion was designed by the San Francisco architect J. Eugene Freeman and is an example of Neoclassical-Revival architecture which was popular in the late 1800s. The 37-room mansion is 16,224 square feet and features 10 fireplaces, a Tiffany-style dome, wood paneled public rooms and inlaid parquet floors. The servant quarters in the house are designed to accommodate 12 live-in staff.\n\n==Current uses==\nDocents lead tours of the estate grounds and the 37-room Dunsmuir Mansion on Wednesdays and the first Sunday of the month from April \u2013 September (except for July).\n\nThe non-profit organization rents out all or part of the property for various occasions such as weddings, corporate engagements, auctions,<ref>[http://www.berkeleydaily.org/text/article.cfm?issue=04-27-07&storyID=26918 Berkeley Daily article] announcing St. Paul's Episcopal School's yearly auction</ref> and historic reenactment gatherings.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dunsmuirgames.com/ |title=Dunsmuir Games |access-date=2007-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701085711/http://www.dunsmuirgames.com/ |archive-date=2007-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, the estate has also been used as a location or background for several movies and television shows, such as:\n\n* ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[Phantasm (film)|Phantasm]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Partners in Crime (American TV series)|Partners in Crime]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[The Vineyard (film)|The Vineyard]]'' (1989)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/TheVineyard/|title=THE VINEYARD|website=www.filminamerica.com|accessdate=Apr 2, 2020}}</ref>\n* ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Gloria (1999 American film)|Gloria]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[True Crime (1999 film)|True Crime]]'' (1999)\n* ''Case #13'' (2014 film) <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3131050/|title=Delirium|accessdate=Apr 2, 2020|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n* ''[[Delirium (2018 film)|Delirium]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Nash Bridges]]'' (1996)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Dunsmuir House}}\n*[http://www.dunsmuirhellman.com/ Official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070419144922/http://www.oaklandnet.com/parks/facilities/points_dunsmuir.asp City of Oakland page]\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in California}}\n{{Oakland Attractions}}\n{{coord|37|44|34|N|122|08|28|W|type:landmark_region:US-CA_source:googlemaps|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in California]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Houses in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:History of Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in California]]\n[[Category:Museums in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Greek Revival houses in California]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in California]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Oakland, California]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1899]]\n[[Category:1899 establishments in California]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunsmuir_House"}

[[Fountain Creek]] passes through the estate and the home is in the shadow of [[Pikes Peak]].\n\nUnder Mrs. Cara Bell's direction, Briarhurst became \"the social center\" of the community,<ref name=\"Harrison p. 26\" /> hosting the internationally famous of the day, President Grant, President Teddy Roosevelt and Oscar Wilde after his lecture in Colorado Springs in 1882. On occasion, a tribe of friendly [[Ute Tribe|Ute]]s camped on the Briarhurst estate grounds while preparing to go into the [[Garden of the Gods]], for them a holy [[place of worship]].\n\nOne winter night in 1886, while Dr. Bell was away on business, Mrs. Bell awoke to a [[bedroom]] filled with [[smoke]]. Burning [[ember]]s escaped from a [[fireplace]] in Briarhurst. She woke the [[children]] and [[servant]]s. Cara stayed in the burning house and with the help of [[gardener]] Schneider, they rescued a prized oil painting by [[Thomas Moran]], the \"Mount of the Holy Cross\". The family escaped safely, but lost all of their belongings and returned to [[England]]. They returned in early 1887 to begin reconstruction of a second, more elaborate Briarhurst Manor, complete with [[school]]room, [[sunroom|conservatory]], [[cloister]] and a [[library]] with a special [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]] to display the \"Mount of the Holy Cross.\"\n\nToday, {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of the original Briarhurst estate is a restaurant and event venue.

Bell House''', is a finely grained pink [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[sandstone]] [[manor house]] listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the city of [[Manitou Springs, Colorado]]. It is the second building on this site.\n\nConstruction of the original Briarhurst began in 1872. [[William Bell (city founder)|Dr. William Bell]], the home's owner, left for England to marry a woman named Cara, who agreed to live with Bell in Colorado as long as her children were born in England.<ref name=\"Harrison p. 26\">{{cite book|author=Deborah Harrison|title=Manitou Springs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VBhvesg_qdwC&pg=PA26|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-2856-4|page=26}}</ref> The [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival style]] home was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973. [[Fountain Creek]] passes through the estate and the home is in the shadow of [[Pikes Peak]].\n\nUnder Mrs. Cara Bell's direction, Briarhurst became \"the social center\" of the community,<ref name=\"Harrison p. 26\" /> hosting the internationally famous of the day, President Grant, President Teddy Roosevelt and Oscar Wilde after his lecture in Colorado Springs in 1882. On occasion, a tribe of friendly [[Ute Tribe|Ute]]s camped on the Briarhurst estate grounds while preparing to go into the [[Garden of the Gods]], for them a holy [[place of worship]].\n\nOne winter night in 1886, while Dr. Bell was away on business, Mrs. Bell awoke to a [[bedroom]] filled with [[smoke]]. Burning [[ember]]s escaped from a [[fireplace]] in Briarhurst. She woke the [[children]] and [[servant]]s. Cara stayed in the burning house and with the help of [[gardener]] Schneider, they rescued a prized oil painting by [[Thomas Moran]], the \"Mount of the Holy Cross\". The family escaped safely, but lost all of their belongings and returned to [[England]]. They returned in early 1887 to begin reconstruction of a second, more elaborate Briarhurst Manor, complete with [[school]]room, [[sunroom|conservatory]], [[cloister]] and a [[library]] with a special [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]] to display the \"Mount of the Holy Cross.\"\n\nToday, {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of the original Briarhurst estate is a restaurant and event venue.  The restaurant seats over 400 guests and features Colorado cuisine. About 2 acres of the old estate is used for a large warehouse building and the Blue Skies Inn Bed and Breakfast utilizing the original 1873 carriage house and 4 other buildings.
