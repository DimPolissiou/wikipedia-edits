Tiwanaku was one of the most significant Andean civilizations. Its influence extended into present-day [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] and lasted from around 550 to 1000 AD. Its capital was the monumental city of [[Tiwanaku]], located at the center of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. This area has clear evidence for large-scale agricultural production on raised fields that probably supported the urban population of the capital. Researchers debate whether these fields were administered by a bureaucratic state (top-down) or through collaboration of a segmented state or federation with local autonomy (bottom-up; see review of debate in Janusek 2004:57-73).<ref name=\"Janusek2004\">{{cite book|title=Identity and Power in the Ancient Andes: Tiwanaku Cities through Time|last=Janusek|first=John|date=2004|isbn=978-0415946346|place=New York|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/identitypowerina0000janu}}</ref> One obsolete theory suggests that Tiwanaku was an expansive military empire, based on comparisons to the later [[Inca Empire]], but supporting evidence is weak.\n\nTiwanaku was a multi-cultural \"hospitality state\"<ref name = \"Bandy 2013\">{{cite book|last=Bandy|first=Matthew|year=2013|title = Visions of Tiwanaku | chapter = Tiwanaku Origins and Early Development: The Political and Moral Economy of a Hospitality State | editor1-last = Vranich | editor1-first = Alexei | editor2-last = Stanish | editor2-first = Charles |place = Los Angeles | publisher = Cotsen Institute of Archaeology | isbn=978-0-917956-09-6 | pages=135\u2013150}}</ref> that brought people together to build large monuments, perhaps as part of large religious festivals. This may have been the central dynamic that attracted people from hundreds of kilometers away, who may have traveled there as part of [[llama]] caravans to trade, make offerings, and honor the gods. Tiwanaku grew into the Andes' most important pilgrimage destination and one of the continent's largest Pre-Columbian cities, reaching a population of 10,000 to 20,000 around AD 800.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/>\n\nOutside of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, there were Tiwanaku colonies on the coast of Peru, where highland people imitated Tiwanaku temples and ceramics, and cemeteries in northern Chile with elaborate grave goods in the Tiwanaku style. Despite the clear connections to these enclaves, there is little evidence that the state controlled the territory or people in between, that is, its territory was not contiguous. With a few important exceptions, the state's influence outside the Lake Titicaca Basin was \"soft power\" that blossomed into a powerful, widespread, and enduring cultural hegemony.\n\n[[File:Plein Tiwanaku.jpg|thumb|right|300px|General view of [[Kalasasaya]] complex]]\n[[File:Puma Punku14.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Ruins of [[Pumapunku]] complex]]\n\n==Rise==\n{{main|Tiwanaku}}\nThe site of Tiwanaku was founded around 110 AD during the Late Formative Period, when there were a number of growing settlements in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. Between 450 and 550 AD, other large settlements were abandoned, leaving Tiwanaku as the pre-eminent center in the region. Beginning around 600 AD its population grew rapidly, probably due to a massive immigration from the surrounding countryside, and large parts of the city were built or remodeled.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/> New and larger carved monoliths were erected, temples were built, and a standardized polychrome pottery style was produced on a massive scale.<ref>{{cite book|last= Stanish|first= Charles|title= Ancient Titicaca: The Evolution of Complex Society in Southern Peru and Northern Bolivia| year= 2003| publisher= University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-23245-7 | page = 166}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Tiwanaku tenon head 20060613 0475.jpg|thumb|1800px|Closeup of a carved stone tenon-head embedded in wall of Tiwanaku's Semi-subterranean (Sunken) Temple]]\n\nTiwanaku's influence, most clearly documented by the presence of its decorated ceramics, expanded into the [[Yungas]] and influenced many other cultures in [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], and northern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. Some statues at Tiwanaku were taken from other regions, where the stones were placed in a subordinate position to the Gods of the Tiwanaku. They displayed the power that their state had over others.<ref name=\"Blom, Deborah E 2004\">Blom, Deborah E. and John W. Janusek. \"Making Place: Humans as Dedications in Tiwanaku\", ''World Archaeology'' (2004): 123\u201341.</ref> Archaeologists have documented Tiwanaku ceramics at a large number of sites in and beyond the Lake Titicaca Basin, attesting to the expansive influence of Tiwanaku symbols and attached messages of power.\n\nThe population grew rapidly between 600 and 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern [[Andes]]. [[William H. Isbell]] states that \"Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population.\"<ref>Isbell, William H. 'Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon'. 731-751.</ref> Early estimates suggested the city covered approximately 6.5 square kilometers at with 15,000 to 30,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Kolata\"/> More recent surveys estimate the site's maximum size between 3.8 and 4.2 square kilometers and a population of 10,000 to 20,000.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/>\n\nIn the rest of the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, hundreds of smaller settlements have been found. Some of the largest and most important were Lukurmata, Qeya Kuntu, Kirawi, Waka Kala, Sonaji, Kala Uyuni, and Khonko Wankane.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/>\n\n===Colonies and diaspora===\nArchaeologists such as Paul Goldstein have showed that the Tiwanaku diaspora expanded outside of the [[altiplano]] area and into the [[Moquegua Valley]] in Peru. After 750 AD, there is growing Tiwanaku presence at the Chen Chen site and the Omo site complex, where a ceremonial center was built. Excavations at Omo settlements show signs of similar architecture characteristic of Tiwanaku, such as a temple and terraced mound.<ref name=\"Goldstein, Paul 1993\">{{cite book |title=Tiwanaku Temples and State Expansion: A Tiwanaku Sunken-Court Temple in Moquegua, Peru |author=Goldstein, Paul |year=1993}}</ref> Evidence of similar types of [[artificial cranial deformation]] in burials between the Omo site and the main site of Tiwanaku is also being used for this argument.<ref>{{cite book |title=Artificial Cranial Deformation at the Omo M10 Site: A Tiwanaku Complex from the Moquegua Valley, Peru | last =Hoshower | first = Lisa M. |year= 1995}}</ref>\n\nTiwanaku established several colonies as far as 300&nbsp;km away. One of the better researched is the colony in Moquegua Valley in Peru, which is 150&nbsp;km from lake Titicaca and flourished between 400 and 1100. This colony was an agricultural and mining center, producing copper and silver.<ref name=\"books.google.lv\">[https://books.google.lv/books?id=pRNuE6gtEJwC&pg=PA1&dq=a+tiwanaku+colony%27s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiU7dON-LbPAhUHBiwKHaA9ApoQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=a%20tiwanaku%20colony%27s&f=false Experience on the Frontier: A Tiwanaku Colony's Shifts Over Time]</ref> Small colonies were also established in Chile's [[Azapa Valley]].\n\n===Agriculture===\nTiwanaku's location between the lake and dry highlands provided key resources of fish, wild birds, plants, and herding grounds for [[camelid]]s, particularly [[llama]]s.<ref name=\"Bruhns\">{{Citation | last = Bruhns | first = K | year = 1994 | title = Ancient South America | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}, 424 pp.</ref> Tiwanaku's economy was based on exploiting the resources of the lake Titicaca, herding of llamas and alpacas and organized farming in raised field systems. Llama meat was consumed and potatoes, quinoa, beans and maize grown. Storage of food was important in the uncertain high altitude climate, so technologies for freeze-dried potatoes and sun-dried meat were developed.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/>\n\nThe Titicaca Basin is the most productive environment in the area, with predictable and abundant rainfall. The Tiwanaku culture developed expanded farming. To the east, the [[Altiplano]] is an area of very dry arid land.<ref name=\"Kolata\"/> The Tiwanaku developed a distinctive farming technique known as \"[[raised field|flooded-raised field]]\" agriculture (''suka qullu''). Such fields were used widely in regional agriculture, together with irrigated fields, pasture, terraced fields and artificial ponds.<ref name=\"Kolata\">{{cite book | title =The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization |last=Kolata| first= Alan L.|authorlink= Alan Kolata | date = December 11, 1993| isbn=978-1-55786-183-2| publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}</ref> Water from [[Katari River|Katari]] and [[Tiwanaku River|Tiwanku]] rivers was used to water raised fields, that covered up to 130 square km.\n\nArtificially raised planting mounds were separated by shallow canals filled with water. The canals supply moisture for growing crops, but they also absorb heat from solar radiation during the day. This heat is gradually emitted during the bitterly cold nights and provided thermal insulation against the endemic frost in the region. Traces of similar landscape management have been found in the [[Llanos de Moxos]] region (Amazonian flood plains of the [[Beni savanna|Moxos]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | last = Kolata | first = Alan L | title = The Agricultural Foundations of the Tiwanaku State: A View from the Heartland | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | year = 1986 | pages = 748\u201362 | doi=10.2307/280863| jstor = 280863 }}.</ref> Over time, the canals also were used to farm edible fish. The resulting canal sludge was dredged for fertilizer.\n\nThough labor-intensive, a ''suka qullu'' produces impressive yields. While traditional agriculture in the region typically yields 2.4 metric tons of potatoes per hectare, and modern agriculture (with artificial fertilizers and pesticides) yields about 14.5 metric tons per hectare, ''suka qullu'' agriculture yields an average of 21 tons per hectare.<ref name=\"Kolata\" /> Modern agricultural researchers have re-introduced the technique of ''suka qullu''. Significantly, the experimental suka qullu fields recreated in the 1980s by [[University of Chicago]]\u00b4s Alan Kolata and Oswaldo Rivera suffered only a 10% decrease in production following a 1988 freeze that killed 70-90% of the rest of the region's production.<ref name=\"Valley of the Spirits\">Kolata, Alan L. ''Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara,'' Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 1996.</ref> Development by the Tiwanaku of this kind of protection against killing frosts in an agrarian civilization was invaluable to their growth.<ref name=\"Valley of the Spirits\"/>\n\nAs the population grew, occupational niches developed, and people began to specialize in certain skills. There was an increase in [[artisan]]s, who worked in pottery, jewelry and textiles. Like the later Incas, the Tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions. Instead, the culture relied on elite redistribution.<ref>Smith, Michael E. (2004), \"The Archaeology of Ancient Economies,\" ''Annu. Rev. Anthrop.'' 33: 73-102.</ref> In this view of Tiwanaku as a bureaucratic state, elites controlled the economic output, but were expected to provide each commoner with all the resources needed to perform his or her function. Selected occupations include agriculturists, herders, [[pastoralism|pastoralists]], etc. Such separation of occupations was accompanied by [[social stratification|hierarchichal stratification]].<ref>Bahn, Paul G. ''Lost Cities''. New York: Welcome Rain, 1999.</ref> The elites gained their status by control of the surplus of food obtained from all regions, which they then redistributed among all the people. Control of [[llama]] herds became very significant to Tiwanaku. The animals were essential for transporting staple and prestige goods.\n\n==Collapse==\nSuddenly around 1000 AD, Tiwanaku ceramics stopped being produced as the state's largest colony (Moquegua) and the urban core of the capital were abandoned within a few decades.<ref name=\"Owen2005\">{{cite journal|last=Owen|first=Bruce|title=Distant Colonies and Explosive Collapse: The Two Stages of the Tiwanaku Diaspora in the Osmore Drainage|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=16|issue=1|pages=45\u201381|doi=10.2307/30042486|jstor=30042486|year=2005}}</ref> The end date for the Tiwanaku state is sometimes extended to 1150 AD, but this only considers raised fields, not urban occupation or ceramic production. One proposed explanation is that a severe drought rendered the raised-field systems ineffective, food surplus dropped, and with it, elite power, leading to state collapse.<ref name=\"Kolata\"/> However, this narrative has been challenged,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Calaway|first=Michael|title=Ice-cores, Sediments and Civilisation Collapse: A Cautionary Tale from Lake Titicaca|journal=Antiquity|volume=79|pages=778\u2013790|date=2005}}</ref> in part because of more refined cultural and climate chronologies, which now suggest that the drought did not start until 1020 or 1040 AD, shortly ''after'' the state's explosive collapse.<ref name=\"Owen2005\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lechleitner|first=Franziska |displayauthors=etal|title=Tropical rainfall over the last two millennia: evidence for a low-latitude hydrologic seesaw|journal=Nature|volume=7|pages=45809|doi=10.1038/srep45809|pmid=28378755|pmc=5381098|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nThis lends greater support to alternative theories of collapse that suggest social dynamics within the Tiwanaku state led to its demise. Some areas of the capital show signs of intentional destruction, though this could have taken place at any time. Monolithic gates, like Gateway of the Sun, were tipped over and broken.<ref name=\"books.google.lv\"/> By the end of Tiwanaku V period the Putuni complex was burned and food storage jars smashed. This indicates an event of destruction, followed by abandonment of the site.

They seem to have worshipped many gods.\n\nThe Gateway of the Sun is a monolithic structure of regular, non-monumental size. Its dimensions suggest that other regularly sized buildings existed at the site. It was found at [[Kalasasaya]], but due to the similarity of other gateways found at [[Pumapunku]], it is thought to have been originally part of a series of doorways there.<ref name=\"Kolata\" /> It is recognized for its singular, great frieze. This is thought to represent a main deity figure surrounded by either calendar signs or natural forces for agricultural worship. Along with Viracocha, another statue is in the Gateway of the Sun. This statue is believed to be associated with the weather: \n{{Quote | a celestial high god that personified various elements of natural forces intimately associated the productive potential of altiplano ecology: the sun, wind, rain, hail \u2013 in brief, a personification of atmospherics that most directly affect agricultural production in either a positive or negative manner<ref name=\"Kolata\" />}} It has twelve faces covered by a solar mask, and at the base thirty running or kneeling figures.<ref name = \"Kolata\" /> Some scientists believe that this statue is a representation of the calendar with twelve months and thirty days in each month.<ref name=\"Kolata\" />\n\nOther evidence points to a system of ancestor worship at Tiwanaku. The preservation, use, and reconfiguration of mummy bundles and skeletal remains, as with the later Inca, may suggest that this is the case.<ref name=\"Kolata\" />  Later cultures within the area made use of large \"above ground burial chambers for the social elite... known as \"[[chullpas]]\".<ref name=\"Kolata\"/> Similar, though smaller, structures were found within the site of Tiwanaku.<ref name=\"Kolata\" />\n\nKolata suggests that, like the later Inca, the inhabitants of Tiwanaku may have practiced similar rituals and rites in relation to the dead. The Akapana East Building has evidence of ancestor burial. The human remains at Akapana East seem to be less for show and more for proper burial. The skeletons show many cut marks that were most likely made by defleshing or excarnation after death. The remains were then bundled up and buried rather than left out in the open.<ref name=\"Blom, Deborah E 2004\" />\n\nThe Tiwanaku conducted human sacrifices on top of a building known as the Akapana. People were disemboweled and torn apart shortly after death and laid out for all to see. It is speculated that this ritual was a form of dedication to the gods. The type of human sacrifice included victims being hacked in pieces, dismembered, exposed to the elements and carnivores before being deposed in trash.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Research showed that one man who was sacrificed was not a native to the Titicaca Basin, leaving room to think that sacrifices were most likely of people originally from other societies.<ref name = \"Kolata\"/>\n\n== Architecture and art ==\n[[File:Tiwanaku1.jpg|thumb|Ponce stela in the sunken courtyard of the Tiwanaku's Kalasasaya temple]]\n\n=== Architecture and sculpture ===\nTiwanaku monumental architecture is characterized by large stones of exceptional workmanship. In contrast to the masonry style of the later [[Inca]], Tiwanaku stone architecture usually employs rectangular [[ashlar]] blocks laid in regular courses. Their monumental structures were frequently fitted with elaborate drainage systems. The drainage systems of the [[Akapana]] and [[Pumapunku]] structures include conduits composed of red sandstone blocks held together by ternary (copper/arsenic/nickel) bronze architectural cramps. The <code>I</code>-shaped architectural cramps of the Akapana were created by cold hammering of ingots. In contrast, the cramps of the Pumapunku were created by pouring molten metal into <code>I</code>-shaped sockets.<ref name=\"LechtmanOther2005\">Lechtman, Heather N., MacFarlane, and Andrew W., 2005, \"''La metalurgia del bronce en los Andes Sur Centrales: Tiwanaku y San Pedro de Atacama''\". ''Estudios Atacame\u00f1os'', vol. 30, pp. 7-27.</ref> The blocks have flat faces that do not need to be fitted upon placement because the grooves make it possible for the blocks to be shifted by ropes into place. The main architectural appeal of the site comes from the carved images and designs on some of these blocks, carved doorways, and giant stone monoliths.<ref name=\"Isbell2004a\">Isbell, W.

They are often holding ritual objects, such as the Ponce Stela or the Bennett Monolith. Some have been found holding severed heads, such as the figure on the Akapana, who possibly represents a puma-shaman. These images suggest the culture practiced ritual human beheading. As additional evidence, headless skeletons have been found under the Akapana.\n[[File:Precolumbian Statue.jpg|thumb|Anthropomorphic receptacle]]\n\n=== Other arts ===\nThe people of Tiwanaku also made ceramics and textiles, composed of bright colors and stepped patterns. Common textile forms included tapestries and tunics. An important ceramic artifact is the ''[[qiru]]'', a drinking cup that was ritually smashed after ceremonies and placed with other goods in burials. Over time, the style of ceramics changed. The earliest ceramics were \"coarsely polished, deeply incised brownware and a burnished [[polychrome]] incised ware\". Later the Qeya style became popular during the Tiwanaku III phase, \"Typified by vessels of a soft, light brown ceramic paste\". These ceramics included [[libation]] bowls and bulbous-bottom vases.<ref>Bray, Tamara L. ''The Archaeology and Politics of Food and Feasting in Early States and Empires,'' New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2003</ref> The [[Staff God]] was a common motif in Tiwanaku art.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=Art of the Andes: from Chavin to Inca|author=Stone-Miller, Rebecca|year=2002|origyear=1995}}</ref>\n\nThe effigy objects typically depicted herders, trophy heads, sacrificial victims, and felines, such as [[Puma (genus)|puma]] and [[jaguar]]s. Such small, portable objects of ritual religious meaning were a key to spreading religion and influence from the main site to the satellite centers. They were created in wood, engraved bone, and cloth and included incense burners, carved wooden hallucinogenic snuff tablets, and human portrait vessels.<ref name=\":0\" /> Like those of the [[Moche culture|Moche]], Tiwanaku portraits expressed individual characteristics.<ref>{{cite book|title=Textiles and Ethnicity: Tiwanaku in San Pedro de Atacama|author=Rodman, Amy Oakland|year=1992}}</ref> One of the best collections of Tiwanaku human effigy vessels was found on the island of Pariti, a [[pilgrimage]] center in Lake Titicaca. These vessels bear individualistic human likenesses and reveal much information about Tiwanaku clothing and jewellery styles. [[Radiocarbon dating]] revealed that they were interred in the ground between 900 and 1050 AD, so they were probably broken as part of a ritual abandonment of the island's temple by local elites and pilgrims during the collapse of the Tiwanaku state.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pariti: The Ceremonial Tiwanaku Pottery of an Island in Lake Titicaca|last=Korpisaari|first=Antti|last2=P\u00e4rssinen|first2=Martti|publisher=Finnish Academy of Science and Letters|year=2011|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Lukurmata ==\nLukurmata, located in the Katari valley was the second great city of the Tiwanaku state. Between 600 and 800 it expanded from 20 hectares to 120 hectares.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> First established nearly two thousand years ago, it grew to be a major ceremonial center in the Tiwanaku state, a polity that dominated the south-central Andes from 400 to 1200. After the Tiwanaku state collapsed, Lukurmata rapidly declined, becoming once again a small village. The site shows evidence of extensive occupation that antedates the Tiwanakan civilization.\n\n==Relationship with Wari==\nThe Tiwanaku shared domination of the Middle Horizon with the [[Wari culture]] (based primarily in central and south Peru) although found to have built important sites in the north as well (Cerro Papato ruins). Their culture rose and fell around the same time; it was centered 500 miles north in the southern highlands of Peru. The relationship between the two polities is unknown. Definite interaction between the two is proved by their shared iconography in art. Significant elements of both of these styles (the split eye, trophy heads, and staff-bearing profile figures, for example) seem to have been derived from that of the earlier [[Pukara, Puno#Pukara culture|Pukara culture]] in the northern Titicaca Basin.\n\nThe Tiwanaku created a powerful ideology, using previous Andean icons that were widespread throughout their sphere of influence. They used extensive trade routes and shamanistic art.

Tiwanaku was one of the most significant Andean civilizations. Its influence extended into present-day [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] and lasted from around 550 to 1000 AD. Its capital was the monumental city of [[Tiwanaku]], located at the center of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. This area has clear evidence for large-scale agricultural production on raised fields that probably supported the urban population of the capital. Researchers debate whether these fields were administered by a bureaucratic state (top-down) or through collaboration of a segmented state or federation with local autonomy (bottom-up; see review of debate in Janusek 2004:57-73).<ref name=\"Janusek2004\">{{cite book|title=Identity and Power in the Ancient Andes: Tiwanaku Cities through Time|last=Janusek|first=John|date=2004|isbn=978-0415946346|place=New York|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/identitypowerina0000janu}}</ref> One obsolete theory suggests that Tiwanaku was an expansive military empire, based on comparisons to the later [[Inca Empire]], but supporting evidence is weak.\n\nTiwanaku was a multi-cultural \"hospitality state\"<ref name = \"Bandy 2013\">{{cite book|last=Bandy|first=Matthew|year=2013|title = Visions of Tiwanaku | chapter = Tiwanaku Origins and Early Development: The Political and Moral Economy of a Hospitality State | editor1-last = Vranich | editor1-first = Alexei | editor2-last = Stanish | editor2-first = Charles |place = Los Angeles | publisher = Cotsen Institute of Archaeology | isbn=978-0-917956-09-6 | pages=135\u2013150}}</ref> that brought people together to build large monuments, perhaps as part of large religious festivals. This may have been the central dynamic that attracted people from hundreds of kilometers away, who may have traveled there as part of [[llama]] caravans to trade, make offerings, and honor the gods. Tiwanaku grew into the Andes' most important pilgrimage destination and one of the continent's largest Pre-Columbian cities, reaching a population of 10,000 to 20,000 around AD 800.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/>\n\nOutside of the state's core area in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, there were Tiwanaku colonies on the coast of Peru, where highland people imitated Tiwanaku temples and ceramics, and cemeteries in northern Chile with elaborate grave goods in the Tiwanaku style. Despite the clear connections to these enclaves, there is little evidence that the state controlled the territory or people in between, that is, its territory was not contiguous. With a few important exceptions, the state's influence outside the Lake Titicaca Basin was \"soft power\" that blossomed into a powerful, widespread, and enduring cultural hegemony.\n\n[[File:Plein Tiwanaku.jpg|thumb|right|300px|General view of [[Kalasasaya]] complex]]\n[[File:Puma Punku14.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Ruins of [[Pumapunku]] complex]]\n\n==Rise==\n{{main|Tiwanaku}}\nThe site of Tiwanaku was founded around 110 AD during the Late Formative Period, when there were a number of growing settlements in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. Between 450 and 550 AD, other large settlements were abandoned, leaving Tiwanaku as the pre-eminent center in the region. Beginning around 600 AD its population grew rapidly, probably due to a massive immigration from the surrounding countryside, and large parts of the city were built or remodeled.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/> New and larger carved monoliths were erected, temples were built, and a standardized polychrome pottery style was produced on a massive scale.<ref>{{cite book|last= Stanish|first= Charles|title= Ancient Titicaca: The Evolution of Complex Society in Southern Peru and Northern Bolivia| year= 2003| publisher= University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-23245-7 | page = 166}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Tiwanaku tenon head 20060613 0475.jpg|thumb|1800px|Closeup of a carved stone tenon-head embedded in wall of Tiwanaku's Semi-subterranean (Sunken) Temple]]\n\nTiwanaku's influence, most clearly documented by the presence of its decorated ceramics, expanded into the [[Yungas]] and influenced many other cultures in [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], and northern [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]]. Some statues at Tiwanaku were taken from other regions, where the stones were placed in a subordinate position to the Gods of the Tiwanaku. They displayed the power that their state had over others.<ref name=\"Blom, Deborah E 2004\">Blom, Deborah E. and John W. Janusek. \"Making Place: Humans as Dedications in Tiwanaku\", ''World Archaeology'' (2004): 123\u201341.</ref> Archaeologists have documented Tiwanaku ceramics at a large number of sites in and beyond the Lake Titicaca Basin, attesting to the expansive influence of Tiwanaku symbols and attached messages of power.\n\nThe population grew rapidly between 600 and 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern [[Andes]]. [[William H. Isbell]] states that \"Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population.\"<ref>Isbell, William H. 'Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon'. 731-751.</ref> Early estimates suggested the city covered approximately 6.5 square kilometers at with 15,000 to 30,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Kolata\"/> More recent surveys estimate the site's maximum size between 3.8 and 4.2 square kilometers and a population of 10,000 to 20,000.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/>\n\nIn the rest of the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, hundreds of smaller settlements have been found. Some of the largest and most important were Lukurmata, Qeya Kuntu, Kirawi, Waka Kala, Sonaji, Kala Uyuni, and Khonko Wankane.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/>\n\n===Colonies and diaspora===\nArchaeologists such as Paul Goldstein have showed that the Tiwanaku diaspora expanded outside of the [[altiplano]] area and into the [[Moquegua Valley]] in Peru. After 750 AD, there is growing Tiwanaku presence at the Chen Chen site and the Omo site complex, where a ceremonial center was built. Excavations at Omo settlements show signs of similar architecture characteristic of Tiwanaku, such as a temple and terraced mound.<ref name=\"Goldstein, Paul 1993\">{{cite book |title=Tiwanaku Temples and State Expansion: A Tiwanaku Sunken-Court Temple in Moquegua, Peru |author=Goldstein, Paul |year=1993}}</ref> Evidence of similar types of [[artificial cranial deformation]] in burials between the Omo site and the main site of Tiwanaku is also being used for this argument.<ref>{{cite book |title=Artificial Cranial Deformation at the Omo M10 Site: A Tiwanaku Complex from the Moquegua Valley, Peru | last =Hoshower | first = Lisa M. |year= 1995}}</ref>\n\nTiwanaku established several colonies as far as 300&nbsp;km away. One of the better researched is the colony in Moquegua Valley in Peru, which is 150&nbsp;km from lake Titicaca and flourished between 400 and 1100. This colony was an agricultural and mining center, producing copper and silver.<ref name=\"books.google.lv\">[https://books.google.lv/books?id=pRNuE6gtEJwC&pg=PA1&dq=a+tiwanaku+colony%27s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiU7dON-LbPAhUHBiwKHaA9ApoQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=a%20tiwanaku%20colony%27s&f=false Experience on the Frontier: A Tiwanaku Colony's Shifts Over Time]</ref> Small colonies were also established in Chile's [[Azapa Valley]].\n\n===Agriculture===\nTiwanaku's location between the lake and dry highlands provided key resources of fish, wild birds, plants, and herding grounds for [[camelid]]s, particularly [[llama]]s.<ref name=\"Bruhns\">{{Citation | last = Bruhns | first = K | year = 1994 | title = Ancient South America | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}, 424 pp.</ref> Tiwanaku's economy was based on exploiting the resources of the lake Titicaca, herding of llamas and alpacas and organized farming in raised field systems. Llama meat was consumed and potatoes, quinoa, beans and maize grown. Storage of food was important in the uncertain high altitude climate, so technologies for freeze-dried potatoes and sun-dried meat were developed.<ref name=\"Janusek2004\"/>\n\nThe Titicaca Basin is the most productive environment in the area, with predictable and abundant rainfall. The Tiwanaku culture developed expanded farming. To the east, the [[Altiplano]] is an area of very dry arid land.<ref name=\"Kolata\"/> The Tiwanaku developed a distinctive farming technique known as \"[[raised field|flooded-raised field]]\" agriculture (''suka qullu''). Such fields were used widely in regional agriculture, together with irrigated fields, pasture, terraced fields and artificial ponds.<ref name=\"Kolata\">{{cite book | title =The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization |last=Kolata| first= Alan L.|authorlink= Alan Kolata | date = December 11, 1993| isbn=978-1-55786-183-2| publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]}}</ref> Water from [[Katari River|Katari]] and [[Tiwanaku River|Tiwanku]] rivers was used to water raised fields, that covered up to 130 square km.\n\nArtificially raised planting mounds were separated by shallow canals filled with water. The canals supply moisture for growing crops, but they also absorb heat from solar radiation during the day. This heat is gradually emitted during the bitterly cold nights and provided thermal insulation against the endemic frost in the region. Traces of similar landscape management have been found in the [[Llanos de Moxos]] region (Amazonian flood plains of the [[Beni savanna|Moxos]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Citation | last = Kolata | first = Alan L | title = The Agricultural Foundations of the Tiwanaku State: A View from the Heartland | journal = American Antiquity | volume = 51 | issue = 4 | year = 1986 | pages = 748\u201362 | doi=10.2307/280863| jstor = 280863 }}.</ref> Over time, the canals also were used to farm edible fish. The resulting canal sludge was dredged for fertilizer.\n\nThough labor-intensive, a ''suka qullu'' produces impressive yields. While traditional agriculture in the region typically yields 2.4 metric tons of potatoes per hectare, and modern agriculture (with artificial fertilizers and pesticides) yields about 14.5 metric tons per hectare, ''suka qullu'' agriculture yields an average of 21 tons per hectare.<ref name=\"Kolata\" /> Modern agricultural researchers have re-introduced the technique of ''suka qullu''. Significantly, the experimental suka qullu fields recreated in the 1980s by [[University of Chicago]]\u00b4s Alan Kolata and Oswaldo Rivera suffered only a 10% decrease in production following a 1988 freeze that killed 70-90% of the rest of the region's production.<ref name=\"Valley of the Spirits\">Kolata, Alan L. ''Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara,'' Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, 1996.</ref> Development by the Tiwanaku of this kind of protection against killing frosts in an agrarian civilization was invaluable to their growth.<ref name=\"Valley of the Spirits\"/>\n\nAs the population grew, occupational niches developed, and people began to specialize in certain skills. There was an increase in [[artisan]]s, who worked in pottery, jewelry and textiles. Like the later Incas, the Tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions. Instead, the culture relied on elite redistribution.<ref>Smith, Michael E. (2004), \"The Archaeology of Ancient Economies,\" ''Annu. Rev. Anthrop.'' 33: 73-102.</ref> In this view of Tiwanaku as a bureaucratic state, elites controlled the economic output, but were expected to provide each commoner with all the resources needed to perform his or her function. Selected occupations include agriculturists, herders, [[pastoralism|pastoralists]], etc. Such separation of occupations was accompanied by [[social stratification|hierarchichal stratification]].<ref>Bahn, Paul G. ''Lost Cities''. New York: Welcome Rain, 1999.</ref> The elites gained their status by control of the surplus of food obtained from all regions, which they then redistributed among all the people. Control of [[llama]] herds became very significant to Tiwanaku. The animals were essential for transporting staple and prestige goods.\n\n==Collapse==\nSuddenly around 1000 AD, Tiwanaku ceramics stopped being produced as the state's largest colony (Moquegua) and the urban core of the capital were abandoned within a few decades.<ref name=\"Owen2005\">{{cite journal|last=Owen|first=Bruce|title=Distant Colonies and Explosive Collapse: The Two Stages of the Tiwanaku Diaspora in the Osmore Drainage|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=16|issue=1|pages=45\u201381|doi=10.2307/30042486|jstor=30042486|year=2005}}</ref> The end date for the Tiwanaku state is sometimes extended to 1150 AD, but this only considers raised fields, not urban occupation or ceramic production. One proposed explanation is that a severe drought rendered the raised-field systems ineffective, food surplus dropped, and with it, elite power, leading to state collapse.<ref name=\"Kolata\"/> However, this narrative has been challenged,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Calaway|first=Michael|title=Ice-cores, Sediments and Civilisation Collapse: A Cautionary Tale from Lake Titicaca|journal=Antiquity|volume=79|pages=778\u2013790|date=2005}}</ref> in part because of more refined cultural and climate chronologies, which now suggest that the drought did not start until 1020 or 1040 AD, shortly ''after'' the state's explosive collapse.<ref name=\"Owen2005\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Lechleitner|first=Franziska |displayauthors=etal|title=Tropical rainfall over the last two millennia: evidence for a low-latitude hydrologic seesaw|journal=Nature|volume=7|pages=45809|doi=10.1038/srep45809|pmid=28378755|pmc=5381098|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nThis lends greater support to alternative theories of collapse that suggest social dynamics within the Tiwanaku state led to its demise. Some areas of the capital show signs of intentional destruction, though this could have taken place at any time. Monolithic gates, like Gateway of the Sun, were tipped over and broken.<ref name=\"books.google.lv\"/> By the end of Tiwanaku V period the Putuni complex was burned and food storage jars smashed. This indicates an event of destruction, followed by abandonment of the site.

They seem to have worshipped many gods.\n\nThe Gateway of the Sun is a monolithic structure of regular, non-monumental size. Its dimensions suggest that other regularly sized buildings existed at the site. It was found at [[Kalasasaya]], but due to the similarity of other gateways found at [[Pumapunku]], it is thought to have been originally part of a series of doorways there.<ref name=\"Kolata\" /> It is recognized for its singular, great frieze. This is thought to represent a main deity figure surrounded by either calendar signs or natural forces for agricultural worship. Along with Viracocha, another statue is in the Gateway of the Sun. This statue is believed to be associated with the weather: \n{{Quote | a celestial high god that personified various elements of natural forces intimately associated the productive potential of altiplano ecology: the sun, wind, rain, hail \u2013 in brief, a personification of atmospherics that most directly affect agricultural production in either a positive or negative manner<ref name=\"Kolata\" />}} It has twelve faces covered by a solar mask, and at the base thirty running or kneeling figures.<ref name = \"Kolata\" /> Some scientists believe that this statue is a representation of the calendar with twelve months and thirty days in each month.<ref name=\"Kolata\" />\n\nOther evidence points to a system of ancestor worship at Tiwanaku. The preservation, use, and reconfiguration of mummy bundles and skeletal remains, as with the later Inca, may suggest that this is the case.<ref name=\"Kolata\" />  Later cultures within the area made use of large \"above ground burial chambers for the social elite... known as \"[[chullpas]]\".<ref name=\"Kolata\"/> Similar, though smaller, structures were found within the site of Tiwanaku.<ref name=\"Kolata\" />\n\nKolata suggests that, like the later Inca, the inhabitants of Tiwanaku may have practiced similar rituals and rites in relation to the dead. The Akapana East Building has evidence of ancestor burial. The human remains at Akapana East seem to be less for show and more for proper burial. The skeletons show many cut marks that were most likely made by defleshing or excarnation after death. The remains were then bundled up and buried rather than left out in the open.<ref name=\"Blom, Deborah E 2004\" />\n\nThe Tiwanaku conducted human sacrifices on top of a building known as the Akapana. People were disemboweled and torn apart shortly after death and laid out for all to see. It is speculated that this ritual was a form of dedication to the gods. The type of human sacrifice included victims being hacked in pieces, dismembered, exposed to the elements and carnivores before being deposed in trash.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Research showed that one man who was sacrificed was not a native to the Titicaca Basin, leaving room to think that sacrifices were most likely of people originally from other societies.<ref name = \"Kolata\"/>\n\n== Architecture and art ==\n[[File:Tiwanaku1.jpg|thumb|Ponce stela in the sunken courtyard of the Tiwanaku's Kalasasaya temple]]\n\n=== Architecture and sculpture ===\nTiwanaku monumental architecture is characterized by large stones of exceptional workmanship. In contrast to the masonry style of the later [[Inca]], Tiwanaku stone architecture usually employs rectangular [[ashlar]] blocks laid in regular courses. Their monumental structures were frequently fitted with elaborate drainage systems. The drainage systems of the [[Akapana]] and [[Pumapunku]] structures include conduits composed of red sandstone blocks held together by ternary (copper/arsenic/nickel) bronze architectural cramps. The <code>I</code>-shaped architectural cramps of the Akapana were created by cold hammering of ingots. In contrast, the cramps of the Pumapunku were created by pouring molten metal into <code>I</code>-shaped sockets.<ref name=\"LechtmanOther2005\">Lechtman, Heather N., MacFarlane, and Andrew W., 2005, \"''La metalurgia del bronce en los Andes Sur Centrales: Tiwanaku y San Pedro de Atacama''\".

They are often holding ritual objects, such as the Ponce Stela or the Bennett Monolith. Some have been found holding severed heads, such as the figure on the Akapana, who possibly represents a puma-shaman. These images suggest the culture practiced ritual human beheading. As additional evidence, headless skeletons have been found under the Akapana.\n[[File:Precolumbian Statue.jpg|thumb|Anthropomorphic receptacle]]\n\n=== Other arts ===\nThe people of Tiwanaku also made ceramics and textiles, composed of bright colors and stepped patterns. Common textile forms included tapestries and tunics. An important ceramic artifact is the ''[[qiru]]'', a drinking cup that was ritually smashed after ceremonies and placed with other goods in burials. Over time, the style of ceramics changed. The earliest ceramics were \"coarsely polished, deeply incised brownware and a burnished [[polychrome]] incised ware\". Later the Qeya style became popular during the Tiwanaku III phase, \"Typified by vessels of a soft, light brown ceramic paste\". These ceramics included [[libation]] bowls and bulbous-bottom vases.<ref>Bray, Tamara L.

Such small, portable objects of ritual religious meaning were a key to spreading religion and influence from the main site to the satellite centers. They were created in wood, engraved bone, and cloth and included incense burners, carved wooden hallucinogenic snuff tablets, and human portrait vessels.<ref name=\":0\" /> Like those of the [[Moche culture|Moche]], Tiwanaku portraits expressed individual characteristics.<ref>{{cite book|title=Textiles and Ethnicity: Tiwanaku in San Pedro de Atacama|author=Rodman, Amy Oakland|year=1992}}</ref> One of the best collections of Tiwanaku human effigy vessels was found on the island of Pariti, a [[pilgrimage]] center in Lake Titicaca. These vessels bear individualistic human likenesses and reveal much information about Tiwanaku clothing and jewellery styles. [[Radiocarbon dating]] revealed that they were interred in the ground between 900 and 1050 AD, so they were probably broken as part of a ritual abandonment of the island's temple by local elites and pilgrims during the collapse of the Tiwanaku state.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pariti: The Ceremonial Tiwanaku Pottery of an Island in Lake Titicaca|last=Korpisaari|first=Antti|last2=P\u00e4rssinen|first2=Martti|publisher=Finnish Academy of Science and Letters|year=2011|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Lukurmata ==\nLukurmata, located in the Katari valley was the second great city of the Tiwanaku state. Between 600 and 800 it expanded from 20 hectares to 120 hectares.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> First established nearly two thousand years ago, it grew to be a major ceremonial center in the Tiwanaku state, a polity that dominated the south-central Andes from 400 to 1200. After the Tiwanaku state collapsed, Lukurmata rapidly declined, becoming once again a small village. The site shows evidence of extensive occupation that antedates the Tiwanakan civilization.\n\n==Relationship with Wari==\nThe Tiwanaku shared domination of the Middle Horizon with the [[Wari culture]] (based primarily in central and south Peru) although found to have built important sites in the north as well (Cerro Papato ruins). Their culture rose and fell around the same time; it was centered 500 miles north in the southern highlands of Peru. The relationship between the two polities is unknown. Definite interaction between the two is proved by their shared iconography in art. Significant elements of both of these styles (the split eye, trophy heads, and staff-bearing profile figures, for example) seem to have been derived from that of the earlier [[Pukara, Puno#Pukara culture|Pukara culture]] in the northern Titicaca Basin.\n\nThe Tiwanaku created a powerful ideology, using previous Andean icons that were widespread throughout their sphere of influence. They used extensive trade routes and shamanistic art. Tiwanaku art consisted of legible, outlined figures depicted in curvilinear style with a naturalistic manner, while Wari art used the same symbols in a more abstract, rectilinear style with a militaristic style.<ref>{{cite book |title=Art of the Andes: from Chavin to Inca |author=Stone-Miller, Rebecca |origyear=1995|year=2002}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |32em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bermann, Marc ''Lukurmata'' Princeton University Press (1994) {{ISBN|978-0-691-03359-4}}.\n* Bruhns, Karen Olsen, ''Ancient South America'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, c. 1994.\n* Goldstein, Paul, \"Tiwanaku Temples and State Expansion: A Tiwanaku Sunken-Court Temple in Moduegua, Peru\", ''Latin American Antiquity'', Vol. 4, No. 1 (March 1993), pp.&nbsp;22\u201347, Society for American Archaeology.\n* Hoshower, Lisa M., [[Jane E.

Better known as the '''Indy 500''' or the '''Indianapolis 500''', it is held annually at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] (IMS) in [[Speedway, Indiana]], United States, an [[enclave]] [[suburb]] of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. The event is held over [[Memorial Day]] weekend in late May. It is contested as part of the [[IndyCar Series]], the top level of [[American Championship Car Racing|American Championship Car]] racing, an [[open wheel car|open-wheel open-cockpit]] [[formula racing|formula]] colloquially known as \"Indy Car Racing\". The name of the race is often shortened to '''Indy 500''', and the track itself is nicknamed the \"Brickyard\", as the racing surfacing was paved in [[brick]] in the fall of 1909, with a yard of brick remaining exposed at the start/finish line.\n\nThe event billed as ''The Greatest Spectacle in Racing'' is considered part of the [[Triple Crown of Motorsport]], which comprises three of the most prestigious motorsports events in the world, also including the [[Monaco Grand Prix]] and the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent [[seating capacity]] is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/stadium_list/100000.shtml|title=World Stadiums - Stadium List :: 100 000+ Stadiums|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> It shares its date with [[NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR]]'s [[Coca-Cola 600|600-mile]] event at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]], with drivers having completed both events in one day before in a so-called [[Double Duty]].\n\nThe inaugural race was held in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]] and was won by [[Ray Harroun]]. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in [[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]], and the 100th running was held in [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]]. The event was put on hiatus twice, from 1917 to 1918 due to [[World War I]] and from 1942 to 1945 due to [[World War II]]. [[Simon Pagenaud]] is the current champion. The most successful drivers are [[A. J. Foyt]], [[Al Unser|Al Unser Sr.]], and [[Rick Mears]], each of whom have [[List of Indianapolis 500 winners|won the race]] four times. The active driver with the most victories is [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], with three. [[Rick Mears]] holds the record for most career [[List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters|pole positions]] with six. The most successful car owner is [[Roger Penske]], owner of [[Team Penske]], which has 18 total wins and 18 poles. Penske also has five wins at the [[IndyCar Grand Prix]], held on the [[Oval track racing#Combined road course|combined road course]].\n\nThe event is steeped in [[Indianapolis 500 traditions|tradition]], in pre-race ceremonies, post-race celebrations, and race procedure. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the 33-car field lining up three-wide for the start, the annual singing of \"[[Back Home Again in Indiana]],\" and the victory lane bottle of milk. Also unique is that qualifying requires the driver to complete four, rather than one, timed laps and qualifying itself has a separate weekend.\n\n==Race specifics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Indianapolis-motor-speedway-1848561.jpg|thumb|The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]\nThe Indianapolis 500 is held annually at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], a {{convert|2.5|mi|0|adj=mid}} [[Oval track racing|oval circuit]]. The track is a rounded-rectangle, with four distinct turns of identical dimensions, connected by four straightaways (two long straightaways and two \"short chutes\"). Drivers race 200 laps, counter-clockwise around the circuit, for a distance of {{convert|500|mi}}. Since its inception in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]], the race has always been scheduled on or around [[Memorial Day]]. Since [[1974 Indianapolis 500|1974]], the race has been specifically scheduled for the Sunday of [[Memorial Day]] weekend. The Sunday of Memorial Day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar, as it is the day of the Indianapolis 500, [[Coca-Cola 600]], and (currently) the [[Monaco Grand Prix]]. Practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race, while miscellaneous preliminary testing is held as early as April.\n\n[[Indianapolis 500 traditions|Traditionally]], the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. The event is contested by [[American Championship car racing|\"Indy cars\"]], a [[Formula racing|formula]] of [[Professional sports|professional]]-level, single-seat, open [[cockpit]], [[Open-wheel car|open-wheel]], purpose-built race cars. As of [[2018 IndyCar Series season|2018]], all entrants utilize 2.2&nbsp;[[Litre|L]] [[V6 engine|V6]], twin-[[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] engines, tuned to produce a range of {{convert|550|-|700|hp}}. [[Chevrolet]] and [[Honda Performance Development|Honda]] are the current engine manufacturers involved in the sport. [[Dallara]] is at present the sole chassis supplier to the series. [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], which has a deep history in the sport, dating back to the first 500, is currently the exclusive tire provider.\n\nThe race is the most prestigious event of the [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] calendar, and one of the oldest and [[Triple Crown of Motorsport|most important]] automobile races. It has been avouched to be the largest single-day sporting event in the entire world. Likewise, the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] itself is regarded as the world's [[List of sports venues by capacity|largest sporting facility]] in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]13 million in [[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]], with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports.\n\nSimilar to [[NASCAR]]'s [[Daytona 500]], the Indianapolis 500 is typically held early in the [[IndyCar Series]] season. That is unique to most sports where major events are usually at the end of the respective season. Currently, the Indy 500 is the sixth event of the 17-race IndyCar schedule. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season, and as late as the 1950s, it was sometimes the first championship event of the year. Due to the high prestige of the Indianapolis 500\u2014rivaling or even surpassing the season championship\u2014it is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to focus heavily on preparing for that race during the early part of the season, and not focus fully on the championship battle until after Indy.\n\nDue to safety issues such as [[aquaplaning]], the race is not held in wet conditions. In the event of a [[Rainout (sports)|rain delay]], the race will be postponed until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race, officials can end the race and declare the results official if more than half of the scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed. The Indianapolis 500, as well as other IndyCar Series races, does not utilize the [[green\u2013white\u2013checker finish]] in case of a late-race yellow. The race can be (and in the past has been) finished under caution. However, officials may call for a late-race red flag to ensure a green-flag finish, an option that was used in [[2014 Indianapolis 500|2014]] and [[2019 Indianapolis 500|2019]]. The circuit lacks lights, therefore lateness can become a factor in the cases of lengthy delays.\n\n====Field====\nThe traditional 33-car starting field at Indianapolis is larger than the fields at the other IndyCar races. The field at Indy typically consists of all of the full-time IndyCar Series entries (roughly 20\u201322 cars), along with 10\u201315 part-time or \"Indy-only\" entries. The \"Indy-only\" entries, also known as \"One-Offs\",  may be an extra car added to an existing full-time team, or a part-time team altogether that does not enter any of the other races, or enters only a few selected races. The \"Indy-only\" drivers may come from a wide range of pedigrees but are usually experienced Indy car competitors that either lack a full-time ride, are former full-time drivers that have elected to drop down to part-time status, or occasional one-off drivers from other racing disciplines. It is not uncommon for some drivers (particularly former Indy 500 winners) to quit full-time driving during the season, but race at Indy singly for numerous years afterward before entering full retirement.\n\n==History==\n===The early years===\n[[File:1912 Indianapolis 500, Joe Dawson winning.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Dawson (racing driver)|Joe Dawson]] winning the [[1912 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n\nThe [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] complex was built in 1909 as a gravel-and-tar track and hosted a smattering of small events, including ones for [[motorcycle]]s.<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. \"Indianapolis:  The Richest Race in the World\", in Northey, Tom, ed.

Usually the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] (e.g. \"50th\") preceded it. Often the race was also advertised on the radio as the \"Annual Memorial Day race,\" or similar variations.\n\nFor the [[1981 Indianapolis 500|1981 race]], the name \"65th Indianapolis 500-Mile Race\" was officially adopted, with all references as the \"International Sweepstakes\" dropped. Since 1981, the race has been formally advertised in this fashion, complete with a unique annual logo with the ordinal almost always included. Around that same time, in the wake of the [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979]] entry controversy, and the formation of [[Champ Car|CART]], the race changed to an invitational event, rather than an [[Open (sport)|Open]], rendering the \"[[sweepstakes]]\" description inappropriate.\n\nFor nearly a century, the race eschewed any sort of [[naming rights]] or [[Sponsor (commercial)|title sponsor]], a move, though uncommon in the modern sports world, that was well-received by fans. This tradition finally ended in [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]] when a presenting sponsor, PennGrade, was added for the first time.

Instead, in most instances in print, television, and radio, the race was referred to as the \"2009 Indianapolis 500\". Since the race was not held during the United States' participation in the two World Wars (1917\u20131918, 1942\u20131945), the advertised Centennial Era occurred during the 93rd to 95th runnings.

Italian driver [[Alberto Ascari]] was the only European-based driver to race in the 500 during its World Championship years. His appearance in [[1952 Indianapolis 500|1952]] in a [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] was also the only time a Ferrari has ever appeared in the race. [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] practiced at the track in [[1958 Indianapolis 500|1958]] but declined an offer to race.\n\nControl issues of monetary prizes and squabbles over technical regulations caused conflict in the 1970s. Soon after the death of Tony Hulman in 1977, and the loss of several key USAC officials in a 1978 plane crash, several key team owners banded together and formed [[Champ Car|CART]] in late 1978 to sanction the sport of [[American Championship Car Racing|Indy car racing]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 itself, however, remained under the sanctioning control of USAC. It became the lone top-level race the body still sanctioned, as it ultimately dropped all other Indy car races (as well as their [[USAC Stock Car|stock car division]]) to concentrate on [[Sprint car racing|sprints]] and [[Midget car racing|midgets]]. For the next three years, the race was not officially recognized on the CART calendar, but the CART teams and drivers comprised the field. By 1983, an agreement was made for the USAC-sanctioned Indy 500 to be recognized on the [[Champ Car|CART]] calendar, and the race awarded points towards the CART championship.\n\nDespite the CART/USAC divide, from 1983 to 1995 the race was run in relative harmony. CART and USAC occasionally quarreled over relatively minor technical regulations but utilized the same machines and the CART-based teams and driver comprised the bulk of the Indy 500 entries each year.\n\n===IndyCar Series===\n[[File:2007 Indianapolis 500 - Starting field formation before start.jpg|thumb|left|The starting field of the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]] in formation before the start]]\n\nIn 1994, Speedway owner [[Tony George]] announced plans for a new series, to be called the [[Indy Racing League]], with Indy 500 as its centerpiece.<ref name=\"INDY26\">{{cite web\n |publisher   = IndyStar.com\n |url         = http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/h/hulman_family/hulman_anton.html\n |title       = The Hulman Family, Owners of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 1945\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120710181822/http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/h/hulman_family/hulman_anton.html\n |archivedate = 2012-07-10\n}}</ref> George announced that he intended to reverse the tide of dramatic cost increases, the decreasing number of [[oval track racing|ovals]] in the CART series, and to allow for more opportunity for drivers from USAC sprint-car ranks.

CART went bankrupt later in the year, and its rights and infrastructure were purchased by remaining car owners, and it became the [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]]. The two series continued to operate separately through 2007. In early 2008, the two series were unified to create a single open-wheel championship after a 12-year split being run under Indy Racing League/IMS control\u2014known as the [[IndyCar Series]].<ref name=\"INDY29\">{{cite web\n|publisher=ESPN\n|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?seriesId=1&id=3253353\n|title=IRL, Champ Car entities sign merger deal\n}}</ref>\n\nThe 2012 race was the return of Turbocharged engines for the first time since 1996 with the use of the Dallara DW12 chassis and 2.2 L V-6 single-turbo and twin-turbocharged engines.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==NASCAR and the 500==\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, the Indy 500 and the [[Coca-Cola 600|World 600]] (now known as the Coca-Cola 600) at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] were held on different days of the week. A handful of [[NASCAR]] regulars participated in both events in the same year, including [[Bobby Allison]], [[Donnie Allison]], [[Cale Yarborough]], and [[Lee Roy Yarbrough]]. From 1974 to 1992, the two events were scheduled for the same day and same starting time, making participation in both impossible. A few stock car drivers during that time, namely [[Neil Bonnett]] in 1979, nevertheless still attempted to qualify at Indy, even if that meant skipping Charlotte altogether.\n\n===\"Double Duty\"===\n\nFrom 1994 to 2014,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kurt Busch Won't Attempt Memorial Day Double|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/3/23/kurt-busch-double-indianapolis-500-coca-cola-600.html|website=NASCAR.com}}</ref> several [[NASCAR]] drivers were able to compete in both the Indy 500 and the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] on the same day. Since 1993, the Coca-Cola 600 has been scheduled in the evening the same day as the Indy 500. The effort has been known as [[Double Duty (auto racing)|\"Double Duty\"]].\nAfter the Indy 500, drivers would catch a helicopter directly from the Speedway to the [[Indianapolis International Airport]]. From there they would fly to [[Concord Regional Airport]], and ride a helicopter to the NASCAR race. [[John Andretti]], [[Tony Stewart]], and [[Robby Gordon]] attempted the feat, with Kurt Busch being the latest in 2014. In 2001, [[Tony Stewart]] became the first driver to complete the full race distance (1,100 miles) in both races on the same day.<ref name=\"INDY30\">{{cite web\n|publisher=NASCAR\n|url=http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/opinion/05/21/retro.racing.maumann.indy.charlotte.double/index.html\n|title=Winning Charlotte, Indy proving an impossible feat\n}}</ref>\n\nFor 2005, the start of Indianapolis was pushed back to 1 p.m. [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] to improve television ratings. This significantly closed the window for a driver to be able to race both events on the same day. (The race's original starting time had been set at 11 a.m. EST to 12 noon EDT\u2014because in 1911, race promoters estimated it would take six hours to complete the event, and they did not want the race to finish too close to dinnertime. Nowadays, the race is routinely completed in under three-and-a-half hours.)\n\nTwo drivers, [[Mario Andretti]] and [[A. J. Foyt]], have won the Indianapolis 500 and the [[Daytona 500]]. Foyt also won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and [[12 Hours of Sebring]], America's premier endurance races, as well as the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Foyt won Le Mans in 1967, about one month after winning his third Indy 500. Andretti won the {{f1|1978}} Formula One World Championship and is a three-time Sebring winner (he also won the 6-hour version of Daytona). Indianapolis 500 winner [[Johnny Rutherford]] once won one of the [[Gatorade Duel|Daytona 500 qualifying races]]. In 2010, [[Chip Ganassi]] became the first car owner to win the Daytona and Indianapolis 500s in the same year, with [[Jamie McMurray]] winning the Daytona 500 and [[Dario Franchitti]] winning the Indianapolis 500.\n\nIn 2010, [[Bruton Smith]] (owner of [[Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]]), offered $20 million to any driver, IndyCar or NASCAR, who can win both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day starting in 2011, a feat that had never been accomplished. For 2011, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved the start time of the Indy 500 back to 12:15 PM EDT (prior to 2005, the engines started at 10:52 AM EST; under the modern schedule, engines start around 12:05 PM for a start around 12:15 PM), which re-opened the window for travel.

Rules are generally the same as every other IndyCar race. In the past, particularly during the era in which USAC sanctioned the Indy 500 (but CART sanctioned the other Indy car races), rules at Indy slightly differed at times. The result, for example, would be a particular chassis or engine configuration being legal at Indy, but not so at the CART-sanctioned events. This was rather commonplace in the 1980s and early 1990s, when \"stock-block\" engines (namely the V-6 Buick) was allotted an increased level of turbocharger boost by USAC at Indy, compared to the purpose-built V-8 quad-cam engines. While the \"stock block\" engines were technically legal in CART competition, they were not given the increased boost advantage, which effectively rendered them uncompetitive, and precluded their use by teams. The most famous manifestation of the USAC rules disparity was the [[Ilmor]]-built [[Ilmor#Racing in the USA|Mercedes-Benz 500I]] engine fielded by [[Roger Penske]] in [[1994 Indianapolis 500|1994]].<ref name=\"INDY31\">{{cite news|publisher=forix.autosport.com|url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/penske-mercedes-pc23.html|title=The Penske-Mercedes PC23-500I}}</ref>\n\nTeams may enter up to two machines under a given car number\u2014the \"primary\" car and a \"backup\" car. The backup car is identified by the letter \"T\". For example, the two cars for the #2 team would be numbered #2 and #2T. Both cars may be practiced during the month, but due to engine lease rules, they must share the same engine. It is not uncommon for teams to prefer their backup car, if it is deemed faster, or for other strategic reasons. Additionally, as the month wears on, a \"T car\" may be split off into a separate entry, and reassigned a new number, or be sold to another team.\n\nAll cars must pass a rigorous technical inspection before receiving a sticker signifying that the car is eligible to practice. Various criteria include minimum weight, dimensions, and approved parts, particularly safety equipment. Before and after qualification attempts, cars must pass another inspection. The pre-qualifying inspection is focused on safety aspects and is done on the pit lane qualifying queue. It is relatively brief, due to the time constraints of the qualifying procedure. The post-qualifying inspection is much more stringent and lengthy, taking place in the garage area. It is to detect deviations from the performance guidelines set forth by the league, and cars can and have been fined or outright disqualified if they fail inspection.\n\n===Qualifying procedure===\n{{Details|List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters}}\n[[File:Dixon Pole 20080510.jpg|thumb|[[Scott Dixon]] makes his pole-winning qualification run for the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n\nThroughout the years, the race has used several different qualifying procedures. The current four-lap (ten-mile) qualifying distance was first introduced in 1920 and has been used every year since 1939.<ref name=\"Evolved\">Mittman, Dick. [http://www.indy500.com/news/story.php?story_id=3569 Indianapolis 500 Qualifying Has Evolved Over The Years], Indy500.com, September 22, 2004</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the qualifying procedure was refined. \"Bump Day\" and \"Pole Day\" were moved the second day of qualifying and drivers who qualified in positions 10-30 will be locked into the field on day one. On the weekend before the race (Saturday and Sunday), all cars are entered into a blind draw for the qualifying order.\n\n*Saturday: All entries are guaranteed at least one attempt to qualify and can make additional attempts if time permits. At the end of the session, the fastest nine drivers advance to a \"shootout\" session held on the next day to determine pole position and the first three rows of the grid. As mentioned above, drivers who qualify 10th-30th have their spots locked in and will not re-qualify. Drivers who qualify 31st and lower advance to a separate \"shootout\" session also held on the next day to determine the final three spots on the grid.\n\n*Sunday: The drivers who qualified 31st and lower from Saturday have their original times erased. These drivers are then given only one attempt to re-qualify using the same four-lap format. Drivers who qualify 31st-33rd have their positions locked in. Drivers who finish 34th and lower fail to qualify. The fastest nine drivers from Saturday take part in the \"Fast Nine Shootout\". The qualifying order is based on the times from Saturday's session from slowest to fastest. Once again, the times from Saturday are erased and each driver is given only one attempt. The fastest driver wins the highly coveted pole position and the remaining eight drivers have their positions locked in based on their times.\n\nFor each attempt, cars are allowed two warm-up laps. At that time, a member of the team is stationed at the north end of the main stretch. He or she must wave a green flag, signaling an attempt, or else the car will be waved off. The attempt can be waved off during any of the four laps by the team, driver, or race officials. (The series will wave off the run if it is obvious the run will not be fast enough to qualify and it is getting late in the day.) If an attempt is waved off after the run starts, the attempt counts towards the three-attempt limit and the previous time is still forfeited unless race officials waved off the attempt because of weather.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Indiana quarter, reverse side, 2002.jpg|thumb|130px|An IndyCar on the Indiana state quarter]]\n\n===Memorabilia===\nMany people promote and share information about the Indianapolis 500 and its memorabilia collecting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ni500cc.com|title=National Indy 500 Collector Club|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> The National Indy 500 Collectors Club is an independent active organization that has been dedicated to supporting such activities.

After winning his third title in 1936, he requested another glass but instead received a bottle. He was captured by a photographer in the act of swigging from the bottle while holding up three fingers to signify the third win.  A local dairy company executive recognized the marketing opportunity in the image and, being unaware Meyer was drinking buttermilk, offered a bottle of milk to the winners of future races.  Milk has been presented each year since then, apart from 1947 to 1955. Modern drivers are offered a choice of whole, 2%, and skim.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/blog/from_the_marbles/post/Indy-mystery-Why-do-Indianapolis-500-winners-dr?urn=nascar,165450], Yahoo, May 22, 2009</ref>\n\nAt the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]], winner [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], who owned and operated an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview.

The race was briefly televised live in 1949 and 1950 on [[WRTV|WFBM-TV]] (today's WRTV), after which the practice was discontinued. From 1964 to 1970, the race was broadcast live on [[closed-circuit television]] in theaters around the country.

The official attendance is not disclosed by Speedway management, but the permanent [[seating capacity]] is upwards of 250,000, and infield patrons raise the race-day attendance to approximately 300,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/stadium_menu/stadium_list/100000.shtml|title=World Stadiums - Stadium List :: 100 000+ Stadiums|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> It shares its date with [[NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR]]'s [[Coca-Cola 600|600-mile]] event at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]], with drivers having completed both events in one day before in a so-called [[Double Duty]].\n\nThe inaugural race was held in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]] and was won by [[Ray Harroun]]. The event celebrated its 100th anniversary in [[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]], and the 100th running was held in [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]]. The event was put on hiatus twice, from 1917 to 1918 due to [[World War I]] and from 1942 to 1945 due to [[World War II]]. [[Simon Pagenaud]] is the current champion. The most successful drivers are [[A. J. Foyt]], [[Al Unser|Al Unser Sr.]], and [[Rick Mears]], each of whom have [[List of Indianapolis 500 winners|won the race]] four times. The active driver with the most victories is [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], with three. [[Rick Mears]] holds the record for most career [[List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters|pole positions]] with six. The most successful car owner is [[Roger Penske]], owner of [[Team Penske]], which has 18 total wins and 18 poles. Penske also has five wins at the [[IndyCar Grand Prix]], held on the [[Oval track racing#Combined road course|combined road course]].\n\nThe event is steeped in [[Indianapolis 500 traditions|tradition]], in pre-race ceremonies, post-race celebrations, and race procedure. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the 33-car field lining up three-wide for the start, the annual singing of \"[[Back Home Again in Indiana]],\" and the victory lane bottle of milk. Also unique is that qualifying requires the driver to complete four, rather than one, timed laps and qualifying itself has a separate weekend.\n\n==Race specifics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Indianapolis-motor-speedway-1848561.jpg|thumb|The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]]]\nThe Indianapolis 500 is held annually at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], a {{convert|2.5|mi|0|adj=mid}} [[Oval track racing|oval circuit]]. The track is a rounded-rectangle, with four distinct turns of identical dimensions, connected by four straightaways (two long straightaways and two \"short chutes\"). Drivers race 200 laps, counter-clockwise around the circuit, for a distance of {{convert|500|mi}}. Since its inception in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]], the race has always been scheduled on or around [[Memorial Day]]. Since [[1974 Indianapolis 500|1974]], the race has been specifically scheduled for the Sunday of [[Memorial Day]] weekend. The Sunday of Memorial Day weekend is widely considered one of the most important days on the motorsports calendar, as it is the day of the Indianapolis 500, [[Coca-Cola 600]], and (currently) the [[Monaco Grand Prix]]. Practice and time trials are held in the two weeks leading up to the race, while miscellaneous preliminary testing is held as early as April.\n\n[[Indianapolis 500 traditions|Traditionally]], the field consists of 33 starters, aligned in a starting grid of eleven rows of three cars apiece. The event is contested by [[American Championship car racing|\"Indy cars\"]], a [[Formula racing|formula]] of [[Professional sports|professional]]-level, single-seat, open [[cockpit]], [[Open-wheel car|open-wheel]], purpose-built race cars. As of [[2018 IndyCar Series season|2018]], all entrants utilize 2.2&nbsp;[[Litre|L]] [[V6 engine|V6]], twin-[[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] engines, tuned to produce a range of {{convert|550|-|700|hp}}. [[Chevrolet]] and [[Honda Performance Development|Honda]] are the current engine manufacturers involved in the sport. [[Dallara]] is at present the sole chassis supplier to the series. [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], which has a deep history in the sport, dating back to the first 500, is currently the exclusive tire provider.\n\nThe race is the most prestigious event of the [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] calendar, and one of the oldest and [[Triple Crown of Motorsport|most important]] automobile races. It has been avouched to be the largest single-day sporting event in the entire world. Likewise, the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] itself is regarded as the world's [[List of sports venues by capacity|largest sporting facility]] in terms of capacity. The total purse exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]13 million in [[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]], with over $2.5 million awarded to the winner, making it one of the richest cash prize funds in sports.\n\nSimilar to [[NASCAR]]'s [[Daytona 500]], the Indianapolis 500 is typically held early in the [[IndyCar Series]] season. That is unique to most sports where major events are usually at the end of the respective season. Currently, the Indy 500 is the sixth event of the 17-race IndyCar schedule. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Indianapolis was often the second or third race of the season, and as late as the 1950s, it was sometimes the first championship event of the year. Due to the high prestige of the Indianapolis 500\u2014rivaling or even surpassing the season championship\u2014it is not uncommon for some teams and drivers to focus heavily on preparing for that race during the early part of the season, and not focus fully on the championship battle until after Indy.\n\nDue to safety issues such as [[aquaplaning]], the race is not held in wet conditions. In the event of a [[Rainout (sports)|rain delay]], the race will be postponed until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race, officials can end the race and declare the results official if more than half of the scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed. The Indianapolis 500, as well as other IndyCar Series races, does not utilize the [[green\u2013white\u2013checker finish]] in case of a late-race yellow. The race can be (and in the past has been) finished under caution. However, officials may call for a late-race red flag to ensure a green-flag finish, an option that was used in [[2014 Indianapolis 500|2014]] and [[2019 Indianapolis 500|2019]]. The circuit lacks lights, therefore lateness can become a factor in the cases of lengthy delays.\n\n====Field====\nThe traditional 33-car starting field at Indianapolis is larger than the fields at the other IndyCar races. The field at Indy typically consists of all of the full-time IndyCar Series entries (roughly 20\u201322 cars), along with 10\u201315 part-time or \"Indy-only\" entries. The \"Indy-only\" entries, also known as \"One-Offs\",  may be an extra car added to an existing full-time team, or a part-time team altogether that does not enter any of the other races, or enters only a few selected races. The \"Indy-only\" drivers may come from a wide range of pedigrees but are usually experienced Indy car competitors that either lack a full-time ride, are former full-time drivers that have elected to drop down to part-time status, or occasional one-off drivers from other racing disciplines. It is not uncommon for some drivers (particularly former Indy 500 winners) to quit full-time driving during the season, but race at Indy singly for numerous years afterward before entering full retirement.\n\n==History==\n===The early years===\n[[File:1912 Indianapolis 500, Joe Dawson winning.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Dawson (racing driver)|Joe Dawson]] winning the [[1912 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n\nThe [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] complex was built in 1909 as a gravel-and-tar track and hosted a smattering of small events, including ones for [[motorcycle]]s.<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. \"Indianapolis:  The Richest Race in the World\", in Northey, Tom, ed.

Usually the [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] (e.g. \"50th\") preceded it. Often the race was also advertised on the radio as the \"Annual Memorial Day race,\" or similar variations.\n\nFor the [[1981 Indianapolis 500|1981 race]], the name \"65th Indianapolis 500-Mile Race\" was officially adopted, with all references as the \"International Sweepstakes\" dropped. Since 1981, the race has been formally advertised in this fashion, complete with a unique annual logo with the ordinal almost always included. Around that same time, in the wake of the [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979]] entry controversy, and the formation of [[Champ Car|CART]], the race changed to an invitational event, rather than an [[Open (sport)|Open]], rendering the \"[[sweepstakes]]\" description inappropriate.\n\nFor nearly a century, the race eschewed any sort of [[naming rights]] or [[Sponsor (commercial)|title sponsor]], a move, though uncommon in the modern sports world, that was well-received by fans. This tradition finally ended in [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]] when a presenting sponsor, PennGrade, was added for the first time. In the 21st century, the facility has also slowly added sponsorship ads on the retaining walls and infield grass.

During the month of May 2009, the ordinal (93rd) was used very sparingly, and for the first time since 1981, was not identified on the annual logo. Instead, in most instances in print, television, and radio, the race was referred to as the \"2009 Indianapolis 500\". Since the race was not held during the United States' participation in the two World Wars (1917\u20131918, 1942\u20131945), the advertised Centennial Era occurred during the 93rd to 95th runnings. To avoid confusion between the 100th anniversary, and the actual number of times the race has been run, references to the ordinal during the ''Centennial Era'' were curtailed.\n\nSix years later, in [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]], the race celebrated its 100th running with about 350,000 in attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/05/25/what-you-need-know-before-you-head-indy-500/84900670/|title=Indy 500: What you need to know|publisher=IndyStar |accessdate=29  May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Female drivers===\n{{main|List of female Indianapolis 500 drivers}}\n[[File:Danica-r.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Danica Patrick]] on Pole Day at Indy, 2007]]\n\nFemale participation of any sort at Indianapolis was discouraged and essentially banned throughout the first several decades of competition.

Following the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]], AAA dissolved the Contest Board to concentrate on its membership program aimed at the general motoring public. Speedway owner [[Tony Hulman]] founded [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] in 1956, which took over sanctioning of the race and the sport of [[American Championship Car Racing|Championship racing]].<ref name=\"INDY24\">{{cite web\n|publisher=world-sprintcar-guide.com\n|url=http://www.world-sprintcar-guide.com/usac-national-sprint-car-series.html\n|title=USAC National Sprint Car Series\n}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1950 to 1960, the Indianapolis 500 also counted toward the [[FIA]]'s [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Championship of Drivers]] (now synonymous with [[Formula One]]), although few drivers participated in the other races of that series. Italian driver [[Alberto Ascari]] was the only European-based driver to race in the 500 during its World Championship years. His appearance in [[1952 Indianapolis 500|1952]] in a [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] was also the only time a Ferrari has ever appeared in the race. [[Juan Manuel Fangio]] practiced at the track in [[1958 Indianapolis 500|1958]] but declined an offer to race.\n\nControl issues of monetary prizes and squabbles over technical regulations caused conflict in the 1970s. Soon after the death of Tony Hulman in 1977, and the loss of several key USAC officials in a 1978 plane crash, several key team owners banded together and formed [[Champ Car|CART]] in late 1978 to sanction the sport of [[American Championship Car Racing|Indy car racing]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 itself, however, remained under the sanctioning control of USAC. It became the lone top-level race the body still sanctioned, as it ultimately dropped all other Indy car races (as well as their [[USAC Stock Car|stock car division]]) to concentrate on [[Sprint car racing|sprints]] and [[Midget car racing|midgets]]. For the next three years, the race was not officially recognized on the CART calendar, but the CART teams and drivers comprised the field. By 1983, an agreement was made for the USAC-sanctioned Indy 500 to be recognized on the [[Champ Car|CART]] calendar, and the race awarded points towards the CART championship.\n\nDespite the CART/USAC divide, from 1983 to 1995 the race was run in relative harmony. CART and USAC occasionally quarreled over relatively minor technical regulations but utilized the same machines and the CART-based teams and driver comprised the bulk of the Indy 500 entries each year.\n\n===IndyCar Series===\n[[File:2007 Indianapolis 500 - Starting field formation before start.jpg|thumb|left|The starting field of the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]] in formation before the start]]\n\nIn 1994, Speedway owner [[Tony George]] announced plans for a new series, to be called the [[Indy Racing League]], with Indy 500 as its centerpiece.<ref name=\"INDY26\">{{cite web\n |publisher   = IndyStar.com\n |url         = http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/h/hulman_family/hulman_anton.html\n |title       = The Hulman Family, Owners of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 1945\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120710181822/http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/people/h/hulman_family/hulman_anton.html\n |archivedate = 2012-07-10\n}}</ref> George announced that he intended to reverse the tide of dramatic cost increases, the decreasing number of [[oval track racing|ovals]] in the CART series, and to allow for more opportunity for drivers from USAC sprint-car ranks.

This effectively left eight starting positions open to the CART-regulars that chose not to participate in the IRL races and would be the first time that not all 33 spots were open for qualification in the history of the race.

A handful of [[NASCAR]] regulars participated in both events in the same year, including [[Bobby Allison]], [[Donnie Allison]], [[Cale Yarborough]], and [[Lee Roy Yarbrough]]. From 1974 to 1992, the two events were scheduled for the same day and same starting time, making participation in both impossible. A few stock car drivers during that time, namely [[Neil Bonnett]] in 1979, nevertheless still attempted to qualify at Indy, even if that meant skipping Charlotte altogether.\n\n===\"Double Duty\"===\n\nFrom 1994 to 2014,<ref>{{cite web|title=Kurt Busch Won't Attempt Memorial Day Double|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/3/23/kurt-busch-double-indianapolis-500-coca-cola-600.html|website=NASCAR.com}}</ref> several [[NASCAR]] drivers were able to compete in both the Indy 500 and the [[Coca-Cola 600]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]] on the same day.

(The race's original starting time had been set at 11 a.m. EST to 12 noon EDT\u2014because in 1911, race promoters estimated it would take six hours to complete the event, and they did not want the race to finish too close to dinnertime.

For 2011, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway moved the start time of the Indy 500 back to 12:15 PM EDT (prior to 2005, the engines started at 10:52 AM EST; under the modern schedule, engines start around 12:05 PM for a start around 12:15 PM), which re-opened the window for travel. [[Brad Keselowski]] suggested that he would consider answering the challenge in 2014.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Autoweek|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130524/nascar01/130529855|title=Gunning for first NASCAR Sprint Cup win of the year in the Coca-Cola 600: Brad Keselowski's Autoweek blog|access-date=2013-07-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305082344/http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130524/nascar01/130529855|archive-date=2014-03-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was announced on March 4, 2014, that [[Kurt Busch]] would attempt to qualify for the [[2014 Indianapolis 500]], driving a fifth car for the [[Andretti Autosport]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/03/04/kurt-busch-indianapolis-500-coca-cola-600-double/6008475/|title=Kurt Busch to attempt Indianapolis 500, Coke 600 'double'|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|date=March 4, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2014-03-04|location=McLean, VA}}</ref> Busch completed all 500 miles at Indy to finish sixth but dropped out of the 600 with a blown engine just past the 400-mile mark.\n\nHowever, for 2019, NBC Sports and the Speedway changed the start time again. The engines are scheduled to start at 12:38 PM for a start time of 12:45 PM EDT.\n\n==Technical regulations==\n[[File:PenskePC23.jpg|thumb|[[Penske PC-23]] [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[1994 Indianapolis 500]] winning car]]\n\nTechnical specifications for the Indianapolis 500 are currently written by [[IndyCar]]. Rules are generally the same as every other IndyCar race. In the past, particularly during the era in which USAC sanctioned the Indy 500 (but CART sanctioned the other Indy car races), rules at Indy slightly differed at times. The result, for example, would be a particular chassis or engine configuration being legal at Indy, but not so at the CART-sanctioned events. This was rather commonplace in the 1980s and early 1990s, when \"stock-block\" engines (namely the V-6 Buick) was allotted an increased level of turbocharger boost by USAC at Indy, compared to the purpose-built V-8 quad-cam engines. While the \"stock block\" engines were technically legal in CART competition, they were not given the increased boost advantage, which effectively rendered them uncompetitive, and precluded their use by teams. The most famous manifestation of the USAC rules disparity was the [[Ilmor]]-built [[Ilmor#Racing in the USA|Mercedes-Benz 500I]] engine fielded by [[Roger Penske]] in [[1994 Indianapolis 500|1994]].<ref name=\"INDY31\">{{cite news|publisher=forix.autosport.com|url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/penske-mercedes-pc23.html|title=The Penske-Mercedes PC23-500I}}</ref>\n\nTeams may enter up to two machines under a given car number\u2014the \"primary\" car and a \"backup\" car. The backup car is identified by the letter \"T\". For example, the two cars for the #2 team would be numbered #2 and #2T. Both cars may be practiced during the month, but due to engine lease rules, they must share the same engine. It is not uncommon for teams to prefer their backup car, if it is deemed faster, or for other strategic reasons. Additionally, as the month wears on, a \"T car\" may be split off into a separate entry, and reassigned a new number, or be sold to another team.\n\nAll cars must pass a rigorous technical inspection before receiving a sticker signifying that the car is eligible to practice. Various criteria include minimum weight, dimensions, and approved parts, particularly safety equipment. Before and after qualification attempts, cars must pass another inspection. The pre-qualifying inspection is focused on safety aspects and is done on the pit lane qualifying queue. It is relatively brief, due to the time constraints of the qualifying procedure. The post-qualifying inspection is much more stringent and lengthy, taking place in the garage area. It is to detect deviations from the performance guidelines set forth by the league, and cars can and have been fined or outright disqualified if they fail inspection.\n\n===Qualifying procedure===\n{{Details|List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters}}\n[[File:Dixon Pole 20080510.jpg|thumb|[[Scott Dixon]] makes his pole-winning qualification run for the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]]]]\n\nThroughout the years, the race has used several different qualifying procedures. The current four-lap (ten-mile) qualifying distance was first introduced in 1920 and has been used every year since 1939.<ref name=\"Evolved\">Mittman, Dick. [http://www.indy500.com/news/story.php?story_id=3569 Indianapolis 500 Qualifying Has Evolved Over The Years], Indy500.com, September 22, 2004</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the qualifying procedure was refined. \"Bump Day\" and \"Pole Day\" were moved the second day of qualifying and drivers who qualified in positions 10-30 will be locked into the field on day one. On the weekend before the race (Saturday and Sunday), all cars are entered into a blind draw for the qualifying order.\n\n*Saturday: All entries are guaranteed at least one attempt to qualify and can make additional attempts if time permits. At the end of the session, the fastest nine drivers advance to a \"shootout\" session held on the next day to determine pole position and the first three rows of the grid. As mentioned above, drivers who qualify 10th-30th have their spots locked in and will not re-qualify. Drivers who qualify 31st and lower advance to a separate \"shootout\" session also held on the next day to determine the final three spots on the grid.\n\n*Sunday: The drivers who qualified 31st and lower from Saturday have their original times erased. These drivers are then given only one attempt to re-qualify using the same four-lap format. Drivers who qualify 31st-33rd have their positions locked in. Drivers who finish 34th and lower fail to qualify. The fastest nine drivers from Saturday take part in the \"Fast Nine Shootout\". The qualifying order is based on the times from Saturday's session from slowest to fastest. Once again, the times from Saturday are erased and each driver is given only one attempt. The fastest driver wins the highly coveted pole position and the remaining eight drivers have their positions locked in based on their times.\n\nFor each attempt, cars are allowed two warm-up laps. At that time, a member of the team is stationed at the north end of the main stretch. He or she must wave a green flag, signaling an attempt, or else the car will be waved off. The attempt can be waved off during any of the four laps by the team, driver, or race officials. (The series will wave off the run if it is obvious the run will not be fast enough to qualify and it is getting late in the day.) If an attempt is waved off after the run starts, the attempt counts towards the three-attempt limit and the previous time is still forfeited unless race officials waved off the attempt because of weather.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Indiana quarter, reverse side, 2002.jpg|thumb|130px|An IndyCar on the Indiana state quarter]]\n\n===Memorabilia===\nMany people promote and share information about the Indianapolis 500 and its memorabilia collecting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ni500cc.com|title=National Indy 500 Collector Club|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> The National Indy 500 Collectors Club is an independent active organization that has been dedicated to supporting such activities.

After winning his third title in 1936, he requested another glass but instead received a bottle. He was captured by a photographer in the act of swigging from the bottle while holding up three fingers to signify the third win.  A local dairy company executive recognized the marketing opportunity in the image and, being unaware Meyer was drinking buttermilk, offered a bottle of milk to the winners of future races.  Milk has been presented each year since then, apart from 1947 to 1955. Modern drivers are offered a choice of whole, 2%, and skim.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/blog/from_the_marbles/post/Indy-mystery-Why-do-Indianapolis-500-winners-dr?urn=nascar,165450], Yahoo, May 22, 2009</ref>\n\nAt the [[1993 Indianapolis 500]], winner [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], who owned and operated an orange grove, notoriously drank orange juice instead of milk during the televised winner's interview.

The race has been broadcast live on the radio in its entirety by the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]] since 1953.\n\nThe Hulmans did not allow live television coverage of the 500 until 1986, largely to maximize gate attendance. The race was briefly televised live in 1949 and 1950 on [[WRTV|WFBM-TV]] (today's WRTV), after which the practice was discontinued. From 1964 to 1970, the race was broadcast live on [[closed-circuit television]] in theaters around the country. From 1965 through 1970, a highlighted version of the race was shown on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]''. From 1971 through 1985, an edited same-day, [[tape delay (broadcasting)|tape delay]] broadcast of the race was shown in prime time. The race broadcast was edited down to either two or three hours in duration (including commercials).\n\nFrom 1986 through 2018, ABC televised the race live in its entirety. However, at the request of the Speedway, Indianapolis affiliate [[WRTV]] was required to [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] the live broadcast and carry it on tape delay in prime time to encourage local race attendance; WRTV would air the ABC primetime lineup in the afternoon.

A total {{USD|30 million}} prize pool was available across the various competitions.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Fortnite World Cup uses two of the game modes available to the video game, ''Fortnite''. The main World Cup event as well as the Pro-Am use ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players airdrop onto an island without any weapons or armor, save for a pickaxe. Once on the ground, players must scavenge for weapons, armor, and healing items, as well as using their pickaxe to knock down existing features to gather wood, stone, and metal resources. This all must be done while avoiding attacks from other players, as well as staying within a shrinking circle on the map or risk taking fatal damage outside it. Players can use gathered resources to build walls, floors, and stairs and ramps to use as cover from attacks. The last player or team left alive wins. In ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', players can build unique courses at their own pace, which can be used to create competitive events that can then share with others.\n\nThe Fortnite World Cup had online events over 10 weeks from April to June 2019 for people to place. The weeks alternated between solo players and duos teams. During the Saturday of each week, any player or duo could compete with others by geographic region, playing up to 10 matches to earn points through eliminations and victories. The top three thousand players/teams from each region then competed on the Sunday event, again playing up to ten matches to earn points. The top point-scorers in each region from the Sunday event then proceed through to the World Cup, a total of about twenty players/teams each week.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\">[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/events/world-cup/about]</ref> An estimated 40 million players vied for spots in the solo and duos World Cup.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/fortnite-world-cup-winner-bugha.html | title = This Fortnite World Cup Winner Is 16 and $3 Million Richer | first1 = Derrick Bryson | last1= Taylor | first2=Niraj | last2= Chokshi | date = July 29, 2019 | accessdate = July 29, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> In the World Cup finals, the competitors played a total of six matches, with points earned for the highest finishers.

Similarly, each duo team in the final received a minimum of {{USD|100,000}} with the top team winning {{USD|3 million}}.<ref name=\"variety viewership\"/>\n\nThe Fortnite Creative Cup had a similar online process to select the players for the finals, taking place over five two-week periods from April to June 2019. Each active week, a new Creative challenge is available. Players, once completed with their Creative island, must submit a video of that challenge to Epic in that period. For each period, Epic selected three of the best entries by a panel of judges. Each selected entry earns a cash prize of {{USD|5,000}} and a guaranteed spot in the Creative Cup finals. From the fifteen winning entries, five were selected by Epic to be used in the Creative Cup finales.<ref>[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-world-cup-creative-competitions-official-rules]</ref> In the finales, eight teams of four, consisting of those that had their Creative island selected and other notable ''Fortnite'' players, complete in these five events to earn the best overall score. The winners in the finale split a {{USD|3 million}} prize pool.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\"/>\n\nThe teams for the Fortnite Pro-Am are selected by Epic Games, with each team made up of a ''Fortnite'' streamer and a celebrity. The teams each played five matches, with a scoring system for the winning teams. The team with the highest overall score after five matches won the Pro-Am. Each team received a minimum of {{USD|20,000}} with the winning team receiving {{USD|1 million}}.\n\nKindness to he horrible reserved ye. Effect twenty indeed beyond for not had county.

The team leaders held qualifiers, in which they had those attempting to qualify participate in a challenge in creative mode. The top 3 performers on each challenge were recruited to their respective leader\u2019s team. The cup included three different creative game maps: a king of the hill map, a prop hunt map, and a death run map. Each map had one round with three matches dedicated to it, and the final round had one match on each map. In the end, the \u201cFish Fam\u201d led by Faze Cizzorz won the creative World Cup.\n\nCreative Cup final standings:\n<ref name=\"fortnite\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!

A total {{USD|30 million}} prize pool was available across the various competitions.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Fortnite World Cup uses two of the game modes available to the video game, ''Fortnite''. The main World Cup event as well as the Pro-Am use ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players airdrop onto an island without any weapons or armor, save for a pickaxe. Once on the ground, players must scavenge for weapons, armor, and healing items, as well as using their pickaxe to knock down existing features to gather wood, stone, and metal resources. This all must be done while avoiding attacks from other players, as well as staying within a shrinking circle on the map or risk taking fatal damage outside it. Players can use gathered resources to build walls, floors, and stairs and ramps to use as cover from attacks. The last player or team left alive wins. In ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', players can build unique courses at their own pace, which can be used to create competitive events that can then share with others.\n\nThe Fortnite World Cup had online events over 10 weeks from April to June 2019 for people to place. The weeks alternated between solo players and duos teams. During the Saturday of each week, any player or duo could compete with others by geographic region, playing up to 10 matches to earn points through eliminations and victories. The top three thousand players/teams from each region then competed on the Sunday event, again playing up to ten matches to earn points. The top point-scorers in each region from the Sunday event then proceed through to the World Cup, a total of about twenty players/teams each week.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\">[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/events/world-cup/about]</ref> An estimated 40 million players vied for spots in the solo and duos World Cup.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/fortnite-world-cup-winner-bugha.html | title = This Fortnite World Cup Winner Is 16 and $3 Million Richer | first1 = Derrick Bryson | last1= Taylor | first2=Niraj | last2= Chokshi | date = July 29, 2019 | accessdate = July 29, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> In the World Cup finals, the competitors played a total of six matches, with points earned for the highest finishers.

Similarly, each duo team in the final received a minimum of {{USD|100,000}} with the top team winning {{USD|3 million}}.<ref name=\"variety viewership\"/>\n\nThe Fortnite Creative Cup had a similar online process to select the players for the finals, taking place over five two-week periods from April to June 2019. Each active week, a new Creative challenge is available. Players, once completed with their Creative island, must submit a video of that challenge to Epic in that period. For each period, Epic selected three of the best entries by a panel of judges. Each selected entry earns a cash prize of {{USD|5,000}} and a guaranteed spot in the Creative Cup finals. From the fifteen winning entries, five were selected by Epic to be used in the Creative Cup finales.<ref>[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-world-cup-creative-competitions-official-rules]</ref> In the finales, eight teams of four, consisting of those that had their Creative island selected and other notable ''Fortnite'' players, complete in these five events to earn the best overall score. The winners in the finale split a {{USD|3 million}} prize pool.<ref name=\"epicgames.com\"/>\n\nThe teams for the Fortnite Pro-Am are selected by Epic Games, with each team made up of a ''Fortnite'' streamer and a celebrity. The teams each played five matches, with a scoring system for the winning teams. The team with the highest overall score after five matches won the Pro-Am. Each team received a minimum of {{USD|20,000}} with the winning team receiving {{USD|1 million}}.\n\n==History==\n[[Epic Games]] had launched ''Fortnite'' in its original planned form, now known as ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', as an [[early access]] title in July 2017, around the same time that the first influential [[battle royale game]], ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]''(PUBG) was released. Inspired by this, Epic created a variation of ''Fortnite'' and released it as ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' in September 2017. While [[free-to-play]], the game was supported by [[microtransaction]]s.

The cup included three different creative game maps: a king of the hill map, a prop hunt map, and a death run map.
