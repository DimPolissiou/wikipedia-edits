{"title_page": "Hook and ladder (football)", "text_new": "The '''hook and lateral''' is a [[trick play]] in [[American football|American]], [[Canadian football]] & [[indoor American football]], often colloquially called '''the hook and ladder play.'''    \n\nAlthough the latter term is often used generically, a \u201chook and ladder\u201d route specifically identifies a hook-and-lateral to a receiver on a \u201cladder\u201d route.  Thus a slant, cross, or other pattern collecting a lateral from a stop (or hook) route is not truly a \u201chook and ladder;\u201d nonetheless, the phrase has long been used in the vernacular to describe any hook and lateral.  \n\nThe \"hook and lateral\" starts with the hook, which is where a [[wide receiver]] runs a predetermined distance, usually 10 yards down the field, and along the sideline, and \"hooks in\" towards the center of the field to receive a forward pass from the [[quarterback]]. Another offensive player (usually another wide receiver) times a run so that he is at full speed, just behind the player with the ball at the time of the catch. As the defenders close in on the stationary ball carrier, he [[lateral pass|lateral]]s or hands the ball to the teammate running at full speed in the opposite direction of the original receiver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nfl/hook-and-ladder.aspx|title=What is Hook and Ladder? Definition from SportingCharts.com|work=sportingcharts.com}}</ref>\n\nIf unanticipated, this play puts defenders out of position, running in the wrong direction. If the second receiver catches the lateral in stride, he can be long gone before defenders can react. However, the offense runs a high risk of turning the ball over if it is not handled properly because, unlike a [[forward pass]], a dropped lateral pass results in a [[fumble|live ball]].\n\nThe hook and lateral is one of two common desperation strategies a trailing team can use at the end of a game, the other being the [[Hail Mary pass]]. It has the advantage in that it can be attempted anywhere on the field, whereas the Hail Mary can generally only be attempted at a point on the field where the quarterback's throwing arm is strong enough to reach the end zone with a forward pass.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The [[Miami Dolphins]] executed a successful \"87 Circle Curl Lateral\" play at the end of the first half of their [[The Epic in Miami|AFC playoff game]] against the [[San Diego Chargers]] on January 2, 1982.

The \"lateral\" refers to the pitching of the ball by the receiver to his teammate. This is not synonymous with a \"ladder\", which is a specific route (also called a \"chair\") in which a receiver cuts out before turning up the field along the sideline. If the \"hook\" receiver laterals the ball to a teammate running a ladder route, the play could accurately be described as a \"hook and ladder\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  This would not be true of many hook and lateral plays; in the case of the play run by the Boise State Broncos in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, [[Jerard Rabb|the player who received the lateral]] from [[Drisan James|the \"hook\" receiver]] was running a [[Slant (route)|slant route]] across the center of the field rather than a ladder route.\n\nOn the January 2, 2007 broadcast of ESPN's ''[[Around the Horn]]'', sportswriter [[Woody Paige]] claimed, perhaps facetiously, that the name \"hook and ladder\" originated with [[New York City Fire Department|NYC Firemen]] Football Team in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen, New York]]. This was in response to the other panelists ridiculing his use of \"hook and ladder\" rather than \"hook and lateral\". The next day, [[Jay Mariotti]] claimed the phrase \"hook and ladder\" referred to [[coal mining]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in the 1930s \u2014 his research claims that coal miners need a hook and ladder when trapped in a mine. Another possible explanation is that \"hook and ladder\" is just a corruption of the phrase \"hook and lateral\".\n\nA \"hook and ladder\" is a common name for a [[firetruck]], which used to carry various hooks and ladders. The analogies that could be drawn to this play based on a \"hook\" route (with or without an actual \"lateral\") and a \"hook and ladder\" apparatus are numerous. Long extension ladders include two or more pieces, perhaps the first piece being a \"hook\" route, and the second piece being a run up the \"ladder\" to the end-zone. The second part of the play is sometimes accomplished with a hand-off, and not a lateral at all. Notwithstanding, there does not seem to be any definitive proof of what the play was originally called or why.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.yesbutnobutyes.com/archives/2005/11/ten_wild_plays_1.html Ten Wild Plays in NFL History] at yesbutnobutyes.com\n\n{{American football strategy}}\n\n[[Category:American football plays]]\n", "text_old": "The '''hook and lateral''' is a [[trick play]] in [[American football|American]], [[Canadian football]] & [[indoor American football]], often colloquially called '''the hook and ladder play.'''    \n\nAlthough the latter term is often used generically, a \u201chook and ladder\u201d route specifically identifies a hook-and-lateral to a receiver on a \u201cladder\u201d route.

The \"lateral\" refers to the pitching of the ball by the receiver to his teammate. This is not synonymous with a \"ladder\", which is a specific route (also called a \"chair\") in which a receiver cuts out before turning up the field along the sideline. If the \"hook\" receiver laterals the ball to a teammate running a ladder route, the play could accurately be described as a \"hook and ladder\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  This would not be true of many hook and lateral plays; in the case of the play run by the Boise State Broncos in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, [[Jerard Rabb|the player who received the lateral]] from [[Drisan James|the \"hook\" receiver]] was running a [[Slant (route)|slant route]] across the center of the field rather than a ladder route.\n\nOn the January 2, 2007 broadcast of ESPN's ''[[Around the Horn]]'', sportswriter [[Woody Paige]] claimed, perhaps facetiously, that the name \"hook and ladder\" originated with [[New York City Fire Department|NYC Firemen]] Football Team in [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen, New York]]. This was in response to the other panelists ridiculing his use of \"hook and ladder\" rather than \"hook and lateral\". The next day, [[Jay Mariotti]] claimed the phrase \"hook and ladder\" referred to [[coal mining]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in the 1930s \u2014 his research claims that coal miners need a hook and ladder when trapped in a mine. Another possible explanation is that \"hook and ladder\" is just a corruption of the phrase \"hook and lateral\".\n\nA \"hook and ladder\" is a common name for a [[firetruck]], which used to carry various hooks and ladders. The analogies that could be drawn to this play based on a \"hook\" route (with or without an actual \"lateral\") and a \"hook and ladder\" apparatus are numerous. Long extension ladders include two or more pieces, perhaps the first piece being a \"hook\" route, and the second piece being a run up the \"ladder\" to the end-zone. The second part of the play is sometimes accomplished with a hand-off, and not a lateral at all. Notwithstanding, there does not seem to be any definitive proof of what the play was originally called or why.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.yesbutnobutyes.com/archives/2005/11/ten_wild_plays_1.html Ten Wild Plays in NFL History] at yesbutnobutyes.com\n\n{{American football strategy}}\n\n[[Category:American football plays]]\n", "name_user": "PCN02WPS", "label": "safe", "comment": "linkAlex CollinsusingFind link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_and_ladder_(football)"}

One of the Trust's key supporters, Rosemarie Rymer, came up with the original creative idea of wearing jeans, for the benefit of our genes, one day in the year, and paying a gold coin donation to the national appeal. The first UK Jeans for Genes campaign was run in 1992 when the CGD Trust mailed 20,000 UK schools. The appeal raised close to 50,000 pounds. In the second year of running the appeal (1994) the campaign raised a further 55,000 pounds.

In 1997 the partnership appeal raised 800,000 pounds, and the following year 2.7 million pounds. The UK annual appeal continues today and is run by Genetic Disorders UK.
