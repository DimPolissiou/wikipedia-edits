After her death in 619 CE, he over time married a number of women. His life is traditionally delineated by two epochs: [[Muhammad in Mecca|pre-hijra]] (emigration) in [[Mecca]], a city in western [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], from the year 570 to 622 CE, and [[Muhammad in Medina|post-hijra]] in [[Medina]], from 622 until his death in 632.

He therefore had family bonds with all the first four Caliphs).\n# Spreading the message by uniting different clans through marriage.\n# Increasing credibility and sources for conveying his private family life. If he only had one wife, then it would have been a tremendous responsibility on her to convey Muhammad's private acts of worship and family life, and people would try to discredit her to destroy the credibility of these practices. However, with multiple wives, there were a lot more sources to the knowledge, making it more difficult to discredit it. Therefore, his marriages gave more women the opportunity to learn and teach the matters of his private life.\n\nMuhammad's first marriage was at the age of about 25 to the 28 or 40-year-old Khadijah. He was monogamously married to her for 25 years, after which he is believed to have had multiple wives for the reasons explained above.

Some commentators<ref>For example Qadi Iyad ibn Musa al-Yahsubi</ref> have found it absurd that Muhammad would suddenly become aware of Zaynab's beauty one day after having known her all her life; if her beauty had been the reason for Muhammad to marry her, he would have married her himself in the first place rather than arranging her marriage to Zayd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.islamtoday.net/quesshow-14-943.htm|title=The Prophet's Marriage to Zaynab bint Jahsh|website=Islam Today|accessdate=2015-05-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406062043/http://en.islamtoday.net/quesshow-14-943.htm|archivedate=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuhammad, fearing public opinion, was initially reluctant to marry Zaynab. The marriage would seem incestuous to their contemporaries because she was the former wife of his adopted son, and adopted sons were considered the same as biological sons.<ref name=\"Watt\" /> According to Watt, this \"conception of incest was bound up with old practices belonging to a lower, communalistic level of familial institutions where a child's paternity was not definitely known; and this lower level was in process being eliminated by Islam.\"<ref name=\"Watt1\">William Montgomery Watt (1974), p.233</ref> The Qur'an,{{cite quran|33|37|style=nosup|expand=no}} however, indicated that this marriage was a duty imposed upon him by God.

On the way back, Aisha lost her necklace which she had borrowed from her sister Asma Bint Abu Bakr (a treasured possession), and Muhammad required the army to stop so that it could be found. The necklace was found, but during the same journey, Aisha lost it again. This time, she quietly slipped out in search for it, but by the time she recovered it, the caravan had moved on. She was eventually taken home by Safw'an bin Mu'attal.<ref name = Ifk>Peterson (2007), p. 169-71</ref>\n\nRumors spread that A'isha and  Safw'an committed adultery although there were no witnesses to this.<ref name=\"Spellberg\">[[Denise Spellberg|D.

Meanwhile, Aisha had been ill, and unaware of the stories. At first, Muhammad himself was unsure of what to believe, but eventually trusted Aisha's protestations of innocence.<ref name=Ifk /> Eventually, verses of surah Nur were revealed by Muhammad, establishing her innocence, and condemning the slanders and the libel.

If he only had one wife, then it would have been a tremendous responsibility on her to convey Muhammad's private acts of worship and family life, and people would try to discredit her to destroy the credibility of these practices. However, with multiple wives, there were a lot more sources to the knowledge, making it more difficult to discredit it. Therefore, his marriages gave more women the opportunity to learn and teach the matters of his private life.\n\nMuhammad's first marriage was at the age of about 25 to the 28 or 40-year-old Khadijah.

The marriage would seem incestuous to their contemporaries because she was the former wife of his adopted son, and adopted sons were considered the same as biological sons.<ref name=\"Watt\" /> According to Watt, this \"conception of incest was bound up with old practices belonging to a lower, communalistic level of familial institutions where a child's paternity was not definitely known; and this lower level was in process being eliminated by Islam.\"<ref name=\"Watt1\">William Montgomery Watt (1974), p.233</ref> The Qur'an,{{cite quran|33|37|style=nosup|expand=no}} however, indicated that this marriage was a duty imposed upon him by God. It implied that treating adopted sons as real sons was objectionable and that there should now be a complete break with the past.<ref name=\"Watt\" /> Thus Muhammad, confident that he was strong enough to face public opinion, proceeded to reject these taboos.<ref>Watt(1956), p.330-1</ref> When Zaynab's waiting period was complete, Muhammad married her.<ref>''Watt,'' p. 156.</ref> An influential faction in Medina, called \"[[Munafiqun|Hypocrites]]\" in the Islamic tradition,<ref name = FS89>Freyer Stowasser (1996), p. 89</ref> did indeed criticize the marriage as incestuous.<ref name=\"Watt\" /> Attempting to divide the Muslim community, they spread rumors as part of a strategy of attacking Muhammad through his wives.<ref name=FS89 /> According to Ibn Kathir, the relevant Qur'anic verses were a \"divine rejection\" of the Hypocrites' objections.<ref name=FS89 /> According to Rodinson, doubters argued the verses were in exact conflict with social taboos and favored Muhammad too much. The delivery of these verses, thus, did not end the dissent.<ref name=Rod>Rodinson, p. 207.</ref>\n\n====Necklace incident====\nAisha had accompanied Muhammad on his skirmish with the Banu Mustaliq. On the way back, Aisha lost her necklace which she had borrowed from her sister Asma Bint Abu Bakr (a treasured possession), and Muhammad required the army to stop so that it could be found. The necklace was found, but during the same journey, Aisha lost it again. This time, she quietly slipped out in search for it, but by the time she recovered it, the caravan had moved on. She was eventually taken home by Safw'an bin Mu'attal.<ref name = Ifk>Peterson (2007), p. 169-71</ref>\n\nRumors spread that A'isha and  Safw'an committed adultery although there were no witnesses to this.<ref name=\"Spellberg\">[[Denise Spellberg|D. A. Spellberg]], ''Politics, Gender, and the Islamic Past: the Legacy of A'isha bint Abi Bakr'', [[Columbia University Press]], 1994, p. 40</ref> Disputes arose, and the community was split into factions. Meanwhile, Aisha had been ill, and unaware of the stories. At first, Muhammad himself was unsure of what to believe, but eventually trusted Aisha's protestations of innocence.<ref name=Ifk /> Eventually, verses of surah Nur were revealed by Muhammad, establishing her innocence, and condemning the slanders and the libel. Although the episode was uneasy for both Muhammad and Aisha, in the end, it reinforced their mutual love and trust.<ref>Ramadan (2007), p. 121</ref>\n\nAccording to shia ([[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i|Allameh Tabataba']]), revealing of Nur's verses belongs to Maria al-Qibtiyya, another wife of Muhammad. Also the accuracy of incident free from which wife of Muhammad, isn't confirmed by shia scholar ([[Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi]]), because the [[Ismah]] of Muhammad is violated.<ref>\n{{cite web|last1=Multiple authors|title=The opinions of Shia and Sunni on Ifk incident|url=https://www.mouood.org/component/k2/item/17797-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%83-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%8C-%D8%A2%D9%8A%D9%87-11%D8%8C-%D9%88-%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A-%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%88-%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%8A.html|website=mouood|access-date=2017-12-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228112241/https://www.mouood.org/component/k2/item/17797-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%83-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%8C-%D8%A2%D9%8A%D9%87-11%D8%8C-%D9%88-%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A-%D8%B4%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%88-%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%8A.html|archive-date=2017-12-28|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Makarem Shirazi|first1=Naser |title=Al amsel (\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062b\u0644)|volume=11|page=41}}</ref>\n\n===Reconciliation===\n\n====Juwayriyya bint al-Harith====\n\nOne of the captives from the skirmish with the [[Banu Mustaliq]] was [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith]], who was the daughter of the tribe's chieftain. Her husband, Mustafa bin Safwan, had been killed in the battle. She initially fell among the booty of Muhammad's companion Thabit b. Qays b. Al-Shammas. Upon being enslaved, Juwayriyya went to Muhammad requesting that she - as the daughter of the lord of the Mustaliq - be released, however the Prophet refused. Meanwhile, her father approached Muhammad with [[ransom]] to secure her release, but Muhammed still refused to release her. Muhammad then offered to marry her, and she accepted.<ref>Rodinson, p. 196.</ref> When it became known that tribes persons of Mustaliq were [[Kinship|kinsmen]] of the prophet of Islam through marriage, the Muslims began releasing their captives.<ref>Lings (1983), p. 241-2</ref> Thus, Muhammad's marriage resulted in the freedom of nearly one hundred families whom he had recently enslaved.<ref>Nomani, p. 365-6</ref>\n\n====Safiyya bint Huyayy Ibn Akhtab====\n[[Safiyya bint Huyayy]] was a noblewoman,<ref name =shati_saf1>Al-Shati', 1971, 171</ref> the daughter of [[Huyayy ibn Akhtab]], chief of the Jewish tribe [[Banu Qurayza]], who was executed after surrendering at the [[Battle of the Trench]].<ref>Ibn Ishaq, ''Sirat Rasul Allah''.

Hence we must discount future payments.

The cost of capital, in a financial market equilibrium, will be the same as the market [[rate of return]] on the financial asset mixture the firm uses to finance capital investment. Some adjustment may be made to the discount rate to take account of risks associated with uncertain cash flows, with other developments.\n\nThe discount rates typically applied to different types of companies show significant differences:\n\n* Start-ups seeking money: 50\u2013100%\n* Early start-ups: 40\u201360%\n* Late start-ups: 30\u201350%\n* Mature companies: 10\u201325%\n\nThe higher discount rate for start-ups reflects the various disadvantages they face, compared to established companies:\n\n* Reduced marketability of ownerships because stocks are not traded publicly\n* Limited number of investors willing to invest\n* High risks associated with start-ups\n* Overly optimistic forecasts by enthusiastic founders\n\nOne method that looks into a correct discount rate is the [[capital asset pricing model]]. This model takes into account three variables that make up the discount rate:\n\n'''1. Risk free rate''': The percentage of return generated by investing in risk free securities such as government bonds.\n\n'''2. Beta''': The measurement of how a company's stock price reacts to a change in the market. A beta higher than 1 means that a change in share price is exaggerated compared to the rest of shares in the same market. A beta less than 1 means that the share is stable and not very responsive to changes in the market. Less than 0 means that a share is moving in the opposite direction from the rest of the shares in the same market.\n\n'''3. Equity market risk premium''': The return on investment that investors require above the risk free rate.\n\n: '''Discount rate''' = (risk free rate) + beta * (equity market risk premium)\n\n== Discount factor ==\n\nThe '''discount factor''', ''DF(T)'', is the factor by which a future cash flow must be multiplied in order to obtain the present value. For a zero-rate (also called spot rate) ''r'', taken from a [[yield curve]], and a time to cash flow ''T'' (in years), the discount factor is:\n\n: <math> DF(T) = \\frac{1}{(1+rT)}. </math>\n\nIn the case where the only discount rate one has is not a zero-rate (neither taken from a [[zero-coupon bond]] nor converted from a [[swap rate]] to a zero-rate through [[bootstrapping (finance)|bootstrapping]]) but an annually-compounded rate (for example if the benchmark is a US Treasury bond with annual coupons) and one only has its [[yield to maturity]], one would use an annually-compounded discount factor:\n\n: <math> DF(T) = \\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}. </math>\n\nHowever, when operating in a bank, where the amount the bank can lend (and therefore get interest) is linked to the value of its [[asset]]s (including [[accrued interest]]), traders usually use daily compounding to discount cash flows. Indeed, even if the interest of the bonds it holds (for example) is paid semi-annually, the value of its book of bond will increase daily, thanks to [[accrued interest]] being accounted for, and therefore the bank will be able to re-invest these daily accrued interest (by lending additional money or buying more financial products). In that case, the discount factor is then (if the usual [[money market]] [[day count convention]] for the currency is ACT/360, in case of currencies such as [[United States dollar]], [[euro]], [[Japanese yen]]), with ''r'' the zero-rate and ''T'' the time to cash flow in years:\n\n: <math> DF(T) = \\frac{1}{( 1 + \\frac{r}{360} )^{ 360T } } </math>\n\nor, in case the market convention for the currency being discounted is ACT/365 ([[AUD]], [[Canadian dollar|CAD]], [[GBP]]):\n\n: <math> DF(T) = \\frac{1}{( 1 + \\frac{r}{365} )^{ 365T } }. </math>\n\nSometimes, for manual calculation, the continuously-compounded hypothesis is a close-enough approximation of the daily-compounding hypothesis, and makes calculation easier (even though its application is limited to instruments such as financial derivatives).

The Class&nbsp;91s were given the auxiliary name of [[InterCity 225]] to indicate their envisaged top speed of {{convert|140|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}; they were also referred to as '''Electras''' by British Rail during their development and throughout the electrification of the East Coast Main Line. The other end of the InterCity 225 train set is formed of a Mark 4 [[Driving Van Trailer]], built with a similar body shell to the Class 91 locomotives. The locomotive body shells are of all-steel construction. Unusually, the motors are body mounted and drive bogie-mounted gearboxes via [[cardan shaft]]s. This reduces the [[unsprung mass]] and hence track wear at high speeds. The locomotive also features an underslung transformer, so that the body is relatively empty compared to contemporary electric locomotives.

The Class 91s then began service on King's Cross to Leeds trains on 11 March 1989, when 91008 with a rake of Intercity 125 Mark 3 coaches and power car 43068 worked the 1D32 06:50 Kings Cross to Leeds service. The set then worked 1A12, the 10:00 Leeds to London Kings Cross service.\n\nIn the early 1990s, after the cancellation of [[InterCity 250]], British Rail examined the option of ordering a further set of ten Class 91s to operate on the [[West Coast Main Line]] with UK Treasury support, however the business case for these failed to prove sufficiently worthwhile <ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Vincent\n  | first = Mike\n  | title = InterCity Story 1964-2012\n  | publisher = Oxford Publishing Company\n  | year = 2013\n  | isbn = 978-0860936527\n}}</ref> and led to the electric [[Networker (train)|Networker]] Classes [[British Rail Class 365|365]], [[British Rail Class 465|465]] and [[British Rail Class 466|466]] EMU Networker stock's procurement being taken forward.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:91115 at Kings Cross 4.jpg|thumb|91115 running blunt-end first at [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]]]]\n\nThe asymmetric body style is streamlined at one end to allow high-speed operation, with the fixed sets of Mark 4 coaches in normal push-pull passenger operation. An additional requirement of the design was that they could operate as normal locomotives. This led to a second cab being incorporated into the unstreamlined 'blunt end'. Operating with the blunt end first limits the maximum speed of the locomotive to {{convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, due to the aerodynamics of the pantograph's knuckle creating excessive uplift force on the OLE.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} \n\nIn July 2019, 91108 was the first of the class to be withdrawn.<ref>First Class 91 withdrawn from traffic by LNER ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 884 31 July 2019 page 28</ref>\n\n===Speed record===\nA Class 91, 91010 (now 91110), holds the British locomotive speed record at {{convert|161.7|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, set on 17 September 1989,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Class 91 hits 162 mph|page=5|issue=106|date=5\u201318 October 1989|magazine=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]|publisher=EMAP National Publications|issn=0953-4563|oclc=49953699}}</ref> just south of Little Bytham on a test run down Stoke Bank with the DVT leading.

When GNER lost their franchise in 2007, the red stripe was replaced by a white stripe containing the words National Express and East Coast. National Express East Coast originally planned to repaint all of their InterCity 225 sets in the white and silver NXEC corporate livery within two years. However, the collapse of NXEC in 2009 and its replacement with East Coast saw this repainting programme cancelled. As a result, 91111 was the only locomotive to receive the full National Express livery.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/emdjt42/5097274026/in/photostream/ 91111 East Coast Newcastle Central.] Flickr.

The Class&nbsp;91s were given the auxiliary name of [[InterCity 225]] to indicate their envisaged top speed of {{convert|140|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}; they were also referred to as '''Electras''' by British Rail during their development and throughout the electrification of the East Coast Main Line. The other end of the InterCity 225 train set is formed of a Mark 4 [[Driving Van Trailer]], built with a similar body shell to the Class 91 locomotives. The locomotive body shells are of all-steel construction. Unusually, the motors are body mounted and drive bogie-mounted gearboxes via [[cardan shaft]]s. This reduces the [[unsprung mass]] and hence track wear at high speeds. The locomotive also features an underslung transformer, so that the body is relatively empty compared to contemporary electric locomotives. Much of the engineering specification for the locomotive was derived from the research and operational experience of the [[Advanced Passenger Train|APT-P]].<ref name=\"jma\"/><ref>\"The Design and Development of the Class 91 Locomotive\", P J Donnison and G R West, Main Line Railway Electrification Conference 1989 - Proceedings of the Institute of Electrical Engineers, 1989.</ref><ref>\"The design, manufacture and assembly of the British Rail Class 91, 25 kV 225km/h locomotive\", M L Broom and G W Smart, Proceedings of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers Vol. 205, 1990.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn 1985, [[ASEA]], [[Brush Traction|Brush]] and [[General Electric Company|GEC Transportation Projects]]  tendered for the design and construction of the Class 91s.<ref>{{cite news |title= Managing Electra |authorlink=Roger Ford |author=Ford, Roger |work=[[Modern Railways]] |date=April 1988 |issn=0026-8356}}</ref> GEC subsequently won the bid and the fleet was built by sub-contractors [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]'s [[Crewe Works]] between 1988 and 1991.\n\nThe Class 91s began passenger service on 3 March 1989, when 91001 worked 1P26 17.36 London Kings Cross to Peterborough train. This train was formed of [[InterCity 125]] Mark 3 coaches and a [[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|Class 43]] power car, which had been converted for use as a [[Driving Van Trailer|DVT]] as the Mark 4 coaches were not then ready. The Class 91s then began service on King's Cross to Leeds trains on 11 March 1989, when 91008 with a rake of Intercity 125 Mark 3 coaches and power car 43068 worked the 1D32 06:50 Kings Cross to Leeds service. The set then worked 1A12, the 10:00 Leeds to London Kings Cross service.\n\nIn the early 1990s, after the cancellation of [[InterCity 250]], British Rail examined the option of ordering a further set of ten Class 91s to operate on the [[West Coast Main Line]] with UK Treasury support, however the business case for these failed to prove sufficiently worthwhile <ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Vincent\n  | first = Mike\n  | title = InterCity Story 1964-2012\n  | publisher = Oxford Publishing Company\n  | year = 2013\n  | isbn = 978-0860936527\n}}</ref> and led to the electric [[Networker (train)|Networker]] Classes [[British Rail Class 365|365]], [[British Rail Class 465|465]] and [[British Rail Class 466|466]] EMU Networker stock's procurement being taken forward.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:91115 at Kings Cross 4.jpg|thumb|91115 running blunt-end first at [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]]]]\n\nThe asymmetric body style is streamlined at one end to allow high-speed operation, with the fixed sets of Mark 4 coaches in normal push-pull passenger operation. An additional requirement of the design was that they could operate as normal locomotives. This led to a second cab being incorporated into the unstreamlined 'blunt end'. Operating with the blunt end first limits the maximum speed of the locomotive to {{convert|110|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, due to the aerodynamics of the pantograph's knuckle creating excessive uplift force on the OLE.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} \n\nIn July 2019, 91108 was the first of the class to be withdrawn.<ref>First Class 91 withdrawn from traffic by LNER ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 884 31 July 2019 page 28</ref>\n\n===Speed record===\nA Class 91, 91010 (now 91110), holds the British locomotive speed record at {{convert|161.7|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, set on 17 September 1989,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Class 91 hits 162 mph|page=5|issue=106|date=5\u201318 October 1989|magazine=[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]|publisher=EMAP National Publications|issn=0953-4563|oclc=49953699}}</ref> just south of Little Bytham on a test run down Stoke Bank with the DVT leading.

When GNER lost their franchise in 2007, the red stripe was replaced by a white stripe containing the words National Express and East Coast. National Express East Coast originally planned to repaint all of their InterCity 225 sets in the white and silver NXEC corporate livery within two years. However, the collapse of NXEC in 2009 and its replacement with East Coast saw this repainting programme cancelled. As a result, 91111 was the only locomotive to receive the full National Express livery.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/emdjt42/5097274026/in/photostream/ 91111 East Coast Newcastle Central.] Flickr.

Immediately after repainting into GNER colours in the late 1990s, all locomotives were briefly nameless. Having initially been applied to only a few locomotives in the early 1990s using cast-iron plates, eventually the whole fleet was named, many multiple times, until all were removed in 2008. In 2011, in response to customer requests, East Coast resumed the practice. It began by naming No. 91109 as ''[[Sir Bobby Robson]]'' with cast-iron plates, unveiled in a ceremony at [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle station]] on 29 March by his widow Elsie and [[Alan Shearer]].<ref name=BBC29Mar2011Train>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-12890755\n|title=Sir Bobby Robson name given to train\n|work=BBC News\n|date=29 March 2011\n|accessdate=29 March 2011\n}}</ref><ref name=EastCoastTrains29Mar2011>{{cite press release \n |url=http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/about-us/Press-Release/2011/EAST-COAST-NAMES-TRAIN-SIR-BOBBY-ROBSON/ \n |title=East Coast Names Train Sir Bobby Robson \n |publisher=East Coast \n |date=29 March 2011 \n |accessdate=29 March 2011 \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xXxVrMou?url=http://www.eastcoast.co.uk/about-us/Press-Release/2011/EAST-COAST-NAMES-TRAIN-SIR-BOBBY-ROBSON/ \n |archivedate=29 March 2011 \n |url-status=dead \n }}</ref>\n\nLocomotive 91023 was involved in both the [[Hatfield rail crash]] and the [[Great Heck rail crash]].
