The 16th [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated feature film]], it was released to theaters on January 29, 1959, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. This was the last Disney adaptation of a fairy tale for some years because of its initial mixed critical reception and underperformance at the box office; the studio did not return to the genre until 30 years later, after Walt Disney died in 1966, with the release of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989).\n\nIt features the voices of [[Mary Costa]], [[Eleanor Audley]], [[Verna Felton]], [[Barbara Luddy]], [[Barbara Jo Allen]], [[Bill Shirley]], [[Taylor Holmes]], and [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Les Clark]], [[Eric Larson]], and [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], under the supervision of [[Clyde Geronimi]], with additional story work by Joe Rinaldi, [[Winston Hibler]], [[Bill Peet]], [[Ted Sears]], [[Ralph Wright]], and Milt Banta. The film's musical score and songs, featuring the work of the [[Munich Symphony Orchestra|Graunke Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[George Bruns]], are arrangements or adaptations of numbers from the 1890 [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|''Sleeping Beauty'' ballet]] by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. However, unlike the previous feature films, this was the first Disney feature film that did not have the same background animation material, but instead it had new background animation material.\n\n''Sleeping Beauty'' was the first animated film to be photographed in the [[Super Technirama 70]] [[widescreen]] process, as well as the second full-length animated feature film to be filmed in anamorphic widescreen, following Disney's ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' four years earlier. The film was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in the first-run engagements. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Tartaglione|first=Nancy|title=National Film Registry Adds \u2018Purple Rain\u2019, \u2018Clerks\u2019, \u2018Gaslight\u2019 & More; \u2018Boys Don\u2019t Cry\u2019 One Of Record 7 Pics From Female Helmers|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 11, 2019|accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter many childless years, King Stefan and Queen Leah welcome a daughter, the Princess [[Aurora (Disney)|Aurora]]. A holiday is proclaimed to pay homage to the princess. At her [[Baptism|christening]], Aurora is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the son of King Stefan's closest friend King Hubert, to [[Jure uxoris|unite their kingdoms]].\n\nAmong the guests are the three [[Fairy|good fairies]], [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]]. Flora and Fauna bless Aurora with beauty and song, respectively, but Merryweather's gift is interrupted by the evil fairy [[Maleficent]], who is angry and insulted she was uninvited. As retaliation, Maleficent [[curse]]s the princess, proclaiming Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] of a [[spinning wheel]] and die. The King and Queen beg the fairies to undo the curse, but they are not powerful enough; Merryweather uses her magic to weaken the curse; instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep slumber, only broken by [[Romantic love|true love]]'s kiss. King Stefan orders all spinning wheels throughout the kingdom be burned. At the fairies' urging, the King and Queen reluctantly allow Aurora to live with the fairies, hidden in a cottage in the forest.\n\nAurora, renamed Briar Rose, grows into a beautiful young woman. On her sixteenth birthday, the fairies ask her to gather berries so they can prepare a surprise party. Aurora befriends the animals of the forest and sings them a song, \"[[Once Upon a Dream (Sleeping Beauty song)|Once Upon a Dream]]\". Phillip, now a handsome young man, follows Aurora's voice and is instantly struck by her beauty and grace. She is initially startled, as she is not allowed to talk to strangers, but she and Phillip fall in love. She invites him to meet her godmothers at the cottage that evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Flora and Merryweather argue over the color of Aurora's gown, their magic attracting the attention of Maleficent's raven who learns Aurora's location. Returning home, Aurora is thrilled to tell her guardians that she has fallen in love. The fairies finally tell Aurora that she is a princess, already betrothed to a prince, and she must never see the man again. Heartbroken, Aurora cries in her room. Phillip tells his father he wishes to marry a peasant girl, despite his betrothal to a princess and he is left devastated.\n\nThe fairies take Aurora to the castle to await her birthday celebrations and be reunited with her parents. Maleficent appears and lures Aurora into a dark tower and tricks her into touching the spindle of a cursed spinning wheel. Aurora pricks her finger, fulfilling the curse only moments before the sun sets. The three fairies place the sleeping Aurora on a bed in the highest tower and cast a powerful spell on everyone in the kingdom, [[Suspended animation in fiction|causing them to sleep]] until the spell on their princess is broken. After overhearing a sleepy conversation between the two kings, they realize that Phillip is the man Aurora loves. They rush to find him, but Maleficent has abducted him. She shows Phillip the sleeping Princess Aurora, and says she will lock him away until he is an old man on the verge of death. Only then will she release him to meet his love, who will not have aged a single day.\n\nThe fairies rescue Phillip, arming him with the magical Sword of Truth and Shield of Virtue. An enraged Maleficent surrounds the castle with thorns but fails to stop Phillip. She confronts him, transforming into a gigantic dragon. They battle, and Phillip throws the sword, blessed by the fairies, directly into Maleficent's heart, killing her.\n\nPhillip awakens Aurora with a kiss, breaking the spell and waking the kingdom. The royal couple descends to the ballroom, where Aurora is reunited with her parents. Flora and Merryweather resume their dispute over Aurora's gown while the happy couple dance, living happily ever after.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Role\n! Voice actor\n!

Aurora) wandering through the forest with her animal friends all the way to Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose running back home, promising Phillip they will meet again later in the evening. This was the only time Larson directed a sequence or a film during his tenure at [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]].\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', writing for ''Sleeping Beauty'' began in early 1951. Partial story elements originated from discarded ideas for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' including Maleficent's capture of Prince Philip and his dramatic escape from her fortress and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' where a fantasy sequence featured the leading protagonists dancing on a cloud which was developed, but eventually dropped from the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian|title=A Brief History of Walt Disney|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mscBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT50&lpg=PT50&dq=sleeping+beauty+snow+white+dancing+on+a+cloud&source=bl&ots=BnX8TcwlwM&sig=7tVg0Qw5VEiPgEIUvEern9k9yOs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFcQ6AEwC2oVChMI1bKMqLmuyAIVQvKACh0nwA2v#v=onepage&q=sleeping%20beauty%20snow%20white%20dancing%20on%20a%20cloud&f=false|isbn=978-0762454754|publisher=Running Press|date=December 9, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref> By the middle of 1953, director [[Wilfred Jackson]] had recorded the dialogue, assembled a story reel, and was to commence for preliminary animation work where Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip were to meet in the forest and dance, though Walt Disney decided to throw out the sequence delaying the film from its initial 1955 release date.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}} For a number of months, Jackson, [[Ted Sears]], and two story writers underwent a rewrite of the story, which received a lukewarm response from Disney. During the story rewriting process, the story writers felt the original fairy tale's second act felt bizarre and with the wake-up kiss serving as a climactic moment, they decided to concentrate on the first half finding strength in the romance. However, they felt little romance was developed between the strange prince and the princess that the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which the king organized a treasure hunt. The idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline. Instead, it was written that Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora would meet in the forest by random chance while Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose was conversing with the forest animals. Additionally, because the original Perrault tale had the curse last one hundred years, the writers decided to shorten it a few hours with the time spent for Prince Phillip to battle the goons, overcome several obstacles, and fight off against Maleficent transformed into a dragon.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=104}}\n\nThe name given to the princess by her royal birth parents is \"Aurora\" ([[Latin language|Latin]] for \"dawn\"), as it was in the original Tchaikovsky ballet. This name occurred in [[Charles Perrault]]'s version as well, not as the princess's name, but as her daughter's.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anne Heiner|first=Heidi|url=http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/notes.html#FORTY4|title=Annotations for Sleeping Beauty|publisher=SurLaLune Fairy Tales|date=1999}}</ref> In hiding, she is called Briar Rose, the name of the princess in the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s version variant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0410.html#grimm|last=Ashliman|first=D.L.|authorlink=D.

Named after [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], the character has the distinction of being the first Disney prince to have a name as the two princes in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' ([[Prince Charming|The Prince]]) and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' ([[Prince Charming]]) are never named.\n\nIn December 1953, Jackson suffered a heart attack, as a result of which directing animator [[Eric Larson]] of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] took over as director. By April 1954, ''Sleeping Beauty'' was scheduled for a February 1957 release.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}} With Larson as the director, Disney instructed Larson, whose unit would animate the forest sequence,<ref name=\"Geronimi-interview\">{{cite interview|url=http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Interviews/Geronimi/Geronimi.html|title=Gerry Geronimi \u2013 An Interview by Michael Barrier and Milton Gray|publisher=MichaelBarrier.com|subject=[[Clyde Geronimi]]|interviewer=Michael Barrier and Milton Gray|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref> that the picture was to be a \"moving illustration, the ultimate in animation\" and added that he did not care how long it would take. Because of the delays, the release date was again pushed back from Christmas 1957 to Christmas 1958.

When Hench returned to the Disney studios, he brought reproductions of the tapestries and showed them to Walt Disney, who replied, \"Yeah, we could use that style for ''Sleeping Beauty''.\"{{sfn|Thomas|1997|pp=104\u20135}}\n\n[[Eyvind Earle]] joined Walt Disney Productions in 1951 first employed as an assistant background painter for ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' before being promoted as a full-fledged background painter in the [[Goofy]] cartoon, \"For Whom the Bulls Toil\" and the color stylist of the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Award-winning]] short, ''[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom]]''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jul/25/local/me-58783|title=Eyvind Earle; Artist and Disney Painter|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 25, 2000|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref> For ''Sleeping Beauty'', Earle said he \"felt totally free to put my own style\" into the paintings he based on Hench's drawings stating \"Where his trees might have curved, I straightened them out\u2026. I took a Hench and took the same subject, and the composition he had, and just turned in into my style.\"{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=557}} Furthermore, Earle found inspiration in [[French Renaissance]] utilizing works from [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Limbourg Brothers]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Nicolaas van Eyck]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], as well as [[Iranian art|Persian art]] and Japanese prints.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=105}} When Geronimi became the supervising director, Earle and Geronimi entered furious creative differences. Geronimi commented that he felt Earle's paintings \"lacked the mood in a lot of things. All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's all well and good, but who the hell's going to look at that?  The backgrounds became more important than the animation. He'd made them more like [[Christmas card]]s.\"<ref name=\"Geronimi-interview\" /> Earle left the Disney studios in March 1958, before ''Sleeping Beauty'' was completed, to take a job at [[John Sutherland (producer)|John Sutherland Productions]]. As a result, Geronimi had Earle's background paintings softened and diluted from their distinctive medieval texture.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=558}}\n\n===Animation===\n====Live-action reference====\nBefore the animation process began, a live-action reference version was filmed with live actors in costume serving as models for the animators in which Walt Disney insisted on because he wanted the characters to appear \"as real as possible, near flesh-and-blood.\" However, Milt Kahl objected to this method, calling it \"a crutch, a stifling of the creative effort.

The role of King Stefan was modeled by [[Hans Conried]], who was both the voice and models of both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling from [[Peter Pan (1953 film)|''Peter Pan'']]. \n\n====Character animation====\nBecause of the artistic depth of Earle's backgrounds, it was decided for the characters to be stylized so they could appropriately match the backgrounds.<ref name=\"making-of\">{{cite DVD notes |title=Picture Perfect: The Making of ''Sleeping Beauty'' |type=Documentary film |publisher=[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] |id= |year=2009}}</ref> While the layout artists and animators were impressed with Earle's paintings, they eventually grew depressed at working with a style that many of them regarded as too cold, too flat, and too modernist for a fairy tale. Nevertheless, Walt insisted on the visual design claiming that the inspirational art he commissioned in the past had homogenized the animators.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=558}} [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] would complain to Ken Peterson, head of the animation department, of Earle's \"very rigid design\" because of the inhibiting effect on the animators that was less problematic than working with [[Mary Blair]]'s designs, in which Peterson would respond that the design style was Walt's decision, and that, like it or not, they had to use it.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=557}} Because of this, Thomas developed a red blotch on his face and had to visit the doctor each week to have it attended to. Production designer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] also complained: \"I had to fight myself to make myself draw that way.\" Another character animator on Aurora claimed their unit was so cautious about the drawings that the clean-up animators produced one drawing a day, which translated into one second of screen time per month.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=558\u201360}}\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Oreb was tasked as character stylist that would not only inhabit the style of the backgrounds, but also fit with the contemporary [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] style. Likewise with Earle's background styling, the animators complained that the character designs were too rigid to animate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laughingplace.com/w/blogs/alex-movie-blog/2014/10/06/from-the-vault-the-history-of-sleeping-beauty/|title=From the Vault: The History of \"Sleeping Beauty\"|last=Reif|first=Alex|publisher=The Laughing Place|date=October 6, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref> Oreb had originally designed Aurora to resemble actress [[Audrey Hepburn]], but according to animator [[Ron Dias]], \"Eyvind redesigned her.

Cartoons was closed when it was anticipated that [[3-D film]] would replace animation as a box office draw. Following the failure of 3-D, and the reversal of Warner's decision, Jones returned to the other studio. His work on ''Sleeping Beauty'', which he spent four months on, remained uncredited. Ironically, during his early years at Warner Bros., Jones was a heavy user of Disney-style animation until [[Tex Avery]] got Warner out of the Disney style. Another notable animator who worked on the film for part of its production was [[Don Bluth]], who worked as an assistant animator to Lounsbery. Bluth would leave after two years but eventually came back in the 1970s.\n\n===Casting===\nIn 1952, Mary Costa was invited to a dinner party where she sang \"[[When I Fall in Love]]\" at the then-named [[California Institute of the Arts|Los Angeles Conservatory of Music]].

The good fairies also appear in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', giving [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] new clothes. Diablo, Maleficent's raven, appears in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' to resurrect his defeated mistress. ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' features a world based on the movie, Enchanted Dominion, and characters who appear are Princess Aurora/Briar Rose, Maleficent, Maleficent's goons, the three faires and Prince Phillip, the latter serving as temporary party member for Aqua during her battle against Maleficent and her henchmen. Maleficent also returned in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.\n\nAurora is also a playable character in the game ''[[Disney Princess (video game)|Disney Princess]]''.\n\n===Board game===\n''Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty Game'' (1958) is a [[Parker Brothers]] children's [[board game]] for two to four players based upon ''Sleeping Beauty''. The object of the game is to be the first player holding three different picture cards to reach the castle and the space marked \"The End\".<ref name=\"Chertoff\">Chertoff, Nina, and Susan Kahn. ''Celebrating Board Games''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 2006</ref>\n\nThe Disney film retains the basics of [[Charles Perrault]]'s 17th-century fairy tale about a princess cursed to sleep one hundred years, but adds three elderly fairies who protect the princess, a prince armed with a magic sword and shield, and other details. The Disney twists on the tale are incorporated into the game, and Disney's \"stunning graphics\"<ref name=\"Chertoff\" /> illustrate the game board. In addition to the board game, the film generated books, toys, and other juvenile merchandise.\n\nThe equipment consists of a center-seamed game board, four tokens in various colors, four spinners, four magic wands, and a deck of picture cards.\n\nThe first player moves the number of spaces along the track according to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instructions. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand at any time during the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.\n\n===Theme parks===\n''Sleeping Beauty'' was made while [[Walt Disney]] was building [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] (hence the six-year production time). To help promote the film, [[Disney Imagineer|Imagineer]]s named the park's icon \"[[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]\" (it was originally to be Snow White's).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} An indoor walk-through exhibit was added to the empty castle interior in 1957, where guests could walk through the castle, up and over the castle entrance, viewing \"Story Moment\" dioramas of scenes from the film, which were improved with animated figurines in 1977. It closed shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], supposedly because the dark, unmonitored corridors were a risk.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} After being closed for seven years, the exhibit space underwent extensive refurbishment to restore the original 1957 displays, and reopened to guests on November 27, 2008. Accommodations were also made on the ground floor with a \"virtual\" version for disabled guests unable to navigate stairs. [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] opened in 2005, also with a Sleeping Beauty Castle, nearly replicating Disneyland's original design.\n\n''[[Le Ch\u00e2teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant]]'' at [[Disneyland Paris]] is a variant of Sleeping Beauty Castle. The version found at Disneyland Paris is much more reminiscent of the film's artistic direction. The ''Ch\u00e2teau'' features an animatronic dragon, imagineered to look like Maleficent's dragon form, is found in the lower level dungeon&nbsp;\u2013 ''La Tani\u00e8re du Dragon''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dlpguide.com/guidebook/disneyland-park/fantasyland/la-taniere-du-dragon/|title=La Tani\u00e8re du Dragon, Disneyland Paris|website=DLP Guide |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref> The building also contains ''[[La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant]]'', a gallery of displays which illustrate the story of Sleeping Beauty in tapestries, stained glass windows and figures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dlpguide.com/guidebook/disneyland-park/fantasyland/la-galerie-de-la-belle-au-bois-dormant/ |title=La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant, Disneyland Paris |website=DLP Guide |accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPrincess Aurora (and, to a lesser extent, Prince Phillip, Fauna, Flora and Merryweather, Maleficent and her goons) makes regular appearances in the parks and parades.\n\nMaleficent is featured as one of the villains in the nighttime show ''[[Fantasmic!]]'' at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] and [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].\n\n===Other appearances===\n* Maleficent's goons appear in the Maroon Cartoon studio lot in the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The Bluebirds from the film also appear as \"tweeting birds\" that fly around [[Roger Rabbit]]'s or [[Eddie Valiant]]'s heads in two scenes, after a refrigerator fell on top of Roger's head and while Eddie Valiant is in Toontown, the birds are seen again flying around his head until he shoos them away.\n* Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather were featured as guests in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' and Maleficent was one of the villains in ''[[Mickey's House of Villains]]''.\n* Although not a full-feature film sequel to the original, the first all-new story featuring the characters from the movie (sans Maleficent) appeared in ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', the first volume of collection of the [[Disney Princess]]es. It was released on September 4, 2007. [[Mary Costa]], the original voice of Princess Aurora, was not fond of this story and felt that it did not work.<ref>[http://www.dvdizzy.com/sleepingbeauty-interview2.html Mary Costa Interview \u2013 Page 2]. Retrieved November 13, 2012.</ref>\n* In the American fantasy drama series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', a live-action version of Maleficent appeared in the second episode and the [[Once Upon a Time (season 1)|Season 1]] finale, as she is an adversary of the Evil Queen, and is also sinister. She appears more prominently in the show's fourth season. Her role is played by ''[[True Blood]]'' actress [[Kristin Bauer]]. In [[Once Upon a Time (season 2)|Season 2]], [[Once Upon a Time (season 3)|Season 3]], and [[Once Upon a Time (season 4)|Season 4]] live-action incarnations of Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip, and King Stefan are portrayed by [[Sarah Bolger]], [[Julian Morris (actor)|Julian Morris]], and [[Sebastian Roch\u00e9]] respectively.\n* Flora, Fauna and Merryweather appear in Disney Channel/Disney Junior's series ''[[Sofia the First]]'' as the teaching faculty of Royal Prep, the school for the various kingdom's princes and princesses.

The 16th [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated feature film]], it was released to theaters on January 29, 1959, by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. This was the last Disney adaptation of a fairy tale for some years because of its initial mixed critical reception and underperformance at the box office; the studio did not return to the genre until 30 years later, after Walt Disney died in 1966, with the release of ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989).\n\nIt features the voices of [[Mary Costa]], [[Eleanor Audley]], [[Verna Felton]], [[Barbara Luddy]], [[Barbara Jo Allen]], [[Bill Shirley]], [[Taylor Holmes]], and [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]].\n\nThe film was directed by [[Les Clark]], [[Eric Larson]], and [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], under the supervision of [[Clyde Geronimi]], with additional story work by Joe Rinaldi, [[Winston Hibler]], [[Bill Peet]], [[Ted Sears]], [[Ralph Wright]], and Milt Banta. The film's musical score and songs, featuring the work of the [[Munich Symphony Orchestra|Graunke Symphony Orchestra]] under the direction of [[George Bruns]], are arrangements or adaptations of numbers from the 1890 [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|''Sleeping Beauty'' ballet]] by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]. However, unlike the previous feature films, this was the first Disney feature film that did not have the same background animation material, but instead it had new background animation material.\n\n''Sleeping Beauty'' was the first animated film to be photographed in the [[Super Technirama 70]] [[widescreen]] process, as well as the second full-length animated feature film to be filmed in anamorphic widescreen, following Disney's ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' four years earlier. The film was presented in Super Technirama 70 and 6-channel stereophonic sound in the first-run engagements. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Tartaglione|first=Nancy|title=National Film Registry Adds \u2018Purple Rain\u2019, \u2018Clerks\u2019, \u2018Gaslight\u2019 & More; \u2018Boys Don\u2019t Cry\u2019 One Of Record 7 Pics From Female Helmers|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/national-film-registry-2019-record-female-directors-boys-dont-cry-purple-rain-clerks-gaslight-platoon-full-list-1202806279/|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 11, 2019|accessdate=December 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter many childless years, King Stefan and Queen Leah welcome a daughter, the Princess [[Aurora (Disney)|Aurora]]. A holiday is proclaimed to pay homage to the princess. At her [[Baptism|christening]], Aurora is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the son of King Stefan's closest friend King Hubert, to [[Jure uxoris|unite their kingdoms]].\n\nAmong the guests are the three [[Fairy|good fairies]], [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather]]. Flora and Fauna bless Aurora with beauty and song, respectively, but Merryweather's gift is interrupted by the evil fairy [[Maleficent]], who is angry and insulted she was uninvited. As retaliation, Maleficent [[curse]]s the princess, proclaiming Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]] of a [[spinning wheel]] and die. The King and Queen beg the fairies to undo the curse, but they are not powerful enough; Merryweather uses her magic to weaken the curse; instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep slumber, only broken by [[Romantic love|true love]]'s kiss. King Stefan orders all spinning wheels throughout the kingdom be burned. At the fairies' urging, the King and Queen reluctantly allow Aurora to live with the fairies, hidden in a cottage in the forest.\n\nAurora, renamed Briar Rose, grows into a beautiful young woman. On her sixteenth birthday, the fairies ask her to gather berries so they can prepare a surprise party. Aurora befriends the animals of the forest and sings them a song, \"[[Once Upon a Dream (Sleeping Beauty song)|Once Upon a Dream]]\". Phillip, now a handsome young man, follows Aurora's voice and is instantly struck by her beauty and grace. She is initially startled, as she is not allowed to talk to strangers, but she and Phillip fall in love. She invites him to meet her godmothers at the cottage that evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Flora and Merryweather argue over the color of Aurora's gown, their magic attracting the attention of Maleficent's raven who learns Aurora's location. Returning home, Aurora is thrilled to tell her guardians that she has fallen in love. The fairies finally tell Aurora that she is a princess, already betrothed to a prince, and she must never see the man again. Heartbroken, Aurora cries in her room. Phillip tells his father he wishes to marry a peasant girl, despite his betrothal to a princess and he is left devastated.\n\nThe fairies take Aurora to the castle to await her birthday celebrations and be reunited with her parents. Maleficent appears and lures Aurora into a dark tower and tricks her into touching the spindle of a cursed spinning wheel. Aurora pricks her finger, fulfilling the curse only moments before the sun sets. The three fairies place the sleeping Aurora on a bed in the highest tower and cast a powerful spell on everyone in the kingdom, [[Suspended animation in fiction|causing them to sleep]] until the spell on their princess is broken. After overhearing a sleepy conversation between the two kings, they realize that Phillip is the man Aurora loves. They rush to find him, but Maleficent has abducted him. She shows Phillip the sleeping Princess Aurora, and says she will lock him away until he is an old man on the verge of death. Only then will she release him to meet his love, who will not have aged a single day.\n\nThe fairies rescue Phillip, arming him with the magical Sword of Truth and Shield of Virtue. An enraged Maleficent surrounds the castle with thorns but fails to stop Phillip. She confronts him, transforming into a gigantic dragon. They battle, and Phillip throws the sword, blessed by the fairies, directly into Maleficent's heart, killing her.\n\nPhillip awakens Aurora with a kiss, breaking the spell and waking the kingdom.

Aurora) wandering through the forest with her animal friends all the way to Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose running back home, promising Phillip they will meet again later in the evening. This was the only time Larson directed a sequence or a film during his tenure at [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]].\n\n==Production==\n===Story development===\nFollowing the critical and commercial success of ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', writing for ''Sleeping Beauty'' began in early 1951. Partial story elements originated from discarded ideas for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' including Maleficent's capture of Prince Philip and his dramatic escape from her fortress and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' where a fantasy sequence featured the leading protagonists dancing on a cloud which was developed, but eventually dropped from the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian|title=A Brief History of Walt Disney|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8mscBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT50&lpg=PT50&dq=sleeping+beauty+snow+white+dancing+on+a+cloud&source=bl&ots=BnX8TcwlwM&sig=7tVg0Qw5VEiPgEIUvEern9k9yOs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFcQ6AEwC2oVChMI1bKMqLmuyAIVQvKACh0nwA2v#v=onepage&q=sleeping%20beauty%20snow%20white%20dancing%20on%20a%20cloud&f=false|isbn=978-0762454754|publisher=Running Press|date=December 9, 2014|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref> By the middle of 1953, director [[Wilfred Jackson]] had recorded the dialogue, assembled a story reel, and was to commence for preliminary animation work where Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip were to meet in the forest and dance, though Walt Disney decided to throw out the sequence delaying the film from its initial 1955 release date.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=554}} For a number of months, Jackson, [[Ted Sears]], and two story writers underwent a rewrite of the story, which received a lukewarm response from Disney. During the story rewriting process, the story writers felt the original fairy tale's second act felt bizarre and with the wake-up kiss serving as a climactic moment, they decided to concentrate on the first half finding strength in the romance. However, they felt little romance was developed between the strange prince and the princess that the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which the king organized a treasure hunt. The idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline. Instead, it was written that Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora would meet in the forest by random chance while Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose was conversing with the forest animals. Additionally, because the original Perrault tale had the curse last one hundred years, the writers decided to shorten it a few hours with the time spent for Prince Phillip to battle the goons, overcome several obstacles, and fight off against Maleficent transformed into a dragon.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=104}}\n\nThe name given to the princess by her royal birth parents is \"Aurora\" ([[Latin language|Latin]] for \"dawn\"), as it was in the original Tchaikovsky ballet.

I took a Hench and took the same subject, and the composition he had, and just turned in into my style.\"{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=557}} Furthermore, Earle found inspiration in [[French Renaissance]] utilizing works from [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Limbourg Brothers]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Nicolaas van Eyck]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], as well as [[Iranian art|Persian art]] and Japanese prints.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=105}} When Geronimi became the supervising director, Earle and Geronimi entered furious creative differences. Geronimi commented that he felt Earle's paintings \"lacked the mood in a lot of things. All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's all well and good, but who the hell's going to look at that?  The backgrounds became more important than the animation. He'd made them more like [[Christmas card]]s.\"<ref name=\"Geronimi-interview\" /> Earle left the Disney studios in March 1958, before ''Sleeping Beauty'' was completed, to take a job at [[John Sutherland (producer)|John Sutherland Productions]]. As a result, Geronimi had Earle's background paintings softened and diluted from their distinctive medieval texture.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=558}}\n\n===Animation===\n====Live-action reference====\nBefore the animation process began, a live-action reference version was filmed with live actors in costume serving as models for the animators in which Walt Disney insisted on because he wanted the characters to appear \"as real as possible, near flesh-and-blood.\" However, Milt Kahl objected to this method, calling it \"a crutch, a stifling of the creative effort.

After doing some modeling, Conried recorded some dialogues and was later replaced by Taylor Holmes, which marks this film as his final film role.\n\n====Character animation====\nBecause of the artistic depth of Earle's backgrounds, it was decided for the characters to be stylized so they could appropriately match the backgrounds.<ref name=\"making-of\">{{cite DVD notes |title=Picture Perfect: The Making of ''Sleeping Beauty'' |type=Documentary film |publisher=[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] |id= |year=2009}}</ref> While the layout artists and animators were impressed with Earle's paintings, they eventually grew depressed at working with a style that many of them regarded as too cold, too flat, and too modernist for a fairy tale. Nevertheless, Walt insisted on the visual design claiming that the inspirational art he commissioned in the past had homogenized the animators.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=558}} [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] would complain to Ken Peterson, head of the animation department, of Earle's \"very rigid design\" because of the inhibiting effect on the animators that was less problematic than working with [[Mary Blair]]'s designs, in which Peterson would respond that the design style was Walt's decision, and that, like it or not, they had to use it.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=557}} Because of this, Thomas developed a red blotch on his face and had to visit the doctor each week to have it attended to. Production designer [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] also complained: \"I had to fight myself to make myself draw that way.\" Another character animator on Aurora claimed their unit was so cautious about the drawings that the clean-up animators produced one drawing a day, which translated into one second of screen time per month.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=558\u201360}}\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Oreb was tasked as character stylist that would not only inhabit the style of the backgrounds, but also fit with the contemporary [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]] style.

Following the failure of 3-D, and the reversal of Warner's decision, Jones returned to the other studio. His work on ''Sleeping Beauty'', which he spent four months on, remained uncredited. Ironically, during his early years at Warner Bros., Jones was a heavy user of Disney-style animation until [[Tex Avery]] got Warner out of the Disney style. Another notable animator who worked on the film for part of its production was [[Don Bluth]], who worked as an assistant animator to Lounsbery. Bluth would leave after two years but eventually came back in the 1970s.\n\n===Casting===\nIn 1952, Mary Costa was invited to a dinner party where she sang \"[[When I Fall in Love]]\" at the then-named [[California Institute of the Arts|Los Angeles Conservatory of Music]].

The object of the game is to be the first player holding three different picture cards to reach the castle and the space marked \"The End\".<ref name=\"Chertoff\">Chertoff, Nina, and Susan Kahn. ''Celebrating Board Games''. Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., 2006</ref>\n\nThe Disney film retains the basics of [[Charles Perrault]]'s 17th-century fairy tale about a princess cursed to sleep one hundred years, but adds three elderly fairies who protect the princess, a prince armed with a magic sword and shield, and other details. The Disney twists on the tale are incorporated into the game, and Disney's \"stunning graphics\"<ref name=\"Chertoff\" /> illustrate the game board. In addition to the board game, the film generated books, toys, and other juvenile merchandise.\n\nThe equipment consists of a center-seamed game board, four tokens in various colors, four spinners, four magic wands, and a deck of picture cards.\n\nThe first player moves the number of spaces along the track according to a dial spin. If the player lands on a pink star, his turn ends. If he lands on a yellow star, he draws a card and follows its instructions. If he draws a picture card, he retains it face down at his place. If a player spins a six, he is given the choice of moving six spaces or taking a magic wand. He may play the wand at any time during the game and in doing so draws two cards, following their instructions. A player must hold three different picture cards before entering the Path of Happiness. If he does not hold three picture cards, he continues around the Deep Sleep circle until he acquires the required three picture cards. Should a player land on a purple Maleficent space, that player returns one of his picture cards to the deck.\n\n===Theme parks===\n''Sleeping Beauty'' was made while [[Walt Disney]] was building [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] (hence the six-year production time). To help promote the film, [[Disney Imagineer|Imagineer]]s named the park's icon \"[[Sleeping Beauty Castle]]\" (it was originally to be Snow White's).{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} An indoor walk-through exhibit was added to the empty castle interior in 1957, where guests could walk through the castle, up and over the castle entrance, viewing \"Story Moment\" dioramas of scenes from the film, which were improved with animated figurines in 1977. It closed shortly after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], supposedly because the dark, unmonitored corridors were a risk.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} After being closed for seven years, the exhibit space underwent extensive refurbishment to restore the original 1957 displays, and reopened to guests on November 27, 2008. Accommodations were also made on the ground floor with a \"virtual\" version for disabled guests unable to navigate stairs. [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] opened in 2005, also with a Sleeping Beauty Castle, nearly replicating Disneyland's original design.\n\n''[[Le Ch\u00e2teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant]]'' at [[Disneyland Paris]] is a variant of Sleeping Beauty Castle.

{"title_page": "United States presidential approval rating", "text_new": "{{use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}\nIn the '''United States, presidential job approval ratings''' were introduced by [[George Gallup]] in the late 1930s (estimated to be 1937) to gauge public support for the [[president of the United States]] during their term. An approval rating is a percentage determined by a polling which indicates the percentage of respondents to an opinion poll who approve of a particular person or program. Typically, an approval rating is given to a [[politician]] based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure. A question might ask: \n<br />\ndisapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?<ref name=\"Donald Trump Gallup Polling Data\" />\n\nLike most surveys that predict opinions, individual poll results may be inaccurate. Many unscientific approval rating systems exist that show inaccurate statistics. Examples that self select, such as online questions are of this type.

An approval rating is a percentage determined by a polling which indicates the percentage of respondents to an opinion poll who approve of a particular person or program. Typically, an approval rating is given to a [[politician]] based on responses to a poll in which a sample of people are asked whether they approve or disapprove of that particular political figure. A question might ask: \n<br />\n:Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?<ref name=\"Donald Trump Gallup Polling Data\" />\n\nLike most surveys that predict opinions, individual poll results may be inaccurate. Many unscientific approval rating systems exist that show inaccurate statistics. Examples that self select, such as online questions are of this type.

Additional variants with a single-stack magazine (XD-S), an external [[Hammer (firearm)|hammer]] (XD-E), or generational updates (Mod.2) are unique to the American market.\n{{main|Springfield Armory XD}}\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:HS 2000 cal. 9x19.JPG|thumb|right|An HS2000 with magazine removed]]\nThe HS2000 is a [[Recoil operation#Short recoil operation|short recoil]]-operated, locked breech, [[Firing Pin#Striker construction|striker fired]] [[semi-automatic pistol]]. Pistols in the series utilize a polymer frame with steel inserts, mounting rail and trigger-mounted [[Safety (firearms)|safety]]. A cocked striker indicator protrudes from the rear of the slide when the striker is cocked. A [[loaded chamber indicator]] pivots up on top of the slide when a round is in the chamber being both visual and tactile. An ambidextrous magazine release is also standard. Take down of the pistol is through a lever on the left side of the frame that rotates up, allowing the slide to move forward off the frame. This is very similar to the mechanism of take down as seen in pistols manufactured by [[SIG Sauer]]. The trigger does not have to be pulled for the pistol to be disassembled, unlike some of its competitors (and even early versions of the XD). The factory-standard trigger has a travel of 13&nbsp;mm (0.5&nbsp;in) and is rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Most HS2000s have dual captive recoil springs; however, the XDM and Tactical {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} models have non-captive springs. The recoil spring guide rod also acts as a standoff device, as the end of the rod protrudes from under the barrel and keeps the slide [[Out-of-battery|in battery]] when pressed against an object such as someones's chest in contact-distance self-defense situations.  This prevents the slide from being moved back because the device pushes the surface area of objects away from the slide, thus increasing the chance that the gun will function normally.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter heat treatment the metal parts are finished with a proprietary [[nitriding]] process called [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing#Salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing|Tenifer Plus+]]. This finish is characterized by extreme wear and corrosion resistance; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth. The Tenifer Plus+ process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 64 [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell C]] hardness rating and a 1,200\u20131,300&nbsp;N/mm<sup>2</sup> tensile strength. This finish makes the HS2000 particularly suitable for [[concealed carry]], as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.\n\nThe HS2000 has a [[Grip safety|grip safety]] that will not allow the pistol to fire without depressing a lever on the rear of the grip. This feature is present on some older pistols such as the [[M1911]]. Unlike the 1911, the grip safety on HS2000 series also locks the slide.  The means without a proper grip on the gun to depress the grip safety, the slide cannot be cycled to load or clear the gun. In addition to a [[Trigger safety|trigger safety,]] a [[Drop safety|drop safety]] prevents the striker from releasing if the gun is dropped or exposed to a significant impact. As of 2008, {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} XD Service models chambered in .45 ACP were available with an optional ambidextrous frame-mounted thumb safety.\n\nThe HS2000 is fed by staggered-column (otherwise known as \"double-stack\") detachable [[box magazine]]s that are made of polished stainless steel with a polymer basepad. The empty weight of a standard-sized HS2000 box magazine is {{convert|80|g|abbr=on}}.\n\n===XDM===\nXDM pistols are polymer-framed with full steel inserts and a mounting rail, with a [[Match grade|match grade]] barrel and trigger, and an ambidextrous magazine release. These barrels are manufactured to tighter tolerances and custom-fitted for better accuracy and to make the pistol \"competition ready\".\n\nFeaturing an \"all terrain\" grip pattern, contours in the grip were designed to maximize control. Serrations on the slide were modified for a better grasp. All XDM pistols come with grip and trigger safety mechanisms and a loaded chamber indicator at the top of the gun just behind the barrel. A traditional manual safety is an optional feature. The surface of the metal has undergone a [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing#Salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing|Melonite]] treatment, a salt bath nitriding process which leaves a hard, corrosion-resistant surface. Disassembling the gun does not require pulling the trigger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the-m-factor.com/html/design.html |title=XDM Design |website=the-m-factor.com |publisher=Springfield Armory, Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608104923/http://the-m-factor.com/html/design.html |archive-date=June 8, 2010 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}</ref>\n\nThe XDM chambered in .45 ACP is offered in three different models with {{convert|3.8|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|5.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} inch barrels. Each of these models has a 13+1 capacity (13 rounds in the magazine, plus one round in the chamber), while the highest capacity for 9mm models is 19+1. The 3.8-inch model is also available with a compact magazine that holds nine rounds, which reduces grip length by {{convert|1|in|mm}} for a more comfortable concealed carry option.\n\n== Variants ==\n{{asof|2020|3}}, the following models and chamberings are listed on the HS Produkt website:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size: 95%;\"\n!

The factory-standard trigger has a travel of 13&nbsp;mm (0.5&nbsp;in) and is rated at {{convert|25|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Most HS2000s have dual captive recoil springs; however, the XDM and Tactical {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} models have non-captive springs. The recoil spring guide rod also acts as a standoff device, as the end of the rod protrudes from under the barrel and keeps the slide [[Out-of-battery|in battery]] when pressed against an object such as someones's chest in contact-distance self-defense situations.  This prevents the slide from being moved back because the device pushes the surface area of objects away from the slide, thus increasing the chance that the gun will function normally.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter heat treatment the metal parts are finished with a proprietary [[nitriding]] process called [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing#Salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing|Tenifer Plus+]]. This finish is characterized by extreme wear and corrosion resistance; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth. The Tenifer Plus+ process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 64 [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell C]] hardness rating and a 1,200\u20131,300&nbsp;N/mm<sup>2</sup> tensile strength. This finish makes the HS2000 particularly suitable for [[concealed carry]], as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.\n\nThe HS2000 has a [[Grip safety|grip safety]] that will not allow the pistol to fire without depressing a lever on the rear of the grip. This feature is present on some older pistols such as the [[M1911]]. Unlike the 1911, the grip safety on HS2000 series also locks the slide.  The means without a proper grip on the gun to depress the grip safety, the slide cannot be cycled to load or clear the gun. In addition to a [[Trigger safety|trigger safety,]] a [[Drop safety|drop safety]] prevents the striker from releasing if the gun is dropped or exposed to a significant impact. As of 2008, {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} XD Service models chambered in .45 ACP were available with an optional ambidextrous frame-mounted thumb safety.\n\nThe HS2000 is fed by staggered-column (otherwise known as \"double-stack\") detachable [[box magazine]]s that are made of polished stainless steel with a polymer basepad. The empty weight of a standard-sized HS2000 box magazine is {{convert|80|g|abbr=on}}.\n\n===XDM===\nXDM pistols are polymer-framed with full steel inserts and a mounting rail, with a [[Match grade|match grade]] barrel and trigger, and an ambidextrous magazine release. These barrels are manufactured to tighter tolerances and custom-fitted for better accuracy and to make the pistol \"competition ready\".\n\nFeaturing an \"all terrain\" grip pattern, contours in the grip were designed to maximize control. Serrations on the slide were modified for a better grasp. All XDM pistols come with grip and trigger safety mechanisms and a loaded chamber indicator at the top of the gun just behind the barrel. A traditional manual safety is an optional feature. The surface of the metal has undergone a [[Ferritic nitrocarburizing#Salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing|Melonite]] treatment, a salt bath nitriding process which leaves a hard, corrosion-resistant surface. Disassembling the gun does not require pulling the trigger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the-m-factor.com/html/design.html |title=XDM Design |website=the-m-factor.com |publisher=Springfield Armory, Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608104923/http://the-m-factor.com/html/design.html |archive-date=June 8, 2010 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}</ref>\n\nThe XDM chambered in .45 ACP is offered in three different models with {{convert|3.8|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|5.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} inch barrels.

It is this level of difficulty that distinguishes sim racing from \"[[Arcade racing|arcade]]\" driving games where real-world variables are taken out of the equation and the principal objective is to create a sense of speed as opposed to a sense of realism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arcade vs Simulation \u2013 What does it all really mean?|url=https://simtorque.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/arcade-vs-simulation-what-does-it-all-really-mean/|publisher=Simtorque|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn general, sim racing applications, such as ''[[rFactor]]'', ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', ''[[NASCAR Racing (video game)|NASCAR Racing]]'', ''[[Race 07]]'', ''[[EA Sports F1 series|F1 Challenge '99\u2013'02]]'', ''[[F1 2018 (video game)|F1 '18]]-[[F1 2019 (video game)|'19]]'', ''[[Assetto Corsa]]'', ''[[GTR 2]]'', ''[[Project CARS]]'', ''[[iRacing]]'' and ''[[Richard Burns Rally]]'' are less popular than [[Arcade racing|arcade-style games]], mainly because much more skill and practice is required to master them.  An exception is ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'', which has achieved worldwide fame,<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> as have \"simcade\" titles such as ''[[Forza (series)|Forza Motorsport]]'',  ''[[Colin McRae Rally]]'', [[F1 2009 (video game)|F1 '09]]-[[F1 2017 (video game)|'17]]  and ''[[NASCAR Heat Evolution]]''. Also, because of the demands on the computer system, race sims require faster computers to run effectively, as well as a somewhat costly steering wheel and pedals for the throttle and brakes. Most arcade-style driving games can be played with a simple joystick controller or even a mouse and keyboard.\n\nWith the development of online racing capability, the ability to drive against human opponents as opposed to [[Game AI|computer AI]] is the closest many will come to driving real cars on a real track. Even those who race in real-world competition use simulations for practice or for entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Game Review|url=http://www.racerchicks.com/motor/Review_NASCAR4.html|publisher=racerchicks.com|accessdate=2008-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011101054017/http://racerchicks.com/motor/Review_NASCAR4.html|archivedate=2001-11-01}}</ref> With continued development of the [[physics engine]] software that forms the basis of these sims, as well as improved hardware (providing tactile feedback), the experience is becoming more realistic.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{Reduce trivia|date=December 2016|sect=y}}\n{{cleanup|section|date=January 2017|reason= This section should be a text about Racing Simulators development and improvement in the world of simulation, not just a list of the releases.}}}}\n\n===Early arcade years===\nPrior to the division between arcade-style racing and sim racing, the earliest attempts at providing driving simulation experiences were arcade [[racing video game]]s, dating back to ''[[Pole Position (video game)|Pole Position]]'',<ref>[[IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society|IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Council]] & [[IEEE Electron Devices Society]] (October 1\u20133, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TpVVAAAAMAAJ ''2000 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference proceedings''], p. 65, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], {{ISBN|0-7803-5971-2}}</ref> a 1982 [[arcade game]] developed by [[Namco]], which the game's publisher [[Atari]] publicized for its \"unbelievable driving realism\" in providing a [[Formula 1]] experience behind a [[racing wheel]] at the time. It featured other [[artificial intelligence|AI]] cars to race against, crashes caused by [[Collision detection|collisions]] with other vehicles and roadside signs, and introduced a qualifying lap concept where the player needs to complete a [[time trial]] before they can compete in [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] races.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9063|name=Pole Position}}</ref> It also pioneered the [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] rear-view perspective used in most racing games since then, with the track's vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance.<ref>Bernard Perron & Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), ''Video game theory reader two'', p. 157, [[Taylor & Francis]], {{ISBN|0-415-96282-X}}</ref>\n\n''[[Pole Position II]]'' was released in 1983 and featured several improvements like giving the player the choice of different race courses.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9064|name=Pole Position II}}</ref> ''[[TX-1]]'', developed by Tatsumi in 1983,<ref>[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=5911 TX-1], The Arcade Flyer Archive, [[Killer List of Videogames]]</ref> was licensed to Namco,<ref name=TX-1/> who in turn licensed it to Atari in America,<ref name=TX-1/> thus the game is considered a successor to ''Pole Position II''.<ref name=TX-1/> ''TX-1'', however, placed a greater emphasis on realism, with details such as forcing players to brake or downshift the gear during corners to avoid the risk of losing control, and let go of the accelerator when going into a skid in order to regain control of the steering. It also used [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] technology, which caused the steering wheel to vibrate, and the game also featured a unique three-screen arcade display for a more [[2.5D|three-dimensional]] perspective of the track. It also introduced [[nonlinear gameplay]] by allowing players to choose which path to drive through after each checkpoint, eventually leading to one of eight possible [[Multiple endings|final destinations]].<ref name=TX-1>{{KLOV game|id=10004|name=TX-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, [[Sega]]'s ''[[Hang-On]]'', a popular [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] style rear-view motorbike racer,<ref name=Hang-On>{{KLOV game|id=8068|name=Hang On}}</ref> was considered the first full-body-experience video game,<ref name=\"gamecentercx\">[[Retro Game Master|GameCenter CX]] \u2013 2nd Season, Episode 13</ref> and was regarded as the first motorbike simulator for its realism at the time, in both the handling of the player's motorbike and the AI of the computer-controlled motorcyclists.<ref name=Hang-On/> It used [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] technology and was also one of the first [[arcade game]]s to use [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit graphics]] and Sega's \"Super Scaler\" technology that allowed [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)#Move to 3D|sprite-scaling]] at high [[frame rate]]s.<ref>[http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p3.html IGN Presents the History of SEGA: World War], [[IGN]]</ref>\n\nThe following year, [[Konami]] released ''[[WEC Le Mans]]'', an early car driving simulator based on the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. It attempted to realistically simulate car driving, with the car jumping up and down, turning back and forth, and spinning up to 180 degrees, with an emphasis on acceleration, braking, and gear shifting, along with the need for counter-steering to avoid spin-outs. It also featured a day-night cycle, accurately simulated courses approved by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]], and force feedback to simulate road vibration in the form of a vibrating steering wheel that reacts to the driver's acceleration and off-road bumps.<ref>{{KLOV game|10383|WEC Le Mans 24}}</ref>\n\nThe first racing game with simulation pretensions on a home system is believed to have been ''[[Chequered Flag (video game)|Chequered Flag]]'', released by Psion on the 8-bit [[ZX Spectrum]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]]. ''[[REVS (computer game)|REVS]]'', followed in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]]. ''REVS'' was a [[Formula Three|Formula 3]] sim that delivered a semi-realistic driving experience by [[Geoff Crammond]] that ran on the [[Commodore 64]] and [[BBC Micro|BBC]]. ''REVS'' had a big fan base in England, but not so much in the United States.<ref name=GSpot-Papyrus/> This was then superseded by the widely popular ''[[Hard Drivin']]'' which was an arcade and home computing staple released in 1989, and one of the most widely played simulators up to that point.\n\n===Emergence of sim racing genre===\nSim racing is generally acknowledged to have really taken off in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] with the introduction of [[Papyrus Design Group]]'s ''[[Indianapolis 500: The Simulation]]'', designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari on 16-bit computer hardware. The game is often generally regarded as the personal computer's first true auto racing simulation. Unlike most other racing games at the time, ''Indianapolis 500'' attempted to simulate realistic [[Game physics|physics]] and [[telemetry]], such as its portrayal of the relationship between the four contact patches and the pavement, as well as the loss of grip when making a high-speed turn, forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle-to-brake interaction. It also featured a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle, including adjustments to the tires, shocks and wings.<ref name=GSpot-Papyrus>{{cite web|title=The History of Papyrus Racing \u2013 Page 2|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6103365/p-2.html|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> With ''Indy 500'', players could race the full {{convert|500|mi|km}}, where even a blowout after {{convert|450|mi|km}} would take the player out of the competition. The simulation sold over 200,000 copies. It was around this time that sim racing began distinguishing itself from arcade-style racing.\n\nConsoles saw the release of [[Human Entertainment]]'s ''[[Fastest 1]]'' for the [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] in 1991. It was considered the most realistic [[Formula 1]] racing simulation up until that time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ajisuke.fc2web.com/f1.htm| title = Basic overview of ''Fastest 1'' | publisher = FC2Web  | date = | accessdate = 2012-06-27|language=ja}}</ref>\n\nThe next major milestone was the 1992 release of ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond)|Formula One Grand Prix]]'' (AKA ''World Circuit'' in some markets) by [[MicroProse]], also developed by Geoff Crammond. This moved the genre along significantly. Multiplayer was made possible by allowing different drivers to take turns, and racers could also hook up their machines for racing via a [[null modem]] cable. This only allowed two drivers to race. Leagues emerged where drivers would submit records of their single player races to compare with other drivers. This is the first sim in which drafting/slip streaming was possible.\n\nPapyrus followed up Indy 500 with ''[[IndyCar Racing]]'' in 1993 and F1GP was surpassed in all areas. Papyrus later released more tracks and a final expansion included the Indy 500 track plus a paintkit. Now drivers could easily customize their cars. ''IndyCar Racing'' sold around 300,000 copies.\n\nThe first variant of Papyrus' ''[[NASCAR Racing]]'' series was launched in 1994. In [[SVGA]] (640\u00d7480) it pushed the PCs of the time to the limit. Suddenly a resolution of 320\u00d7200 seemed a poor option and ''NASCAR Racing'' was the race sim of choice for anyone with a capable PC, particularly in North America. It was the first sim where cars no longer looked like boxes. It keyed in on sophisticated physics modeling. ''NASCAR Racing'' sold over one million units. Moreover, the first real online racing started with ''NASCAR Racing'' using the \"Hawaii\" dial-in servers and it was not uncommon for these early sim racers to have $300 to $1500 phone bills. Online racing had seen its first true realization, and to many, this was the dawn of \"real\" sim racing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffdrivesim.html?topic=gaming&topic_set=newmedia|author=Rob Riddell|title=Hard Drive \u2014 The parallel universe of auto racing simulation is about to collide with reality|website=[[Wired.com]]|date=February 1997|accessdate=2011-01-13}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the release of ''[[IndyCar Racing II]]'', updating the first version with the new NASCAR graphics engine. A year later, [[MicroProse]] released the successor to F1GP, ''[[Grand Prix 2 (game)|Grand Prix 2]]'', to much anticipation. ''GP2'' became successful not just because of its detailed and thorough simulation of the 1994 Formula 1 season, but also because it was customizable; this was achievable by way of the online community. Players could change everything about the game: drivers, teams, graphics, physics, car shapes, and eventually even the racetracks. Offline leagues reached their peak with ''GP2'' in 1998.\n\nIn 1996, ''[[NASCAR Racing 2]]'' was released, further improving the original, and the number of sim racers exploded. The [[Total Entertainment Network|TEN]] multiplayer hosting service was introduced and went live in November 1997 with the backing of NASCAR and the online sim racing community grew.\n\nIn 1997, ''[[Gran Turismo (1997 video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' was released for the [[PlayStation]]. It was considered the most realistic racing simulation for consoles at the time, featuring a wealth of meticulous tuning options and an [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]] [[Be-a-pro mode|career mode]] where players had to undertake [[driving test]]s to acquire [[Driver's license|driving licenses]], earn their way into races and choose their own career path.<ref name=\"GameSpot\">[http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-greatest-games-of-all-time-gran-turismo/1100-6148640/ The Greatest Games of All Time: ''Gran Turismo''], [[GameSpot]]</ref> It introduced the racing simulation genre to [[home console]]s,<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/><ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|last=Reilly |first=Luke |url=http://ign.com/articles/2015/04/03/the-top-10-most-influential-racing-games-ever?page=2 |title=The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever |website=IGN |accessdate=2019-07-23}}</ref> becoming the basis for all modern racing simulations on [[video game console]]s.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n===Graphic accelerators era===\nGraphics accelerator cards brought a new level of realism to the graphics and physics of sim racing games. These new [[graphics processing unit]]s provided [[texture mapping]], [[Spatial anti-aliasing|antialiasing]], [[Particle system|particle effects]] (i.e. fog, rain and snow), [[High dynamic range rendering|HDR]] and the capability to perform polygonal calculations faster, while taking the load off of the main processor. ''[[F1 Racing Simulation]]'' by [[Ubisoft]], was among the first to utilize the new technology in 1997.\n\nAfter years of development, Microprose released ''[[Grand Prix 3]]'', which used a more modern graphics engine and featured the same customizable structure of ''GP2''. ''GP3'' was ultimately seen as a bit of a disappointment though, lacking proper network-multiplayer-support and using only an evolution of the GP2 graphic-engine. Still, its similarity allowed easy track conversions back and forth.\n\nAnother milestone in sim racing came in 1998 with the release of ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'' (GPL) from Papyrus, based on 1967 F1 season. It was hailed as outstanding in all areas, but especially the physics and online multiplayer capability. For many, their first real experience with online racing was GPL, or the later variants of ''NASCAR'' that used the ''GPL'' engine. The release of a third-party add-on for GPL\u2014VROC (Virtual Racers Online Connection)\u2014allowed racers to join together online and race in leagues.\n\nDespite its age, ''GPL'' has remained a top class sim even in 2008 thanks to a strong community, who collectively have updated the graphics to utilize the current CPU and graphics capabilities and have created loads of add-on tracks of a high quality. Modding teams have managed to create new physics sets and a 1965, 1966 and 1969 variants are now available with many improvements over the original.\n\nWired magazine wrote an in-depth article about racing sims called Hard Drive in their February 1997 issue.[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffdrivesim_pr.html] [[TORCS]] was created in 1997, as an open source car racing simulator.\n\n[[Sega AM2]]'s 1999 arcade game ''[[Ferrari F355 Challenge]]'', later ported to the [[Dreamcast]] in 2000, was considered the most accurate simulation of the [[Ferrari F355]] possible up until that time; its focus on realism was considered unusual for an arcade game at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=F355 Challenge: It's hard.

Unlike the Papyrus sims, the physics are easily modified, and a large community has developed dedicated to modifying the ISI sims. One such modding team, [[Simbin]], have created their own company and have released several games, including ''[[GTR \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game]]'', ''[[GT Legends]]'', ''[[GTR - FIA GT Racing Game 2|GTR 2]]'', ''[[Race \u2013 The Official WTCC Game|RACE \u2013 The Official WTCC Game]]'', ''[[Race 07|RACE 07]]'', ''[[STCC \u2013 The Game]]'', ''[[GTR Evolution]]'' and ''[[Race On]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Simbin Game titles|url=http://www.simbin.se/main/games.htm|publisher=simbin.se|accessdate=2008-02-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222205448/http://www.simbin.se/main/games.htm|archivedate=2008-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Recent developments===\nIn 2003, a 3-man team began developing ''[[Live for Speed]]''. Phase 2 brought in many updates, including the first real cars (the [[BMW Sauber]] F1 car being included in those). The third and final phase of the development cycle was launched in 2015, featuring the [[VW Scirocco]] and the first real-world circuit, the [[Rockingham Motor Speedway]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Live For Speed \u2013 Rockingham coming to LFS|url=http://www.lfs.net/?page=rockingham|accessdate=2009-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Live For Speed \u2013 New Tyre Physics|url=http://www.lfs.net/|accessdate=2009-10-04}}</ref>\n\t\t \nIn 2004, [[Rallying|rally]] fans received a hardcore rally sim with [[Richard Burns Rally]], which is to this day still regarded as the best rally sim ever made.\t \n\t\t \nIn 2005, [[Image Space Incorporated|ISI]] released ''[[rFactor]]'', a highly modifiable sim based on their gMotor2 physics engine. Notable for its initial download-only distribution model, ''rFactor'' originally released with fictional cars and tracks. ISI's encouragement of the enthusiast mod community has led to an unprecedented number of add-ons, including 800-horsepower-stock cars. Subsequent releases of rFactor featured Formula One cars and recreations of real track layouts under fictitious names.\t\n\nIn 2006, SimBin Studios released ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR 2]]'' (itself a sequel to ''[[GTR \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game]]''), a sports car racing simulator developed with input from the actual racing teams which took part in the FIA GT 2003 / 2004 seasons (''[[FIA GT Championship]]''). It has received widespread acclaim and has been noted for its high levels of technical and driving realism with regards to sports car racing. \n\t\t \nIn 2006, [[Kunos Simulazioni]] released ''[[netKar Pro]]'', a new version of ''netKar'' which attempts to bring together highly accurate physics and sound modeling as well as [[DirectX]] 9 graphics. Development tools for modifying ''NKP'' have been announced.\t\n\nIn 2008, David Kaemmer, co-founder of the now-defunct Papyrus,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6103365/index.html|title=The History of Papyrus Racing \u2013 Page 1|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> has released ''[[iRacing]]'', a multiplayer-oriented simulator run on a subscription model.\n\nIn 2010, [[Kunos Simulazioni]] started developing ''[[Assetto Corsa]]'', a sim built on the experience from [[netKar Pro]] and [[Ferrari Virtual Academy]], but on an entirely new engine, with an emphasis on customization and extensive modification possibilities. It was released on    Windows through the Steam's Early Access program in November 2013, and full release came out in December 2014. The game was launched for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in August 2016.\n\nIn 2012, [[Image Space Incorporated|ISI]] launched the open beta of [[RFactor 2|rFactor2]]. It went out of beta in 2013 in an mostly unpolished state. In 2016 however [[Studio 397]] took over development of rFactor2 with the aim to revamp and revive the title, essentially making huge efforts to bring the title to a modern standard.\n\nIn 2013, [[Sector3 Studios]] (former SimBin) released [[RaceRoom]], a free-to-play simulator for Microsoft Windows. Also, Eugene Cojocar of Exotypos released [[X Motor Racing]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Interview with Eugene Cojocar for AutoSimSport |publisher=AutoSimSport.net|url = http://www.autosimsport.net/issues/aUtosimsport_v3i02.zip | accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, [[Slightly Mad Studios]] launched ''[[Project CARS]]'' for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. ''CARS'' stands for ''Community Assisted Racing Simulator'', as funding for the game was raised by the community and the developers themselves.\n\nIn 2016, Reiza Studios released Automobilista, a racing simulator (based on their previous sim Stock Car Extreme) featuring, among others, Formula Truck racing, Rallycross and some lesser known Brazilian racing classes.\n\nIn 2016, [[Studio 397]] took over development of rFactor2 with the aim to revamp and revive the title.\n\nIn 2017, [[Project CARS 2]] was launched by [[Slightly Mad Studios]].

It is this level of difficulty that distinguishes sim racing from \"[[Arcade racing|arcade]]\" driving games where real-world variables are taken out of the equation and the principal objective is to create a sense of speed as opposed to a sense of realism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arcade vs Simulation \u2013 What does it all really mean?|url=https://simtorque.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/arcade-vs-simulation-what-does-it-all-really-mean/|publisher=Simtorque|date=22 January 2013|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn general, sim racing applications, such as ''[[rFactor]]'', ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'', ''[[NASCAR Racing (video game)|NASCAR Racing]]'', ''[[Race 07]]'', ''[[EA Sports F1 series|F1 Challenge '99\u2013'02]]'', ''[[F1 2018 (video game)|F1 '18]]-[[F1 2019 (video game)|'19]], ''[[Assetto Corsa]]'', ''[[GTR 2]]'', ''[[Project CARS]]'', ''[[iRacing]]'' and ''[[Richard Burns Rally]]'' are less popular than [[Arcade racing|arcade-style games]], mainly because much more skill and practice is required to master them.  An exception is ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'', which has achieved worldwide fame,<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> as have \"simcade\" titles such as ''[[Forza (series)|Forza Motorsport]]'',  ''[[Colin McRae Rally]]'', [[F1 2009 (video game)|F1 '09]]-[[F1 2017 (video game)|'17]]  and ''[[NASCAR Heat Evolution]]''. Also, because of the demands on the computer system, race sims require faster computers to run effectively, as well as a somewhat costly steering wheel and pedals for the throttle and brakes. Most arcade-style driving games can be played with a simple joystick controller or even a mouse and keyboard.\n\nWith the development of online racing capability, the ability to drive against human opponents as opposed to [[Game AI|computer AI]] is the closest many will come to driving real cars on a real track. Even those who race in real-world competition use simulations for practice or for entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video Game Review|url=http://www.racerchicks.com/motor/Review_NASCAR4.html|publisher=racerchicks.com|accessdate=2008-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011101054017/http://racerchicks.com/motor/Review_NASCAR4.html|archivedate=2001-11-01}}</ref> With continued development of the [[physics engine]] software that forms the basis of these sims, as well as improved hardware (providing tactile feedback), the experience is becoming more realistic.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{Reduce trivia|date=December 2016|sect=y}}\n{{cleanup|section|date=January 2017|reason= This section should be a text about Racing Simulators development and improvement in the world of simulation, not just a list of the releases.}}}}\n\n===Early arcade years===\nPrior to the division between arcade-style racing and sim racing, the earliest attempts at providing driving simulation experiences were arcade [[racing video game]]s, dating back to ''[[Pole Position (video game)|Pole Position]]'',<ref>[[IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society|IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Council]] & [[IEEE Electron Devices Society]] (October 1\u20133, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TpVVAAAAMAAJ ''2000 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference proceedings''], p. 65, [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], {{ISBN|0-7803-5971-2}}</ref> a 1982 [[arcade game]] developed by [[Namco]], which the game's publisher [[Atari]] publicized for its \"unbelievable driving realism\" in providing a [[Formula 1]] experience behind a [[racing wheel]] at the time. It featured other [[artificial intelligence|AI]] cars to race against, crashes caused by [[Collision detection|collisions]] with other vehicles and roadside signs, and introduced a qualifying lap concept where the player needs to complete a [[time trial]] before they can compete in [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] races.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9063|name=Pole Position}}</ref> It also pioneered the [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] rear-view perspective used in most racing games since then, with the track's vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance.<ref>Bernard Perron & Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), ''Video game theory reader two'', p. 157, [[Taylor & Francis]], {{ISBN|0-415-96282-X}}</ref>\n\n''[[Pole Position II]]'' was released in 1983 and featured several improvements like giving the player the choice of different race courses.<ref>{{KLOV game|id=9064|name=Pole Position II}}</ref> ''[[TX-1]]'', developed by Tatsumi in 1983,<ref>[http://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=thumbs&db=videodb&id=5911 TX-1], The Arcade Flyer Archive, [[Killer List of Videogames]]</ref> was licensed to Namco,<ref name=TX-1/> who in turn licensed it to Atari in America,<ref name=TX-1/> thus the game is considered a successor to ''Pole Position II''.<ref name=TX-1/> ''TX-1'', however, placed a greater emphasis on realism, with details such as forcing players to brake or downshift the gear during corners to avoid the risk of losing control, and let go of the accelerator when going into a skid in order to regain control of the steering. It also used [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] technology, which caused the steering wheel to vibrate, and the game also featured a unique three-screen arcade display for a more [[2.5D|three-dimensional]] perspective of the track. It also introduced [[nonlinear gameplay]] by allowing players to choose which path to drive through after each checkpoint, eventually leading to one of eight possible [[Multiple endings|final destinations]].<ref name=TX-1>{{KLOV game|id=10004|name=TX-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, [[Sega]]'s ''[[Hang-On]]'', a popular [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] style rear-view motorbike racer,<ref name=Hang-On>{{KLOV game|id=8068|name=Hang On}}</ref> was considered the first full-body-experience video game,<ref name=\"gamecentercx\">[[Retro Game Master|GameCenter CX]] \u2013 2nd Season, Episode 13</ref> and was regarded as the first motorbike simulator for its realism at the time, in both the handling of the player's motorbike and the AI of the computer-controlled motorcyclists.<ref name=Hang-On/> It used [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] technology and was also one of the first [[arcade game]]s to use [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit graphics]] and Sega's \"Super Scaler\" technology that allowed [[2.5D|pseudo-3D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)#Move to 3D|sprite-scaling]] at high [[frame rate]]s.<ref>[http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p3.html IGN Presents the History of SEGA: World War], [[IGN]]</ref>\n\nThe following year, [[Konami]] released ''[[WEC Le Mans]]'', an early car driving simulator based on the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. It attempted to realistically simulate car driving, with the car jumping up and down, turning back and forth, and spinning up to 180 degrees, with an emphasis on acceleration, braking, and gear shifting, along with the need for counter-steering to avoid spin-outs. It also featured a day-night cycle, accurately simulated courses approved by the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]], and force feedback to simulate road vibration in the form of a vibrating steering wheel that reacts to the driver's acceleration and off-road bumps.<ref>{{KLOV game|10383|WEC Le Mans 24}}</ref>\n\nThe first racing game with simulation pretensions on a home system is believed to have been ''[[Chequered Flag (video game)|Chequered Flag]]'', released by Psion on the 8-bit [[ZX Spectrum]] in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]]. ''[[REVS (computer game)|REVS]]'', followed in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]]. ''REVS'' was a [[Formula Three|Formula 3]] sim that delivered a semi-realistic driving experience by [[Geoff Crammond]] that ran on the [[Commodore 64]] and [[BBC Micro|BBC]]. ''REVS'' had a big fan base in England, but not so much in the United States.<ref name=GSpot-Papyrus/> This was then superseded by the widely popular ''[[Hard Drivin']]'' which was an arcade and home computing staple released in 1989, and one of the most widely played simulators up to that point.\n\n===Emergence of sim racing genre===\nSim racing is generally acknowledged to have really taken off in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] with the introduction of [[Papyrus Design Group]]'s ''[[Indianapolis 500: The Simulation]]'', designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari on 16-bit computer hardware. The game is often generally regarded as the personal computer's first true auto racing simulation. Unlike most other racing games at the time, ''Indianapolis 500'' attempted to simulate realistic [[Game physics|physics]] and [[telemetry]], such as its portrayal of the relationship between the four contact patches and the pavement, as well as the loss of grip when making a high-speed turn, forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle-to-brake interaction. It also featured a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle, including adjustments to the tires, shocks and wings.<ref name=GSpot-Papyrus>{{cite web|title=The History of Papyrus Racing \u2013 Page 2|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6103365/p-2.html|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> With ''Indy 500'', players could race the full {{convert|500|mi|km}}, where even a blowout after {{convert|450|mi|km}} would take the player out of the competition. The simulation sold over 200,000 copies. It was around this time that sim racing began distinguishing itself from arcade-style racing.\n\nConsoles saw the release of [[Human Entertainment]]'s ''[[Fastest 1]]'' for the [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] in 1991. It was considered the most realistic [[Formula 1]] racing simulation up until that time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ajisuke.fc2web.com/f1.htm| title = Basic overview of ''Fastest 1'' | publisher = FC2Web  | date = | accessdate = 2012-06-27|language=ja}}</ref>\n\nThe next major milestone was the 1992 release of ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond)|Formula One Grand Prix]]'' (AKA ''World Circuit'' in some markets) by [[MicroProse]], also developed by Geoff Crammond. This moved the genre along significantly. Multiplayer was made possible by allowing different drivers to take turns, and racers could also hook up their machines for racing via a [[null modem]] cable. This only allowed two drivers to race. Leagues emerged where drivers would submit records of their single player races to compare with other drivers. This is the first sim in which drafting/slip streaming was possible.\n\nPapyrus followed up Indy 500 with ''[[IndyCar Racing]]'' in 1993 and F1GP was surpassed in all areas. Papyrus later released more tracks and a final expansion included the Indy 500 track plus a paintkit. Now drivers could easily customize their cars. ''IndyCar Racing'' sold around 300,000 copies.\n\nThe first variant of Papyrus' ''[[NASCAR Racing]]'' series was launched in 1994. In [[SVGA]] (640\u00d7480) it pushed the PCs of the time to the limit. Suddenly a resolution of 320\u00d7200 seemed a poor option and ''NASCAR Racing'' was the race sim of choice for anyone with a capable PC, particularly in North America. It was the first sim where cars no longer looked like boxes. It keyed in on sophisticated physics modeling. ''NASCAR Racing'' sold over one million units. Moreover, the first real online racing started with ''NASCAR Racing'' using the \"Hawaii\" dial-in servers and it was not uncommon for these early sim racers to have $300 to $1500 phone bills. Online racing had seen its first true realization, and to many, this was the dawn of \"real\" sim racing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffdrivesim.html?topic=gaming&topic_set=newmedia|author=Rob Riddell|title=Hard Drive \u2014 The parallel universe of auto racing simulation is about to collide with reality|website=[[Wired.com]]|date=February 1997|accessdate=2011-01-13}}</ref>\n\n1995 saw the release of ''[[IndyCar Racing II]]'', updating the first version with the new NASCAR graphics engine. A year later, [[MicroProse]] released the successor to F1GP, ''[[Grand Prix 2 (game)|Grand Prix 2]]'', to much anticipation. ''GP2'' became successful not just because of its detailed and thorough simulation of the 1994 Formula 1 season, but also because it was customizable; this was achievable by way of the online community. Players could change everything about the game: drivers, teams, graphics, physics, car shapes, and eventually even the racetracks. Offline leagues reached their peak with ''GP2'' in 1998.\n\nIn 1996, ''[[NASCAR Racing 2]]'' was released, further improving the original, and the number of sim racers exploded. The [[Total Entertainment Network|TEN]] multiplayer hosting service was introduced and went live in November 1997 with the backing of NASCAR and the online sim racing community grew.\n\nIn 1997, ''[[Gran Turismo (1997 video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' was released for the [[PlayStation]]. It was considered the most realistic racing simulation for consoles at the time, featuring a wealth of meticulous tuning options and an [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]] [[Be-a-pro mode|career mode]] where players had to undertake [[driving test]]s to acquire [[Driver's license|driving licenses]], earn their way into races and choose their own career path.<ref name=\"GameSpot\">[http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-greatest-games-of-all-time-gran-turismo/1100-6148640/ The Greatest Games of All Time: ''Gran Turismo''], [[GameSpot]]</ref> It introduced the racing simulation genre to [[home console]]s,<ref name=\"GameSpot\"/><ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|last=Reilly |first=Luke |url=http://ign.com/articles/2015/04/03/the-top-10-most-influential-racing-games-ever?page=2 |title=The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever |website=IGN |accessdate=2019-07-23}}</ref> becoming the basis for all modern racing simulations on [[video game console]]s.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n===Graphic accelerators era===\nGraphics accelerator cards brought a new level of realism to the graphics and physics of sim racing games. These new [[graphics processing unit]]s provided [[texture mapping]], [[Spatial anti-aliasing|antialiasing]], [[Particle system|particle effects]] (i.e. fog, rain and snow), [[High dynamic range rendering|HDR]] and the capability to perform polygonal calculations faster, while taking the load off of the main processor. ''[[F1 Racing Simulation]]'' by [[Ubisoft]], was among the first to utilize the new technology in 1997.\n\nAfter years of development, Microprose released ''[[Grand Prix 3]]'', which used a more modern graphics engine and featured the same customizable structure of ''GP2''. ''GP3'' was ultimately seen as a bit of a disappointment though, lacking proper network-multiplayer-support and using only an evolution of the GP2 graphic-engine. Still, its similarity allowed easy track conversions back and forth.\n\nAnother milestone in sim racing came in 1998 with the release of ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'' (GPL) from Papyrus, based on 1967 F1 season. It was hailed as outstanding in all areas, but especially the physics and online multiplayer capability. For many, their first real experience with online racing was GPL, or the later variants of ''NASCAR'' that used the ''GPL'' engine. The release of a third-party add-on for GPL\u2014VROC (Virtual Racers Online Connection)\u2014allowed racers to join together online and race in leagues.\n\nDespite its age, ''GPL'' has remained a top class sim even in 2008 thanks to a strong community, who collectively have updated the graphics to utilize the current CPU and graphics capabilities and have created loads of add-on tracks of a high quality. Modding teams have managed to create new physics sets and a 1965, 1966 and 1969 variants are now available with many improvements over the original.\n\nWired magazine wrote an in-depth article about racing sims called Hard Drive in their February 1997 issue.[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffdrivesim_pr.html] [[TORCS]] was created in 1997, as an open source car racing simulator.\n\n[[Sega AM2]]'s 1999 arcade game ''[[Ferrari F355 Challenge]]'', later ported to the [[Dreamcast]] in 2000, was considered the most accurate simulation of the [[Ferrari F355]] possible up until that time; its focus on realism was considered unusual for an arcade game at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=F355 Challenge: It's hard.

Unlike the Papyrus sims, the physics are easily modified, and a large community has developed dedicated to modifying the ISI sims. One such modding team, [[Simbin]], have created their own company and have released several games, including ''[[GTR \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game]]'', ''[[GT Legends]]'', ''[[GTR - FIA GT Racing Game 2|GTR 2]]'', ''[[Race \u2013 The Official WTCC Game|RACE \u2013 The Official WTCC Game]]'', ''[[Race 07|RACE 07]]'', ''[[STCC \u2013 The Game]]'', ''[[GTR Evolution]]'' and ''[[Race On]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Simbin Game titles|url=http://www.simbin.se/main/games.htm|publisher=simbin.se|accessdate=2008-02-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222205448/http://www.simbin.se/main/games.htm|archivedate=2008-02-22}}</ref>\n\n===Recent developments===\nIn 2003, a 3-man team began developing ''[[Live for Speed]]''. Phase 2 brought in many updates, including the first real cars (the [[BMW Sauber]] F1 car being included in those). The third and final phase of the development cycle was launched in 2015, featuring the [[VW Scirocco]] and the first real-world circuit, the [[Rockingham Motor Speedway]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Live For Speed \u2013 Rockingham coming to LFS|url=http://www.lfs.net/?page=rockingham|accessdate=2009-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Live For Speed \u2013 New Tyre Physics|url=http://www.lfs.net/|accessdate=2009-10-04}}</ref>\n\t\t \nIn 2004, [[Rallying|rally]] fans received a hardcore rally sim with [[Richard Burns Rally]], which is to this day still regarded as the best rally sim ever made.\t \n\t\t \nIn 2005, [[Image Space Incorporated|ISI]] released ''[[rFactor]]'', a highly modifiable sim based on their gMotor2 physics engine. Notable for its initial download-only distribution model, ''rFactor'' originally released with fictional cars and tracks. ISI's encouragement of the enthusiast mod community has led to an unprecedented number of add-ons, including 800-horsepower-stock cars. Subsequent releases of rFactor featured Formula One cars and recreations of real track layouts under fictitious names.\t\n\nIn 2006, SimBin Studios released ''[[GTR 2 \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game|GTR 2]]'' (itself a sequel to ''[[GTR \u2013 FIA GT Racing Game]]''), a sports car racing simulator developed with input from the actual racing teams which took part in the FIA GT 2003 / 2004 seasons (''[[FIA GT Championship]]''). It has received widespread acclaim and has been noted for its high levels of technical and driving realism with regards to sports car racing. \n\t\t \nIn 2006, [[Kunos Simulazioni]] released ''[[netKar Pro]]'', a new version of ''netKar'' which attempts to bring together highly accurate physics and sound modeling as well as [[DirectX]] 9 graphics. Development tools for modifying ''NKP'' have been announced.\t\n\nIn 2008, David Kaemmer, co-founder of the now-defunct Papyrus,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6103365/index.html|title=The History of Papyrus Racing \u2013 Page 1|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> has released ''[[iRacing]]'', a multiplayer-oriented simulator run on a subscription model.\n\nIn 2010, [[Kunos Simulazioni]] started developing ''[[Assetto Corsa]]'', a sim built on the experience from [[netKar Pro]] and [[Ferrari Virtual Academy]], but on an entirely new engine, with an emphasis on customization and extensive modification possibilities. It was released on    Windows through the Steam's Early Access program in November 2013, and full release came out in December 2014. The game was launched for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in August 2016.\n\nIn 2012, [[Image Space Incorporated|ISI]] launched the open beta of [[RFactor 2|rFactor2]]. It went out of beta in 2013 in an mostly unpolished state. In 2016 however [[Studio 397]] took over development of rFactor2 with the aim to revamp and revive the title, essentially making huge efforts to bring the title to a modern standard.\n\nIn 2013, [[Sector3 Studios]] (former SimBin) released [[RaceRoom]], a free-to-play simulator for Microsoft Windows. Also, Eugene Cojocar of Exotypos released [[X Motor Racing]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Interview with Eugene Cojocar for AutoSimSport |publisher=AutoSimSport.net|url = http://www.autosimsport.net/issues/aUtosimsport_v3i02.zip | accessdate = 2007-03-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, [[Slightly Mad Studios]] launched ''[[Project CARS]]'' for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. ''CARS'' stands for ''Community Assisted Racing Simulator'', as funding for the game was raised by the community and the developers themselves.\n\nIn 2016, Reiza Studios released Automobilista, a racing simulator (based on their previous sim Stock Car Extreme) featuring, among others, Formula Truck racing, Rallycross and some lesser known Brazilian racing classes.\n\nIn 2016, [[Studio 397]] took over development of rFactor2 with the aim to revamp and revive the title.\n\nIn 2017, [[Project CARS 2]] was launched by [[Slightly Mad Studios]]. It is the successor to [[Project CARS]].\n\nKunos launched ''[[Assetto Corsa Competizione]]'' on early access in May 2019.\n\nOriginally announced in 2010, Simbin Studios planned the release of GTR3 in Q2 2019, but is still unreleased without new date.\n\n=== Online communities ===\nIn recent years as international interest has grown, so has the online community and underground racing circuit.

The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

The Kingston campus of [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.\n\nMunicipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding [[Township (Canada)|townships]], which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh, Kingston|Pittsburgh Township]] to form the new City of Kingston.

As a result of the report of the ''Commission of Inquiry into Certain Events at the Prison for Women in Kingston'', the facility was closed in 2000. Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; therefore, Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is considering its options.\n\nIn September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in February 1990 due to its history and reputation. In its early years, the prison had a vital role in constructing the city. The prison brought prosperity to Kingston, and along with eight other prisons being built in the area, helped create an impressive local economy.<ref>Steve Cameron, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/kingston-penitentiary-closes-its-doors-as-canadas-most-famous-prison/article14598900/?page=all \"Kingston Penitentiary: Canada's most famous prison closes its doors\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071218/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/kingston-penitentiary-closes-its-doors-as-canadas-most-famous-prison/article14598900/?page=all |date=March 4, 2016 }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', September 29, 2013</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\nKingston is within the [[Mixedwood Plains Ecozone (Canada)|Mixedwood Plains Ecozone]], and is dominated in the Kingston area by a mixture of [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] tree species and abundant water resources.<ref>[http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/MixedwoodPlains/land.html Ecological Framework of Canada \u2013 Mixedwood Plains Ecozone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315210334/http://ecozones.ca/english/zone/MixedwoodPlains/land.html |date=March 15, 2016 }}.

To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada.

It is on the eastern end of [[Lake Ontario]], at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]] (south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]). The city is midway between [[Toronto]], Ontario and [[Montreal]], Quebec. The [[Thousand Islands]] tourist region is nearby to the east. Kingston is nicknamed the \"Limestone City\" because of the many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].\n\nGrowing European exploration in the 17th century, and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade, led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as \"Cataraqui\"  (generally pronounced \"kah-tah-ROCK-way\") in 1673. This outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. Since 1760, the site of Kingston, Ontario, was in effective British possession.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |url=https://doi.org/10.3138/9781442618503}}</ref> Cataraqui would be renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s. \n\nKingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short (ending in 1844), the community has remained an important [[military]] installation.

From this base, de La Salle explored west and south as far as the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name=\"kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca\"/> The fort was rebuilt several times and experienced periods of abandonment.

Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''\"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.\"''<ref name=\"queens\">{{cite web|title=Hockey night in Kingston |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |accessdate=June 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.\n\nThe [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.\n\nKingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL) by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs general manager is Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].\n\nThe [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]], is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ \u201cAbout the Hall\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053203/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/about/ |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref> The museum's collection is home to various items that pay homage to Kingston's role in the history of hockey in Canada. These include: the original square hockey puck from the first Queens University vs. the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) game in 1886, hockey's oldest sweater worn by a Queen's student in 1894, and Canada's first Olympic gold medal from 1924, among others.<ref>Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum, [http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/exhibits/top-10-artifacts.html \u201cThe Top 10 Artifacts in the Museum\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053201/http://www.originalhockeyhalloffame.com/exhibits/top-10-artifacts.html |date=November 29, 2014 }}, \"Original Hockey Hall of Fame and Museum\"</ref>\n\nNew to the city is Leon's Centre, in the downtown core.

The [[Kingston Yacht Club]] in downtown Kingston has a learn to sail program for both children and adults.\n\n===Diving===\nKingston is known for fresh-water [[wreck diving]]. [[List of shipwrecks of Canada#Ontario|Kingston's shipwrecks]] are well preserved by its cool fresh water, and the recent [[zebra mussel]] invasion has caused a dramatic improvement in water clarity that has enhanced the quality of diving in the area.\n\n===Lawn bowling===\nThe Kingston Lawn Bowling Club has been at its location on Napier Street since 1932, although the sport's beginnings in Kingston have been traced back to 1914.<ref>[https://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html Kingston Lawn Bowling Club \u2013 About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514141551/http://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html |date=May 14, 2016 }} Retrieved November 22, 2018</ref> While the club offers a variety of recreational opportunities, a number of its members have gone on to compete successfully at the provincial level and beyond.

The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (founded in 1917 and redesigned by [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1930). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Evergreen (1972), Belle Park Fairways (1975), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). [[Matt McQuillan]], a professional player on the [[PGA Tour]] for the 2011 and 2012 seasons, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]]. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus [[Edmonton]] Open on the [[Canadian Professional Golf Tour]].\n\n===Curling===\nThree curling clubs are in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf & Country Club, Garrison Golf & Curling Club, and the [[Royal Kingston Curling Club]].<ref>[http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston CurlingRink.ca \u2013 Kingston Curling Clubs and Rinks \u2013 Kingston, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706174549/http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston |date=July 6, 2011 }} Retrieved March 2, 2011</ref> The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993.

In 2020, Kingston will host the Tim Hortons Brier, the national men's curling championship. Kingston previously hosted the Brier in 1957.

KPRFC is a non-profit organization answering directly to the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union (EORU), the [[Ontario Rugby Union]] (ORU), and [[Rugby Canada]] (RC). The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at [[Twin Elm Rugby Park]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].\n\n===Football===\nThe earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]], (ORFU). The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8\u20130. Kingston also hosted the [[10th Grey Cup]] on December 2, 1922. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.\nMany notable football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:\n\n===Volleyball===\n\nThe Kingston Volleyball Club (KVC) was founded in 2015.
