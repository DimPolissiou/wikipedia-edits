As it has developed alongside [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], Singapore became known as one of the \"[[Four Asian Tigers]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAfter gaining independence abruptly, Singapore faced a future filled with uncertainties. The [[Konfrontasi]] was on-going and the conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the dangers of attack by the Indonesian military and forcible re-integration into the Malaysia Federation on unfavorable terms.  Much of the international media was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, and the lack of [[natural resource]]s and land.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Two Decades of Independence|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/11.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=28 June 2006}}</ref> Unemployment was ranging between 10\u201312%, threatening to trigger civil unrest.\n\nSingapore immediately sought international recognition of its sovereignty. The new state joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, becoming the 117th member; and joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in October that year. Foreign minister [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]] headed a new foreign service that helped assert Singapore's independence and establishing diplomatic relations with other countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716151550/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 July 2009|title=Former DPM Rajaratnam dies at age 90|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> On 22 December 1965, the Constitution Amendment Act was passed under which the Head of State became the President and the State of Singapore became the Republic of Singapore.

The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The [[service industry]] also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Esso]] to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence/> The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.\n\nThe lack of good public housing, poor sanitation, and high unemployment led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of [[squatter]] settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the [[Bukit Ho Swee Fire]] in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milestone \u2013 1888\u20131990|publisher=[[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]|accessdate =17 July 2006|url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/General/About_Us/Milestones/1888_1990.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510204004/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/General/About_Us/Milestones/1888_1990.html|archivedate=10 May 2006}}</ref> The [[Housing Development Board]] set up before independence continued to be largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters.

These new residential estates have larger and higher-standard apartments and are served with better amenities. Today, 80\u201390% of the population lives in HDB apartments.

As it has developed alongside [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], Singapore became known as one of the \"[[Four Asian Tigers]]\".\n\n==Background==\nAfter gaining independence abruptly, Singapore faced a future filled with uncertainties. The [[Konfrontasi]] was on-going and the conservative UMNO faction strongly opposed the separation; Singapore faced the dangers of attack by the Indonesian military and forcible re-integration into the Malaysia Federation on unfavorable terms.  Much of the international media was skeptical of prospects for Singapore's survival. Besides the issue of sovereignty, the pressing problems were unemployment, housing, education, and the lack of [[natural resource]]s and land.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence>{{cite web|title=Singapore \u2013 Two Decades of Independence|url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/11.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=28 June 2006}}</ref> Unemployment was ranging between 10\u201312%, threatening to trigger civil unrest.\n\nSingapore immediately sought international recognition of its sovereignty. The new state joined the United Nations on 21 September 1965, becoming the 117th member; and joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in October that year. Foreign minister [[Sinnathamby Rajaratnam]] headed a new foreign service that helped assert Singapore's independence and establishing diplomatic relations with other countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090716151550/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/194463/1/.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 July 2009|title=Former DPM Rajaratnam dies at age 90|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=22 February 2006}}</ref> On 22 December 1965, the Constitution Amendment Act was passed under which the Head of State became the President and the State of Singapore became the Republic of Singapore.

The industrialization transformed the manufacturing sector to one that produced higher value-added goods and achieved greater revenue. The [[service industry]] also grew at this time, driven by demand for services by ships calling at the port and increasing commerce. This progress helped to alleviate the unemployment crisis. Singapore also attracted big oil companies like [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Esso]] to establish oil refineries in Singapore which, by the mid-1970s, became the third largest oil-refining centre in the world.<ref name=uslcTwoDecadesOfIndependence/> The government invested heavily in an education system that adopted English as the language of instruction and emphasised practical training to develop a competent workforce well suited for the industry.\n\nThe lack of good public housing, poor sanitation, and high unemployment led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of [[squatter]] settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the [[Bukit Ho Swee Fire]] in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milestone \u2013 1888\u20131990|publisher=[[Singapore Civil Defence Force]]|accessdate =17 July 2006|url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/General/About_Us/Milestones/1888_1990.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510204004/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/General/About_Us/Milestones/1888_1990.html|archivedate=10 May 2006}}</ref> The [[Housing Development Board]] set up before independence continued to be largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters.

The boy soon meets with an accident while rowing in the river and is eventually discovered by some fishermen from the neighbouring kingdom of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalingapuri]], a rival of Kottaipattinam. Rana grows up there and trains in weaponry, and grows up to be a fearless warrior. Due to his fighting skills and bravery, he soon wins the confidence of the king of Kalingapuri, Raja Mahendran, who promotes him as [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] of the Kalingapuri army. The son of Raja Mahendran, Veera Mahendran shows Rana around the kingdom's mine where the captured soldiers of Kottaipattinam work as slaves. Veera says that this information is known only to a few people. After this, Rana promotes a war strategy to Veera that they release the slaves and have them trained in the army of Kalingapuri. Veera agrees and the slaves are freed. He then gets Raja Mahendran's approval to attack Kottaipattinam. However, during the war, Rana encounters his childhood friend, crown prince Sengodagan, the son of Rishikodagan (Nassar), king of Kottaipattinam. Instead of fighting, it is revealed that the main motive of Rana's plan was to free the soldiers of Kottipattinam. Immediately signalling an end to the war, he, along with the soldiers disown Kalingapuri and return to Kottaipattinam, much to the disgust of Raja Mahendran and his son, crown prince Veera Mahendran, who swear revenge on Rana for tricking them and betraying Kalingapuri.\n\nAt Kottaipattinam, Rana and Sengodagan renew their friendship. Sengodagan introduces Rana to Rishikodagan, who is alarmed on seeing him. Rana also reunites with his younger sister Yamuna Devi whom he last saw as a baby and their uncle, who raised her, but soon learns that his mother Yaaghavi is dead and his brother Sena is missing. He soon learns that Yamuna and Sengodagan are in love with each other. He accepts their relationship and decides to get them married, even cleverly convincing Rishikodagan, who was unwilling to get his son married to a commoner like Yamuna. Meanwhile, Rana also falls in love with his [[childhood sweetheart]], princess Vadhana Devi, the daughter of Rishikodagan.\n\nSoon, Sengodagan and Yamuna get married. But following the wedding, Rishikodagan disowns his son for marrying Yamuna despite knowing that the latter does not belong to a royal family. An unfazed Sengodagan immediately leaves the palace with Yamuna. Later that night, a masked man barges into the palace and attempts to kill Rishikodagan. Vadhana immediately goes after him, fights him and gets him captured. Rishikodagan unmasks the assassin who is revealed to be Rana, and immediately throws him into prison, sentencing him to death. An upset Vadhana rushes to the cell where Rana is imprisoned, where Rana tells her why he attempted to kill Rishikodagan.\n\nRana tells her that he is the younger son of Kochadaiiyaan, the former Commander-in-Chief of Kottaipattinam's army. Kochadaiiyaan is extremely respected in Kottaipattinam for his bravery and is more popular than Rishikodagan himself. So,  Rishikodagan becomes jealous of Kochadaiiyaan. One night, when Kochadaiiyaan is returning by ship to Kottaipatinam with his army after buying horses and ammunition, they are attacked by the rival army of Kalingapuri. Kochadaiiyaan defeats them but allows them to return to their kingdom as an act of chivalry. However, the Kalingapuri army, before leaving, poison the food on the ship. The Kottaipattinam army men consume this food, and fall ill.\n\nDespite knowing that he had been tricked by the Kalingapuri army, Kochadaiiyaan immediately rushes to Kalingapuri itself, because it is the only land body close enough to provide medicines to the sick and dying soldiers. He orders Raja Mahendran to provide medical assistance to his soldiers. Raja Mahendran, in turn, cunningly proposes a deal that, if he wants his men to be saved, he has to leave all the horses, ammunition and the sick army men in Kalingapuri as slaves. Only if Kochadaiiyan agrees to this, his soldiers will be nursed back to health. Kochadaiiyan thinks that his men rather be alive as slaves than die from poisoning, and also thinks that when they officially wage a war in the near future, all of them could be easily rescued. So he accepts Raja Mahendran's offer and leaves Kalingapuri all alone. When he returns to Kottaipattinam, the jealous Rishikodagan seizes this opportunity to strip Kochadaiiyan off all respect and dignity and sentences him to death for becoming a traitor to Kottaipattinam because of surrendering his army men, horses and ammunition to Kalingapuri. Though all his subjects are dismayed at Kochadaiiyaan being sentenced to death, and his wife Yaaghavi even goes to the extent of publicly rebuking Rishikodagan for his injustice, Rishikodagan stands firm in his decision. Kochadaiiyaan is beheaded the following morning before Rana's eyes.\n\nThe story comes back to the present, with Rana telling Vadhana that he ran away to Kalingapuri, with the intention of freeing the soldiers of Kottaipattinam and to take revenge on Rishikodagan for unjustly killing his father. Vadhana is shocked on hearing about her father's actions and reconciles with Rana. She then pleads with her father to release Rana, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Rana escapes from the prison. When Rishikodagan learns of Rana's escape, he immediately arranges for Vadhana's marriage with prince Veera Mahendran after consulting with an astrologer and learning that his life is at Rana's mercy. Despite the enmity between Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, he arranges this marriage with the hope that their united armies and their mutual hatred for Rana can subdue him.\n\nOn the day of the marriage, Rana arrives just when the marriage is about to take place. He and the people of Kottapattinam berate Rishikodagan for becoming a traitor and surrendering the whole kingdom of Kottaipattinam to Raja Mahendran for his own personal interests and commitments, which was the same charge that Rishikodagan had placed on Kochadaiiyaan years ago. Following this, a war starts between Rana and the united armies of Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri. Rana successfully manages to subdue the armies of both kingdoms and along with a majority of Kottaipattinam's army, he kills Raja Mahendran and allows Veera Mahendran to return as he was defeated, reminding him of their friendship. He then fights Rishikodagan and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] him.\n\nFinally, as Rana and Vadhana reunite, a young soldier comes towards them riding a horse. This soldier is revealed to be Sena (Rana\"s Long lost twin brother), who looks surprisingly angered, as their father had asked him to protect the king but Rana had killed him, indicating that a fight awaits.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Kochadaiiyaan, Ranadheeran \"Rana\" and Senadheeran \"Sena\" (triple role)<ref name=\"kids\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Kids-only-after-delivering-Kochadaiyaan/2014/03/10/article2101208.ece#.Uy13FaiSxmw |title=Kids only after delivering Kochadaiyaan |work=The New Indian Express |date=10 March 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322151216/http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Kids-only-after-delivering-Kochadaiyaan/2014/03/10/article2101208.ece#.Uy13FaiSxmw |archivedate=22 March 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Princess Vadhana Devi<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/regional/deepika-padukone-to-attend-kochadaiyaan-music-launch-493102 |title=Deepika Padukone to attend Kochadaiyaan music launch |work=NDTV Movies |date=8 March 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309040827/http://movies.ndtv.com/regional/deepika-padukone-to-attend-kochadaiyaan-music-launch-493102 |archivedate=9 March 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[R.

S. Ravikumar to help complete an animation feature that Soundarya Rajinikanth had begun in 2007. The project titled ''Sultan: The Warrior'' had run into problems with its production and Rajinikanth hoped that they could salvage the project by adding a historical back plot which would make the film partially animation and partially live action. Ravikumar then developed a story for fifteen days with his team of assistants and after being impressed by the script, Rajinikanth felt that Ravikumar's story should be an entirely separate film. Thus the team launched a venture titled ''Rana'', to be jointly produced by [[Soundarya Rajinikanth|Ocher Picture Productions]] and [[Eros International]]. The film would have featured cinematographer [[R. Rathnavelu]] and music would have been composed by [[A. R. Rahman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?ID=ENTEN20110168195&keyword=regional&subcatg=MOVIESINDIA&nid=82359 |title=Rajinikanth to play a triple role in Rana |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |accessdate=17 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326043514/http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?keyword=regional&ID=ENTEN20110168195&subcatg=MOVIESINDIA&nid=82359 |archivedate=26 March 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Bharti Dubey |agency=TNN |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/news-interviews/Rana-a-triple-delight-for-Rajini-fans/articleshow/7385003.cms?referral=PM |title='Rana', a triple delight for Rajini fans |work=The Times of India |date=29 January 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216051452/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/news-interviews/Rana-a-triple-delight-for-Rajini-fans/articleshow/7385003.cms?referral=PM |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}</ref> [[Principal photography]], began on 29 April 2011.

He added that when his team started working on the [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley (ambient sounds)]] he told the film director to provide him with the exact costumes used whilst filming. However, realising that the filming was done using [[Motion capture|performance capture technology]], the entire set of costumes were designed to provide requisite foley. He also paid attention to nuances extensively where he added, \"For instance, the image you see on screen is a composite of several layers of images.

It is India's first [[photorealism|photorealistic]] [[motion capture]] film, featuring characters whose designs were based on the appearance and likeness of their respective actors. [[Rajinikanth]], also Soundarya's father, enacted and voiced the two lead roles, and one surprise role in the film's final act.

In addition to performing, [[R. Sarathkumar]], [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] and [[Rukmini Vijayakumar]] had also voiced their respective characters. The narrative follows the quest of an 8th-century warrior who seeks revenge after witnessing the unlawful punishment administered to his father, a good-hearted warrior in his kingdom, by the jealous ruler.\n\nThe film was the result of a complex development process, starting with the director's idea of directing and co-producing ''Sultan: The Warrior'' with [[Eros International]] in 2007, which was to feature Rajinikanth as a [[computer-generated imagery|computer animated]] character.<ref name=thandance /> After cancelling the project due to lack of financial support,<ref name=stwarrior>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news-interviews/Rajinikanths-Kochadaiiyaan-similar-to-his-Sultan-the-Warrior/articleshow/22508840.cms Rajinikanth\u2019s 'Kochadaiiyaan' similar to his 'Sultan the Warrior'?].

The boy soon meets with an accident while rowing in the river and is eventually discovered by some fishermen from the neighbouring kingdom of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalingapuri]], a rival of Kottaipattinam. Rana grows up there and trains in weaponry, and grows up to be a fearless warrior. Due to his fighting skills and bravery, he soon wins the confidence of the king of Kalingapuri, Raja Mahendran, who promotes him as [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] of the Kalingapuri army. The son of Raja Mahendran, Veera Mahendran shows Rana around the kingdom's mine where the captured soldiers of Kottaipattinam work as slaves. Veera says that this information is known only to a few people. After this, Rana promotes a war strategy to Veera that they release the slaves and have them trained in the army of Kalingapuri. Veera agrees and the slaves are freed. He then gets Raja Mahendran's approval to attack Kottaipattinam. However, during the war, Rana encounters his childhood friend, crown prince Sengodagan, the son of Rishikodagan (Nassar), king of Kottaipattinam. Instead of fighting, it is revealed that the main motive of Rana's plan was to free the soldiers of Kottipattinam. Immediately signalling an end to the war, he, along with the soldiers disown Kalingapuri and return to Kottaipattinam, much to the disgust of Raja Mahendran and his son, crown prince Veera Mahendran, who swear revenge on Rana for tricking them and betraying Kalingapuri.\n\nAt Kottaipattinam, Rana and Sengodagan renew their friendship. Sengodagan introduces Rana to Rishikodagan, who is alarmed on seeing him. Rana also reunites with his younger sister Yamuna Devi whom he last saw as a baby and their uncle, who raised her, but soon learns that his mother Yaaghavi is dead and his brother Sena is missing. He soon learns that Yamuna and Sengodagan are in love with each other. He accepts their relationship and decides to get them married, even cleverly convincing Rishikodagan, who was unwilling to get his son married to a commoner like Yamuna. Meanwhile, Rana also falls in love with his [[childhood sweetheart]], princess Vadhana Devi, the daughter of Rishikodagan.\n\nSoon, Sengodagan and Yamuna get married. But following the wedding, Rishikodagan disowns his son for marrying Yamuna despite knowing that the latter does not belong to a royal family. An unfazed Sengodagan immediately leaves the palace with Yamuna. Later that night, a masked man barges into the palace and attempts to kill Rishikodagan. Vadhana immediately goes after him, fights him and gets him captured. Rishikodagan unmasks the assassin who is revealed to be Rana, and immediately throws him into prison, sentencing him to death. An upset Vadhana rushes to the cell where Rana is imprisoned, where Rana tells her why he attempted to kill Rishikodagan.\n\nRana tells her that he is the younger son of Kochadaiiyaan, the former Commander-in-Chief of Kottaipattinam's army. Kochadaiiyaan is extremely respected in Kottaipattinam for his bravery and is more popular than Rishikodagan himself. So,  Rishikodagan becomes jealous of Kochadaiiyaan. One night, when Kochadaiiyaan is returning by ship to Kottaipatinam with his army after buying horses and ammunition, they are attacked by the rival army of Kalingapuri. Kochadaiiyaan defeats them but allows them to return to their kingdom as an act of chivalry. However, the Kalingapuri army, before leaving, poison the food on the ship. The Kottaipattinam army men consume this food, and fall ill.\n\nDespite knowing that he had been tricked by the Kalingapuri army, Kochadaiiyaan immediately rushes to Kalingapuri itself, because it is the only land body close enough to provide medicines to the sick and dying soldiers. He orders Raja Mahendran to provide medical assistance to his soldiers. Raja Mahendran, in turn, cunningly proposes a deal that, if he wants his men to be saved, he has to leave all the horses, ammunition and the sick army men in Kalingapuri as slaves. Only if Kochadaiiyan agrees to this, his soldiers will be nursed back to health. Kochadaiiyan thinks that his men rather be alive as slaves than die from poisoning, and also thinks that when they officially wage a war in the near future, all of them could be easily rescued. So he accepts Raja Mahendran's offer and leaves Kalingapuri all alone. When he returns to Kottaipattinam, the jealous Rishikodagan seizes this opportunity to strip Kochadaiiyan off all respect and dignity and sentences him to death for becoming a traitor to Kottaipattinam because of surrendering his army men, horses and ammunition to Kalingapuri. Though all his subjects are dismayed at Kochadaiiyaan being sentenced to death, and his wife Yaaghavi even goes to the extent of publicly rebuking Rishikodagan for his injustice, Rishikodagan stands firm in his decision. Kochadaiiyaan is beheaded the following morning before Rana's eyes.\n\nThe story comes back to the present, with Rana telling Vadhana that he ran away to Kalingapuri, with the intention of freeing the soldiers of Kottaipattinam and to take revenge on Rishikodagan for unjustly killing his father. Vadhana is shocked on hearing about her father's actions and reconciles with Rana. She then pleads with her father to release Rana, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Rana escapes from the prison. When Rishikodagan learns of Rana's escape, he immediately arranges for Vadhana's marriage with prince Veera Mahendran after consulting with an astrologer and learning that his life is at Rana's mercy. Despite the enmity between Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, he arranges this marriage with the hope that their united armies and their mutual hatred for Rana can subdue him.\n\nOn the day of the marriage, Rana arrives just when the marriage is about to take place. He and the people of Kottapattinam berate Rishikodagan for becoming a traitor and surrendering the whole kingdom of Kottaipattinam to Raja Mahendran for his own personal interests and commitments, which was the same charge that Rishikodagan had placed on Kochadaiiyaan years ago. Following this, a war starts between Rana and the united armies of Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri. Rana successfully manages to subdue the armies of both kingdoms and along with a majority of Kottaipattinam's army, he kills Raja Mahendran and allows Veera Mahendran to return as he was defeated, reminding him of their friendship. He then fights Rishikodagan and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] him.\n\nFinally, as Rana and Vadhana reunite, a young soldier comes towards them riding a horse. This soldier is revealed to be Sena(Rana\"s Long lost twin brother),who looks surprisingly angered, as their father had asked him to protect the king but Rana had killed him, indicating that a fight awaits.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Kochadaiiyaan, Ranadheeran \"Rana\" and Senadheeran \"Sena\" (triple role)<ref name=\"kids\">{{cite web |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Kids-only-after-delivering-Kochadaiyaan/2014/03/10/article2101208.ece#.Uy13FaiSxmw |title=Kids only after delivering Kochadaiyaan |work=The New Indian Express |date=10 March 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322151216/http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Kids-only-after-delivering-Kochadaiyaan/2014/03/10/article2101208.ece#.Uy13FaiSxmw |archivedate=22 March 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Princess Vadhana Devi<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/regional/deepika-padukone-to-attend-kochadaiyaan-music-launch-493102 |title=Deepika Padukone to attend Kochadaiyaan music launch |work=NDTV Movies |date=8 March 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140309040827/http://movies.ndtv.com/regional/deepika-padukone-to-attend-kochadaiyaan-music-launch-493102 |archivedate=9 March 2014 }}</ref>\n* [[R.

The project titled ''Sultan: The Warrior'' had run into problems with its production and Rajinikanth hoped that they could salvage the project by adding a historical back plot which would make the film partially animation and partially live action. Ravikumar then developed a story for fifteen days with his team of assistants and after being impressed by the script, Rajinikanth felt that Ravikumar's story should be an entirely separate film. Thus the team launched a venture titled ''Rana'', to be jointly produced by [[Soundarya Rajinikanth|Ocher Picture Productions]] and [[Eros International]]. The film would have featured cinematographer [[R. Rathnavelu]] and music would have been composed by [[A. R.

He added that when his team started working on the [[Foley (filmmaking)|foley (ambient sounds)]] he told the film director to provide him with the exact costumes used whilst filming. However, realising that the filming was done using [[Motion capture|performance capture technology]], the entire set of costumes were designed to provide requisite foley. He also paid attention to nuances extensively where he added, \"For instance, the image you see on screen is a composite of several layers of images.

The couple were [[cousin|first cousins]] and publicly married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 27. Biographers disagree as to the nature of the couple's relationship. Though their marriage was loving, some biographers suggest they viewed one another more like a brother and sister. In January 1842, she contracted [[tuberculosis]], growing worse for five years until she died of the disease at the age of 24 in [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|the family's cottage]], at that time outside [[New York City]].\n\nAlong with other family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived together off and on for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City|New York]]. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving [[Frances Sargent Osgood]] and [[Elizabeth F. Ellet]]. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]] in Baltimore, [[Maryland]]. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.\n\nThe disease and eventual death of his wife had a substantial effect on Edgar Allan Poe, who became despondent and turned to alcohol to cope. Her struggles with illness and death are believed to have affected his poetry and prose, where dying young women appear as a frequent motif, as in \"[[Annabel Lee]]\", \"[[The Raven]]\", and \"[[Ligeia]]\".\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:PoeFamilyTree.svg|thumb|400px|Poe family tree]]\n\nVirginia Eliza Clemm was born in 1822<ref>Thomas, Dwight & David K.

The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear.<ref name=Silverman107>Silverman, 107</ref> Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev.

Noted Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn argues it was not particularly unusual, nor was Poe's nicknaming his wife \"Sissy\" or \"Sis\".<ref>Hoffman, 26</ref> Another Poe biographer, [[Kenneth Silverman]], contends that though their [[cousin marriage|first-cousin marriage]] was not unusual, her young age was.<ref name=Silverman107/> It has been suggested that Clemm and Poe had a relationship more like that between brother and sister than between husband and wife.<ref>Krutch, 52</ref> Biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn disagreed with this view, citing a fervent love letter to argue that Poe \"loved his little cousin not only with the affection of a brother, but also with the passionate devotion of a lover and prospective husband.\"<ref>{{cite book | author = Quinn, Arthur Hobson | year = 1941 | title = Edgar Allan Poe: A Critical Biography | publisher = D. Appleton-Century Company | pages = 219\u2013224 | url = http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1921/quinnc10.htm}}</ref> Some scholars, including [[Princess Marie Bonaparte|Marie Bonaparte]], have read many of Poe's works as autobiographical and have concluded that Virginia died a [[virginity|virgin]].<ref name=Hoffman27>Hoffman, 27</ref> It has been speculated that she and her husband never consummated their marriage, although no evidence is given.<ref>Richard, Claude and Jean-Marie Bonnet, \"[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/PS1960/P1968108.HTM Raising the Wind; or, French Editions of the Works of Edgar Allan Poe]\", ''Poe Newsletter'', vol. I, No. 1, April 1968, p. 12.</ref> This interpretation often assumes that Virginia is represented by the title character in the poem \"[[Annabel Lee]]\": a \"maiden... by the name of Annabel Lee\".<ref name=Hoffman27/> Poe biographer Joseph Wood Krutch suggests that Poe did not need women \"in the way that normal men need them\", but only as a source of inspiration and care,<ref>Krutch, 54</ref> and that Poe was never interested in women sexually.<ref>Krutch, 25</ref> Friends of Poe suggested that the couple did not share a bed for at least the first two years of their marriage but that, from the time she turned 16, they had a \"normal\" married life until the onset of her illness.<ref name=Sova53>Sova, 53</ref>\n\nVirginia and Poe were by all accounts a happy and devoted couple. Poe's one-time employer [[George Rex Graham]] wrote of their relationship: \"His love for his wife was a sort of rapturous worship of the spirit of beauty.\"<ref>Oberholtzer, 299</ref> Poe once wrote to a friend, \"I see no one among the living as beautiful as my little wife.\"<ref>Phillips, 1184</ref> She, in turn, by many contemporary accounts, nearly idolized her husband.<ref>Hoffman, 318</ref> She often sat close to him while he wrote, kept his pens in order, and folded and addressed his manuscripts.<ref>Phillips, 1183</ref> She showed her love for Poe in an [[acrostic]] poem she composed when she was 23, dated February 14, 1846:\n\n[[File:VirginiaValentine.jpg|thumb|right|Virginia's handwritten [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]] poem to her husband]]\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nEver with thee I wish to roam \u2014\nDearest my life is thine.\nGive me a cottage for my home\nAnd a rich old cypress vine,\nRemoved from the world with its sin and care\nAnd the tattling of many tongues.\nLove alone shall guide us when we are there \u2014\nLove shall heal my weakened lungs;\nAnd Oh, the tranquil hours we'll spend,\nNever wishing that others may see!\nPerfect ease we'll enjoy, without thinking to lend\nOurselves to the world and its glee \u2014\nEver peaceful and blissful we'll be.<ref>Quinn, 497</ref></poem>}}\n\n===Osgood/Ellet scandal===\n[[File:FannyOsgood.jpg|right|thumb|[[Frances Sargent Osgood]]]]\n\nThe \"tattling of many tongues\" in Virginia's Valentine poem was a reference to actual incidents.<ref>Moss, 214</ref> In 1845, Poe had begun a flirtation with [[Frances Sargent Osgood]], a married 34-year-old poet.<ref>Silverman, 280</ref> Virginia was aware of the friendship and might even have encouraged it.<ref name=Meyers190>Meyers, 190</ref> She often invited Osgood to visit them at home, believing that the older woman had a \"restraining\" effect on Poe, who had made a promise to \"give up the use of stimulants\" and was never drunk in Osgood's presence.<ref>Silverman, 287</ref>\n\nAt the same time, another poet, [[Elizabeth F. Ellet]], became enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood.<ref name=Meyers190/> Though, in a letter to [[Sarah Helen Whitman]], Poe called her love for him \"loathsome\" and wrote that he \"could do nothing but repel [it] with scorn\", he printed many of her poems to him in the ''[[Broadway Journal]]'' while he was its editor.<ref>Moss, 212</ref> Ellet was known for being meddlesome and vindictive,<ref>Silverman, 288</ref> and, while visiting the Poe household in late January 1846, she saw one of Osgood's personal letters to Poe.<ref name=Meyers191>Meyers, 191</ref> According to Ellet, Virginia pointed out \"fearful paragraphs\" in Osgood's letter.<ref name=Moss213>Moss, 213</ref> Ellet contacted Osgood and suggested she should beware of her indiscretions and asked Poe to return her letters,<ref name=Meyers191/> motivated either by jealousy or by a desire to cause scandal.<ref name=Moss213/> Osgood then sent [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Anne Lynch Botta]] to ask Poe on her behalf to return the letters. Angered by their interference, Poe called them \"Busy-bodies\" and said that Ellet had better \"look after her ''own'' letters\", suggesting indiscretion on her part.<ref name=Silverman290>Silverman, 290</ref> He then gathered up these letters from Ellet and left them at her house.<ref name=Meyers191/>\n\nThough these letters had already been returned to her, Ellet asked her brother \"to ''demand of me the letters''\".<ref name=Silverman290/> Her brother, Colonel William Lummis, did not believe that Poe had already returned them and threatened to kill him. In order to defend himself, Poe requested a pistol from [[Thomas Dunn English]].<ref name=Meyers191/> English, Poe's friend and a minor writer who was also a trained doctor and lawyer, likewise did not believe that Poe had already returned the letters and even questioned their existence.<ref name=Silverman290/> The easiest way out of the predicament, he said, \"was a retraction of unfounded charges\".<ref>Moss, 220</ref> Angered at being called a liar, Poe pushed English into a fistfight. Poe later claimed he was triumphant in the fight, though English claimed otherwise, and Poe's face was badly cut by one of English's rings.<ref name=Meyers191/> In Poe's version, he said, \"I gave E. a flogging which he will remember to the day of his death.\" Either way, the fight further sparked gossip over the Osgood affair.<ref>Silverman, 291</ref>\n\nOsgood's husband stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet unless she formally apologized for her insinuations. She retracted her statements in a letter to Osgood saying, \"The letter shown me by Mrs Poe ''must have been a forgery''\" created by Poe himself.<ref>Moss, 215</ref> She put all the blame on Poe, suggesting the incident was because Poe was \"intemperate and subject to acts of lunacy\".<ref name=Silverman292>Silverman, 292</ref> Ellet spread the rumor of Poe's insanity, which was taken up by other enemies of Poe and reported in newspapers. The St. Louis ''Reveille'' reported: \"A rumor is in circulation in New York, to the effect that Mr. Edgar A. Poe, the poet and author, has been deranged, and his friends are about to place him under the charge of [[Amariah Brigham|Dr. Brigham]] of the [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Insane Retreat]] at Utica.\"<ref>Meyers, 192</ref> The scandal eventually died down only when Osgood reunited with her husband.<ref name=Silverman292/> Virginia, however, had been very affected by the whole affair. She had received anonymous letters about her husband's alleged indiscretions as early as July 1845. It is presumed that Ellet was involved with these letters, and they so disturbed Virginia that she allegedly declared on her deathbed that \"Mrs. E. had been her murderer.\"<ref>Moss, 213\u2013214</ref>\n\n===Illness===\nBy this time, Virginia had developed [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], first seen sometime in the middle of January 1842. While singing and playing the piano, Virginia began to bleed from the mouth, though Poe said she merely \"ruptured a blood-vessel\".<ref>Silverman, 179</ref> Her health declined and she became an invalid, which drove Poe into a deep depression, especially as she occasionally showed signs of improvement. In a letter to a friend, Poe described his resulting mental state: \"Each time I felt all the agonies of her death&mdash;and at each accession of the disorder I loved her more dearly & clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitive&mdash;nervous in a very unusual degree. I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity.\"<ref>Meyers, 208</ref>\n\nVirginia's condition might have been what prompted the Poe family to move, in the hopes of finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within [[Philadelphia]] in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the [[Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site]] in [[Spring Garden District, Pennsylvania|Spring Garden]].<ref name=Silverman183>Silverman, 183</ref> In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden<ref>Quinn, 385</ref> and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing.<ref>Oberholtzer, 287</ref> The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street.<ref>Silverman, 219\u2013220</ref> By early 1846, family friend [[Elizabeth Oakes Smith]] said that Virginia admitted, \"I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; but I want to be as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy.\"<ref>Phillips, 1098</ref> She promised her husband that after her death she would be his guardian angel.<ref>Silverman, 301</ref>\n\n===Move to Fordham===\n[[File:Poe cottage - 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Virginia Poe endured the latter part of her illness at [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|this cottage]] in the [[Fordham, Bronx|Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], shown here in 1900.]]\nIn May 1846, the family (Poe, Virginia, and her mother, Maria) moved to a small [[cottage]] in [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]], about fourteen miles outside the city,<ref>Meyers, 322</ref> a [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|home which is still standing today]]. In what is the only surviving letter from Poe to Virginia, dated June 12, 1846, he urged her to remain optimistic: \"Keep up your heart in all hopelessness, and trust yet a little longer.\" Of his recent loss of the ''Broadway Journal'', the only magazine Poe ever owned, he said, \"I should have lost my courage ''but for you''&mdash;my darling little wife you are my ''greatest'' and ''only'' stimulus now to battle with this uncongenial, unsatisfactory and ungrateful life.\"<ref name=Meyers203>Meyers, 203</ref> But by November of that year, Virginia's condition was hopeless.<ref name=Silverman323 /> Her symptoms included irregular appetite, flushed cheeks, unstable pulse, night sweats, high fever, sudden chills, shortness of breath, chest pains, coughing and spitting up blood.<ref name=Meyers203/>\n\n[[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], a friend of Poe's and an influential editor, published an announcement on December 30, 1846, requesting help for the family, though his facts were not entirely correct:<ref name=Meyers202>Meyers, 202</ref>\n{{quote|Illness of Edgar A.

Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look.\"<ref>Meyers, 204</ref> That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human.<ref name=Krutch56>Krutch, 56</ref> [[William Gowans]], who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of \"matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any [[houri]], and her face defy the genius of a [[Antonio Canova|Canova]] to imitate\".<ref>Meyers, 92\u201393</ref> She might have been a little plump.<ref name=Krutch56/> Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even in the last years of her life.<ref name=Sova52/><ref name=Krutch56/><ref name=Meyers206/>\n\n[[File:VirginiaPoeMonument.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial marker to Virginia Clemm, Maria Clemm, and Edgar Allan Poe in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]]]\n\nWhile dying, Virginia asked her mother: \"Darling... will you console and take care of my poor Eddy&mdash;you will ''never never'' leave him?\"<ref>Silverman, 420</ref> Her mother stayed with Poe until his own death in 1849. As Virginia was dying, the family received many visitors, including an old friend named Mary Starr. At one point Virginia put Starr's hand in Poe's and asked her to \"be a friend to Eddy, and don't forsake him\".<ref name=Silverman326/> Virginia was tended to by 25-year-old Marie Louise Shew. Shew, who served as a nurse, knew medical care from her father and her husband, both doctors.<ref>Sova, 218</ref> She provided Virginia with a [[comforter]] as her only other cover was Poe's old military [[cloak]], as well as bottles of wine, which the invalid drank \"smiling, even when difficult to get it down\".<ref name=Silverman326>Silverman, 326</ref> Virginia also showed Poe a letter from Louisa Patterson, second wife of Poe's foster-father John Allan, which she had kept for years<ref>Quinn, 527</ref> and which suggested that Patterson had purposely caused the break between Allan and Poe.<ref name=Silverman326/>\n\n===Death===\nOn January 29, 1847, Poe wrote to Marie Louise Shew: \"My poor Virginia still lives, although failing fast and now suffering much pain.\"<ref name=Meyers206>Meyers, 206</ref>\nVirginia died the following day, January 30,<ref>Krutch, 169</ref> after five years of illness. Shew helped in organizing her funeral, even purchasing the coffin.<ref name=Silverman327>Silverman, 327</ref> Death notices appeared in several newspapers. On February 1, The New York ''Daily Tribune'' and the ''Herald'' carried the simple obituary: \"On Saturday, the 30th ult., of pulmonary consumption, in the 25th year of her age, VIRGINIA ELIZA, wife of EDGAR A. POE.\"<ref name=Silverman326/> The funeral was February 2, 1847.<ref name=Meyers206/> Attendees included Nathaniel Parker Willis, [[Ann S. Stephens]], and publisher [[George Pope Morris]]. Poe refused to look at his dead wife's face, saying he preferred to remember her living.<ref name=\"Phillips1203\"/> Though now buried at [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]], Virginia was originally buried in a [[Burial vault (tomb)|vault]] owned by the Valentine family, from whom the Poes rented their Fordham cottage.<ref name=Silverman327/>\n\nOnly one image of Virginia is known to exist, for which the painter had to take her corpse as model.<ref name=Sova52/> A few hours after her death, Poe realized he had no image of Virginia and so commissioned a portrait in [[watercolor painting|watercolor]].<ref name=Meyers206/> She is shown wearing \"beautiful linen\" that Shew said she had dressed her in;<ref name=Phillips1203>Phillips, 1203</ref> Shew might have been the portrait's artist, though this is uncertain.<ref name=Silverman327/> The image depicts her with a slight double chin and with hazel eyes.<ref name=Meyers206/> The image was passed down to the family of Virginia's half-sister Josephine, wife of Neilson Poe.<ref name=Phillips1203/>\n\nIn 1875, the same year in which her husband's body was reburied, the cemetery in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed.<ref>Meyers, 263</ref> Gill's story was reported in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the [[sexton (office)|sexton]] Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket.<ref name=Miller>Miller, John C. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1974204.htm The Exhumations and Reburials of Edgar and Virginia Poe and Mrs. Clemm]\", from ''Poe Studies'', vol. VII, no. 2, December 1974, p. 47</ref> Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885<ref>Phillips, 1205</ref>&mdash;the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.<ref name=Miller/>\n\n==Effect and influence on Poe==\nVirginia's death had a significant effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, \"the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all.\"<ref>Meyers, 207</ref> A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, \"a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before\", had fallen ill.<ref name=Sova53/> While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers.<ref name=Silverman183/> Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it \"in the ''death'' of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a man&mdash;it was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could ''not'' longer have endured without the total loss of reason\".<ref>Moss, 233</ref>\n\nPoe regularly visited Virginia's grave. As his friend Charles Chauncey Burr wrote, \"Many times, after the death of his beloved wife, was he found at the dead hour of a winter night, sitting beside her tomb almost frozen in the snow\".<ref>Phillips, 1206</ref> Shortly after Virginia's death, Poe courted several other women, including Nancy Richmond of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], [[Sarah Helen Whitman]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and childhood sweetheart [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] in Richmond. Even so, Frances Sargent Osgood, whom Poe also attempted to woo, believed \"that [Virginia] was the only woman whom he ever loved\".<ref>Krutch, 57</ref>\n\n===References in literature===\nMany of [[Bibliography of Edgar Allan Poe|Poe's works]] are interpreted autobiographically, with much of his work believed to reflect Virginia's long struggle with tuberculosis and her eventual death. The most discussed example is \"[[Annabel Lee]]\". This poem, which depicts a dead young bride and her mourning lover, is often assumed to have been inspired by Virginia, though other women in Poe's life are potential candidates including Frances Sargent Osgood<ref>Meyers, 244</ref> and Sarah Helen Whitman.<ref>Sova, 12</ref> A similar poem, \"[[Ulalume]]\", is also believed to be a memorial tribute to Virginia,<ref>Meyers, 211</ref> as is \"[[Lenore (poem)|Lenore]]\", whose title character is described as \"the most lovely dead that ever died so young!\"<ref>Silverman, 202</ref> After Poe's death, [[George Gilfillan]] of the London-based ''Critic'' said Poe was responsible for his wife's death, \"hurrying her to a premature grave, that he might write 'Annabel Lee' and '[[The Raven]]'\".<ref>Campbell, Killis. \"The Poe-Griswold Controversy\", ''The Mind of Poe and Other Studies''. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 79.</ref> However, \"The Raven\" was written and published two years before Virginia's death.\n\nVirginia is also seen in Poe's prose. The [[short story]] \"[[Eleonora (short story)|Eleonora]]\" (1842)&mdash;which features a narrator preparing to marry his cousin, with whom he lives alongside her mother&mdash;may also refer to Virginia's illness. When Poe wrote it, his wife had just begun to show signs of her illness.<ref>Sova, 78</ref> It was shortly thereafter that the couple moved to New York City by boat and Poe published \"[[The Oblong Box (short story)|The Oblong Box]]\" (1844). This story, which shows a man mourning his young wife while transporting her corpse by boat, seems to suggest Poe's feelings about Virginia's impending death. As the ship sinks, the husband would rather die than be separated from his wife's corpse.<ref>Silverman, 228\u2013229</ref> The short story \"[[Ligeia]]\", whose title character suffers a slow and lingering death, may also be inspired by Virginia.<ref>Hoffman, 255\u2013256</ref> After his wife's death, Poe edited his first published story, \"[[Metzengerstein]]\", to remove the narrator's line, \"I would wish all I love to perish of that gentle disease\", a reference to tuberculosis.<ref name=Meyers206/>\n\n===References in music===\nIn track 9 of their 2008 debut album ''[[Le Pop]]'', Norwegian band [[Katzenjammer (band)|Katzenjammer]] performed a song entitled \"Virginia Clemm\". Set to the tune of a musical clock, the song's lyrics refer to Virginia's early marriage at 13 years of age (\"He was a child I was a child / Sentimental and wild\"), to her husband's alleged affairs (\"The other woman to explain / Her letters I deplore\"), to her untimely death (\"For twelve short years / We lived out of health\"), to the band's perceived obsessions of Poe's subsequent obsession with his wife's death (\"Heir of my illness / Writer of all the stories and the words / That I'm haunting / That I'm haunting\") as well as alluding, in the last verse (\"And I'll leave you nevermore\"), to the poem \"[[The Raven]]\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|15em}}\n\n==References==\n*Hoffman, Daniel.

The couple were [[cousin|first cousins]] and publicly married when Virginia Clemm was 13 and Poe was 27. Biographers disagree as to the nature of the couple's relationship. Though their marriage was loving, some biographers suggest they viewed one another more like a brother and sister. In January 1842, she contracted [[tuberculosis]], growing worse for five years until she died of the disease at the age of 24 in [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|the family's cottage]], at that time outside [[New York City]].\n\nAlong with other family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived together off and on for several years before their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City|New York]]. A few years after their wedding, Poe was involved in a substantial scandal involving [[Frances Sargent Osgood]] and [[Elizabeth F. Ellet]]. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]] in Baltimore, [[Maryland]]. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.\n\nThe disease and eventual death of his wife had a substantial effect on Edgar Allan Poe, who became despondent and turned to alcohol to cope. Her struggles with illness and death are believed to have affected his poetry and prose, where dying young women appear as a frequent motif, as in \"[[Annabel Lee]]\", \"[[The Raven]]\", and \"[[Ligeia]]\".\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:PoeFamilyTree.svg|thumb|400px|Poe family tree]]\n\nVirginia Eliza Clemm was born in 1822<ref>Thomas, Dwight & David K.

The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear.<ref name=Silverman107>Silverman, 107</ref> Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev.

Ellet]], became enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood.<ref name=Meyers190/> Though, in a letter to [[Sarah Helen Whitman]], Poe called her love for him \"loathsome\" and wrote that he \"could do nothing but repel [it] with scorn\", he printed many of her poems to him in the ''[[Broadway Journal]]'' while he was its editor.<ref>Moss, 212</ref> Ellet was known for being meddlesome and vindictive,<ref>Silverman, 288</ref> and, while visiting the Poe household in late January 1846, she saw one of Osgood's personal letters to Poe.<ref name=Meyers191>Meyers, 191</ref> According to Ellet, Virginia pointed out \"fearful paragraphs\" in Osgood's letter.<ref name=Moss213>Moss, 213</ref> Ellet contacted Osgood and suggested she should beware of her indiscretions and asked Poe to return her letters,<ref name=Meyers191/> motivated either by jealousy or by a desire to cause scandal.<ref name=Moss213/> Osgood then sent [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Anne Lynch Botta]] to ask Poe on her behalf to return the letters. Angered by their interference, Poe called them \"Busy-bodies\" and said that Ellet had better \"look after her ''own'' letters\", suggesting indiscretion on her part.<ref name=Silverman290>Silverman, 290</ref> He then gathered up these letters from Ellet and left them at her house.<ref name=Meyers191/>\n\nThough these letters had already been returned to her, Ellet asked her brother \"to ''demand of me the letters''\".<ref name=Silverman290/> Her brother, Colonel William Lummis, did not believe that Poe had already returned them and threatened to kill him. In order to defend himself, Poe requested a pistol from [[Thomas Dunn English]].<ref name=Meyers191/> English, Poe's friend and a minor writer who was also a trained doctor and lawyer, likewise did not believe that Poe had already returned the letters and even questioned their existence.<ref name=Silverman290/> The easiest way out of the predicament, he said, \"was a retraction of unfounded charges\".<ref>Moss, 220</ref> Angered at being called a liar, Poe pushed English into a fistfight. Poe later claimed he was triumphant in the fight, though English claimed otherwise, and Poe's face was badly cut by one of English's rings.<ref name=Meyers191/> In Poe's version, he said, \"I gave E. a flogging which he will remember to the day of his death.\" Either way, the fight further sparked gossip over the Osgood affair.<ref>Silverman, 291</ref>\n\nOsgood's husband stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet unless she formally apologized for her insinuations. She retracted her statements in a letter to Osgood saying, \"The letter shown me by Mrs Poe ''must have been a forgery''\" created by Poe himself.<ref>Moss, 215</ref> She put all the blame on Poe, suggesting the incident was because Poe was \"intemperate and subject to acts of lunacy\".<ref name=Silverman292>Silverman, 292</ref> Ellet spread the rumor of Poe's insanity, which was taken up by other enemies of Poe and reported in newspapers. The St. Louis ''Reveille'' reported: \"A rumor is in circulation in New York, to the effect that Mr. Edgar A. Poe, the poet and author, has been deranged, and his friends are about to place him under the charge of [[Amariah Brigham|Dr. Brigham]] of the [[Utica Psychiatric Center|Insane Retreat]] at Utica.\"<ref>Meyers, 192</ref> The scandal eventually died down only when Osgood reunited with her husband.<ref name=Silverman292/> Virginia, however, had been very affected by the whole affair. She had received anonymous letters about her husband's alleged indiscretions as early as July 1845. It is presumed that Ellet was involved with these letters, and they so disturbed Virginia that she allegedly declared on her deathbed that \"Mrs. E. had been her murderer.\"<ref>Moss, 213\u2013214</ref>\n\n===Illness===\nBy this time, Virginia had developed [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], first seen sometime in the middle of January 1842. While singing and playing the piano, Virginia began to bleed from the mouth, though Poe said she merely \"ruptured a blood-vessel\".<ref>Silverman, 179</ref> Her health declined and she became an invalid, which drove Poe into a deep depression, especially as she occasionally showed signs of improvement. In a letter to a friend, Poe described his resulting mental state: \"Each time I felt all the agonies of her death&mdash;and at each accession of the disorder I loved her more dearly & clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity. But I am constitutionally sensitive&mdash;nervous in a very unusual degree. I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity.\"<ref>Meyers, 208</ref>\n\nVirginia's condition might have been what prompted the Poe family to move, in the hopes of finding a healthier environment for her. They moved several times within [[Philadelphia]] in the early 1840s and their last home in that city is now preserved as the [[Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site]] in [[Spring Garden District, Pennsylvania|Spring Garden]].<ref name=Silverman183>Silverman, 183</ref> In this home, Virginia was well enough to tend the flower garden<ref>Quinn, 385</ref> and entertain visitors by playing the harp or the piano and singing.<ref>Oberholtzer, 287</ref> The family then moved to New York sometime in early April 1844, traveling by train and steamboat. Virginia waited on board the ship while her husband secured space at a boarding house on Greenwich Street.<ref>Silverman, 219\u2013220</ref> By early 1846, family friend [[Elizabeth Oakes Smith]] said that Virginia admitted, \"I know I shall die soon; I know I can't get well; but I want to be as happy as possible, and make Edgar happy.\"<ref>Phillips, 1098</ref> She promised her husband that after her death she would be his guardian angel.<ref>Silverman, 301</ref>\n\n===Move to Fordham===\n[[File:Poe cottage - 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Virginia Poe endured the latter part of her illness at [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|this cottage]] in the [[Fordham, Bronx|Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]], shown here in 1900.]]\nIn May 1846, the family (Poe, Virginia, and her mother, Maria) moved to a small [[cottage]] in [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]], about fourteen miles outside the city,<ref>Meyers, 322</ref> a [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage|home which is still standing today]]. In what is the only surviving letter from Poe to Virginia, dated June 12, 1846, he urged her to remain optimistic: \"Keep up your heart in all hopelessness, and trust yet a little longer.\" Of his recent loss of the ''Broadway Journal'', the only magazine Poe ever owned, he said, \"I should have lost my courage ''but for you''&mdash;my darling little wife you are my ''greatest'' and ''only'' stimulus now to battle with this uncongenial, unsatisfactory and ungrateful life.\"<ref name=Meyers203>Meyers, 203</ref> But by November of that year, Virginia's condition was hopeless.<ref name=Silverman323 /> Her symptoms included irregular appetite, flushed cheeks, unstable pulse, night sweats, high fever, sudden chills, shortness of breath, chest pains, coughing and spitting up blood.<ref name=Meyers203/>\n\n[[Nathaniel Parker Willis]], a friend of Poe's and an influential editor, published an announcement on December 30, 1846, requesting help for the family, though his facts were not entirely correct:<ref name=Meyers202>Meyers, 202</ref>\n{{quote|Illness of Edgar A. Poe. &mdash;We regret to learn that this gentleman and his wife are both dangerously ill with the consumption, and that the hand of misfortune lies heavily on their temporal affairs. We are sorry to mention the fact that they are so far reduced as to be barely able to obtain the necessaries of life. That is, indeed, a hard lot, and we do hope that the friends and admirers of Mr. Poe will come promptly to his assistance in his bitterest hour of need.<ref name=Silverman324/>}}\n[[File:VirginiaPoeBedroom.jpg|thumb|right|Her bedroom at Poe Cottage.]]\nWillis, who had not corresponded with Poe for two years and had since lost his own wife, was one of his greatest supporters in this period. He sent Poe and his wife an inspirational Christmas book, ''The Marriage Ring; or How to Make a Home Happy''.<ref name=Silverman324>Silverman, 324</ref>\n\nThe announcement was similar to one made for Poe's mother, [[Eliza Poe]], during her last stages of tuberculosis.<ref name=Meyers202/> Other newspapers picked up on the story: \"Great God!\", said one, \"is it possible, that the literary people of the Union, will let poor Poe perish by starvation and lean faced beggary in New York? For so we are led to believe, from frequent notices in the papers, stating that Poe and his wife are both down upon a bed of misery, death, and disease, with not a ducat in the world.\"<ref name=Silverman324/> The ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' asserted that Virginia was in a hopeless condition and that Poe was bereft: \"It is said that Edgar A. Poe is lying dangerously with brain fever, and that his wife is in the last stages of consumption&mdash;they are without money and without friends.\"<ref name=\"Meyers203\"/> Even editor [[Hiram Fuller (journalist)|Hiram Fuller]], whom Poe had previously sued for [[defamation|libel]], attempted in the ''New York Mirror'' to garner support for Poe and his wife: \"We, whom he has quarrelled with, will take the lead\", he wrote.<ref name=Silverman324/>\n\nVirginia was described as having dark hair and violet eyes, with skin so pale it was called \"pure white\",<ref>Krutch, 55\u201356</ref> causing a \"bad complexion that spoiled her looks\".<ref name=Silverman82/> One visitor to the Poe family noted that \"the rose-tint upon her cheek was too bright\", possibly a symptom of her illness.<ref>Silverman, 182</ref> Another visitor in Fordham wrote, \"Mrs. Poe looked very young; she had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness of complexion, which was a perfect pallor. Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her raven hair gave her an unearthly look.\"<ref>Meyers, 204</ref> That unearthly look was mentioned by others who suggested it made her look not quite human.<ref name=Krutch56>Krutch, 56</ref> [[William Gowans]], who once lodged with the family, described Virginia as a woman of \"matchless beauty and loveliness, her eye could match that of any [[houri]], and her face defy the genius of a [[Antonio Canova|Canova]] to imitate\".<ref>Meyers, 92\u201393</ref> She might have been a little plump.<ref name=Krutch56/> Many contemporary accounts as well as modern biographers remark on her childlike appearance even in the last years of her life.<ref name=Sova52/><ref name=Krutch56/><ref name=Meyers206/>\n\n[[File:VirginiaPoeMonument.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial marker to Virginia Clemm, Maria Clemm, and Edgar Allan Poe in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]]]\n\nWhile dying, Virginia asked her mother: \"Darling... will you console and take care of my poor Eddy&mdash;you will ''never never'' leave him?\"<ref>Silverman, 420</ref> Her mother stayed with Poe until his own death in 1849. As Virginia was dying, the family received many visitors, including an old friend named Mary Starr. At one point Virginia put Starr's hand in Poe's and asked her to \"be a friend to Eddy, and don't forsake him\".<ref name=Silverman326/> Virginia was tended to by 25-year-old Marie Louise Shew. Shew, who served as a nurse, knew medical care from her father and her husband, both doctors.<ref>Sova, 218</ref> She provided Virginia with a [[comforter]] as her only other cover was Poe's old military [[cloak]], as well as bottles of wine, which the invalid drank \"smiling, even when difficult to get it down\".<ref name=Silverman326>Silverman, 326</ref> Virginia also showed Poe a letter from Louisa Patterson, second wife of Poe's foster-father John Allan, which she had kept for years<ref>Quinn, 527</ref> and which suggested that Patterson had purposely caused the break between Allan and Poe.<ref name=Silverman326/>\n\n===Death===\nOn January 29, 1847, Poe wrote to Marie Louise Shew: \"My poor Virginia still lives, although failing fast and now suffering much pain.\"<ref name=Meyers206>Meyers, 206</ref>\nVirginia died the following day, January 30,<ref>Krutch, 169</ref> after five years of illness. Shew helped in organizing her funeral, even purchasing the coffin.<ref name=Silverman327>Silverman, 327</ref> Death notices appeared in several newspapers. On February 1, The New York ''Daily Tribune'' and the ''Herald'' carried the simple obituary: \"On Saturday, the 30th ult., of pulmonary consumption, in the 25th year of her age, VIRGINIA ELIZA, wife of EDGAR A. POE.\"<ref name=Silverman326/> The funeral was February 2, 1847.<ref name=Meyers206/> Attendees included Nathaniel Parker Willis, [[Ann S. Stephens]], and publisher [[George Pope Morris]]. Poe refused to look at his dead wife's face, saying he preferred to remember her living.<ref name=\"Phillips1203\"/> Though now buried at [[Westminster Hall and Burying Ground]], Virginia was originally buried in a [[Burial vault (tomb)|vault]] owned by the Valentine family, from whom the Poes rented their Fordham cottage.<ref name=Silverman327/>\n\nOnly one image of Virginia is known to exist, for which the painter had to take her corpse as model.<ref name=Sova52/> A few hours after her death, Poe realized he had no image of Virginia and so commissioned a portrait in [[watercolor painting|watercolor]].<ref name=Meyers206/> She is shown wearing \"beautiful linen\" that Shew said she had dressed her in;<ref name=Phillips1203>Phillips, 1203</ref> Shew might have been the portrait's artist, though this is uncertain.<ref name=Silverman327/> The image depicts her with a slight double chin and with hazel eyes.<ref name=Meyers206/> The image was passed down to the family of Virginia's half-sister Josephine, wife of Neilson Poe.<ref name=Phillips1203/>\n\nIn 1875, the same year in which her husband's body was reburied, the cemetery in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed.<ref>Meyers, 263</ref> Gill's story was reported in the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 at exactly the moment that the [[sexton (office)|sexton]] Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket.<ref name=Miller>Miller, John C. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/pstudies/ps1970/p1974204.htm The Exhumations and Reburials of Edgar and Virginia Poe and Mrs. Clemm]\", from ''Poe Studies'', vol. VII, no. 2, December 1974, p. 47</ref> Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885<ref>Phillips, 1205</ref>&mdash;the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.<ref name=Miller/>\n\n==Effect and influence on Poe==\nVirginia's death had a significant effect on Poe. After her death, Poe was deeply saddened for several months. A friend said of him, \"the loss of his wife was a sad blow to him. He did not seem to care, after she was gone, whether he lived an hour, a day, a week or a year; she was his all.\"<ref>Meyers, 207</ref> A year after her death, he wrote to a friend that he had experienced the greatest evil a man can suffer when, he said, \"a wife, whom I loved as no man ever loved before\", had fallen ill.<ref name=Sova53/> While Virginia was still struggling to recover, Poe turned to alcohol after abstaining for quite some time. How often and how much he drank is a controversial issue, debated in Poe's lifetime and also by modern biographers.<ref name=Silverman183/> Poe referred to his emotional response to his wife's sickness as his own illness, and that he found the cure to it \"in the ''death'' of my wife. This I can & do endure as becomes a man&mdash;it was the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope & despair which I could ''not'' longer have endured without the total loss of reason\".<ref>Moss, 233</ref>\n\nPoe regularly visited Virginia's grave. As his friend Charles Chauncey Burr wrote, \"Many times, after the death of his beloved wife, was he found at the dead hour of a winter night, sitting beside her tomb almost frozen in the snow\".<ref>Phillips, 1206</ref> Shortly after Virginia's death, Poe courted several other women, including Nancy Richmond of [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], [[Sarah Helen Whitman]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and childhood sweetheart [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] in Richmond. Even so, Frances Sargent Osgood, whom Poe also attempted to woo, believed \"that [Virginia] was the only woman whom he ever loved\".<ref>Krutch, 57</ref>\n\n===References in literature===\nMany of [[Bibliography of Edgar Allan Poe|Poe's works]] are interpreted autobiographically, with much of his work believed to reflect Virginia's long struggle with tuberculosis and her eventual death. The most discussed example is \"[[Annabel Lee]]\". This poem, which depicts a dead young bride and her mourning lover, is often assumed to have been inspired by Virginia, though other women in Poe's life are potential candidates including Frances Sargent Osgood<ref>Meyers, 244</ref> and Sarah Helen Whitman.<ref>Sova, 12</ref> A similar poem, \"[[Ulalume]]\", is also believed to be a memorial tribute to Virginia,<ref>Meyers, 211</ref> as is \"[[Lenore (poem)|Lenore]]\", whose title character is described as \"the most lovely dead that ever died so young!\"<ref>Silverman, 202</ref> After Poe's death, [[George Gilfillan]] of the London-based ''Critic'' said Poe was responsible for his wife's death, \"hurrying her to a premature grave, that he might write 'Annabel Lee' and '[[The Raven]]'\".<ref>Campbell, Killis. \"The Poe-Griswold Controversy\", ''The Mind of Poe and Other Studies''. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 79.</ref> However, \"The Raven\" was written and published two years before Virginia's death.\n\nVirginia is also seen in Poe's prose. The [[short story]] \"[[Eleonora (short story)|Eleonora]]\" (1842)&mdash;which features a narrator preparing to marry his cousin, with whom he lives alongside her mother&mdash;may also refer to Virginia's illness. When Poe wrote it, his wife had just begun to show signs of her illness.<ref>Sova, 78</ref> It was shortly thereafter that the couple moved to New York City by boat and Poe published \"[[The Oblong Box (short story)|The Oblong Box]]\" (1844). This story, which shows a man mourning his young wife while transporting her corpse by boat, seems to suggest Poe's feelings about Virginia's impending death. As the ship sinks, the husband would rather die than be separated from his wife's corpse.<ref>Silverman, 228\u2013229</ref> The short story \"[[Ligeia]]\", whose title character suffers a slow and lingering death, may also be inspired by Virginia.<ref>Hoffman, 255\u2013256</ref> After his wife's death, Poe edited his first published story, \"[[Metzengerstein]]\", to remove the narrator's line, \"I would wish all I love to perish of that gentle disease\", a reference to tuberculosis.<ref name=Meyers206/>\n\n===References in music===\nIn track 9 of their 2008 debut album ''[[Le Pop]]'', Norwegian band [[Katzenjammer (band)|Katzenjammer]] performed a song entitled \"Virginia Clemm\". Set to the tune of a musical clock, the song's lyrics refer to Virginia's early marriage at 13 years of age (\"He was a child I was a child / Sentimental and wild\"), to her husband's alleged affairs (\"The other woman to explain / Her letters I deplore\"), to her untimely death (\"For twelve short years / We lived out of health\"), to the band's perceived obsessions of Poe's subsequent obsession with his wife's death (\"Heir of my illness / Writer of all the stories and the words / That I'm haunting / That I'm haunting\") as well as alluding, in the last verse (\"And I'll leave you nevermore\"), to the poem \"[[The Raven]]\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|15em}}\n\n==References==\n*Hoffman, Daniel.
