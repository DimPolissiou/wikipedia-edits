Moon is primarily \"true father,\" probably the Messiah, and only secondarily a theologian. In an effort to systematize Moon's teachings, several members of the Unification Church in Korea have put together a developing theological system in Divine Principle which is impressive in its imaginative nature, coherence, and consistency, if not in its Christian orthodoxy. As the most complete expression of Moonist teachings to date, Divine Principle is the basic text of the Unification Church.4 The two major divisions of the system are the doctrines of Creation and Restoration. There are many subsets to these major divisions, but Creation and Restoration are the foci for the Moonist theological system.\"</ref> Moon was intent on replacing worldwide forms of Christianity with his new unified vision of it,<ref name=\"WP Obit\"/> Moon being a self-declared [[messiah]]; in effect, the [[Second Coming of Jesus]].

Central to Unification teachings is the concept that [[fall of man|fallen humanity]] can be restored to [[God]] only through a messiah, who comes as a new [[Adam]] to become the new head of the human race, replacing the sinful parents, through whom mankind can be reborn into God's family. According to the religion, Jesus is this messiah,<ref name=\"Sontag102\"/> but his premature execution (before he could start a family) meant that his messianic role as the head of a sinless new humanity was passed on to Moon.\n\nIn 1980 Unification theologian [[Young Oon Kim]] wrote:\n{{quote|Unification theology teaches that Jesus came to establish the kingdom of heaven on earth. As St. Paul wrote, Jesus was to be the new Adam restoring the lost garden of Eden. For this purpose he chose twelve apostles, symbolizing the original twelve tribes of Israel, and sent out seventy disciples, symbolizing all the nations of the world. Like John the Baptist, Jesus proclaimed that the long-awaited kingdom of heaven was at hand (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus was appointed God's earthly representative in order to subjugate Satan, cleanse men of original sin and free them from the power of evil. Christ's mission involved liberation from sin and raising mankind to the perfection stage. His purpose was to bring about the kingdom of heaven in our world with the help of men filled with divine truth and love. Jesus' goal was to restore the garden of Eden, a place of joy and beauty in which true families of perfected parents would dwell with God in a full relationship of reciprocal love.<ref>Kim, Young Oon, 1980, [http://www.religious.org/ucbooks/UTheol/toc.htm Unification Theology], Barrytown, NY: [[Unification Theological Seminary]], Library of Congress Cataloging number 80-52872</ref>}}\n\nThe Unification movement view of Jesus has been criticized by mainstream Christian authors and theologians. In their influential book ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults]]'' (first published in 1965), Walter Ralston Martin and Ravi K. Zacharias disagreed with the ''Divine Principle'' on the issues of the [[divinity of Christ]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married and a literal [[resurrection of Jesus]] as well as a literal [[Second Coming]].  They add: \"Moon makes all men equal in 'divinity' to Jesus, thereby striking a blow at the uniqueness of Christ.\"<ref>Walter Ralston Martin, Ravi K. Zacharias, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', Bethany House, 2003, {{ISBN|0764228218}}  pages 368-370</ref>\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' responds to this criticism  by saying:\n{{quote|There is no greater value than that of a person who has realized the ideal of creation.

Indemnity is that which people do to restore themselves to God's kingdom. [[Young Oon Kim]] describes it this way: 'We atone for our sins through specific acts of penance.'

When someone has lost his original position or state, he must make some condition to be restored to it. The making of such conditions of restitution is called indemnity. .... God's work to restore people to their true, unfallen state by having them fulfill indemnity conditions is called the providence of restoration through indemnity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Exposition of the Divine Principle''</ref>}}\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' goes on to explain three types of indemnity conditions. Equal conditions of indemnity pay back the full value of what was lost. The [[Bible|biblical]] verse \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example of an equal indemnity condition. Lesser conditions of indemnity provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. [[Faith]], [[baptism]], and the [[eucharist]] are mentioned as examples of lesser indemnity conditions. Greater conditions of indemnity come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid to make up for the earlier failure. [[Abraham]]'s attempted sacrifice of his son [[Isaac]] (Gen. 22:1-18) and the [[Israelites]]' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under [[Moses]] (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater indemnity conditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a \"just and righteous\" God to work through mankind. [[Jesus]]' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and [[Christianity]]'s history of [[martyr]]dom are mentioned as examples of this.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then states that human beings, not God or the [[angel]]s, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.<ref>Yamamoto, J.

For this purpose he chose twelve apostles, symbolizing the original twelve tribes of Israel, and sent out seventy disciples, symbolizing all the nations of the world. Like John the Baptist, Jesus proclaimed that the long-awaited kingdom of heaven was at hand (Matt. 4:17).  Jesus was appointed God's earthly representative in order to subjugate Satan, cleanse men of original sin and free them from the power of evil. Christ's mission involved liberation from sin and raising mankind to the perfection stage. His purpose was to bring about the kingdom of heaven in our world with the help of men filled with divine truth and love. Jesus' goal was to restore the garden of Eden, a place of joy and beauty in which true families of perfected parents would dwell with God in a full relationship of reciprocal love.<ref>Kim, Young Oon, 1980, [http://www.religious.org/ucbooks/UTheol/toc.htm Unification Theology], Barrytown, NY: [[Unification Theological Seminary]], Library of Congress Cataloging number 80-52872</ref>}}\n\nThe Unification movement view of Jesus has been criticized by mainstream Christian authors and theologians.

Zacharias disagreed with the ''Divine Principle'' on the issues of the [[divinity of Christ]], the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], the Unification Church's belief that Jesus should have married and a literal [[resurrection of Jesus]] as well as a literal [[Second Coming]].

When someone has lost his original position or state, he must make some condition to be restored to it. The making of such conditions of restitution is called indemnity. .... God's work to restore people to their true, unfallen state by having them fulfill indemnity conditions is called the providence of restoration through indemnity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Exposition of the Divine Principle''</ref>}}\n\nThe ''Divine Principle'' goes on to explain three types of indemnity conditions. Equal conditions of indemnity pay back the full value of what was lost. The [[Bible|biblical]] verse \"life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example of an equal indemnity condition. Lesser conditions of indemnity provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. [[Faith]], [[baptism]], and the [[eucharist]] are mentioned as examples of lesser indemnity conditions. Greater conditions of indemnity come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid to make up for the earlier failure. [[Abraham]]'s attempted sacrifice of his son [[Isaac]] (Gen. 22:1-18) and the [[Israelites]]' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under [[Moses]] (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples of greater indemnity conditions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a \"just and righteous\" God to work through mankind. [[Jesus]]' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and [[Christianity]]'s history of [[martyr]]dom are mentioned as examples of this.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The ''Divine Principle'' then states that human beings, not God or the [[angel]]s, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.<ref>Yamamoto, J.

Vijay is obedient, honest and hardworking and lives with his mother. He is always haunted by the death of his girlfriend Renu, who died in an accident. Raja is the son of wealthy businessman Mahendra Pratap, who hates his son because his wife died during childbirth. He blames Raja for her death and prefers to not have any relationship with his son. As a result, the task of raising Raja falls on the shoulders of their loyal servant Bansi, who gives Raja the love of a mother and a father.\n\nDespite Bansi's good upbringing, Vijay's mum's love and Vijay's guidance, Raja still grows up to be a philandering playboy who lives a hedonistic lifestyle. Being a loyal friend, Vijay always has to bail his friend out of trouble and he even berates him and urges him to change his womanizing ways, but Raja is incorrigible.\n\nOne day, Vijay's mother meets a kind girl called Rama in the temple and decides to get her married to her son. Vijay reluctantly agrees, without even knowing who the girl is. Because of some important business matter, Raja has to travel to London and so is unable to attend the wedding. On the wedding night, Vijay sees his bride's face for the first time and is quite shocked, as it turns out that Rama is the same girl whom Raja had once raped and Vijay hadn't been able to save her. It immediately became obvious to Vijay that Rama had married him only to exact her revenge as she believed that Vijay was in cahoots with Raja when the latter raped her.\n\nWhen Raja returns from London, he too is shocked to see Rama, but neither Raja nor Vijay can reveal anything to Vijay's mother. The two continue to live their lives while every moment being tormented by what they did to Rama. This inner guilt creates a rift between the two friends and even pushes Vijay into becoming an alcoholic. When Rama learns of Vijay's innocence, she has a change of heart and she and Vijay reconcile. Rama also says that she has chosen to let go of her hate and has forgiven Raja.\n\nRaja however, unaware of this and tormented by his guilt decides to commit suicide by drinking poison. Vijay and Rama rush to Raja's side, but they are too late. Raja eventually dies in his friend's arms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxfxbipEfcg|title=Bahaar Ane Tak (1990)|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Roopa Ganguly]] as Rama\n*[[Sumeet Saigal]] as Rajkumar Pratap \"Raja\"\n*[[Moon Moon Sen]] as Renu\n*Tariq Shah as Vijay\n*Ram Mohan as Bansi\n*[[Navin Nischol]] as Mahendra Pratap\n*[[Shammi (actress)|Shammi]] as Vijay's mother<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinestaan.com/movies/bahaar-aane-tak-6966/cast-crew|title=Bahaar Aane Tak (1990) - Full Cast and Crew {{!}} Cinestaan.com|website=www.cinestaan.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-03}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nLyrics written by [[Indivar]].\n{| border=\"10\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!  !!

Whilst the school mainly admits boys, a small number girls have been educated at the school within the Sixth Form. The School holds specialist status in Sports.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sittingbourne Adult Education College - geograph.org.uk - 364022.jpg|thumb|left|The old Borden Grammar School now Sittingbourne Adult Education College]]\n\nPlans for a boys' school in [[Borden, Kent|Borden]] began in 1875, as a new way of using some of the accumulated funds from the Barrow Trust, established from the estate of William Barrow (d. 1707), a local farmer, for the benefit of the poorer members of the village. The trustees of the Barrow Trust became the new school's governors, and they began organising a suitable sum of money to allow the project to go ahead. Within a few years, they had amassed \u00a39,500 and the building of the school began on a seven acre site in Riddles Road, which belonged to the trust. The Barrow Boy's School, Borden, was to be an independent day and boarding school, designed to have some fifty boarders and some 150 day pupils. The School formally opened in October 1878, with just twenty-three pupils (nine of them from the village of Borden) and one full-time member of staff (the headmaster, Rev. William Henry Bond). A full-time assistant master was recruited in 1880, followed by a second full-time assistant master in 1883.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Rev. Bond left to become headmaster of [[Churcher's College]], and was replaced by James Williamson Thurnham, who was keen to increase the number of boarders at the School, which by now was known as Barrow School, Borden. Boarders came from all parts of the country and, indeed, the world, with some hailing from France, Spain, India and Jamaica. Thurnham left to establish [[New College, Herne Bay]] in 1906, and took most of the 120 boarders and the majority of the School's staff with him, leaving the next headmaster, William Murdock, with the difficult task of building up numbers once more. Soon after Murdock's appointment, the School began to be referred to as Borden Barrow's Boys' School and was taken into the state education system in 1906. The School now became known as Borden School, a name that had appeared as part of the School badge since at least 1885, but, by 1910, there were six annual scholarships to \"Borden Grammar School\", the name by which the School has been known ever since. Up until the 1914, there had still been a few boarders at the School but, after the First World War, it became a day grammar school.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), pp. 3-4</ref>\n\nIn the early summer of 1929, the School moved to its present site on the Avenue of Remembrance, Sittingbourne, not only because of the rising maintenance costs of the original premises and the fact that it was no longer possible to attract suitable numbers of boys with the school being so far from the centre of Sittingbourne. The new building was formally opened by [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|George, Lord Harris]] in October 1929, but the School retained its original name despite no longer being located in Borden. The old school building was used for a time as an agricultural college, and is now an [[Adult Education]] Centre.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Short|first1=Bryan|title=Borden Grammar School \u2013 the early years part 1|url=http://old-bordenians.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/memory-lane/16-founding-a-school-in-the-1870s-part-i|website=The Old Bordenian Association|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1931, work began on the construction of a cricket pavilion as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who were killed in the [[World War I|First World War]], most of the money being provided by the Old Bordenian Association. The original pavilion was replaced by a modern structure in 2004, which continues to serve as a memorial to all those old boys who were killed in the First World War.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p.5</ref>\n\nIn May 1940, the Government announced that a number of towns on the Southeast Coast were to have their children [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]]: [[Sheerness]] was one such town, and some sixty-five pupils from Borden, accompanied by three masters, were evacuated to [[Pengam]], South Wales, where the boys were to attend the [[Lewis School, Pengam|Lewis School]]. Meanwhile, air raid shelters were built on the east side of the school site in Sittingbourne and, later, to the north of the cricket pavilion. In May 1949, a clock tower was unveiled by the [[Alfred Rose (bishop)|Bishop of Dover]] as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who lost their lives in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the funds once again being provided by the Old Bordenian Association.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe word \"Grammar\" was removed from the School's name in 1972, in accordance with a change in the local education system, and there were fears that Borden might be turned into a Sixth Form college. These fears were, however, not realised, and Borden remained a selective school, admitting pupils at thirteen rather than after the 11+ Examination. In 1982, the word \"Grammar\" was restored to the School's name, and entry at eleven resumed in 1994.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 7</ref>\n\nIn 1979, a new teaching block, the Hardy Block (named for the School's fifth headmaster, George Hardy), was opened. The first phase of another new teaching block, the Short Block (named for the School's sixth headmaster, Bryan Short), was opened in 1995 and completed in 1998; the finished building was formally opened by [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton|Robin, Lord Kingsdown]], the great-grandson of the School's first chair of governors, Sir [[Edward Leigh Pemberton]].<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref> One of the science laboratories, the Hooker Advanced Physics Laboratory, was named for and opened by Sir [[Stanley Hooker]], an Old Bordenian and aeronautical engineer.\n\n== Modern School ==\nOn 1 September 2006 the School was awarded Specialist status for Sports and Modern Foreign Languages. With this status and an associated increase in funding, the school has built many new facilities including a multi use games area (MUGA) and the William Barrow Library. In 2011 the school also received a sports bursary, with which it used to construct a climbing wall in the gym.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/about-us|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nBorden became an [[academy]] in 2012, which changed the flexibility of the curriculum able to be taught at the school as well as increased funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Borden Grammar School, Sittingbourne|url=https://www.kent-teach.com/School/Directory/Details.aspx?SchoolId=2213|website=Kent-Teach|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe School, along with other Sittingbourne-based Secondary schools, [[Fulston Manor School]] and [[Highsted Grammar School]] for Girls, maintain a close community and share teaching responsibilities of specialised subjects at A-Level, with Borden teaching [[Economics]], [[Sociology]] and [[Psychology]].\n\n== Old Bordenian Association ==\nThe Old Bordenian Association (OBA) was established in 1912, re-established in 1925, and membership is open to all former pupils and staff of Borden Grammar School. The OBA's annual journal, ''The Maroon'', was first published in 1937, but was replaced by a website in 2009. The OBA holds an annual reunion dinner, formerly held inside the Old Hall but now in the nearby premises of UK Paper Leisure Club. The OBA also organises a Remembrance Service on the Saturday closest to Remembrance Sunday, honouring all those old boys who have lost their lives in the armed conflicts of the Twentieth Century. Apart from these annual events, the OBA's activities include the Old Bordenian Hockey Club and Old Bordenian Football Club. The OBA also strives to support the present activities of the school, and in recent years has provided a minibus and contributed toward the costs of refurbishing the School's William Barrow Library, in addition to offering career mentoring to current pupils and recent leavers.\n\n== School badge, motto and song ==\nThe School's badge, which in heraldic terms is blazoned as \"azure, a chevron between three crescents or\",  is believed to have been derived from the coat of arms of William Barrow; however, no proof of this connection has been uncovered, despite extensive efforts in the 1930s. Some sources fancifully state that the three crescents represent successive generations of pupils at the School, but the badge was in use as early as 1885, when the School was still in its infancy. The gold border that surrounds the shield is believed to have been added when a navy blazer became part of the school uniform, so that the blue field of the shield would stand out.\n\nThe School has a Latin motto, ''nitere porro'', which translates as \"to strive forward\". Adopted during the headmastership of William Claydon, it was taken from a speech by [[Julius Caesar]] quoted in [[Horace|Horace's]] [[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]. \n\n'[[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]]' was also adopted as the school song under William Claydon. This replaced an earlier school song, which began with the words 'Borden, you merit all our praise, Our home through countless happy days.'\n\n== Houses ==\nIn common with many [[secondary school]]s in England, Borden has long had a [[house system]]. At the time of the First World War, the houses were 'Blue', 'Buff' and 'Red'. These were later replaced with 'Barrow', 'Borden' and 'School', to which 'Swale' was added in the 1930s. Aside from the references to the School's location and [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]], the [[etymology]] of 'Swale' can be explained by reference to the local stretch of water, [[The Swale]], which runs between [[Sittingbourne]] and the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and also lends its name to the local [[Borough]] Council. This house system was brought to an end by headmaster Stephen Wright in 2002. A house system was reinstated at the start of the school year beginning September 2007. The new house names are [[Lords cricket ground|Lord's]], [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|Wimbledon]], [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] and [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], named after the homes of [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]] in England; ironically, the School predates the namesakes of two of its houses, Wembley and Twickenham. With the loss of Barrow House, there is no longer any reference to the school's benefactor, William Barrow.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Information|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015|quote=Lords, Twickenham, Wembley and Wimbledon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907131553/http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|archive-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\nNo formal uniform existed for the first few decades of the School's existence. Prior to the First World War, some pupils wore a cap that carried a metal badge depicting the School shield; this badge later became embroidered. In the 1920s, pupils wore a tie with horizontal stripes in navy blue and gold, the School's colours. Members of the School's Cadet Corps wore khaki military uniform.\n\nBy the end of the Second World War, a uniform was in place that continues to be worn, with minor modifications, to the present day: navy blazer with the School shield on the breast pocket; grey trousers; white shirt; and tie with diagonal stripes in navy blue and gold. This tie was formerly worn by all pupils in Lower and Middle School; members of the Sixth Form wore a navy blue tie with small representations of the School shield arranged diagonally, while prefects wore a plain red tie. However, following the introduction of lounge suits for the Sixth Form in 2002, the former Sixth Form tie was adopted by Middle School and the former Lower and Middle School tie adopted by Lower School only.\n\n== Cadet Corps ==\nThe School's first cadet corps was formed in 1903, affiliated to 4th Volunteer Battalion, [[The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by one of the masters. The Cadet Corps was removed from the Army List in 1906, following the transfer of the headmaster, James Thurnham, and most of the School's staff and boarders, to New College, Herne Bay. It was then revived in 1917, this time affiliated to 4th [[The Buffs (East Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by the then headmaster, William Murdock. It appears to have been finally wound up by the time the School moved to the Avenue of Remembrance in 1928.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7y__ACbNigC&pg=PA122&dq=borden+school+cadet+corps#v=onepage&q=borden%20school%20cadet%20corps&f=false | title=Tracing the Rifle Volunteers: A Guide for Military and Family Historians| isbn=9781848842113| last1=Westlake| first1=Ray| date=January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Headmasters ==\n* 1878\u20131893: Rev.

Whilst the school mainly admits boys, a small number girls have been educated at the school within the Sixth Form. The School holds specialist status in Sports.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sittingbourne Adult Education College - geograph.org.uk - 364022.jpg|thumb|left|The old Borden Grammar School now Sittingbourne Adult Education College]]\n\nPlans for a boys' school in [[Borden, Kent|Borden]] began in 1875, as a new way of using some of the accumulated funds from the Barrow Trust, established from the estate of William Barrow (d. 1707), a local farmer, for the benefit of the poorer members of the village. The trustees of the Barrow Trust became the new school's governors, and they began organising a suitable sum of money to allow the project to go ahead. Within a few years, they had amassed \u00a39,500 and the building of the school began on a seven acre site in Riddles Road, which belonged to the trust. The Barrow Boy's School, Borden, was to be an independent day and boarding school, designed to have some fifty boarders and some 150 day pupils. The School formally opened in October 1878, with just twenty-three pupils (nine of them from the village of Borden) and one full-time member of staff (the headmaster, Rev. William Henry Bond). A full-time assistant master was recruited in 1880, followed by a second full-time assistant master in 1883.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Rev. Bond left to become headmaster of [[Churcher's College]], and was replaced by James Williamson Thurnham, who was keen to increase the number of boarders at the School, which by now was known as Barrow School, Borden. Boarders came from all parts of the country and, indeed, the world, with some hailing from France, Spain, India and Jamaica. Thurnham left to establish [[New College, Herne Bay]] in 1906, and took most of the 120 boarders and the majority of the School's staff with him, leaving the next headmaster, William Murdock, with the difficult task of building up numbers once more. Soon after Murdock's appointment, the School began to be referred to as Borden Barrow's Boys' School and was taken into the state education system in 1906. The School now became known as Borden School, a name that had appeared as part of the School badge since at least 1885, but, by 1910, there were six annual scholarships to \"Borden Grammar School\", the name by which the School has been known ever since. Up until the 1914, there had still been a few boarders at the School but, after the First World War, it became a day grammar school.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), pp. 3-4</ref>\n\nIn the early summer of 1929, the School moved to its present site on the Avenue of Remembrance, Sittingbourne, not only because of the rising maintenance costs of the original premises and the fact that it was no longer possible to attract suitable numbers of boys with the school being so far from the centre of Sittingbourne. The new building was formally opened by [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|George, Lord Harris]] in October 1929, but the School retained its original name despite no longer being located in Borden. The old school building was used for a time as an agricultural college, and is now an [[Adult Education]] Centre.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Short|first1=Bryan|title=Borden Grammar School \u2013 the early years part 1|url=http://old-bordenians.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/memory-lane/16-founding-a-school-in-the-1870s-part-i|website=The Old Bordenian Association|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1931, work began on the construction of a cricket pavilion as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who were killed in the [[World War I|First World War]], most of the money being provided by the Old Bordenian Association. The original pavilion was replaced by a modern structure in 2004, which continues to serve as a memorial to all those old boys who were killed in the First World War.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p.5</ref>\n\nIn May 1940, the Government announced that a number of towns on the Southeast Coast were to have their children [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]]: [[Sheerness]] was one such town, and some sixty-five pupils from Borden, accompanied by three masters, were evacuated to [[Pengam]], South Wales, where the boys were to attend the [[Lewis School, Pengam|Lewis School]]. Meanwhile, air raid shelters were built on the east side of the school site in Sittingbourne and, later, to the north of the cricket pavilion. In May 1949, a clock tower was unveiled by the [[Alfred Rose (bishop)|Bishop of Dover]] as a memorial to all those Old Bordenians who lost their lives in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the funds once again being provided by the Old Bordenian Association.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe word \"Grammar\" was removed from the School's name in 1972, in accordance with a change in the local education system, and there were fears that Borden might be turned into a Sixth Form college. These fears were, however, not realised, and Borden remained a selective school, admitting pupils at thirteen rather than after the 11+ Examination. In 1982, the word \"Grammar\" was restored to the School's name, and entry at eleven resumed in 1994.<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998), p. 7</ref>\n\nIn 1979, a new teaching block, the Hardy Block (named for the School's fifth headmaster, George Hardy), was opened. The first phase of another new teaching block, the Short Block (named for the School's sixth headmaster, Bryan Short), was opened in 1995 and completed in 1998; the finished building was formally opened by [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton|Robin, Lord Kingsdown]], the great-grandson of the School's first chair of governors, Sir [[Edward Leigh Pemberton]].<ref>K. Hughes, Borden Grammar School: A History in Photographs (Sittingbourne 1998)</ref> One of the science laboratories, the Hooker Advanced Physics Laboratory, was named for and opened by Sir [[Stanley Hooker]], an Old Bordenian and aeronautical engineer.\n\n== Modern School ==\nOn 1 September 2006 the School was awarded Specialist status for Sports and Modern Foreign Languages. With this status and an associated increase in funding, the school has built many new facilities including a multi use games area (MUGA) and the William Barrow Library. In 2011 the school also received a sports bursary, with which it used to construct a climbing wall in the gym.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/about-us|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nBorden became an [[academy]] in 2012, which changed the flexibility of the curriculum able to be taught at the school as well as increased funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=Borden Grammar School, Sittingbourne|url=https://www.kent-teach.com/School/Directory/Details.aspx?SchoolId=2213|website=Kent-Teach|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe School, along with other Sittingbourne-based Secondary schools, [[Fulston Manor School]] and [[Highsted Grammar School]] for Girls, maintain a close community and share teaching responsibilities of specialised subjects at A-Level, with Borden teaching [[Economics]], [[Sociology]] and [[Psychology]].\n\n== Old Bordenian Association ==\nThe Old Bordenian Association (OBA) was established in 1912, re-established in 1925, and membership is open to all former pupils and staff of Borden Grammar School. The OBA's annual journal, ''The Maroon'', was first published in 1937, but was replaced by a website in 2009. The OBA holds an annual reunion dinner, formerly held inside the Old Hall but now in the nearby premises of UK Paper Leisure Club. The OBA also organises a Remembrance Service on the Saturday closest to Remembrance Sunday, honouring all those old boys who have lost their lives in the armed conflicts of the Twentieth Century. Apart from these annual events, the OBA's activities include the Old Bordenian Hockey Club and Old Bordenian Football Club. The OBA also strives to support the present activities of the school, and in recent years has provided a minibus and contributed toward the costs of refurbishing the School's William Barrow Library, in addition to offering career mentoring to current pupils and recent leavers.\n\n== School badge, motto and song ==\nThe School's badge, which in heraldic terms is blazoned as \"azure, a chevron between three crescents or\",  is believed to have been derived from the coat of arms of William Barrow; however, no proof of this connection has been uncovered, despite extensive efforts in the 1930s. Some sources fancifully state that the three crescents represent successive generations of pupils at the School, but the badge was in use as early as 1885, when the School was still in its infancy. The gold border that surrounds the shield is believed to have been added when a navy blazer became part of the school uniform, so that the blue field of the shield would stand out.\n\nThe School has a Latin motto, ''nitere porro'', which translates as \"to strive forward\". Adopted during the headmastership of William Claydon, it was taken from a speech by [[Julius Caesar]] quoted in [[Horace|Horace's]] [[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]. \n\n'[[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]]' was also adopted as the school song under William Claydon. This replaced an earlier school song, which began with the words 'Borden, you merit all our praise, Our home through countless happy days.'\n\n== Houses ==\nIn common with many [[secondary school]]s in England, Borden has long had a [[house system]]. At the time of the First World War, the houses were 'Blue', 'Buff' and 'Red'. These were later replaced with 'Barrow', 'Borden' and 'School', to which 'Swale' was added in the 1930s. Aside from the references to the School's location and [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]], the [[etymology]] of 'Swale' can be explained by reference to the local stretch of water, [[The Swale]], which runs between [[Sittingbourne]] and the [[Isle of Sheppey]] and also lends its name to the local [[Borough]] Council. This house system was brought to an end by headmaster Stephen Wright in 2002. A house system was reinstated at the start of the school year beginning September 2007. The new house names are [[Lords cricket ground|Lord's]], [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club|Wimbledon]], [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] and [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]], named after the homes of [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]] in England; ironically, the School predates the namesakes of two of its houses, Wembley and Twickenham. With the loss of Barrow House, there is no longer any reference to the school's benefactor, William Barrow.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Information|url=http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|website=Borden Grammar School|accessdate=26 August 2015|quote=Lords, Twickenham, Wembley and Wimbledon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907131553/http://www.bordengrammar.kent.sch.uk/index.php/pages/house-information|archive-date=7 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\nNo formal uniform existed for the first few decades of the School's existence. Prior to the First World War, some pupils wore a cap that carried a metal badge depicting the School shield; this badge later became embroidered. In the 1920s, pupils wore a tie with horizontal stripes in navy blue and gold, the School's colours. Members of the School's Cadet Corps wore khaki military uniform.\n\nBy the end of the Second World War, a uniform was in place that continues to be worn, with minor modifications, to the present day: navy blazer with the School shield on the breast pocket; grey trousers; white shirt; and tie with diagonal stripes in navy blue and gold. This tie was formerly worn by all pupils in Lower and Middle School; members of the Sixth Form wore a navy blue tie with small representations of the School shield arranged diagonally, while prefects wore a plain red tie. However, following the introduction of lounge suits for the Sixth Form in 2002, the former Sixth Form tie was adopted by Middle School and the former Lower and Middle School tie adopted by Lower School only.\n\n== Cadet Corps ==\nThe School's first cadet corps was formed in 1903, affiliated to 4th Volunteer Battalion, [[The Queen's Own (Royal West Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by one of the masters. The Cadet Corps was removed from the Army List in 1906, following the transfer of the headmaster, James Thurnham, and most of the School's staff and boarders, to New College, Herne Bay. It was then revived in 1917, this time affiliated to 4th [[The Buffs (East Kent Regiment)]] and commanded by the then headmaster, William Murdock. It appears to have been finally wound up by the time the School moved to the Avenue of Remembrance in 1928.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7y__ACbNigC&pg=PA122&dq=borden+school+cadet+corps#v=onepage&q=borden%20school%20cadet%20corps&f=false | title=Tracing the Rifle Volunteers: A Guide for Military and Family Historians| isbn=9781848842113| last1=Westlake| first1=Ray| date=January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Headmasters ==\n* 1878\u20131893: Rev.
