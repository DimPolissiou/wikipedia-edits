His father was Mirza Habibullah al-Shirazi, and his mother was Radhiya Golshan-Shirazi (daughter of Muhib Ali Golshan-Shirazi). Mirza Mahdi is the fourth of eight children. His eldest brother, Muhammd-Sadiq, died young. The remaining two of his brothers were also clerics; his older brother, Abdullah al-Shirazi (grandfather of [[Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani's]] wife; also known as al-Tawasuli), and younger brother, Jafar al-Shirazi. His elder sister, Um Moosa, was married to his cousin, senior cleric, Abd al-Hadi al-Shirazi.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMirza Mahdi began his religious education at a very early age, carrying out his introductory studies in Karbala, under his brother, Abdullah al-Tawasuli, Sayyid Husayn Khayr al-Din and Sayyid Muhammad-Hassan Agha Mir al-Qazwini.<ref name=\":5\" /> After his father, Mirza Habibullah passed away in 1902, he moved to [[Najaf]], to study under the two greats, [[Akhund Khorasani|Akhund Khurasani]] and [[Mohammed Kazem Yazdi|Muhammad-Kadhim Yazdi]].

They remained in Kadhimiya for approximately a year and a half, living a life of dire poverty, until they returned to Karbala, where Mirza Taqi, was preparing to lead the [[Iraqi revolt of 1920|independence movement]] against the British. He remained in Karbala, and played an active supporting role with his uncle in the Iraqi revolt, until his uncle was poisoned in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alshirazi.net/karbala/olama/09.htm|title=al-Thikra al-Tasi'a Wal Arbaoon Liraheel al-Marja al-Muqadas Ayatollah al-Udhma al-Sayyid Mirza Mahdi al-Husayni al-Shirazi Qudisa Siruh|last=|first=|date=|website=Official Website of Ayatollah Shirazi|trans-title=The 49th anniversary of the demise of the divine jurist Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mirza Mahdi al-Husayni al-Shirazi|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Lukitz|first=Liora|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hk-RAgAAQBAJ|title=Iraq: The Search for National Identity|date=2005-07-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-135-77820-0|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\nAfter the death of his uncle, he moved back to Najaf, to resume his religious education, and studied under his first cousin once removed, Mirza Ali Agha al-Shirazi, as well as [[Muhammad Hossein Naini|al-Muhaqiq al-Naini]] and [[Agha Zia ol Din Araghi|al-Muhaqiq al-Iraqi]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Mirzamehdi.jpg|thumb|200px|Mirza Mahdi (centre left) with his teacher Hossein Qomi (centre right)|alt=|left]]\n\n=== Return to Karbala ===\nIn 1935, senior cleric Hossein Tabatabaei Qomi was exiled from Iran, by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Muhammed Reza Shah]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shakibi|first=Zhand|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4k6_DwAAQBAJ|title=Pahlavi Iran and the Politics of Occidentalism: The Shah and the Rastakhiz Party|date=2019-12-12|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=|isbn=978-1-78673-630-7|location=|pages=123|language=en}}</ref> So Qomi emigrated to Karbala, and sent a request for Mirza Mahdi to return to Karbala, so that he may join him in his quest to revive its seminary, to which Mirza Mahdi accepted and returned to his birthplace.

Within six months, Iraq was turned into a blood bath of pro-communist protests, attacking the homes of religious clerics and nationalists. It was so bad, it is reported that a Muslim would feel estranged in a city like Najaf.\n\nOne time, a protest was formed in Karbala, with some of the leaders of the city's communist movement. They had a list of fifty two names (this included Mirza Mahdi's son [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Muhammad]]), of the people they planned to attack their homes and kill, for the reason that they 'stood against communism and the \"red tide\"'.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=al-Muhtadi|first=Abd al-Atheem|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9PjWAAAAMAAJ|title=Qusas Wa Khawatir - Min Akhlaqiyat 'Ulama' al-Din|publisher=Mu'asasat al-Balagh|year=2009|isbn=|location=Beirut, Lebanon|pages=552\u201353|trans-title=Stories and Memories - From the Manners of the Scholars}}</ref>\n\nThis is when the senior jurists of the time decided to take a stand to counter this wave of terror.

His father was Mirza Habibullah al-Shirazi, and his mother was Radhiya Golshan-Shirazi (daughter of Muhib Ali Golshan-Shirazi). Mirza Mahdi is the fourth of eight children. His eldest brother, Muhammd-Sadiq, died young. The remaining two of his brothers were also clerics; his older brother, Abdullah al-Shirazi (grandfather of [[Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani's]] wife; also known as al-Tawasuli), and younger brother, Jafar al-Shirazi. His elder sister, Um Moosa, was married to his cousin, senior cleric, Abd al-Hadi al-Shirazi.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMirza Mahdi began his religious education at a very early age, carrying out his introductory studies in Karbala, under his brother, Abdullah al-Tawasuli, Sayyid Husayn Khayr al-Din and Sayyid Muhammad-Hassan Agha Mir al-Qazwini.<ref name=\":5\" /> After his father, Mirza Habibullah passed away in 1902, he moved to [[Najaf]], to study under the two greats, [[Akhund Khorasani|Akhund Khurasani]] and [[Mohammed Kazem Yazdi|Muhammad-Kadhim Yazdi]]. He then travelled to [[Samarra]] with his family, to study in its seminary - under his maternal uncle, [[Mirza Taqi al-Shirazi|Mirza Muhammad-Taqi al-Shirazi]] and Hasan al-Sadr - which the former was managing at the time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Kut|siege of Kut]], Mirza Mahdi travelled to [[Kadhimiya]], with his uncle Mirza Taqi, who feared that Samarra could end up like Kut, and that way many from the religious sphere would die. They remained in Kadhimiya for approximately a year and a half, living a life of dire poverty, until they returned to Karbala, where Mirza Taqi, was preparing to lead the [[Iraqi revolt of 1920|independence movement]] against the British. He remained in Karbala, and played an active supporting role with his uncle in the Iraqi revolt, until his uncle was poisoned in 1920.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alshirazi.net/karbala/olama/09.htm|title=al-Thikra al-Tasi'a Wal Arbaoon Liraheel al-Marja al-Muqadas Ayatollah al-Udhma al-Sayyid Mirza Mahdi al-Husayni al-Shirazi Qudisa Siruh|last=|first=|date=|website=Official Website of Ayatollah Shirazi|trans-title=The 49th anniversary of the demise of the divine jurist Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mirza Mahdi al-Husayni al-Shirazi|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Lukitz|first=Liora|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hk-RAgAAQBAJ|title=Iraq: The Search for National Identity|date=2005-07-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-135-77820-0|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\nAfter the death of his uncle, he moved back to Najaf, to resume his religious education, and studied under his first cousin once removed, Mirza Ali Agha al-Shirazi, as well as [[Muhammad Hossein Naini|al-Muhaqiq al-Naini]] and [[Agha Zia ol Din Araghi|al-Muhaqiq al-Iraqi]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />[[File:Mirzamehdi.jpg|thumb|200px|Mirza Mahdi (centre left) with his teacher Hossein Qomi (centre right)|alt=|left]]\n\n=== Return to Karbala ===\nIn 1935, senior cleric Hossein Tabatabaei Qomi was exiled from Iran, by [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Muhammed Reza Shah]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shakibi|first=Zhand|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4k6_DwAAQBAJ|title=Pahlavi Iran and the Politics of Occidentalism: The Shah and the Rastakhiz Party|date=2019-12-12|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=|isbn=978-1-78673-630-7|location=|pages=123|language=en}}</ref> So Qomi emigrated to Karbala, and sent a request for Mirza Mahdi to return to Karbala, so that he may join him in his quest to revive its seminary, to which Mirza Mahdi accepted and returned to his birthplace.

He also claimed that it violated the liberty of man and the [[sharia]], and would create mental barriers within the minds of people. He also explained, that the citizenship was a devotion of dominance by the [[Abd al-Karim Qasim|ruling Sunni]] government over the Shia.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Stand against communism ===\nAfter the [[14 July Revolution|14 July coup]], Abd al-Karim Qasim allowed [[communism]] to flourish in his new republic. Within six months, Iraq was turned into a blood bath of pro-communist protests, attacking the homes of religious clerics and nationalists. It was so bad, it is reported that a Muslim would feel estranged in a city like Najaf.\n\nOne time, a protest was formed in Karbala, with some of the leaders of the city's communist movement. They had a list of fifty two names (this included Mirza Mahdi's son [[Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi|Muhammad]]), of the people they planned to attack their homes and kill, for the reason that they 'stood against communism and the \"red tide\"'.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=al-Muhtadi|first=Abd al-Atheem|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9PjWAAAAMAAJ|title=Qusas Wa Khawatir - Min Akhlaqiyat 'Ulama' al-Din|publisher=Mu'asasat al-Balagh|year=2009|isbn=|location=Beirut, Lebanon|pages=552\u201353|trans-title=Stories and Memories - From the Manners of the Scholars}}</ref>\n\nThis is when the senior jurists of the time decided to take a stand to counter this wave of terror.

The result was that they were going to issue religious [[fatwa]]s branding the [[Iraqi Communist Party|Communist party]] as [[Kafir|infidels]].

The oil is produced by pressing whole olives. It is commonly used in cooking, for frying foods or as a [[salad dressing]]. It is also used in [[cosmetics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], and [[soap]]s, and as a [[fuel]] for traditional [[oil lamp]]s, and has additional uses in some religions. There is limited evidence of its possible health benefits. The olive is one of three core food plants in [[Mediterranean cuisine]]; the other two are [[wheat]] and [[grapes]]. Olive trees have been grown around the Mediterranean since the 8th millennium BC.\n\nToday, [[Spain]] is the largest producer of olive oil by volume, followed by [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. However, per capita national consumption is highest in Greece, followed by Spain, Italy, and [[Tunisia]]. Consumption in South Asia, North America and northern Europe is far less, but rising steadily.\n\nThe composition of olive oil varies with the [[cultivar]], altitude, time of harvest and extraction process. It consists mainly of [[oleic acid]] (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other [[fatty acid]]s including [[linoleic acid]] (up to 21%) and [[palmitic acid]] (up to 20%). Extra virgin olive oil is required to have no more than 0.8% [[olive oil acidity|free acidity]] and is considered to have favorable flavor characteristics.<!--see Prosodol ref below-->\n\n== History ==\n\nOlive oil has long been a common ingredients in [[Mediterranean cuisine]], including [[ancient Greek cuisine|ancient Greek]] and [[cuisine of ancient Rome|Roman cuisine]]. Wild olives, which originated in [[Asia Minor]], were collected by [[Neolithic]] people as early as the 8th millennium BC.<ref name=\"Davidson, s.v. Olives\">Davidson, ''s.v.''

The flavor of these oils varies considerably and a particular oil may be more suited for a particular dish.\n\nFresh oil, as available in an oil-producing region, tastes noticeably different from the older oils available elsewhere. In time, oils deteriorate and become stale. One-year-old oil may be still pleasant to the taste, but it is less fragrant than fresh oil. After the first year, olive oil is more suitable for cooking than serving raw.\n\nThe taste of the olive oil is influenced by the varietals used to produce the oil and by the moment when the olives are harvested and ground (less ripe olives give more bitter and spicy flavors \u2013 riper olives give a sweeter sensation in the oil).\n\n=== Religious use ===\n\n==== Christianity ====\nThe Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches use olive oil for the [[Oil of Catechumens]] (used to bless and strengthen those preparing for Baptism) and Oil of the Sick (used to confer the Sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick]] or [[Unction]]). Olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such as [[Balsam of Mecca|balsam]] is [[consecrated]] by [[bishop]]s as Sacred [[Chrism]], which is used to confer the sacrament of [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]] (as a symbol of the strengthening of the Holy Spirit), in the rites of [[Baptism]] and the [[Holy Orders|ordination]] of [[priest]]s and bishops, in the consecration of [[altar]]s and [[church (building)|churches]], and, traditionally, in the anointing of monarchs at their [[coronation]].\n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] still use oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners and in the cemeteries. A vigil lamp consists of a votive glass containing a half-inch of water and filled the rest with olive oil. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil. To douse the flame, the float is carefully pressed down into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak. The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed, whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries.\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] uses virgin olive oil that has been blessed by the priesthood. This consecrated oil is used for anointing the sick.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2010/04/healing-the-sick?lang=eng|title=Healing the Sick |first=Dallin H.|last=Oaks|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Iglesia ni Cristo]] uses olive oil to anoint sick (in [[Filipino language|Filipino]]: \"''Pagpapahid ng Langis''\"), it is blessed by minister or deacon by prayer before anointing to the sick. After anointing, the Elder prays for Thanksgiving.\n\n==== Judaism ====\nIn [[Jewish]] observance, olive oil was the only fuel allowed to be used in the seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] in the [[Mishkan]] service during [[the Exodus]] of the tribes of [[Israel]] from [[Egypt]], and later in the permanent [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. It was obtained by using only the first drop from a squeezed olive and was consecrated for use only in the Temple by the priests and stored in special containers. Although candles can be used to light the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] at [[Hanukkah]], oil containers are preferred, to imitate the original menorah. Another use of oil in Jewish religion was for anointing the kings of the Kingdom of Israel, originating from King David. [[Tzidkiyahu]] was the last anointed King of Israel.\n\n=== Skin care ===\nOlive oil has a long history of being used as a home skincare remedy.

Green olives usually produce more bitter oil, and overripe olives can produce oil that is rancid, so for good extra virgin olive oil care is taken to make sure the olives are perfectly ripened. The process is generally as follows:\n\n# The olives are ground into paste using large millstones (traditional method) or steel drums (modern method).\n# If ground with mill stones, the olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process may result in a more raw paste that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste, a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste and reduce the flavor. After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other in a column, then placed into the press. Pressure is then applied onto the column to separate the vegetal liquid from the paste. This liquid still contains a significant amount of water. Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity (oil is less dense than water). This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorough. The centrifuges have one exit for the (heavier) watery part and one for the oil. Olive oil should not contain significant traces of vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in smaller oil mills is not always perfect, thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles.\n# In modern steel drum mills the grinding process takes about 20 minutes. After grinding, the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 minutes in a particular container (malaxation), where the microscopic oil drops aggregate into bigger drops, which facilitates the mechanical extraction. The paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from the oil in a second centrifugation as described before.<br />The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as described above is called virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and [[organoleptic]] criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years, so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather.\n# Sometimes the produced oil will be filtered to eliminate remaining solid particles that may reduce the shelf life of the product. Labels may indicate the fact that the oil has ''not'' been filtered, suggesting a different taste. Fresh [[unfiltered olive oil]] usually has a slightly cloudy appearance, and is therefore sometimes called ''cloudy olive oil''. This form of olive oil used to be popular only among olive oil small scale producers but is now becoming \"trendy\", in line with consumer's demand for products that are perceived to be less processed. But generally, if not tasted or consumed soon after production, filtered olive oil should be preferred: \"Some producers maintain that extra-virgin olive oils do not need filtration but also that filtration is detrimental to oil quality. This point of view should be considered as erroneous and probably the result of improper implementation of this operation. In fact, fine particles that are suspended in a virgin olive oil, even after the most effective centrifugal finishing, contain water and enzymes that may impair oil stability and ruin its sensory profile. [...] Filtration makes an extra-virgin olive oil more stable and also more attractive. If the suspended particles are not removed they slowly agglomerate and flocculate, forming a deposit on the bottom of the storage containers. Such a deposit continues to be at risk of enzymatic spoilage and, in the worst case, of development of anaerobic micro-organisms with further spoilage and hygienic risk. [...] It is [...] recommended that filtration be carried out as soon as possible after centrifugal separation and finishing.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The extra-virgin olive oil handbook|last=|first=|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=2014|isbn=9781118460450|editor-last=Peri|editor-first=Claudio|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=155\u2013156|oclc=908158600}}</ref>\n\n===Pomace handling===\n\nThe remaining semi-solid waste, called [[pomace]], retains a small quantity (about 5\u201310%) of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing, but only with chemical solvents.

The oil is produced by pressing whole olives. It is commonly used in cooking, for frying foods or as a [[salad dressing]]. It is also used in [[cosmetics]], [[pharmaceuticals]], and [[soap]]s, and as a [[fuel]] for traditional [[oil lamp]]s, and has additional uses in some religions. There is limited evidence of its possible health benefits. The olive is one of three core food plants in [[Mediterranean cuisine]]; the other two are [[wheat]] and [[grapes]]. Olive trees have been grown around the Mediterranean since the 8th millennium BC.\n\nToday, [[Spain]] is the largest producer of olive oil by volume, followed by [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. However, per capita national consumption is highest in Greece, followed by Spain, Italy, and [[Tunisia]]. Consumption in South Asia, North America and northern Europe is far less, but rising steadily.\n\nThe composition of olive oil varies with the [[cultivar]], altitude, time of harvest and extraction process. It consists mainly of [[oleic acid]] (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other [[fatty acid]]s including [[linoleic acid]] (up to 21%) and [[palmitic acid]] (up to 20%). Extra virgin olive oil is required to have no more than 0.8% [[olive oil acidity|free acidity]] and is considered to have favorable flavor characteristics.<!--see Prosodol ref below-->\n\n== History ==\n\nOlive oil has long been a common ingredients in [[Mediterranean cuisine]], including [[ancient Greek cuisine|ancient Greek]] and [[cuisine of ancient Rome|Roman cuisine]]. Wild olives, which originated in [[Asia Minor]], were collected by [[Neolithic]] people as early as the 8th millennium BC.<ref name=\"Davidson, s.v. Olives\">Davidson, ''s.v.''

The flavor of these oils varies considerably and a particular oil may be more suited for a particular dish.\n\nFresh oil, as available in an oil-producing region, tastes noticeably different from the older oils available elsewhere. In time, oils deteriorate and become stale. One-year-old oil may be still pleasant to the taste, but it is less fragrant than fresh oil. After the first year, olive oil is more suitable for cooking than serving raw.\n\nThe taste of the olive oil is influenced by the varietals used to produce the oil and by the moment when the olives are harvested and ground (less ripe olives give more bitter and spicy flavors \u2013 riper olives give a sweeter sensation in the oil).\n\n=== Religious use ===\n\n==== Christianity ====\nThe Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches use olive oil for the [[Oil of Catechumens]] (used to bless and strengthen those preparing for Baptism) and Oil of the Sick (used to confer the Sacrament of [[Anointing of the Sick]] or [[Unction]]). Olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such as [[Balsam of Mecca|balsam]] is [[consecrated]] by [[bishop]]s as Sacred [[Chrism]], which is used to confer the sacrament of [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]] (as a symbol of the strengthening of the Holy Spirit), in the rites of [[Baptism]] and the [[Holy Orders|ordination]] of [[priest]]s and bishops, in the consecration of [[altar]]s and [[church (building)|churches]], and, traditionally, in the anointing of monarchs at their [[coronation]].\n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] still use oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners and in the cemeteries. A vigil lamp consists of a votive glass containing a half-inch of water and filled the rest with olive oil. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a bracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit wick floats on the oil. To douse the flame, the float is carefully pressed down into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton in olive oil and forming it into a peak. The peak is lit and then burns until all the oil is consumed, whereupon the rest of the cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries.\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] uses virgin olive oil that has been blessed by the priesthood. This consecrated oil is used for anointing the sick.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2010/04/healing-the-sick?lang=eng|title=Healing the Sick |first=Dallin H.|last=Oaks|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Iglesia ni Cristo]] uses olive oil to anoint sick (in [[Filipino]]: \"''Pagpapahid ng Langis''\"), it is blessed by minister or deacon by prayer before anointing to the sick. After anointing, the Elder prays for Thanksgiving.\n\n==== Judaism ====\nIn [[Jewish]] observance, olive oil was the only fuel allowed to be used in the seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] in the [[Mishkan]] service during [[the Exodus]] of the tribes of [[Israel]] from [[Egypt]], and later in the permanent [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. It was obtained by using only the first drop from a squeezed olive and was consecrated for use only in the Temple by the priests and stored in special containers. Although candles can be used to light the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] at [[Hanukkah]], oil containers are preferred, to imitate the original menorah. Another use of oil in Jewish religion was for anointing the kings of the Kingdom of Israel, originating from King David. [[Tzidkiyahu]] was the last anointed King of Israel.\n\n=== Skin care ===\nOlive oil has a long history of being used as a home skincare remedy.

It yearly honors poetry, fiction and non-fiction about extra virgin olive oil.\n\n== Extraction ==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Cold press olive oil machine at Saba Habib in Israel 2.jpg|thumb|A cold press olive oil machine in [[Israel]].]]\n[[File:Frantoio Maraldi 2.JPG|thumb|Olive oil mill]]\n{{Main article|Olive oil extraction}}\n\nOlive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or chemical means. Green olives usually produce more bitter oil, and overripe olives can produce oil that is rancid, so for good extra virgin olive oil care is taken to make sure the olives are perfectly ripened. The process is generally as follows:\n\n# The olives are ground into paste using large millstones (traditional method) or steel drums (modern method).\n# If ground with mill stones, the olive paste generally stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process may result in a more raw paste that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste, a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste and reduce the flavor. After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other in a column, then placed into the press. Pressure is then applied onto the column to separate the vegetal liquid from the paste. This liquid still contains a significant amount of water. Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity (oil is less dense than water). This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorough. The centrifuges have one exit for the (heavier) watery part and one for the oil. Olive oil should not contain significant traces of vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in smaller oil mills is not always perfect, thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles.\n# In modern steel drum mills the grinding process takes about 20 minutes. After grinding, the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 minutes in a particular container (malaxation), where the microscopic oil drops aggregate into bigger drops, which facilitates the mechanical extraction. The paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from the oil in a second centrifugation as described before.<br />The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as described above is called virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and [[organoleptic]] criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher grade extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years, so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather.\n# Sometimes the produced oil will be filtered to eliminate remaining solid particles that may reduce the shelf life of the product. Labels may indicate the fact that the oil has ''not'' been filtered, suggesting a different taste. Fresh [[unfiltered olive oil]] usually has a slightly cloudy appearance, and is therefore sometimes called ''cloudy olive oil''. This form of olive oil used to be popular only among olive oil small scale producers but is now becoming \"trendy\", in line with consumer's demand for products that are perceived to be less processed. But generally, if not tasted or consumed soon after production, filtered olive oil should be preferred: \"Some producers maintain that extra-virgin olive oils do not need filtration but also that filtration is detrimental to oil quality. This point of view should be considered as erroneous and probably the result of improper implementation of this operation. In fact, fine particles that are suspended in a virgin olive oil, even after the most effective centrifugal finishing, contain water and enzymes that may impair oil stability and ruin its sensory profile. [...] Filtration makes an extra-virgin olive oil more stable and also more attractive. If the suspended particles are not removed they slowly agglomerate and flocculate, forming a deposit on the bottom of the storage containers. Such a deposit continues to be at risk of enzymatic spoilage and, in the worst case, of development of anaerobic micro-organisms with further spoilage and hygienic risk. [...] It is [...] recommended that filtration be carried out as soon as possible after centrifugal separation and finishing.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The extra-virgin olive oil handbook|last=|first=|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|year=2014|isbn=9781118460450|editor-last=Peri|editor-first=Claudio|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=155\u2013156|oclc=908158600}}</ref>\n\n===Pomace handling===\n\nThe remaining semi-solid waste, called [[pomace]], retains a small quantity (about 5\u201310%) of oil that cannot be extracted by further pressing, but only with chemical solvents.
