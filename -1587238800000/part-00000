He finished alone in third place, three strokes behind the champion [[Jason Dufner]]. Stenson moved up one place in the world rankings to move back inside the world's top ten.\n\nStenson's good form continued into the [[2013 FedEx Cup Playoffs]], when he won the [[Deutsche Bank Championship]] by two strokes over runner-up, [[Steve Stricker]]. It was the Swede's first PGA Tour victory in over three years. He tied the tournament record of \u221222 en route to his third career PGA Tour win.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/daily-wrapup/2013/09/02/deutschebank4.html |title=Daily Wrap-up: Deutsche Bank Championship, Round 4 |publisher=PGA Tour |date=2 September 2013 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> The win vaulted him into first place in the [[FedEx Cup]] standings just ahead of [[Tiger Woods]].\n\nOn 22 September 2013, Stenson won [[The Tour Championship]] at [[East Lake Golf Club]] and the [[FedEx Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/9707991/fedex-cup-playoffs-payoff-henrik-stenson-tour-championship-golf |first=Bob |last=Harig |title=Playoffs a payoff for Henrik Stenson |work=[[ESPN]] |date=22 September 2013 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}</ref> He also tied his career best OWGR ranking of 4th.\n\nHe then moved up to a career best 3rd in the OWGR ranking on 3 November 2013.<ref name=OWGR-w44-2013>{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/archive/2013/owgr44f2013.pdf |title=Official World Golf Ranking for Week 44 |date=3 November 2013 |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> He finished the 2013 season ranked first on the PGA Tour in greens in regulation, first in ball striking, second among money leaders, third in total driving, fourth in scoring average, and seventh in driving accuracy percentage.<ref name=pga/>\n\nOn 17 November 2013, he won the [[DP World Tour Championship, Dubai]] with a record-breaking performance (an aggregate 263 score at 25-under par), thereby also winning the [[Race to Dubai]] which he was already leading.

After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate [[Primary election|primary]] nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party's political boss in Wisconsin.

In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). Where McCarthy got the money to invest in the first place remains a mystery.

In that letter, Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in \"recommendation against permanent employment\" for 284 persons, and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs; this left 205 still on the State Department's payroll.

Throughout the hearings, McCarthy employed colorful rhetoric, but produced no substantial evidence, to support his accusations.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nFrom its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy's charges a \"fraud and a hoax\", and said that the result of McCarthy's actions was to \"confuse and divide the American people ... to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves\".

Barely a month after McCarthy's Wheeling speech, the term \"McCarthyism\" was coined by ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' cartoonist [[Herblock|Herbert Block]]. Block and others used the word as a synonym for [[demagogy|demagoguery]], baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters. \"McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled,\" McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year, he published a book titled ''McCarthyism: The Fight For America.''\n\nMcCarthy sought to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers. In the 1950 Maryland Senate election, McCarthy campaigned for [[John Marshall Butler]] in his race against four-term incumbent Millard Tydings, with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings. In speeches supporting Butler, McCarthy accused Tydings of \"protecting Communists\" and \"shielding traitors.\" McCarthy's staff was heavily involved in the campaign, and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader [[Earl Russell Browder]].<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Oshinsky\n  |first = David M.\n  |title = A Conspiracy So Immense: The World of Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Oxford University Press\n  |year=  2005\n  |page = 175\n  |isbn = 0-19-515424-X\n  |origyear= 1983}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title = The Official United States Congressional Daily Digest Records\n  |publisher = Government Publishing Office, Thomas Library, Official Repository Library, Local, Bakersfield California, CSUB\n  |year=  2009\n  |pages = 8', 79th Congress, 3rd Session, Date August 2, 1946, Congressional Records&nbsp;\u2013 House, p. 10749\n  |isbn =\n  |origyear= 1946}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title = The United States Constitution\n  |publisher = Government Publishing Office, Thomas Library, Official Repository Library, Local, Bakersfield California, CSUB\n  |year=  2009\n  |page = 10\n  |isbn =\n  |origyear= 1782}}\n</ref>\nA Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as \"a despicable, back-street type of campaign,\" as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Cook\n  |first = Fred J.\n  |title = The Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Random House\n  |year=  1971\n  |pages = 150\u2013151\n  |isbn = 0-394-46270-X}}</ref> The pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite.

Lucas]]. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner.

Marshall had been [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] during World War II and was also Truman's former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Marshall was a highly respected general and statesman, remembered today as the architect of victory and peace, the latter based on the [[Marshall Plan]] for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled ''America's Retreat From Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall''. Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the [[loss of China]] to Communism.

Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly.

In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing \"1,456 Truman holdovers who were&nbsp;... gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion.\" He then went on to complain that [[John Paton Davies Jr.]] was still \"on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower Administration,\" even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to \"put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].\" In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War.<ref>All quotes in this paragraph: {{cite book|last = Fried\n |first = Albert\n |year = 1997\n |title = McCarthyism, The Great American Red Scare: A Documentary History\n |publisher = Oxford University Press\n |pages = [https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/182 182\u2013184]\n |isbn = 0-19-509701-7\n |url = https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/182\n }}</ref> By the end of 1953, McCarthy had altered the \"twenty years of treason\" catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to \"twenty-''one'' years of treason\" to include Eisenhower's first year in office.<ref>{{cite book|last = Fried\n  |first = Albert\n  |title = McCarthyism, The Great American Red Scare: A Documentary History\n  |publisher = Oxford University Press\n  |year = 1996\n  |page = [https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/179 179]\n  |isbn = 0-19-509701-7\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/179\n  }}</ref>\n\nAs McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly.

According to some reports, Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy's methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Internal Security Subcommittee]]\u2014the committee normally involved with investigating Communists\u2014thus putting McCarthy \"where he can't do any harm,\" in the words of Senate Majority Leader [[Robert A. Taft]].<ref>{{cite book\n |last = Fried\n |first = Richard M.\n |year = 1990\n |title = Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective\n |publisher = Oxford University Press\n |page = 134\n |isbn = 0-19-504361-8\n}}</ref> However, the Committee on Government Operations included the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]], and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed [[Roy Cohn]] as chief counsel and 27-year-old [[Robert F. Kennedy]] as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee. Cohn brought with him, as his assistant, [[G. David Schine|Gerard David Schine]], heir to a hotel-chain fortune, who would bear much responsibility for triggering McCarthy's eventual downfall.\n\nThis subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy's most publicized exploits. When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy's chairmanship were made public in 2003\u201304,<ref>See \"Transcripts, Executive Sessions ...\" under Primary sources, below.</ref> Senators [[Susan Collins]] and [[Carl Levin]] wrote the following in their preface to the documents:\n\n<blockquote>Senator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.&nbsp;...

Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations.<ref name=\"VOA\">{{cite book\n |last = Heil\n |first = Alan L.\n |year = 2003\n |title = Voice of America: A History\n |publisher = Columbia University Press\n |page = 53\n |isbn = 0-231-12674-3\n}}</ref> A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy's investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA's \"darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it.\"<ref name=\"VOA\" />\n\nThe subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves \"material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc.\" Some libraries went as far as [[Book burning|burning]] the newly forbidden books.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

B. Matthews]] as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled \"Reds and Our Churches\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=%22Reds%20and%20Our%20Churches%22%20Matthews&btnG=Search%20Books|title=\"Reds and Our Churches\" Matthews \u2013 Google Search|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=%22Reds%20in%20Our%20Churches%22%20Matthews&btnG=Search%20Books|title=\"Reds in Our Churches\" Matthews |via=Google Search|publisher=}}</ref> which opened with the sentence, \"The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen.\" A group of senators denounced this \"shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy\" and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. But as the controversy mounted, and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews's ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] laboratory at [[Fort Monmouth]]. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations.<ref>{{cite book|last = Stone|title = Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism|isbn = 0-393-05880-8|url = https://archive.org/details/periloustimesfre00ston|publisher = W.W. Norton & Co.|year = 2004}}</ref> Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of [[Irving Peress]], a New York dentist who had been drafted into the army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing [[American Labor Party]], had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress' superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. McCarthy responded by sending a message to [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[Robert T. Stevens]], demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the army to be effected immediately, and the next day [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Ralph Wise Zwicker|Ralph W. Zwicker]], his commanding officer at [[Camp Kilmer]] in [[New Jersey]], gave him an honorable separation from the army. At McCarthy's encouragement, \"Who promoted Peress?\" became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.<ref>{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Bart |date=November 18, 2014 |title=Irving Peress, dentist who was subject of Sen.

After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in \"unduly persistent or aggressive efforts\". The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams \"made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth\", and that Adams \"made vigorous and diligent efforts\" to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board \"by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee\".<ref>Karl E.

It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men\u2014not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.\n\nThis is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.\n\nThe actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it\u2014and rather successfully.

[[Constitution of Wisconsin|Wisconsin's constitution]] stipulates the number of signatures needed to force a recall election must exceed one-quarter the number of voters in the most recent gubernatorial election, requiring the anti-McCarthy movement to gather some 404,000 signatures in sixty days. With little support from [[organized labor]] or the [[Democratic Party (Wisconsin)|state Democratic Party]], the roughly organized recall effort attracted national attention, particularly during the concurrent Army-McCarthy hearings.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nFollowing the deadline of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent out of state to avoid a subpoena from the [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk County]] district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of the recall campaign on the grounds that they had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act.

Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate's rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next introduced a resolution to [[censure in the United States|censure]] McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy's part. As Flanders put it, \"It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing,\" but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a \"bill of particulars\" listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator [[Arthur Vivian Watkins]], was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

HUAC was a House committee, and as such it had no formal connection to McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938\u20131975).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/house-un-american-activities-committee.html |title=House Un-American Activities Committee |publisher=infoplease.com |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===In popular culture===\nFrom the start of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a favorite subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. [[Herblock]]'s cartoon that coined the term ''McCarthyism'' appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]].\n\nIn 1951, [[Ray Bradbury]] published ''The Fireman'', an allegory on suppression of ideas.

After a worried [[Rhode Island]] newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator [[Walt Kelly]] began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features.

He was impersonated by nightclub and radio [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]] and was satirized in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', and elsewhere. Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954, including \"Point of Order\" by [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Daws Butler]], \"Senator McCarthy Blues\" by [[Hal Block]], and unionist folk singer [[Joe Glazer]]'s \"Joe McCarthy's Band\", sung to the tune of \"[[McNamara's Band]]\". Also in 1954, the radio comedy team [[Bob and Ray]] parodied McCarthy with the character \"Commissioner Carstairs\" in their soap opera spoof \"Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife\". That same year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio network broadcast a satire, ''[[The Investigator]]'', whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy. A recording of the show became popular in the United States, and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| first = Thomas\n| last = Doherty\n| title= Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture\n| url = https://archive.org/details/coldwarcoolmediu00dohe\n| url-access = registration\n| publisher= Columbia University Press\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/coldwarcoolmediu00dohe/page/213 213]\n| year= 2005\n| isbn= 978-0-231-12953-4}}</ref>\n\nThe 1953 short story ''Mr. Costello, Hero'' by [[Theodore Sturgeon]] was described by noted journalist and author [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]] as \"the all-time great story about Senator Joseph McCarthy, who he was and how he did what he did.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoresturgeontrust.com/williams.html|title=Theodore Sturgeon, Storyteller|last=Williams|first=Paul|date=1976|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Post-censure reaction====\n''Mr. Costello, Hero'' was adapted in 1958 by [[X Minus One]] into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956.<ref>https://archive.org/download/OTRR_X_Minus_One_Singles/XMinusOne56-07-03058MrCostelloHero.mp3</ref> While the radio adaptation retains much of the story, it completely remakes the narrator and in fact gives him a line spoken in the original by Mr Costello himself, thus changing the tone of the story considerably.

[[Webster's Dictionary|''Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged'' (1961)]] defines it as \"characterized chiefly by opposition to elements held to be subversive and by the use of tactics involving personal attacks on individuals by means of widely publicized indiscriminate allegations especially on the basis of unsubstantiated charges\".</ref><ref>Onion, Rebecca, ''[https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/that-have-you-no-sense-of-decency-sir-moment-from-the-1954-army-mccarthy-hearings-isnt-quite-what-we-remember.html We're Never Going to Get Our \u201cHave You No Sense of Decency, Sir?\u201d Moment]'', Slate, July 26, 2018</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Grand Chute, Wisconsin]], McCarthy commissioned in to the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in 1942, where he served as an [[military intelligence|intelligence]] briefing officer for a [[dive bomber]] squadron.

After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate [[Primary election|primary]] nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party's political boss in Wisconsin. In this race, he was challenging three-term senator [[Robert M. La Follette Jr.]], founder of the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]] and son of the celebrated Wisconsin governor and senator [[Robert M. La Follette|Robert M. La Follette Sr.]]\n\n===Senate campaign===\nIn his campaign, McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war, although La Follette had been 46 when [[Pearl Harbor]] was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, had been away fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). Where McCarthy got the money to invest in the first place remains a mystery. La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Rovere\n  |first = Richard H.\n  |title = Senator Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = University of California Press\n  |year=  1959\n  |pages = 97, 102\n  |isbn = 0-520-20472-7}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Jack Anderson and Ronald W.

It was during this campaign that McCarthy started publicizing his war-time nickname \"Tail-Gunner Joe\", using the slogan, \"Congress needs a tail-gunner\".

In that letter, Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in \"recommendation against permanent employment\" for 284 persons, and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs; this left 205 still on the State Department's payroll.

Service]], and [[Philip Jessup]]. Some of them no longer worked for the State Department, or never had; all had previously been the subject of charges of varying worth and validity. Owen Lattimore became a particular focus of McCarthy's, who at one point described him as a \"top Russian spy\". Throughout the hearings, McCarthy employed colorful rhetoric, but produced no substantial evidence, to support his accusations.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nFrom its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy's charges a \"fraud and a hoax\", and said that the result of McCarthy's actions was to \"confuse and divide the American people ... to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves\". Republicans responded in kind, with [[William E.

Political historian David Barrett uncovered Hillenkoetter's notes, which reveal the remainder of the statement: \"While this agency will never employ homosexuals on its rolls, it might conceivably be necessary, and in the past has actually been valuable, to use known homosexuals as agents in the field. I am certain that if [[Josef Stalin]] or a member of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] or a high satellite official were known to be a homosexual, no member of this committee or of the Congress would balk against our use of any technique to penetrate their operations ... after all, intelligence and espionage is, at best, an extremely dirty business.\"<ref>Hillenkoetter Testimony, 7-14-50, ''CIS Unpublished'' ''U.S. Senate Committee Hearings on Microfiche ''(Washington D.C.: Congressional Information Service); quoted in David M.

Barely a month after McCarthy's Wheeling speech, the term \"McCarthyism\" was coined by ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' cartoonist [[Herblock|Herbert Block]]. Block and others used the word as a synonym for [[demagogy|demagoguery]], baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters. \"McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled,\" McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year, he published a book titled ''McCarthyism: The Fight For America.''\n\nMcCarthy sought to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers. In the 1950 Maryland Senate election, McCarthy campaigned for [[John Marshall Butler]] in his race against four-term incumbent Millard Tydings, with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings. In speeches supporting Butler, McCarthy accused Tydings of \"protecting Communists\" and \"shielding traitors.\" McCarthy's staff was heavily involved in the campaign, and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader [[Earl Russell Browder]].<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Oshinsky\n  |first = David M.\n  |title = A Conspiracy So Immense: The World of Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Oxford University Press\n  |year=  2005\n  |page = 175\n  |isbn = 0-19-515424-X\n  |origyear= 1983}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title = The Official United States Congressional Daily Digest Records\n  |publisher = Government Publishing Office, Thomas Library, Official Repository Library, Local, Bakersfield California, CSUB\n  |year=  2009\n  |pages = 8', 79th Congress, 3rd Session, Date August 2, 1946, Congressional Records&nbsp;\u2013 House, p. 10749\n  |isbn =\n  |origyear= 1946}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  |title = The United States Constitution\n  |publisher = Government Publishing Office, Thomas Library, Official Repository Library, Local, Bakersfield California, CSUB\n  |year=  2009\n  |page = 10\n  |isbn =\n  |origyear= 1782}}\n</ref>\nA Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as \"a despicable, back-street type of campaign,\" as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Cook\n  |first = Fred J.\n  |title = The Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Random House\n  |year=  1971\n  |pages = 150\u2013151\n  |isbn = 0-394-46270-X}}</ref> The pamphlet was clearly labeled a composite.

After he lost the election by almost 40,000 votes, Tydings claimed foul play.\n\nIn addition to the Tydings\u2013Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the [[1950 United States Senate elections|1950 elections]], including [[Everett Dirksen]] against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader [[Scott W. Lucas]]. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now regarded as one of the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Cook\n  |first = Fred J.\n  |title = The Nightmare Decade: The Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy\n  |publisher = Random House\n  |year=  1971\n  |page = 316\n  |isbn = 0-394-46270-X}}</ref>\nIn the 1952 Senate elections McCarthy was returned to his Senate seat with 54.2% of the vote, compared to Democrat Thomas Fairchild's 45.6%.\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n| title=1952 Wisconsin U.S. Senate election}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n  |party      = Republican Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = Joseph McCarthy\n  |votes      = 870,444\n  |percentage = 54.2\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n  |party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n  |candidate  = [[Thomas E.

Truman|President Truman]] clashed often during the years both held office. McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on, or even in league with, Communists, and spoke of the Democrats' \"twenty years of treason\". Truman, in turn, once referred to McCarthy as \"the best asset the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] has\", calling McCarthy's actions an attempt to \"sabotage the [[foreign policy of the United States]]\" in a cold war and comparing it to shooting American soldiers in the back in a hot war.<ref>\n{{cite book|last = Herman\n  |first = Arthur\n  |title = Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator\n  |publisher = Free Press\n  |year = 2000\n  |page = [https://archive.org/details/josephmccarthyre00herm/page/131 131]\n  |isbn = 0-684-83625-4\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/josephmccarthyre00herm/page/131\n  }}</ref>\nIt was the Truman Administration's State Department that McCarthy accused of harboring 205 (or 57 or 81) \"known Communists\". Truman's [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[George Marshall|George Catlett Marshall]], was the target of some of McCarthy's most vitriolic rhetoric. Marshall had been [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] during World War II and was also Truman's former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Marshall was a highly respected general and statesman, remembered today as the architect of victory and peace, the latter based on the [[Marshall Plan]] for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled ''America's Retreat From Victory: The Story of George Catlett Marshall''. Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the [[loss of China]] to Communism. In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason;<ref name=\"Retreat\">\n{{cite book\n  |last = McCarthy\n  |first = Joseph\n  |title = Major Speeches and Debates of Senator Joe McCarthy Delivered in the United States Senate, 1950\u20131951\n  |publisher = Gordon Press\n  |year=  1951\n  |pages = 264, 307, 215\n  |isbn = 0-87968-308-2}}</ref>\ndeclared that \"if Marshall were merely stupid, the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this country's interest\";<ref name=\"Retreat\"/> and most famously, accused him of being part of \"a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man\".<ref name=\"Retreat\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], when President Truman dismissed General [[Douglas MacArthur]], McCarthy charged that Truman and his advisors must have planned the dismissal during late-night sessions when \"they've had time to get the President cheerful\" on bourbon and [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine]].

The Republican party also held a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that \"Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal.&nbsp;...

In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing \"1,456 Truman holdovers who were&nbsp;... gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion.\" He then went on to complain that [[John Paton Davies Jr.]] was still \"on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower Administration,\" even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to \"put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].\" In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War.<ref>All quotes in this paragraph: {{cite book|last = Fried\n |first = Albert\n |year = 1997\n |title = McCarthyism, The Great American Red Scare: A Documentary History\n |publisher = Oxford University Press\n |pages = [https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/182 182\u2013184]\n |isbn = 0-19-509701-7\n |url = https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/182\n }}</ref> By the end of 1953, McCarthy had altered the \"twenty years of treason\" catchphrase he had coined for the preceding Democratic administrations and began referring to \"twenty-''one'' years of treason\" to include Eisenhower's first year in office.<ref>{{cite book|last = Fried\n  |first = Albert\n  |title = McCarthyism, The Great American Red Scare: A Documentary History\n  |publisher = Oxford University Press\n  |year = 1996\n  |page = [https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/179 179]\n  |isbn = 0-19-509701-7\n  |url = https://archive.org/details/mccarthyismgreat00frie/page/179\n  }}</ref>\n\nAs McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly.

According to some reports, Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy's methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Internal Security Subcommittee]]\u2014the committee normally involved with investigating Communists\u2014thus putting McCarthy \"where he can't do any harm,\" in the words of Senate Majority Leader [[Robert A. Taft]].<ref>{{cite book\n |last = Fried\n |first = Richard M.\n |year = 1990\n |title = Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective\n |publisher = Oxford University Press\n |page = 134\n |isbn = 0-19-504361-8\n}}</ref> However, the Committee on Government Operations included the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]], and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed [[Roy Cohn]] as chief counsel and 27-year-old [[Robert F. Kennedy]] as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee. Cohn brought with him, as his assistant, [[G. David Schine|Gerard David Schine]], heir to a hotel-chain fortune, who would bear much responsibility for triggering McCarthy's eventual downfall.\n\nThis subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy's most publicized exploits. When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy's chairmanship were made public in 2003\u201304,<ref>See \"Transcripts, Executive Sessions ...\" under Primary sources, below.</ref> Senators [[Susan Collins]] and [[Carl Levin]] wrote the following in their preface to the documents:\n\n<blockquote>Senator McCarthy's zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.&nbsp;...

Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations.<ref name=\"VOA\">{{cite book\n |last = Heil\n |first = Alan L.\n |year = 2003\n |title = Voice of America: A History\n |publisher = Columbia University Press\n |page = 53\n |isbn = 0-231-12674-3\n}}</ref> A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy's investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA's \"darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it.\"<ref name=\"VOA\" />\n\nThe subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves \"material by any controversial persons, Communists, fellow travelers, etc.\" Some libraries went as far as [[Book burning|burning]] the newly forbidden books.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

B. Matthews]] as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled \"Reds and Our Churches\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=%22Reds%20and%20Our%20Churches%22%20Matthews&btnG=Search%20Books|title=\"Reds and Our Churches\" Matthews \u2013 Google Search|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?lr=&q=%22Reds%20in%20Our%20Churches%22%20Matthews&btnG=Search%20Books|title=\"Reds in Our Churches\" Matthews |via=Google Search|publisher=}}</ref> which opened with the sentence, \"The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen.\" A group of senators denounced this \"shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy\" and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. But as the controversy mounted, and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews's ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] laboratory at [[Fort Monmouth]]. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations.<ref>{{cite book|last = Stone|title = Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism|isbn = 0-393-05880-8|url = https://archive.org/details/periloustimesfre00ston|publisher = W.W. Norton & Co.|year = 2004}}</ref> Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of [[Irving Peress]], a New York dentist who had been drafted into the army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing [[American Labor Party]], had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress' superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. McCarthy responded by sending a message to [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[Robert T. Stevens]], demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the army to be effected immediately, and the next day [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Ralph Wise Zwicker|Ralph W. Zwicker]], his commanding officer at [[Camp Kilmer]] in [[New Jersey]], gave him an honorable separation from the army. At McCarthy's encouragement, \"Who promoted Peress?\" became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.<ref>{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Bart |date=November 18, 2014 |title=Irving Peress, dentist who was subject of Sen.

After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in \"unduly persistent or aggressive efforts\". The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams \"made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth\", and that Adams \"made vigorous and diligent efforts\" to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board \"by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee\".<ref>Karl E.

It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men\u2014not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.\n\nThis is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.\n\nThe actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it\u2014and rather successfully.

[[Constitution of Wisconsin|Wisconsin's constitution]] stipulates the number of signatures needed to force a recall election must exceed one-quarter the number of voters in the most recent gubernatorial election, requiring the anti-McCarthy movement to gather some 404,000 signatures in sixty days. With little support from [[organized labor]] or the [[Democratic Party (Wisconsin)|state Democratic Party]], the roughly organized recall effort attracted national attention, particularly during the concurrent Army-McCarthy hearings.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nFollowing the deadline of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent out of state to avoid a subpoena from the [[Sauk County, Wisconsin|Sauk County]] district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of the recall campaign on the grounds that they had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act.

Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate's rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next introduced a resolution to [[censure in the United States|censure]] McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy's part. As Flanders put it, \"It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing,\" but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a \"bill of particulars\" listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator [[Arthur Vivian Watkins]], was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Griffith\n  |first = Robert\n  |title = The Politics of Fear: Joseph R.

HUAC was a House committee, and as such it had no formal connection to McCarthy, who served in the Senate, although the existence of the House Un-American Activities Committee thrived in part as a result of McCarthy's activities. HUAC was active for 37 years (1938\u20131975).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/house-un-american-activities-committee.html |title=House Un-American Activities Committee |publisher=infoplease.com |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===In popular culture===\nFrom the start of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a favorite subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. [[Herblock]]'s cartoon that coined the term ''McCarthyism'' appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]].\n\nIn 1951, [[Ray Bradbury]] published ''The Fireman'', an allegory on suppression of ideas.

After a worried [[Rhode Island]] newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator [[Walt Kelly]] began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features.

He was impersonated by nightclub and radio [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]] and was satirized in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', and elsewhere. Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954, including \"Point of Order\" by [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Daws Butler]], \"Senator McCarthy Blues\" by [[Hal Block]], and unionist folk singer [[Joe Glazer]]'s \"Joe McCarthy's Band\", sung to the tune of \"[[McNamara's Band]]\". Also in 1954, the radio comedy team [[Bob and Ray]] parodied McCarthy with the character \"Commissioner Carstairs\" in their soap opera spoof \"Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife\". That same year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio network broadcast a satire, ''[[The Investigator]]'', whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy. A recording of the show became popular in the United States, and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| first = Thomas\n| last = Doherty\n| title= Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture\n| url = https://archive.org/details/coldwarcoolmediu00dohe\n| url-access = registration\n| publisher= Columbia University Press\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/coldwarcoolmediu00dohe/page/213 213]\n| year= 2005\n| isbn= 978-0-231-12953-4}}</ref>\n\nThe 1953 short story ''Mr. Costello, Hero'' by [[Theodore Sturgeon]] was described by noted journalist and author [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]] as \"the all-time great story about Senator Joseph McCarthy, who he was and how he did what he did.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoresturgeontrust.com/williams.html|title=Theodore Sturgeon, Storyteller|last=Williams|first=Paul|date=1976|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Post-censure reaction====\n''Mr. Costello, Hero'' was adapted in 1958 by [[X Minus One]] into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956.<ref>https://archive.org/download/OTRR_X_Minus_One_Singles/XMinusOne56-07-03058MrCostelloHero.mp3</ref> While the radio adaptation retains much of the story, it completely remakes the narrator and in fact gives him a line spoken in the original by Mr Costello himself, thus changing the tone of the story considerably.

CDCR correctional officers are sworn law enforcement officers with peace officer powers.\n\nAs of 2013, CDCR employed approximately 24,000 peace officers (state correctional officers), 1,800 state parole agents, and 200 criminal investigators/special agents.\n\n\n\n'''Secretary Ralph Diaz'''\n\nRalph Diaz was appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom as Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) on March 27, 2019. Most recently, he served as Undersecretary of Operations, Deputy Director of Facility Operations, and Associate Director of High Security Institutions. Before that, Mr. Diaz served as a prison Warden, Correctional Counselor Supervisor, and Correctional Counselor, after starting his career as a Correctional Officer in 1991. \n\nMr. Diaz has the honor and privilege to lead over 60,000 of the nation\u2019s finest correctional professionals, who provide outstanding levels of rehabilitative services to the offenders in our care. \n\nWith more than 29 years of diverse correctional experience, Mr. Diaz has seen first-hand how restorative justice practices can transform communities inside and outside prison walls. He believes in a holistic approach to corrections that offers a variety of educational, vocational, and therapeutic programs to offenders while also stressing individual accountability and respecting and honoring victims of crime.\n\nMr. Diaz has been instrumental in developing policies focused on staff well-being and professional development, while empowering them to serve as role models and mentors to all.<ref>{{cite web |title=Secretary Ralph Diaz |url=https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/about-cdcr/secretary/ |website=California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1851, California activated its first state-run institution.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.<ref>{{cite news |title=Convicted murderer caught after escaping during prison transport |url=https://abc7news.com/jeffery-scott-landers-convicted-murderer-escapes-during-prison-transport-in-merced-county/237543/ |work=ABC7 San Francisco |date=4 August 2014 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" Although the gang was known about for years, the formal investigation began in the spring of 2016, when SSU obtained evidence of Woodland residents with ties to Nuestra Familia gang members incarcerated at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California. Although centered in Woodland, the investigation revealed that at least nine other California counties were negatively impacted by these criminal organizations including Sacramento, Sutter, Colusa, Yuba, Del Norte, Solano, Fresno, Santa Clara, and Siskiyou. Ironically, the massive arrest sweep took place on February 14, 2018. More than 750 law enforcement federal, state and local officers netted 29 suspects on drug and weapons charges across 10 Northern California counties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Ryan |title=Gangland's Finest |journal=Tactical Life |date=January 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parry |first1=Brian |title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service |journal=www.ncjrs.gov |date=October 2001 |volume=63 |issue=6 |page=120-123 |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=191541 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe. Special agents come from a variety of backgrounds. Some have worked their way up through the Department of Corrections. An internal hire must hold the rank of lieutenant or above in order to apply to SSU. Law enforcement officers also apply from outside agencies, such as local police departments and other state police services. Those individuals ordinarily come with an investigative and/or tactical background, usually having served on their agencies detective unit and special weapons team (SWAT).\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Garridos deny involvement in \u201988 Hayward abduction |url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/garridos-deny-involvement-in-88-hayward-abduction/ |work=www.tahoedailytribune.com}}</ref> \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.<ref>{{cite news |title=Convicted murderer caught after escaping during prison transport |url=https://abc7news.com/jeffery-scott-landers-convicted-murderer-escapes-during-prison-transport-in-merced-county/237543/ |work=ABC7 San Francisco |date=4 August 2014 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2018, SSU culminated a year long operation in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, code named \"Silent Night.\" The investigation focused on the Nuestra Familia prison gang and its control over Northern California communities. The investigation centered on the city of Woodland, California and the street gang called \"Varrio Bosque Norteno.\" Although the gang was known about for years, the formal investigation began in the spring of 2016, when SSU obtained evidence of Woodland residents with ties to Nuestra Familia gang members incarcerated at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California. Although centered in Woodland, the investigation revealed that at least nine other California counties were negatively impacted by these criminal organizations including Sacramento, Sutter, Colusa, Yuba, Del Norte, Solano, Fresno, Santa Clara, and Siskiyou. Ironically, the massive arrest sweep took place on February 14, 2018. More than 750 law enforcement federal, state and local officers netted 29 suspects on drug and weapons charges across 10 Northern California counties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Thompson |first1=Don |title=Sweep targets street gang directed from California prison and based in Woodland |url=https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2018/02/15/sweep-targets-street-gang-directed-from-california-prison-and-based-in-woodland/ |accessdate=15 Feb 2018 |work=Daily Democrat |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.
