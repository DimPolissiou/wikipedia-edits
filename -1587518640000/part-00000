Its geographic location on the island has resulted in it being referred to as the ''Sol Nascente'' parish (roughly, the ''sun dawn''), owing to it being the first of the archipelagos of the Azores to glimpse the dawn (approximately 24 minutes earlier than the most distant community, on the island of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]). With an area of approximately {{convert|15.34|km2|mi2}}, \nSanta B\u00e1rbara is bounded in the north and east by the sea, south by the neighboring parish of [[Santo Esp\u00edrito]] and south by [[S\u00e3o Pedro (Vila do Porto)|S\u00e3o Pedro]].\n\n===Physical geography===\nSanta Maria is one of the more important geomorphological islands of the archipelago, owing to its varied geological sedimentary, calcium and marine fossil deposits, along with basaltic formations.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nThe area of Santa B\u00e1rbara consists of geological basaltic stone and escoria, transformed by pressures and weathering. In the region of Arrebent\u00e3o is a former quarry pit, where these deposits were excavated and sold, explaining the vertical slopes of the quarry. From its geological record and level of alteration, the pyroclasts are consolidated and took on the red-tinged colour, giving the name of the site: Pico Vermelho.\n\nThe highest points in the parish include the peak of Pico Alto {{convert|587|m|ft}}, shared between the central parishes of the island, and Pico do Penedo, the heightest point totally within the parish of Santa B\u00e1rbara at an elevation of {{convert|423|m|ft}}.\n\n===Human geography===\n[[File:SMA VPO Santa Barbara Sao Lourenco.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The scenic landscape of the former caldera, village and bay of S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]]\nIts accented relief of hills and valleys resulted in isolated communities of less than 100 inhabitants, with the largest being the seat of the parish (Santa B\u00e1rbara).

Its geographic location on the island has resulted in it being referred to as the ''Sol Nascente'' parish (roughly, the ''sun dawn''), owing to it being the first of the archipelagos of the Azores to glimpse the dawn (approximately 24 minutes earlier than the most distant community, on the island of [[Flores Island (Azores)|Flores]]). With an area of approximately {{convert|15.34|km2|mi2}}, \nSanta B\u00e1rbara is bounded in the north and east by the sea, south by the neighboring parish of [[Santo Esp\u00edrito]] and south by [[S\u00e3o Pedro (Vila do Porto)|S\u00e3o Pedro]].\n\n===Physical geography===\nSanta Maria is one of the more important geomorphological islands of the archipelago, owing to its varied geological sedimentary, calcium and marine fossil deposits, along with basaltic formations.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nThe area of Santa B\u00e1rbara consists of geological basaltic stone and escoria, transformed by pressures and weathering. In the region of Arrebent\u00e3o is a former quarry pit, where these deposits were excavated and sold, explaining the vertical slopes of the quarry. From its geological record and level of alteration, the pyroclasts are consolidated and took on the red-tinged colour, giving the name of the site: Pico Vermelho.\n\nThe highest points in the parish include the peak of Pico Alto {{convert|587|m|ft}}, shared between the central parishes of the island, and Pico do Penedo, the heightest point totally within the parish of Santa B\u00e1rbara at an elevation of {{convert|423|m|ft}}.\n\n===Human geography===\n[[File:SMA VPO Santa Barbara Sao Lourenco.JPG|thumb|235px|left|The scenic landscape of the former caldera, village and bay of S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o]]\nIts accented relief of hills and valleys resulted in isolated communities of less than 100 inhabitants, with the largest being the seat of the parish (Santa B\u00e1rbara).

The twenty-three verses of the hymn are a metaphorical and riddle-filled legend. It is presented as a dialogue between multiple characters: the god [[Indra]], his wife Indrani and an energetic monkey it refers to as ''Vrisakapi'' and his wife ''Kapi''.<ref>[https://sa.wikisource.org/s/9c \u090b\u0917\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926:_\u0938\u0942\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902_\u0967\u0966.\u096e\u096c], Rigveda, Wikisource</ref><ref name=lutgendorf23>Philip Lutgendorf (1999), [http://www.manushi.in/docs/106.%20Like%20Mother,%20Like%20Son.pdf Like Mother, Like Son, Sita and Hanuman], Manushi, No. 114, pages 23\u201325</ref><ref name=\"Philip_2007\"/>{{rp|39\u201340}} The hymn opens with Indrani complaining to Indra that some of the soma offerings for Indra have been allocated to the energetic and strong monkey, and the people are forgetting Indra. The king of the gods, Indra, responds by telling his wife that the living being (monkey) that bothers her is to be seen as a friend, and that they should make an effort to coexist peacefully. The hymn closes with all agreeing that they should come together in Indra's house and share the wealth of the offerings.\n\n===Tamil roots===\nThe orientalist [[F. E. Pargiter]] (1852\u20131927) theorized that Hanuman was a [[Dravidian folk religion|proto-Dravidian]] deity.<ref name=\"Philip_2007\"/>{{rp|40}} According to this theory, the name \"Hanuman\" derives from the Tamil word for male monkey (''ana-mandi''), first transformed to \"Anumant\" \u2013 a name which remains in use. \"Anumant\", according to this hypothesis, was later Sanskritized to \"Hanuman\" because the ancient Aryans confronted with a popular monkey deity of ancient Dravidians coopted the concept and then Sanskritized it.<ref name=\"Philip_2007\"/>{{rp|39\u201340}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Legend of Ram\u2013Retold |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KIALB4WXHOMC&pg=PT56 |publisher=PublishAmerica |isbn=978-1-4512-2350-7 |pages=56\u2013|date=2012-12-28 }}</ref> According to Murray Emeneau, known for his Tamil linguistic studies, this theory does not make sense because the Old Tamil word ''mandi'' in [[Sangam literature|Ca\u1e45kam literature]] can only mean \"female monkey\", and Hanuman is male. Further, adds Emeneau, the compound ''ana-mandi'' makes no semantic sense in Tamil, which has well developed and sophisticated grammar and semantic rules.

One story mentioned in [[Eknath]]'s ''Bhavartha Ramayana'' (16th century CE) states that when Anjana was worshiping Shiva, the King [[Dasharatha]] of [[Ayodhya]] was also performing the ritual of [[Putrakameshti]] [[yagna]] in order to have children. As a result, he received some sacred pudding ([[payasam]]) to be shared by his three wives, leading to the births of [[Rama]], [[Lakshmana]], [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] and [[Shatrughna]]. By divine ordinance, a [[Kite (bird)|kite]] snatched a fragment of that pudding and dropped it while flying over the forest where Anjana was engaged in worship. [[Vayu]], the [[Hindu]] deity of the wind, delivered the falling pudding to the outstretched hands of Anjana, who consumed it.

Mistaking it for a ripe fruit, he leapt up to eat it. In one version of the Hindu legend, the king of gods [[Indra]] intervened and struck Hanuman with his thunderbolt. It hit Hanuman on his jaw, and he fell to the earth as dead with a broken jaw. His father, Vayu (air), states Ramayana in section 4.65, became upset and withdrew. The lack of air created immense suffering to all living beings. This led lord [[Shiva]], to intervene and resuscitate Hanuman, which in turn prompted Vayu to return to the living beings. As the mistake done by god Indra, he grants Hanuman a wish that his body would be as strong as Indra's [[Vajra]], where as his Vajra can also not harm him. Along with Indra other gods have also granted him wishes such as God [[Agni]] granted Hanuman a wish that [[fire]] won't harm him, God [[Varuna]] granted a wish for Hanuman that [[water]] won't harm him, God [[Vayu]] granted a wish for Hanuman that he will be as fast as [[wind]] and the wind won't harm him. Lord [[Brahma]] has also granted Hanuman a wish that he can move at any place where he cannot be stopped at anywhere, Lord [[Vishnu]] also grants Hanuman a weapon which is named as \"Gada\".

In fury, the sage curses Hanuman to forget the vast majority of his powers.\n\n== Adulthood ==\n[[File:The giant leap of Hanuman to Lanka.jpg|thumb|300px|The giant leap of Hanuman to Lanka]]\nThere is quite a lot of variation between what happens between his childhood and the events of the ''Ramayana'', but his story becomes much more solid in the events of the Ramayana. After [[Rama]] and his brother [[Lakshmana]], searching for Rama's kidnapped wife, [[Sita]], arrive in Kishkindha, the new king, and Rama's newfound ally, the monkey king [[Sugriva]], agrees to send scouts in all four directions to search for Rama's missing wife. To the south, Sugriva sends Hanuman and some others, including the great bear [[Jambavan]]. This group travels all the way to the southernmost tip of India, where they encounter the ocean with the island of [[Lanka]] (modern day [[Sri Lanka]]) visible in the horizon. The group wishes to investigate the island, but none can swim or jump so far (it was common for such supernatural powers to be common amongst characters in these epics). However, Jambavan knows from prior events that Hanuman used to be able to do such a feat with ease, and lifts his curse.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Valmiki's Ramayana|last=Pai|first=Anant|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|year=1978|isbn=|location=India|pages=1\u201396}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hanuman then allows himself to be captured by Ravana, who sets his tail on fire; bazaar art, c.1910's.jpg|thumb|left|Ravana burns Hanuman's tail.]]\nThe curse lifted, Hanuman now remembers all of his godlike powers. He is said to have transformed into the size of mountain, and flew across the narrow channel to Lanka. Upon landing, he discovers a city populated by the lanka king [[Ravana]] and his demon followers, so he shrinks down to the size of an ant and sneaks into the city. After searching the city, he discovers Sita in a grove, guarded by demon warriors. When they all fall asleep, he meets with Sita and discusses how he came to find her. She reveals that Ravana kidnapped her and is forcing her to marry him soon. He offers to rescue her but Sita refuses, stating that her husband must do it (A belief from the time of [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient India]]).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Hanuman|last=Pai|first=Anant|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|year=1971|isbn=|location=India|pages=1\u201332}}</ref>\n\nWhat happens next differs by account, but a common tale is that after visiting Sita, he starts destroying the grove, prompting in his capture. Regardless of the tale, he ends up captured in the court of Ravana himself, who laughs when Hanuman tells him that Rama is coming to take back Sita. Ravana orders his servants to light Hanuman's tail on fire as torture for threatening his safety. However, every time they put on an oil soaked cloth to burn, he grows his tail longer so that more cloths need to be added. This continues until Ravana has had enough and orders the lighting to begin. However, when his tail is lit, he shrinks his tail back and breaks free of his bonds with his superhuman strength. He jumps out a window and jumps from rooftop to rooftop, burning down building after building, until much of the city is ablaze. Seeing this triumph, Hanuman leaves back for India.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nUpon returning, he tells his scouting party what had occurred, and they rush back to Kishkindha, where Rama had been waiting all along for news. Upon hearing that Sita was safe and was awaiting him, Rama gathered the support of Sugriva's army and marched for Lanka. Thus begins the legendary Battle of Lanka.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout the long battle, Hanuman played a role as a general in the army. During one intense fight, Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was fatally wounded and was thought to die without the aid of an [[Sanjeevani (plant)|herb]] from a Himalayan mountain. Hanuman was the only one who could make the journey so quickly, and was thus sent to the mountain. Upon arriving, he discovered that there were many herbs along the mountainside, and did not want to take the wrong herb back. So instead, he grew to the size of a mountain, ripped the mountain from the Earth, and flew it back to the battle. This act is perhaps his most legendary among Hindus.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the end, Rama revealed his divine powers as the incarnation of the God Vishnu, and slew Ravana and the rest of the demon army. Finally finished, Rama returned to his home of Ayodhya to return to his place as king. After blessing all those who aided him in the battle with gifts, he gave Hanuman his gift, who threw it away. Many court officials, perplexed, were angered by this act. Hanuman replied that rather than needing a gift to remember Rama, he would always be in his heart. Some court officials, still upset, asked him for proof, and Hanuman tore open his chest, which had an image of Rama and Sita on his heart. Now proven as a true devotee, Rama cured him and blessed him with immortality, but Hanuman refused this and asked only for a place at Rama's feet to worship him. Touched, Rama blessed him with immortality anyway, which according to legend, is set only as long as the story of Rama lives on.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Bhimanjaneyula_kalayika.jpg|thumb|Bhima tries to lift Hanuman's tail.]]\nCenturies after the events of the Ramayana, and during the events of the Mahabharata, Hanuman is now a nearly forgotten demigod living his life in a forest. After some time, his half brother through the god [[Vayu]], [[Bhima]], passes through looking for flowers for his [[Draupadi|wife]]. Hanuman senses this and decides to teach him a lesson, as Bhima had been known to be boastful of his superhuman strength (at this point in time supernatural powers were much rarer than in the Ramayana but still seen in the Hindu epics). Bhima encountered Hanuman lying on the ground in the shape of a feeble old monkey. He asked Hanuman to move, but he would not. As stepping over an individual was considered extremely disrespectful in this time, Hanuman suggested lifting his tail up to create passage. Bhima heartily accepted, but could not lift the tail to any avail.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Bheema and Hanuman|last=Chandrakant|first=Kamala|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|year=1980|isbn=|location=India|pages=1\u201332}}</ref>\n\nBhima, humbled, realized that the frail monkey was some sort of deity, and asked him to reveal himself. Hanuman revealed himself, much to Bhima's surprise, and the brothers embraced. Hanuman prophesied that Bhima would soon be a part of [[Kurukshetra War|a terrible war]], and promised his brother that he would sit on the flag of his chariot and shout a battle cry that would weaken the hearts of his enemies.

According to belief, chanting of Hanuman Chalisa is said to protect Hanuman devotees from devil and all problems.\n\n====Relation with [[Devi]] or [[Shakti]]====\nThe relation between Hanuman and [[Goddess Kali]] finds mention in the Krittivasi Ramayana. Their meeting takes place in the [[Yuddha Kanda]] of Ramayana in the legend of [[Mahiravana]].\nMahiravana was a trusted friend/brother of Ravana. After his son, Meghanatha was killed, Ravana sought Mahiravana, the King of [[Patalaloka]]'s help to kill [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]].\nOne night, Mahiravana, using his maya, took Vibhishana's form and entered Rama's camp. There he cast the nidra mantra on the Vanar Sena, kidnapped Rama and Lakshmana and took them to Patala Loka. He was an adherent devotee of [[Devi]] and Ravana convinced him to sacrificing the valiant fighters of [[Ayodhya]] to the goddess to which, Mahiravana agreed.\nHanuman, upon understanding the way to Patala from [[Vibhishana]] headed for rescuing his lords. Down, he met Makardhwaja who claimed of being Hanuman's son, being born from his sweat which was consumed by a Makara (crocodile). Hanuman defeated and tied him and went inside the palace. There he met Chandrasena who told about the sacrifice and the way to kill Ahiravana.\nHanuman then shrunk his size to that of a bee and went towards the huge idol of [[Maha-Kali]]. He asked her to let him save Rama, and the fierce mother goddess agreed as Hanuman took her place while she slipped below. When Mahiravana asked the prince-sages to bow, they refused as they were of royal lineage and didn't know how to bow.\nSo as Mahiravana was about to show them how to bow, Hanuman took his Pancha-mukha form (with the head of Garuda, Narasimha, Varaha, Hayagreeva and himself: each head signifying a particular trait. Hanuman courage and strength, Narasimha fearlessness, Garuda magical skills and the power to cure snake bites, Varaha health and exorcism and Hayagriva victory over enemies), blew the 5 oil lamps in 5 directions and severed the head of Mahiravana by thus killing him.\nHe later took Shri Rama and Lakshmana on his shoulders and as he flew outside Shri Rama saw Makardhwaja tied with his tail. He rightaway ordered Hanuman to crown him the King of Patala.\nThe story of Ahiravan finds its place in the Ramayanas of the East. It can be found in the Bengali version of the Ramayana, written by Krittibash. The passage which talks about this incident is known as \u2018Mahirabonerpala\u2019.\nIt is also believed that after being pleased with Hanuman, [[Goddess Kali]] blessed him to be her dwara-paal or gate-keeper and hence one finds Bhairava and Hanuman on either sides of the temple entrance of the Goddess' shrine.\n<ref>Mystery of Hanuman - Inspiring Tales from Art and Mythology\nThe Story of Ahiravan Vadh - Hanuman Saves Lord</ref>\n\n=== Buddhism ===\nHanuman appears with a Buddhist gloss in Tibetan (southwest China) and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotanese]] (west China, central Asia and northern Iran) versions of Ramayana. The Khotanese versions have a [[J\u0101taka]] tales-like theme, but are generally similar to the Hindu texts in the storyline and character of Hanuman. The Tibetan version is more embellished, and without attempts to include a J\u0101taka gloss. Also, in the Tibetan version, novel elements appear such as Hanuman carrying love letters between Rama and Sita, in addition to the Hindu version wherein Rama sends the wedding ring with him as a message to Sita. Further, in the Tibetan version, Rama chides Hanuman for not corresponding with him through letters more often, implying that the monkey-messenger and warrior is a learned being who can read and write.<ref name=whitfield212>{{cite book|author1=Susan Whitfield|author2=Ursula Sims-Williams|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ArWLD4Qop38C&pg=PA212 |year=2004|publisher=Serindia Publications |isbn=978-1-932476-13-2|page=212}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=J.

There is no exaltation of humans over animals or nature, unlike the Western traditions. A divine monkey has been a part of the historic literature and culture of China and Japan, possibly influenced by the close cultural contact through Buddhist monks and pilgrimage to India over two millennia.<ref name= Lutgendorf353/> For example, the Japanese text ''Keiranshuyoshu'', while presenting its mythology about a divine monkey, that is the theriomorphic [[Shinto]] emblem of [[Hie Shrine|Hie]] shrines, describes a flying white monkey that carries a mountain from India to China, then from China to Japan.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Karl Payne|title=Re-Visioning \"Kamakura\" Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5nJT5NYvn4C&pg=PA65| year= 1998|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-2078-7|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> This story is based on a passage in the Ramayana where the wounded hero asks Hanuman to bring a certain herbal medicine from the Himalayas.

He is the son of [[Pavangati]] (wind deity) and [[A\u00f1jan\u0101|Anjana]] Sundari. Anjana gives birth to Hanuman in a forest cave, after being banished by her in-laws. Her maternal uncle rescues her from the forest; while boarding his [[vimana]], Anjana accidentally drops her baby on a rock. However, the baby remains uninjured while the rock is shattered. The baby is raised in Hanuruha.\n\nThere are major differences from the Hindu text  : Hanuman is a supernatural being in Jain texts, (Rama is a pious Jaina who never kills anyone, and it is Lakshamana who kills Ravana.) Hanuman becomes a supporter of Rama after meeting him and learning about [[Sita]]'s kidnapping by Ravana. He goes to [[Lanka]] on Rama's behalf, but is unable to convince Ravana to give up Sita. Ultimately, he joins Rama in the war against Ravana and performs several heroic deeds.\nLater Jain texts, such as ''[[Uttarapurana]]'' (9th century CE) by [[Gunabhadra (Jain monk)|Gunabhadra]] and ''[[Anjana-Pavananjaya]]'' (12th century CE), tell the same story.\n\n(In several versions of the Jain ''Ramayana'' story, there are passages that explain to Hanuman, and Rama (called Pauma in Jainism),(Hanuman, in these versions, ultimately renounces all social life become a Jain ascetic).\n\n=== Sikhism ===\nIn [[Sikhism]], the Hindu god Rama has been referred to as Sri Ram Chandar, and the story of Hanuman as a ''[[siddha]]'' has been influential. After the birth of the martial Sikh [[Khalsa]] movement in 1699, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Hanuman was an inspiration and object of reverence by the Khalsa.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Some Khalsa regiments brought along the Hanuman image to the battleground.

Hanuman is the son of [[A\u00f1jan\u0101|Anjani]] and [[Kesari (Ramayana)|Kesari]] and is also son of the wind-god [[Vayu]], who according to several stories, played a role in his birth.<ref name=\"debroy184\">{{cite book|author=Bibek Debroy|title=The Mahabharata: Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=af1qFbouaVMC&pg=PA184|year=2012|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-310015-7|pages=184 with footnote 686}}</ref><ref name=\"Melton2010p1310\">{{cite book|author1=J.

The king of the gods, Indra, responds by telling his wife that the living being (monkey) that bothers her is to be seen as a friend, and that they should make an effort to coexist peacefully.

Further, adds Emeneau, the compound ''ana-mandi'' makes no semantic sense in Tamil, which has well developed and sophisticated grammar and semantic rules.

She reveals that Ravana kidnapped her and is forcing her to marry him soon. He offers to rescue her but Sita refuses, stating that her husband must do it (A belief from the time of [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient India]]).<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Hanuman|last=Pai|first=Anant|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|year=1971|isbn=|location=India|pages=1\u201332}}</ref>\n\nWhat happens next differs by account, but a common tale is that after visiting Sita, he starts destroying the grove, prompting in his capture. Regardless of the tale, he ends up captured in the court of Ravana himself, who laughs when Hanuman tells him that Rama is coming to take back Sita. Ravana orders his servants to light Hanuman's tail on fire as torture for threatening his safety. However, every time they put on an oil soaked cloth to burn, he grows his tail longer so that more cloths need to be added. This continues until Ravana has had enough and orders the lighting to begin. However, when his tail is lit, he shrinks his tail back and breaks free of his bonds with his superhuman strength. He jumps out a window and jumps from rooftop to rooftop, burning down building after building, until much of the city is ablaze. Seeing this triumph, Hanuman leaves back for India.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nUpon returning, he tells his scouting party what had occurred, and they rush back to Kishkindha, where Rama had been waiting all along for news. Upon hearing that Sita was safe and was awaiting him, Rama gathered the support of Sugriva's army and marched for Lanka. Thus begins the legendary Battle of Lanka.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout the long battle, Hanuman played a role as a general in the army. During one intense fight, Lakshmana, Rama's brother, was fatally wounded and was thought to die without the aid of an [[Sanjeevani (plant)|herb]] from a Himalayan mountain. Hanuman was the only one who could make the journey so quickly, and was thus sent to the mountain. Upon arriving, he discovered that there were many herbs along the mountainside, and did not want to take the wrong herb back. So instead, he grew to the size of a mountain, ripped the mountain from the Earth, and flew it back to the battle. This act is perhaps his most legendary among Hindus.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the end, Rama revealed his divine powers as the incarnation of the God Vishnu, and slew Ravana and the rest of the demon army. Finally finished, Rama returned to his home of Ayodhya to return to his place as king. After blessing all those who aided him in the battle with gifts, he gave Hanuman his gift, who threw it away. Many court officials, perplexed, were angered by this act. Hanuman replied that rather than needing a gift to remember Rama, he would always be in his heart. Some court officials, still upset, asked him for proof, and Hanuman tore open his chest, which had an image of Rama and Sita on his heart. Now proven as a true devotee, Rama cured him and blessed him with immortality, but Hanuman refused this and asked only for a place at Rama's feet to worship him. Touched, Rama blessed him with immortality anyway, which according to legend, is set only as long as the story of Rama lives on.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Bhimanjaneyula_kalayika.jpg|thumb|Bhima tries to lift Hanuman's tail.]]\nCenturies after the events of the Ramayana, and during the events of the Mahabharata, Hanuman is now a nearly forgotten demigod living his life in a forest. After some time, his half brother through the god [[Vayu]], [[Bhima]], passes through looking for flowers for his [[Draupadi|wife]]. Hanuman senses this and decides to teach him a lesson, as Bhima had been known to be boastful of his superhuman strength (at this point in time supernatural powers were much rarer than in the Ramayana but still seen in the Hindu epics). Bhima encountered Hanuman lying on the ground in the shape of a feeble old monkey. He asked Hanuman to move, but he would not. As stepping over an individual was considered extremely disrespectful in this time, Hanuman suggested lifting his tail up to create passage. Bhima heartily accepted, but could not lift the tail to any avail.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Bheema and Hanuman|last=Chandrakant|first=Kamala|publisher=Amar Chitra Katha|year=1980|isbn=|location=India|pages=1\u201332}}</ref>\n\nBhima, humbled, realized that the frail monkey was some sort of deity, and asked him to reveal himself. Hanuman revealed himself, much to Bhima's surprise, and the brothers embraced.

Many people recite Hanuman Chalisa regularly. According to belief, chanting of Hanuman Chalisa is said to protect Hanuman devotees from devil and all problems.\n\n====Relation with [[Devi]] or [[Shakti]]====\nThe relation between Hanuman and [[Goddess Kali]] finds mention in the Krittivasi Ramayana. Their meeting takes place in the [[Yuddha Kanda]] of Ramayana in the legend of [[Mahiravana]].\nMahiravana was a trusted friend/brother of Ravana. After his son, Meghanatha was killed, Ravana sought Mahiravana, the King of [[Patalaloka]]'s help to kill [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]].\nOne night, Mahiravana, using his maya, took Vibhishana's form and entered Rama's camp. There he cast the nidra mantra on the Vanar Sena, kidnapped Rama and Lakshmana and took them to Patala Loka. He was an adherent devotee of [[Devi]] and Ravana convinced him to sacrificing the valiant fighters of [[Ayodhya]] to the goddess to which, Mahiravana agreed.\nHanuman, upon understanding the way to Patala from [[Vibhishana]] headed for rescuing his lords. Down, he met Makardhwaja who claimed of being Hanuman's son, being born from his sweat which was consumed by a Makara (crocodile). Hanuman defeated and tied him and went inside the palace. There he met Chandrasena who told about the sacrifice and the way to kill Ahiravana.\nHanuman then shrunk his size to that of a bee and went towards the huge idol of [[Maha-Kali]]. He asked her to let him save Rama, and the fierce mother goddess agreed as Hanuman took her place while she slipped below. When Mahiravana asked the prince-sages to bow, they refused as they were of royal lineage and didn't know how to bow.\nSo as Mahiravana was about to show them how to bow, Hanuman took his Pancha-mukha form (with the head of Garuda, Narasimha, Varaha, Hayagreeva and himself: each head signifying a particular trait. Hanuman courage and strength, Narasimha fearlessness, Garuda magical skills and the power to cure snake bites, Varaha health and exorcism and Hayagriva victory over enemies), blew the 5 oil lamps in 5 directions and severed the head of Mahiravana by thus killing him.\nHe later took Shri Rama and Lakshmana on his shoulders and as he flew outside Shri Rama saw Makardhwaja tied with his tail. He rightaway ordered Hanuman to crown him the King of Patala.\nThe story of Ahiravan finds its place in the Ramayanas of the East. It can be found in the Bengali version of the Ramayana, written by Krittibash. The passage which talks about this incident is known as \u2018Mahirabonerpala\u2019.\nIt is also believed that after being pleased with Hanuman, [[Goddess Kali]] blessed him to be her dwara-paal or gate-keeper and hence one finds Bhairava and Hanuman on either sides of the temple entrance of the Goddess' shrine.\n<ref>Mystery of Hanuman - Inspiring Tales from Art and Mythology\nThe Story of Ahiravan Vadh - Hanuman Saves Lord</ref>\n\n=== Buddhism ===\nHanuman appears with a Buddhist gloss in Tibetan (southwest China) and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotanese]] (west China, central Asia and northern Iran) versions of Ramayana. The Khotanese versions have a [[J\u0101taka]] tales-like theme, but are generally similar to the Hindu texts in the storyline and character of Hanuman. The Tibetan version is more embellished, and without attempts to include a J\u0101taka gloss. Also, in the Tibetan version, novel elements appear such as Hanuman carrying love letters between Rama and Sita, in addition to the Hindu version wherein Rama sends the wedding ring with him as a message to Sita. Further, in the Tibetan version, Rama chides Hanuman for not corresponding with him through letters more often, implying that the monkey-messenger and warrior is a learned being who can read and write.<ref name=whitfield212>{{cite book|author1=Susan Whitfield|author2=Ursula Sims-Williams|title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ArWLD4Qop38C&pg=PA212 |year=2004|publisher=Serindia Publications |isbn=978-1-932476-13-2|page=212}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=J.

A divine monkey has been a part of the historic literature and culture of China and Japan, possibly influenced by the close cultural contact through Buddhist monks and pilgrimage to India over two millennia.<ref name= Lutgendorf353/> For example, the Japanese text ''Keiranshuyoshu'', while presenting its mythology about a divine monkey, that is the theriomorphic [[Shinto]] emblem of [[Hie Shrine|Hie]] shrines, describes a flying white monkey that carries a mountain from India to China, then from China to Japan.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Karl Payne|title=Re-Visioning \"Kamakura\" Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5nJT5NYvn4C&pg=PA65| year= 1998|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-2078-7|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> This story is based on a passage in the Ramayana where the wounded hero asks Hanuman to bring a certain herbal medicine from the Himalayas.

He is the son of [[Pavangati]] (wind deity) and [[A\u00f1jan\u0101|Anjana]] Sundari. Anjana gives birth to Hanuman in a forest cave, after being banished by her in-laws. Her maternal uncle rescues her from the forest; while boarding his [[vimana]], Anjana accidentally drops her baby on a rock. However, the baby remains uninjured while the rock is shattered. The baby is raised in Hanuruha.\n\nThere are major differences from the Hindu text  : Hanuman is a supernatural being in Jain texts, (Rama is a pious Jaina who never kills anyone, and it is Lakshamana who kills Ravana.) Hanuman becomes a supporter of Rama after meeting him and learning about [[Sita]]'s kidnapping by Ravana. He goes to [[Lanka]] on Rama's behalf, but is unable to convince Ravana to give up Sita. Ultimately, he joins Rama in the war against Ravana and performs several heroic deeds.\nLater Jain texts, such as ''[[Uttarapurana]]'' (9th century CE) by [[Gunabhadra (Jain monk)|Gunabhadra]] and ''[[Anjana-Pavananjaya]]'' (12th century CE), tell the same story.\n\n(In several versions of the Jain ''Ramayana'' story, there are passages that explain to Hanuman, and Rama (called Pauma in Jainism),(Hanuman, in these versions, ultimately renounces all social life become a Jain ascetic).\n\n=== Sikhism ===\nIn [[Sikhism]], the Hindu god Rama has been referred to as Sri Ram Chandar, and the story of Hanuman as a ''[[siddha]]'' has been influential.

The monkey baby was delivered by the crocodile, who was soon retrieved by [[Ahiravana]], and raised by him, named [[Makardhwaja]], and made the guard of the gates of Patala, the former's kingdom. One day, Hanuman, when going to save [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] from Ahiravana, faced Makardhwaja and defeated him combat. Later, after knowing the reality and after saving both, he made his son, the king of Patala.\n\nThe [[Jethwa]] clan claims to be a descendant of Makardhwaja, and, according to them, he had a son named Modh-dhwaja, who in turn had a son named Jeth-dhwaja, hence the name of the clan.\n\n==In non-religious pop culture==\nWhile Hanuman is a quintessential character of any movie on [[Ramayan (1987 TV series)|Ramayan]], Hanuman centric movies have also been produced with Hanuman as the central character.

Several decades later in 2005 an animated version of the movie [[Hanuman (2005 film)|of the same name]] was released and was extremely popular among children. Following this several series of movies featuring the legendary God were produced though all of them were animated, prominent ones being the Bal Hanuman series 2006\u20132012.
