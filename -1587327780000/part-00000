Japan.\n\nUnlike comparable bodies such as the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the NPA does not have any operational units of its own except for the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)#Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency|Imperial Guard]]. Instead, its role is to supervise [[Prefectural police department]]s and determine general standards and policies; although in national emergencies or large-scale disasters the agency is authorized to take command of Prefectural police departments. As of 2017, the NPA has a strength of approximately 7,800 personnel: 2,100 [[police officer|sworn officers]], 900 guards and 4,800 civilian staff.<ref name=\"NPAWP\">{{Cite report|url=https://www.npa.go.jp/english/Police_of_Japan/Police_of_Japan_2018_full_text.pdf|title=POLICE OF JAPAN 2018\u3000(Overview of Japanese Police)|year=2018|author=National Police Agency}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Police services of the Empire of Japan]] were placed under complete centralized control with the {{Nihongo|Police Affairs Bureau|[[:ja:\u8b66\u4fdd\u5c40|\u8b66\u4fdd\u5c40]]|Keiho-kyoku}} of the [[Home Ministry]] at their core.

But most Japanese municipalities were too small to have a large police force, so sometimes they were unable to deal with large-scale violence. In addition, excessive fragmentation of the police organization reduced the efficiency of police activities.<ref name=\"NPA1977\"/>\n\nAs a response to these problems, complete restructuring created a more centralized system under the 1954 amended Police Law. All operational units except for the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)#Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency|Imperial Guard]] were reorganized into [[prefectural police department]]s for each [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]], and the National Police Agency was established as the central coordinating agency for these Police Departments.<ref name=\"NPA1977\"/>\n\n==Organization==\n=== Leadership ===\nThe {{Nihongo|[[Commissioner General]] of the National Police Agency|\u8b66\u5bdf\u5e81\u9577\u5b98|Keisatsu-ch\u014d Ch\u014dkan}} is the highest ranking police officer of Japan, regarded as an exception to the regular class structure.

of Japan]], and is the central agency of the [[Law enforcement in Japan|Japanese police system]], and the central coordinating agency of law enforcement in situations of national emergency in Japan.\n\nUnlike comparable bodies such as the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the NPA does not have any operational units of its own except for the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)#Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency|Imperial Guard]]. Instead, its role is to supervise [[Prefectural police department]]s and determine general standards and policies; although in national emergencies or large-scale disasters the agency is authorized to take command of Prefectural police departments. As of 2017, the NPA has a strength of approximately 7,800 personnel: 2,100 [[police officer|sworn officers]], 900 guards and 4,800 civilian staff.<ref name=\"NPAWP\">{{Cite report|url=https://www.npa.go.jp/english/Police_of_Japan/Police_of_Japan_2018_full_text.pdf|title=POLICE OF JAPAN 2018\u3000(Overview of Japanese Police)|year=2018|author=National Police Agency}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Police services of the Empire of Japan]] were placed under complete centralized control with the {{Nihongo|Police Affairs Bureau|[[:ja:\u8b66\u4fdd\u5c40|\u8b66\u4fdd\u5c40]]|Keiho-kyoku}} of the [[Home Ministry]] at their core.

But most Japanese municipalities were too small to have a large police force, so sometimes they were unable to deal with large-scale violence. In addition, excessive fragmentation of the police organization reduced the efficiency of police activities.<ref name=\"NPA1977\"/>\n\nAs a response to these problems, complete restructuring created a more centralized system under the 1954 amended Police Law. All operational units except for the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)#Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency|Imperial Guard]] were reorganized into [[Prefectural Police Department]]s for each [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]], and the National Police Agency was established as the central coordinating agency for these Police Departments.<ref name=\"NPA1977\"/>\n\n==Organization==\n=== Leadership ===\nThe {{Nihongo|[[Commissioner General]] of the National Police Agency|\u8b66\u5bdf\u5e81\u9577\u5b98|Keisatsu-ch\u014d Ch\u014dkan}} is the highest ranking police officer of Japan, regarded as an exception to the regular class structure.

It lies between the [[Victoria Cross Ranges]] (northwest), [[Pyramid Mountain (Alberta)|Pyramid Mountain]] (north), [[Maligne Range]] (southeast) and Indian Ridge (southwest).\n\nJasper is connected to the west via the [[Yellowhead Highway]] and the [[Yellowhead Pass]] to [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] and to the east to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. Toward the south, the [[Icefields Parkway]] leads to [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] and [[Banff National Park]].\n\nLocated near Jasper are [[Pyramid Lake (Alberta)|Pyramid Lake]] and [[Patricia Lake (Alberta)|Patricia Lake]], as well as Lake Annette, Lake Edith, [[Lac Beauvert]], [[Maligne Lake]], [[Medicine Lake (Alberta)|Medicine Lake]] and other smaller lakes. The [[Jasper Skytram]], which takes visitors to [[The Whistlers]]' summit, and the [[Marmot Basin]] ski resort are located near the town, as is the Fairmont [[Jasper Park Lodge]]. The Jasper-Yellowhead Museum and Archives is located in the Jasper town site, as is the [[Jasper Park Information Centre|Jasper Visitor Centre]].\n\n== Climate ==\n\nJasper experiences a borderline [[humid continental climate|Humid Continental]]/[[subarctic climate|Subarctic]] climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''/''Dfc'').

It lies between the [[Victoria Cross Ranges]] (northwest), [[Pyramid Mountain (Alberta)|Pyramid Mountain]] (north), [[Maligne Range]] (southeast) and Indian Ridge (southwest).\n\nJasper is connected to the west via the [[Yellowhead Highway]] and the [[Yellowhead Pass]] to [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] and to the east to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]. Toward the south, the [[Icefields Parkway]] leads to [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]] and [[Banff National Park]].\n\nLocated near Jasper are [[Pyramid Lake (Alberta)|Pyramid Lake]] and [[Patricia Lake (Alberta)|Patricia Lake]], as well as Lake Annette, Lake Edith, [[Lac Beauvert]], [[Maligne Lake]], [[Medicine Lake (Alberta)|Medicine Lake]] and other smaller lakes. The [[Jasper Skytram]], which takes visitors to [[The Whistlers]]' summit, and the [[Marmot Basin]] ski resort are located near the town, as is the Fairmont [[Jasper Park Lodge]]. The Jasper-Yellowhead Museum and Archives is located in the Jasper town site, as is the [[Jasper Park Information Centre|Jasper Visitor Centre]].\n\n== Climate ==\n\nJasper experiences a borderline [[humid continental climate|Humid Continental]]/[[subarctic climate|Subarctic]] climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''/''Dfc'').

Crested Butte.<ref>[http://www.hccaonline.org/pdf/CBMR2009MasterDevelopmentPlan-Part-I-New.pdf 2009 Crested Butte Master Developmental Plan]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> An operating permit enabling the resort to be built was approved by the [[United States Forest Service]] the following year. The resort struggled on for its first ten years. Some of the first lifts included a t-bar at the base area.\n\nIn 1963, Crested Butte constructed a top-to-bottom gondola from the base area to near where the bottom of the High Lift is today. The resort was the second resort to open a gondola in Colorado, after [[Vail Ski Resort]] opened theirs in 1962. Constructed by Carlevaro-Savio, the three-person Silver Queen Gondola was notorious for being cramped and the cabins were known to have frequent collisions.<ref>[http://www.chairlift.org/crestedbutte.html Crested Butte at chairlift.org]</ref> The gondola lasted until summer of 1973, when a bubble double chairlift replaced it. Other opening lifts included a Doppelmayr T-Bar that serviced the training hill on Buckley.\n\n[[Riblet]] constructed a double chairlift called Twister in 1969 to supplement the Silver Queen Gondola. The lift serviced expert and advanced trails on the west slope of the mountain, but following the additions of the Silver Queen and Paradise quads only operated sporadically until 2013 when it was removed from service.\n\nIn 1973, a bubble double replaced the old gondola and provided main access out of the base area for the next twenty years. Another double chairlift, Peachtree, was built at the base area to service a set of learning trails between Silver Queen and the T-Bar area. Peachtree still operates today.\n\nIn 1979, Riblet constructed the Teocalli double chairlift on the north side of the mountain, providing access to some intermediate trails, and double chairlifts were also built servicing the Paradise Bowl, which opened intermediate trails to the east of Twister as well as the East River area below that.\n\nIn 1982, [[Poma]] constructed a triple chairlift running out of the base area called the Keystone lift, servicing beginner and low intermediate trails on the lower slopes of the mountain. The following year, they expanded the mountain by constructing two additional triple chairlifts, Gold Link and Painter Boy, servicing beginner and intermediate terrain to the north of the main mountain. In 1987, Poma constructed a platter lift servicing the North Face chutes above East River.\n\nIn 1991, a T-Bar was constructed by Doppelmayr. Called the High Lift, the new T-Bar provided access to the Headwall chutes above Paradise Bowl, and also opened additional expert terrain on the upper part of the mountain.\n\nIn 1992, Crested Butte entered the high speed lift market, with Poma replacing the Silver Queen bubble double with a high speed quad. The quad services the same terrain as the old lift, but is aligned slightly differently so as to provide better access to the High Lift. It also provides access to terrain on all other parts of the mountain as well. Two years later, the Paradise double was replaced with another high speed quad. In 1997, the Keystone triple was replaced with a high speed quad, and the original triple was used to upgrade East River.\n\nIn 2004, Crested Butte was acquired by Triple Peaks, LLC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Triple Peaks, LLC History - NewEnglandSkiHistory.com|accessdate=June 16, 2018|url=http://www.newenglandskihistory.com/skiareamanagement/triplepeaksllc.php}}</ref> The Keystone Express lift was renamed the Red Lady Express, while the North Face platter was replaced with a t-bar. A fixed-grip quad, Prospect, was also constructed in the Painter Boy area to open up new terrain in the area east of Gold Link and provide ski-in-ski-out access. In 2005, another fixed-grip quad, West Wall, replaced the T-bar on Buckley. In 2006, a high speed quad replaced the East River triple chairlift.\n\nIn 2008, [[CNL Lifestyle Properties]] acquired the resorts owned by Triple Peaks. Triple Peaks continued to operate them under a lease.<ref>{{cite web|title=CNL Lifestyle Properties, Inc. - NewEnglandSkiHistory.com|accessdate=June 16, 2018|url=http://www.newenglandskihistory.com/skiareamanagement/cnllifestyleproperties.php}}</ref> In 2016, CNL sold the Triple Peaks-operated properties to [[Och-Ziff Capital Management]].<ref>{{cite news|title=No big changes expected with new owners at Crested Butte Mountain Resort|work=[[The Denver Post]]|accessdate=June 16, 2018|date=November 8, 2016|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/11/08/no-big-changes-crested-butte-mountain-resort/}}</ref>\n\nOn June 4, 2018, Vail Resorts announced plans to acquire Crested Butte Mountain Resort.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coast to Coast!

Out of the base, two learning lifts - Peachtree and Westwall - provide access to beginner and low-intermediate terrain.\n\nThe sole method of access to most of the mountain's terrain is via one of two high speed quads at the north end of the base area. On the north, the Red Lady Express lift provides access to additional beginner terrain, as well as access to lifts and trails on the north side of the mountain, as well as Painter Boy. To the south, the Silver Queen Express lift runs from the base all the way up to near the bottom of the Peak. The Silver Queen Express also provides access to advanced intermediate terrain, as well as a number of black runs such as International. From the top of Silver Queen, skiers and riders can also take a catwalk to Paradise Bowl or access a number of south-facing chutes on this part of the mountain, including Forest and Peel.\n\nAbove the top of the Silver Queen Express is the Headwall, an area of double-black diamond chutes above Paradise Bowl. These chutes are accessible via the High lift, a t-bar that originates below the top of Silver Queen and tops out at an elevation of 11,875 feet. It also provides access to the Peak (reachable by hiking only). The High Lift also has a midway unload for people not wishing to ride the entire way up. The High Lift is only accessible by taking the Silver Queen Express from the base area and taking a cutoff. It should also be noted that most of the chutes off this t-bar require riding Silver Queen and the High Lift.\n\nBelow the Headwall is Paradise Bowl, a mostly intermediate section of the mountain. The bowl allows for intermediate bowl skiing on a number of blue trails with names like Forest Queen and Ruby Chief. A third high speed quad, the Paradise Express lift, provides access to the trails in this area, as well as the resort's NASTAR course and a ski-cross course (for a couple of years, the ski-cross course was the location of a terrain park). A double chairlift, Teocalli, services some additional trails to the west of Paradise during peak periods.\n\nThe Paradise Express also provides access to the North Face T-Bar, which services the Extreme Limits terrain east of Paradise Bowl. These double-black chutes are relatively remote, as they require using three lifts for roundtrip skiing (East River, Paradise, and North Face).\n\nBelow Paradise Bowl is the East River trail pod. Serviced by the East River Express lift, it is composed primarily of additional blue trails with names like Floresta and Black Eagle, as well as continuations of a number of trails from Paradise Bowl, but also has a number of mogul runs. East River is also a runout for riders leaving the Extreme Limits chutes off North Face. It is a very remote section of the mountain, as it is necessary to ride Paradise to exit this area.\n\nTo the north of Red Lady is another small peak containing both of Crested Butte's triple chairlifts. Painter Boy provides access into this area from Red Lady and the rest of the mountain, and services beginner and low-intermediate trails. To the northwest, Gold Link accesses additional low-intermediate runs and also provides access to the resort's superpipe (which was originally located in Paradise Bowl on Canaan until 2009). A fixed-grip quad, Prospect, provides access to additional trails to the east of Gold Link.\n\n===Terrain aspects<ref>{{cite web|last1=ZRankings|first1=Best Ski Resorts in North America|title=ZRankings Terrain Survey - Crested Butte|url=https://zrankings.com/resort/show?id=44-crested-butte-ski-resort|website=ZRankings Best Ski Resorts - Crested Butte|publisher=ZRankings|accessdate=June 16, 2018}}</ref>===\n*North: 45%\n*West: 45%\n*East: 10%\n\n==The resort today==\n[[File:Mount Crested Butte ski area sign.jpg|thumb|right|Mt.

They have helped revolutionize skiing by starting freeski and [[telemark|Telemark skiing]] extremes competitions. Crested Butte has also been called home for many revolutionary skiers such as [[Seth Morrison (skier)|Seth Morrison]] and [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup]] and [[Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] athlete [[Wendy Fisher]], as well as extreme sports film production company [[Matchstick Productions]].\n\nCrested Butte Mountain Resort, is considered an adventure ski destination. It has abundant green and blue groomed trails to more advanced longer trails and the famous extreme limits of the North Face and Headwall. The mountain also features three slope-side restaurants accessible via lift. Summer activities on the mountain include hiking, disc golf, and lift access mountain biking. The town of Crested Butte is known as the origin of mountain biking in Colorado.  The lift access mountain bike trails further enhance Crested Butte as a summer riding destination. The nearby town of Crested Butte\u2019s activities include many diverse and distinctive bars, restaurants, shopping, and nightlife.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Crested Butte, Colorado]]\n*[[Mount Crested Butte, Colorado]]\n*[[Gunnison County, Colorado]]\n*[[Bo Callaway#The Colorado years|Bo Callaway]]\n*[[State of Colorado]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.skicb.com Crested Butte Mountain Resort Official Website]\n\n{{Colorado}}\n*[http://www.skicb.com Crested Butte Mountain Resort Official Page]\n\n[[Category:Ski areas and resorts in Colorado]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Gunnison County, Colorado]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Gunnison County, Colorado]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}\n{{Infobox ski area\n| name           = Crested Butte Mountain Resort \n| picture        = Mount crested butte 1988.jpg\n| caption        = Crested Butte in 1988\n| location       = [[Gunnison County, Colorado]], [[United States|USA]]\n| nearest_city   = [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Colorado]]\n| pushpin_map    = Colorado#United States\n| pushpin_relief = 1\n| coordinates    = {{coord|38|53|59|N|106|57|54|W|type:landmark_scale:50000|display=inline}}\n| pushpin_label_position = \n| map_caption    = Location in [[Colorado]]\n| top_elevation  = {{convert|12170|ft|m}}\n| base_elevation = {{convert|9115|ft|m}}\n| vertical       = &nbsp; {{convert|3055|ft|0|abbr=on}}\n| skiable_area   = {{convert|1547|acre|km2}}\n| number_trails  = 121 <br> 23% beginner <br> 57% intermediate<br>20% advanced/expert\n| longest_run    = 2.6 miles (4.2 km); Peak to Treasury\n| liftsystem     = 16 (4 high-speed quad [[detachable chairlift|chairs]], 2 quad [[chairlift|chair]], 2 triple chairs, 3 double chairs, 3 surface lifts, 2 Magic Carpets)\n| terrainparks   = 2\n| snowfall       = {{convert|300|in|m}} per year\n| snowmaking     = {{convert|282|acre|km2|abbr=on}} \n| external_link  = http://www.skicb.com\n }}\n\n'''Crested Butte Mountain Resort''' is a ski resort located at [[Mount Crested Butte, Colorado|Mount Crested Butte]] in [[Gunnison County, Colorado|Gunnison County]], [[Colorado]], [[United States]].\n\n==History==\nCrested Butte Mountain Resort opened in 1960 when two men - Fred Rice and Dick Eflin - purchased a ranch on Mt.

Out of the base, two learning lifts - Peachtree and Westwall - provide access to beginner and low-intermediate terrain.\n\nThe sole method of access to most of the mountain's terrain is via one of two high speed quads at the north end of the base area. On the north, the Red Lady Express lift provides access to additional beginner terrain, as well as access to lifts and trails on the north side of the mountain, as well as Painter Boy. To the south, the Silver Queen Express lift runs from the base all the way up to near the bottom of the Peak. The Silver Queen Express also provides access to advanced intermediate terrain, as well as a number of black runs such as International. From the top of Silver Queen, skiers and riders can also take a catwalk to Paradise Bowl or access a number of south-facing chutes on this part of the mountain, including Forest and Peel.\n\nAbove the top of the Silver Queen Express is the Headwall, an area of double-black diamond chutes above Paradise Bowl. These chutes are accessible via the High lift, a t-bar that originates below the top of Silver Queen and tops out at an elevation of 11,875 feet. It also provides access to the Peak (reachable by hiking only). The High Lift also has a midway unload for people not wishing to ride the entire way up. The High Lift is only accessible by taking the Silver Queen Express from the base area and taking a cutoff. It should also be noted that most of the chutes off this t-bar require riding Silver Queen and the High Lift.\n\nBelow the Headwall is Paradise Bowl, a mostly intermediate section of the mountain. The bowl allows for intermediate bowl skiing on a number of blue trails with names like Forest Queen and Ruby Chief. A third high speed quad, the Paradise Express lift, provides access to the trails in this area, as well as the resort's NASTAR course and a ski-cross course (for a couple of years, the ski-cross course was the location of a terrain park). A double chairlift, Teocalli, services some additional trails to the west of Paradise during peak periods.\n\nThe Paradise Express also provides access to the North Face T-Bar, which services the Extreme Limits terrain east of Paradise Bowl. These double-black chutes are relatively remote, as they require using three lifts for roundtrip skiing (East River, Paradise, and North Face).\n\nBelow Paradise Bowl is the East River trail pod. Serviced by the East River Express lift, it is composed primarily of additional blue trails with names like Floresta and Black Eagle, as well as continuations of a number of trails from Paradise Bowl, but also has a number of mogul runs. East River is also a runout for riders leaving the Extreme Limits chutes off North Face. It is a very remote section of the mountain, as it is necessary to ride Paradise to exit this area.\n\nTo the north of Red Lady is another small peak containing both of Crested Butte's triple chairlifts. Painter Boy provides access into this area from Red Lady and the rest of the mountain, and services beginner and low-intermediate trails. To the northwest, Gold Link accesses additional low-intermediate runs and also provides access to the resort's superpipe (which was originally located in Paradise Bowl on Canaan until 2009). A fixed-grip quad, Prospect, provides access to additional trails to the east of Gold Link.\n\n===Terrain aspects<ref>{{cite web|last1=ZRankings|first1=Best Ski Resorts in North America|title=ZRankings Terrain Survey - Crested Butte|url=https://zrankings.com/resort/show?id=44-crested-butte-ski-resort|website=ZRankings Best Ski Resorts - Crested Butte|publisher=ZRankings|accessdate=June 16, 2018}}</ref>===\n*North: 45%\n*West: 45%\n*East: 10%\n\n==The resort today==\n[[File:Mount Crested Butte ski area sign.jpg|thumb|right|Mt.

During his 17-year career, he played with the [[Montreal Expos]], [[Colorado Rockies]], and [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. In 1997, he became the only player in major league history to register both a .700 [[slugging percentage]] (SLG) and 30 [[stolen bases]] in the same season, on his way to winning the [[National League]] (NL) [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] (MVP). The first player in more than 60 years to record a [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .360 in three consecutive seasons from 1997 to 1999, Walker also won three NL [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting championships]]. He was inducted into [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2007, and the [[Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame]] in the Class of 2009,  and was named the 13th-greatest sporting figure from Canada by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1999. In [[2020 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2020]], he was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]].\n\nWidely considered a [[Glossary of baseball (0\u20139)#5-tool player|five-tool talent]] of prodigious athleticism and instincts, Walker hit for both average and [[Power hitter|power]], combined with well above-average [[Base runner|speed]], [[Defense (sports)|defense]] and throwing strength and accuracy. He was recognized as the top Canadian athlete in 1998 with the [[Lou Marsh Trophy]]. Other honors include five [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] selections, seven [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Awards]], three [[Silver Slugger Award|Silver Slugger Awards]], and nine [[Tip O'Neill Award]]s. His career SLG of .565 [[List of Major League Baseball career slugging percentage leaders|ranks 12th all time]]. Walker is one of only 19 hitters in history to accomplish a .300 batting average, .400 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP), and .500 SLG with at least 5,000 [[plate appearance]]s, and one of six whose careers began after 1960. Considering advanced [[Sabermetrics|metrics]], he is one of only three players in history to rank within the top 100 of each of batting runs, base-running runs, and [[Defensive Runs Saved|defensive runs saved]]; the others are [[Barry Bonds]] and [[Willie Mays]].\n\nRaised in the [[Greater Vancouver]] area of [[British Columbia]], Walker spent his youth playing [[street hockey]] with consuming [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[goaltender]] aspirations. That dream never materialized; however, the Expos saw his baseball potential and signed him in 1984. By 1990, Walker became their starting right fielder, propelling them to the majors' best record in 1994 when [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|that year's strike]] stopped their first serious [[World Series]] run. He signed with the Rockies as a [[free agent]] following the season, and, during a six-year period starting in 1997, was the major league batting leader three times while finishing second in the NL twice. In 1997, he also led the league in home runs, OBP, SLG, while joining the [[30\u201330 club]], registering 12 outfield [[Assist (baseball)|assists]] and leading his position with four [[double play]]s turned.\n\nDesiring a trade to a contending team, the Rockies sent Walker to St. Louis in the middle of their 105-win season of 2004 where he made his first [[2004 World Series|World Series]] appearance while tying or setting three Cardinals postseason records. He announced his retirement from playing baseball after Game 6 of the [[2005 National League Championship Series]]. Following his playing career, Walker has served as a guest instructor for the Cardinals, and, since 2009, has [[Coach (baseball)|coached]] the [[Canada national baseball team|Canadian national team]]. In that time, Team Canada has competed in three [[World Baseball Classic]] (WBC) tournaments, and twice at the [[Baseball at the Pan American Games|Pan American Games]], winning consecutive [[gold medal]]s in 2011 and 2015.\n\n==Early life and amateur career==\n\n{{quote box\n|width=24%\n|align=right\n|quote=I'm just thrilled to have kids come up to me and tell me my son is their idol.

Larry, Jr., was the youngest of four boys, Barry, Carey and Gary. The five men often played together in a [[fastpitch softball]] league, frequently all in the same starting lineup. Walker grew up passing much of his free time playing [[street hockey]], especially as part of a group of boys in the backyard and driveway of another boy named Rick Herbert. In that group was future [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r [[Cam Neely]], who became one of Walker's close friends. Walker dreamed of a career in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a [[goaltender]], only casually playing an occasional [[baseball]] game during the summer.

He swung indiscriminately, expecting every pitch to be a fastball, including at ones that bounced 10 feet in front of, or on, home plate. When the camp ended, there was still about one and a half months remaining until the start of the season, so he returned home, seeking additional preparation. He joined a fast-pitch softball team sponsored by a [[bowling alley]], but this brought little relief.<ref name=montville040593/>\n\nThe Expos assigned Walker to the [[Utica Blue Sox]] of the [[New York\u2013Penn League]], a Class A Short Season league, for his first season of [[professional baseball]].

[[Manager (baseball)|Manager]] [[Ken Brett]], who was less preoccupied with fielding a winning team than giving the athletic players opportunity to experiment, allowed Walker to stay in the lineup as a regular in part because of his willingness to learn.<ref name=sickels050811/> Walker heard that he would be released, but Brett recalled that \"he was just so tough,\" and marveled at his \"outstanding athleticism, freakish hand-eye coordination and mental approach;\"<ref name=montville040593/> he also had 12 [[stolen base]]s.<ref name=sickels050811/> Expos hitting coach [[Ralph Rowe]] successfully lobbied for him to be sent to the [[Florida Instructional League]] (FIL).

Famously distinguished as \"the accidental ballplayer\" by a ''Sports Illustrated'' article in 1993, he displayed all skills of the ideal five-tool player. The transition was a feat even more impressive considering he only began playing organized baseball after graduating high school and did not attend college,<ref name=montville040593/> and maintained staggering productivity over the course of his career in spite of myriad injuries. Baseball-Reference's advanced metrics of the three major areas of the game (excluding pitching) \u2212batting, baserunning and fielding\u2212, echo a multitude of observations of Walker's overall excellence.<ref name=montville040593/><ref name=hill081086/><ref name=walkerbrefmain/><ref name=gwynn082002/> He produced 420 runs above average in batting, or batting runs (Rbat), 94 fielding runs (Rfield), 40 baserunning runs (Rbase), and 10 runs above average avoiding grounding into [[double play]]s (Rdp). In every season following his short debut campaign of 1989, his adjusted OPS+ graded at minimum at 110; in just four seasons did he rate below average in fielding runs and twice in baserunning runs.<ref name=walkerbrefmain/>\n\nPer a profile of Walker's batting technique in ''Lau's Laws on Hitting'', he met all checkpoints on the list of absolutes for a complete swing that would generate the greatest possible success as prescribed by former hitting coach [[Charley Lau]]. Overall, Walker produced \"a beautiful, one-piece swing.\" Highlights included \"an exceptionally balanced stance,\" \"excellent weight transfer\" and \"admirable ... hip rotation.\" All energy transferred to the ball in an explosion upon impact with the bat. The authors assert that due to this balance, he was able to post excellent numbers in Montreal before playing for Colorado.<ref name=lau2000-174>[[#lau2000|Lau, Jr., and Flanagan 2000]]: 174</ref>\n\nRival right fielder and long-time San Diego Padre Tony Gwynn epitomized Walker as \"the most complete player in the National League,\" and \"best baserunner in the game\" in a 2002 profile for ESPN. He observed that, in addition to his obvious athletic gifts, Walker approaches the game very cerebrally and is always thinking ahead, unearthing a wide array of advantages that he applied to the game.<ref name=gwynn082002/> Said one sportswriter, \"His hand-eye co-ordination was off the charts, and his instincts as an outfielder and baserunner were unmatched.\"<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Griffin |first= |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/sports/1430590-griffin-hall-of-fame-case-for-clemens-bonds-isnt-too-hard-to-make |title=Hall of Fame case for Clemens, Bonds isn't too hard to make |work=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |date=January 9, 2017 |accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> To ''[[Denver Post]]'' sports writer Tony Renck, \"Walker is the most talented player I have ever covered.

He is the best.\"<ref name=hoffer061101/>\n\nOn defense, Walker combined uncanny awareness and competence with the aplomb of an expert actor. By tapping into extensive knowledge of where to play for each hitter with what the pitcher was going to throw, he recognized where to position himself accordingly. He understood how to read the path and angle of the ball and anticipate how it would ricochet off the wall. His arm strength and accuracy often made it intimidating for baserunners to seize extra bases. Adept at mimicking catching long fly balls and line drives that he was actually unable to apprehend, he often fooled hitters into settling for singles when they could have taken extra bases.<ref name=gwynn082002/>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n===Impact on baseball in Canada===\nAlthough Walker was not the first Canadian to become a star player in the major leagues, his influence in Canada and native British Columbia is far-reaching. \"He was the standard for the height of baseball in Canada,\" commented [[Jeff Francis]], a former major league pitcher from [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]], Vancouver. \"If you went to a provincial championship, his picture was on your T-shirt. Or if you went to play in Maple Ridge, you were playing at Larry Walker Field. The fact that he played for the Montreal Expos helped, too, so even people who weren't baseball fans knew who he was.

All nine ahead of him are in the National Hall of Fame, and eight of nine played at least 2,400 games, compared to Walker's 1,988. There are 24 right fielders in the Hall of Fame.

Never having to permanently move off the position, he made significant contribution there every season of his career, while at times covering for significant stretches at first base (1991 and 1994), center field (1996) and left field (2000). He ranks 17th in games played in right field, with 1,718, 18th in assists (150), tenth in double plays turned (40), eighth in defensive zone runs (100), and 29th in fielding percentage (.986).

former professional [[baseball]] [[right fielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). During his 17-year career, he played with the [[Montreal Expos]], [[Colorado Rockies]], and [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. In 1997, he became the only player in major league history to register both a .700 [[slugging percentage]] (SLG) and 30 [[stolen bases]] in the same season, on his way to winning the [[National League]] (NL) [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] (MVP). The first player in more than 60 years to record a [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .360 in three consecutive seasons from 1997 to 1999, Walker also won three NL [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting championships]]. He was inducted into [[Canada's Sports Hall of Fame]] in 2007, and the [[Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame]] in the Class of 2009,  and was named the 13th-greatest sporting figure from Canada by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' in 1999. In [[2020 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2020]], he was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]].\n\nWidely considered a [[Glossary of baseball (0\u20139)#5-tool player|five-tool talent]] of prodigious athleticism and instincts, Walker hit for both average and [[Power hitter|power]], combined with well above-average [[Base runner|speed]], [[Defense (sports)|defense]] and throwing strength and accuracy. He was recognized as the top Canadian athlete in 1998 with the [[Lou Marsh Trophy]]. Other honors include five [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]] selections, seven [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Awards]], three [[Silver Slugger Award|Silver Slugger Awards]], and nine [[Tip O'Neill Award]]s. His career SLG of .565 [[List of Major League Baseball career slugging percentage leaders|ranks 12th all time]]. Walker is one of only 19 hitters in history to accomplish a .300 batting average, .400 [[on-base percentage]] (OBP), and .500 SLG with at least 5,000 [[plate appearance]]s, and one of six whose careers began after 1960. Considering advanced [[Sabermetrics|metrics]], he is one of only three players in history to rank within the top 100 of each of batting runs, base-running runs, and [[Defensive Runs Saved|defensive runs saved]]; the others are [[Barry Bonds]] and [[Willie Mays]].\n\nRaised in the [[Greater Vancouver]] area of [[British Columbia]], Walker spent his youth playing [[street hockey]] with consuming [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[goaltender]] aspirations. That dream never materialized; however, the Expos saw his baseball potential and signed him in 1984. By 1990, Walker became their starting right fielder, propelling them to the majors' best record in 1994 when [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|that year's strike]] stopped their first serious [[World Series]] run. He signed with the Rockies as a [[free agent]] following the season, and, during a six-year period starting in 1997, was the major league batting leader three times while finishing second in the NL twice. In 1997, he also led the league in home runs, OBP, SLG, while joining the [[30\u201330 club]], registering 12 outfield [[Assist (baseball)|assists]] and leading his position with four [[double play]]s turned.\n\nDesiring a trade to a contending team, the Rockies sent Walker to St. Louis in the middle of their 105-win season of 2004 where he made his first [[2004 World Series|World Series]] appearance while tying or setting three Cardinals postseason records. He announced his retirement from playing baseball after Game 6 of the [[2005 National League Championship Series]]. Following his playing career, Walker has served as a guest instructor for the Cardinals, and, since 2009, has [[Coach (baseball)|coached]] the [[Canada national baseball team|Canadian national team]]. In that time, Team Canada has competed in three [[World Baseball Classic]] (WBC) tournaments, and twice at the [[Baseball at the Pan American Games|Pan American Games]], winning consecutive [[gold medal]]s in 2011 and 2015.\n\n==Early life and amateur career==\n\n{{quote box\n|width=24%\n|align=right\n|quote=I'm just thrilled to have kids come up to me and tell me my son is their idol.

Larry, Jr., was the youngest of four boys, Barry, Carey and Gary. The five men often played together in a [[fastpitch softball]] league, frequently all in the same starting lineup. Walker grew up passing much of his free time playing [[street hockey]], especially as part of a group of boys in the backyard and driveway of another boy named Rick Herbert. In that group was future [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r [[Cam Neely]], who became one of Walker's close friends. Walker dreamed of a career in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) as a [[goaltender]], only casually playing an occasional [[baseball]] game during the summer.

Famously distinguished as \"the accidental ballplayer\" by a ''Sports Illustrated'' article in 1993, he displayed all skills of the ideal five-tool player. The transition was a feat even more impressive considering he only began playing organized baseball after graduating high school and did not attend college,<ref name=montville040593/> and maintained staggering productivity over the course of his career in spite of myriad injuries. Baseball-Reference's advanced metrics of the three major areas of the game (excluding pitching) \u2212batting, baserunning and fielding\u2212, echo a multitude of observations of Walker's overall excellence.<ref name=montville040593/><ref name=hill081086/><ref name=walkerbrefmain/><ref name=gwynn082002/> He produced 420 runs above average in batting, or batting runs (Rbat), 94 fielding runs (Rfield), 40 baserunning runs (Rbase), and 10 runs above average avoiding grounding into [[double play]]s (Rdp). In every season following his short debut campaign of 1989, his adjusted OPS+ graded at minimum at 110; in just four seasons did he rate below average in fielding runs and twice in baserunning runs.<ref name=walkerbrefmain/>\n\nPer a profile of Walker's batting technique in ''Lau's Laws on Hitting'', he met all checkpoints on the list of absolutes for a complete swing that would generate the greatest possible success as prescribed by former hitting coach [[Charley Lau]]. Overall, Walker produced \"a beautiful, one-piece swing.\" Highlights included \"an exceptionally balanced stance,\" \"excellent weight transfer\" and \"admirable ... hip rotation.\" All energy transferred to the ball in an explosion upon impact with the bat. The authors assert that due to this balance, he was able to post excellent numbers in Montreal before playing for Colorado.<ref name=lau2000-174>[[#lau2000|Lau, Jr., and Flanagan 2000]]: 174</ref>\n\nRival right fielder and long-time San Diego Padre Tony Gwynn epitomized Walker as \"the most complete player in the National League,\" and \"best baserunner in the game\" in a 2002 profile for ESPN. He observed that, in addition to his obvious athletic gifts, Walker approaches the game very cerebrally and is always thinking ahead, unearthing a wide array of advantages that he applied to the game.<ref name=gwynn082002/> Said one sportswriter, \"His hand-eye co-ordination was off the charts, and his instincts as an outfielder and baserunner were unmatched.\"<ref>{{cite newspaper |last=Griffin |first= |url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/sports/1430590-griffin-hall-of-fame-case-for-clemens-bonds-isnt-too-hard-to-make |title=Hall of Fame case for Clemens, Bonds isn't too hard to make |work=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |date=January 9, 2017 |accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> To ''[[Denver Post]]'' sports writer Tony Renck, \"Walker is the most talented player I have ever covered.

Most talented player I've ever had.\" Former manager [[Bobby Cox]] remarked, \"He's better than one of the best. He is the best.\"<ref name=hoffer061101/>\n\nOn defense, Walker combined uncanny awareness and competence with the aplomb of an expert actor. By tapping into extensive knowledge of where to play for each hitter with what the pitcher was going to throw, he recognized where to position himself accordingly. He understood how to read the path and angle of the ball and anticipate how it would ricochet off the wall. His arm strength and accuracy often made it intimidating for baserunners to seize extra bases. Adept at mimicking catching long fly balls and line drives that he was actually unable to apprehend, he often fooled hitters into settling for singles when they could have taken extra bases.<ref name=gwynn082002/>\n\n==Post-playing career==\n===Impact on baseball in Canada===\nAlthough Walker was not the first Canadian to become a star player in the major leagues, his influence in Canada and native British Columbia is far-reaching. \"He was the standard for the height of baseball in Canada,\" commented [[Jeff Francis]], a former major league pitcher from [[North Delta, British Columbia|North Delta]], Vancouver. \"If you went to a provincial championship, his picture was on your T-shirt. Or if you went to play in Maple Ridge, you were playing at Larry Walker Field. The fact that he played for the Montreal Expos helped, too, so even people who weren't baseball fans knew who he was.
