At the [[Battle of Rocky Face Ridge]], the 21st joined in the flanking maneuver that forced the Confederates to abandon their position and fall back toward Resaca.  At the [[Battle of Resaca]], the 21st was again engaged in heavy fighting, as their brigade was ordered to assault the enemy fortifications.  A few days later, at the [[Battle of Dallas]], the regiment held a defensive position under heavy fire for six days.  They received the compliments of their brigade commander, General [[William Carlin]], for their fortitude and gallantry.\n\nThe 21st, with its brigade, pursued retreating Confederate forces, engaging them in skirmishes near [[Big Shanty]]. They drove a North Carolina regiment from their position, taking captives, and moved into position before Kennesaw Mountain.  The regiment received severe bombardment during the [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain]], but held their ground until Sherman's flanking maneuver forced the enemy to abandon their position.  After Kennesaw, Lt. Col. Hobart was assigned to command three regiments of the first Brigade, and Major Michael H. Fitch was assigned to replace him as commander of the 21st Regiment.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Jonesborough]], Hobart and the 21st camped at [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] in September 1864.

Hobart's brigade led the advance out of [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] and encountered the enemy, skirmishing with them at the [[Battle of Averasborough]], and then confronting the Confederate counterattack at the [[Battle of Bentonville]].  Hobart was conspicuous at Bentonville, leading three regiments of his brigade in repelling the enemy attack.  This was their last significant fighting of the war.  Hobart's brigade reached [[Goldsboro, North Carolina]], on March 23rd, and was the first unit to enter [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], on April 13.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondwi.com/wisconsinregiments/21st_wisconsin_regimental_histor.htm |title= 21st Wisconsin |accessdate= April 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHobart and his brigade remained in Raleigh until the announcement of the end of the war.
