Mollings). With decades in the industry and a plethora of accolades under their belt, they cover a vast array of genres in the music industry. When DJ Nasty is not touring with the likes of [[Jay-Z]], [[Beyonce]], [[DJ Khaled]] or [[Fat Joe]], he is a DJ at the biggest celebrity parties and on the radio in [[Orlando]]. LVM is a well-trained musician who has toured with [[Snap!|SNAP]] & [[Backstreet Boys]] & has played guitar on [[DJ Khaled]]'s [[Wild Thoughts]]. LVM and DJ Nasty also produced DJ Khaled's [[All I Do is Win]] and [[Wild Thoughts]] along with being a part of a list of other songs from other top musicians, including DJ Khaled, [[Lil Wayne]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Plies (rapper)|Plies]], [[Ludacris]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Flo Rida]], [[Rick Ross (rapper)|Rick Ross]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[8Ball & MJG]], [[Juelz Santana]], [[Cam'Ron]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] and [[Chingy]]. Their major influences in producing come from [[The Neptunes]], [[Pete Rock]], [[The Runners]], and [[Dr. Dre]].\n\nContinuing to produce and having an influence on today's latest music, the duo takes time to mentor artists and up and coming producers in the industry. They have also showcased their creative juices into other ventures in the music industry and beyond. With a unique mix of live guitar strings being played by LVM while his brother DJ Nasty mixes at the DJ Booth, the duo has performed live on many occasions for fans and partners.  \n\nThrough the years some of Hip Hops biggest songs have come from the duo with favorites over the years such as [[Lil Wayne]]'s \"[[I'm Me]]\", [[Plies (rapper)|Plies]]'s \"#1 Fan\", featuring [[J. Holiday]] and [[Keyshia Cole]] and their Grammy Produced [[Ludacris]]'s \"[[Grew Up A Screw Up]]\", featuring [[Young Jeezy]], \n\n==History==\n===Early life and career beginnings===\nDJ Nasty and LVM were both born in [[Cuba]], and came to the United States in 1988 due to their father being in the [[United States Navy|Navy]]; he \"wanted a change in scenery\", states Nasty.  DJ Nasty early on met [[DJ Khaled]] and another associate named Ceaser and started Hitmen Productions. They were doing local house parties and renting out halls, and soon started to make a big name for themselves in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]]. The group eventually broke up due to [[DJ Khaled]] moving to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], with his parents because they owned a clothing store there. Today, Khaled and Ceaser are still good friends with Nasty. DJ Nasty & DJ Khaled have a management company \"We The Best Management\" which houses the super producers [[The Runners]].\n\nDJ Nasty's first track was actually [[Krayzie Bone]]'s \"Thug Alwayz\" on Krayzie's ''[[Thug Mentality 1999]]'' (1999). But DJ Nasty is not too fond of that record, and actually considers the beat he did for [[Fat Joe]] \"The Wild Life\" to be his true first track. LVM started out doing a record for [[95 South]] called \"Cheer For Me\" which can be heard on the ''Bring It On'' soundtrack, as well as numerous remixes for the likes of [[Jordan Knight]] and [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. LVM dabbled in the pop market producing \"Baby Be Mine\" for pop group [[LFO (American band)|LFO]].\n\nSuccess started to take off when DJ Nasty befriended [[Disturbing tha Peace|DTP]]'s Co-CEO Chaka Zulu and landed a few placements with [[Ludacris]] in 2003 for his ''[[Chicken-n-Beer]]'' album's \"Southern Fried Intro\".\n\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

It is the second largest [[single-payer healthcare]] system in the world, losing only to the Brazilian [[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]. Primarily funded by the government from general taxation (plus a small amount from [[National Insurance]] contributions), and overseen by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], the NHS provides [[healthcare]] to all legal English residents and residents from other regions of the UK, with most services free at the point of use. Some services, such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases, are free for everyone, including visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68 |title=Am I entitled to NHS treatment when I visit England? |work=www.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\nFree healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service. The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in 1948. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e., in possession of an [[NHS number]]), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example [[eye test]]s, [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[Prescription charges|prescriptions]] and aspects of [[long-term care]]. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/dentist/nhs-private-prices.html |title=UK Dentist Prices \u2013 Compare NHS and Private Dental Treatment Costs |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/health/optician-prices.html |title=Optician and Eye Care Prices \u2013 Compare the Cost of Eye Tests |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[long-term care|long-term healthcare]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]. The [[National Health Service Act 1946]] came into effect on 5 July 1948. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance: it is used by about 8% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services.\n\nThe NHS is largely funded from general taxation, with a small amount being contributed by [[National Insurance]] payments<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/nhs/10542622/The-awkward-truth-about-funding-the-NHS.html</ref> and from fees levied in accordance with recent changes in the [[Immigration Act 2014]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-health-surcharge-information-for-migrants |title=Immigration health surcharge: information for migrants |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref> The UK government department responsible for the NHS is the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], headed by the [[Secretary of State for Health and Social Care]]. On 9 January 2018, the Department of Health was renamed the Department of Health and Social Care. The Department of Health had a \u00a3110 billion budget in 2013\u201314, most of this being spent on the NHS.\n\n== Organisation ==\nThe NHS was established within the differing nations of the United Kingdom through differing legislation, and such there has never been a singular British healthcare system, instead there are 4 health services in the United Kingdom; NHS England, the [[NHS Scotland]], [[Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland|HSC Northern Ireland]] and [[NHS Wales]], which were run by the respective UK government ministries for each home nation before falling under the control of devolved governments in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/nhswalesaboutus/historycontext |title= NHS Wales \u2013 About Us: History & Context |publisher=NHS Wales |accessdate=3 August 2014|date= 2006-10-23 }}</ref>  In 2009, NHS England agreed to a formal [[NHS Constitution for England|NHS constitution]], which sets out the legal rights and responsibilities of the NHS, its staff, and users of the service, and makes additional non-binding pledges regarding many key aspects of its operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_093419 |title=NHS Constitution for England.

Starting in April 2013, [[Primary Care Trust]]s (PCTs) began to be replaced by General Practitioner (GP)-led organisations called [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s (CCGs).

In reality, the provision of NHS services by private companies long precedes this legislation, but there are concerns that the new role of the healthcare regulator ('Monitor') could lead to increased use of private sector competition, balancing care options between private companies, charities, and NHS organisations.<ref name=\"The changing NHS\" /> NHS Trusts responded to the [[Nicholson challenge]]\u2014which involved making \u00a320 billion in savings across the service by 2015.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the National Health Service (England)}}\n[[File:Aneurin Bevan and his wife Jenny Lee in Corwen (15368872658).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aneurin Bevan]].

Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.<ref>R. Samuel, \"North and South,\" ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3-6.</ref>\n\nA national [[health]] service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The [[Emergency Hospital Service]] established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Thatcherism]] represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the [[post-war consensus]], wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"<ref>Rudolf Klein, \"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\" ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41-58.

At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles:\n* That it meet the needs of everyone\n* That it be free at the point of delivery\n* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\n\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain.

PCTs disbursed funds to them on an agreed tariff or contract basis, on guidelines set out by the Department of Health. The PCTs budget from the Department of Health was calculated on a formula basis relating to population and specific local needs. They were supposed to \"break even\" - that is, not show a deficit on their budgets at the end of the financial year. Failure to meet financial objectives could result in the dismissal and replacement of a Trust's Board of Directors, although such dismissals are enormously expensive for the NHS.<ref>{{cite web | title=Anger over C difficile payoff | publisher=Health Service Journal | url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/anger-over-c-difficile-pay-off/538529.article | date=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2013 a new system was established as a result of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].  The NHS budget is largely in the hands of a new body, NHS England.  NHS England commission specialist services and primary care.  Acute services and community care is commissioned by local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s led by GPs.\n\n=== Free services and contributory services ===\n\n==== Services free at the point of use ====\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing,  reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having [[ordinary resident status]]. See [[National Health Service Eligibility for treatment]].\n\n==== Prescription charges ====\n\n{{As of|2019|May}} the NHS prescription charge in England was \u00a39 for each quantity of medicine<ref>{{NHS Web Site|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs|title=NHS charges|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> (which contrasts with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Prescription costs scrapped in Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8598011.stm|accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> where items prescribed on the NHS are free). People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from paying. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity. The charge is the same regardless of the actual cost of the medicine, but higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority. For more details of prescription charges, see [[Prescription charges]].\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the [[NHS Primary Care Trust|PCTs]], whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the fixed prescription charge. This has led to disputes whether some expensive drugs (e.g., [[Herceptin]]) should be prescribed by the NHS.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Herceptin judgement|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4684852.stm|accessdate=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== NHS dentistry ====\n{{Main|NHS dentistry}}\n\nWhere available, NHS dentistry charges {{As of|2017|April|lc=on}} were: \u00a320.60 for an examination; \u00a356.30 for a filling or extraction; and \u00a3244.30 for more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Help with dental charges - Health Costs | publisher = NHS Choices | url = http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcosts/pages/Dentalcosts.aspx | accessdate = 8 April 2015 }}</ref> As of 2007, less than half of dentists' income came from treating patients under NHS coverage; about 52% of dentists' income was from treating private patients.<ref>{{cite news | title = Call for dentists' NHS-work quota &#124; BBC| date =  3 June 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6711379.stm | work=BBC News | accessdate=19 May 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle}}</ref>  Some people needing NHS dental care are unable to get it.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41113507 'We couldn't see an NHS dentist so we pulled out our own teeth'] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n==== NHS Optical Services ====\n{{main|Eye care in the United Kingdom}}\nFrom 1 April 2007 the NHS Sight Test Fee (in England) was \u00a319.32, and there were 13.1 million NHS sight tests carried out in the UK.\n\nFor those who qualify through need, the sight test is free, and a voucher system is employed to pay for or reduce the cost of lenses.  There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items.  For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\n==== Injury cost recovery scheme ====\nUnder older legislation (mainly the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]]) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to \u00a325 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as ''Road Traffic Act insurance'' when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers.

This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.<!--\n  --><ref>{{cite book | author=Manfred Davidmann| title=Reorganising the National Health Service: An Evaluation of the Griffiths Report | edition=Second | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-85192-046-7 | url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/nhs.html | publisher=Social Organisation | location=Stanmore}}</ref>\nThis recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional \u00a3101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two [[white paper]]s ''Working for Patients'' and ''Caring for People'' were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ''internal market'', which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.  Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients.  The \"providers\" became [[NHS trust|independent trusts]], which encouraged competition but also increased [[Postcode lottery|local differences]]. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = NHS competition 'costs lives'\n| accessdate = 10 May 2008\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2701899.stm\n| date=29 January 2003\n| publisher=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes under the Blair government ===\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Opposition to what was claimed to be the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] intention to [[privatise]] the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \"internal market\" and abolish fundholding.  However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See [[NHS Wales]] and [[NHS Scotland]] for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed [[Standards for Better Health|service standards]], strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous [[clinical governance|clinical]] and [[corporate governance]].  Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including [[NHS Direct]]. The [[Agenda for Change]] agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression.  These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The [[British Medical Association]] in a 2009 document on [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre]]s (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.<ref name=BMAonISTCs>{{cite web|url=http://lookafterournhs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/independent-sector-treatment-centres-01062.pdf |title=BMA document on ISTCs |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the [[Private Finance Initiative]], an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services such as ISTCs<ref>{{cite web | title = New generation surgery-centres to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=3 December 2002 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 15 September 2006}}</ref> and non-medical services such as catering provided under long-term contracts by the private sector. A study by a consultancy company for the Department of Health shows that every \u00a3200 million spent on privately financed hospitals will result in the loss of 1000 doctors and nurses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The first PFI hospitals contain some 28 per cent fewer beds than the ones they replaced.<ref>{{cite web | author=George Monbiot | title=Private Affluence, Public Rip-Off |date=10 March 2002 | url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/03/10/private-affluence-public-rip-off/ | accessdate = 7 September 2006 | publisher = [[The Spectator]]| author-link=George Monbiot }}</ref>\n\nThe NHS was also required to take on pro-active socially \"directive\" policies, for example, in respect of [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[obesity]].\n\n=== Information technology ===\nIn the 1980s and 90s, NHS IT spent money on several failed IT projects. The Wessex project, in the 1980s, attempted to standardise IT systems across a regional health authority. The [[London Ambulance Service]] was to be a computer-aided dispatch system. [[Read code]] was an attempt to develop a new electronic language of health,<ref name=\"gamble\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/apr/25/epublic.technology|title=Blair's \u00a340bn gamble on IT|date=25 April 2002|accessdate=19 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Staff|first1=Guardian}}</ref> later scheduled to be replaced by [[SNOMED CT]].\n\nThe [[NHS Information Authority]] (NHSIA) was established by an Act of Parliament in 1999 with the goal to bring together four NHS IT and Information bodies (NHS Telecoms, Family Health Service (FHS), NHS Centre for Coding and Classification (CCC) and NHS Information Management Group (IMG)) to work together to deliver IT infrastructure and information solutions to the NHS in England. A 2002 plan was for NHSIA to implement four national IT projects: Basic infrastructure, Electronic records, Electronic prescribing, and Electronic booking, modelled after the large [[NHS Direct]] tele-nurse and healthcare website program.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> The NHSIA functions were divided into other organisations by April 2005.\n\nIn 2002, the [[NHS Connecting for Health|NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) was announced by the Department of Health.  It was widely seen as a failure, and blamed for delaying the implementation of IT in the service.  Even in 2020 it appeared most of the 1.38 million NHS computers were still using [[Windows 7]], which was released in 2009, and additional support had to be arranged by [[Microsoft]] until 14 January 2021 before the migration to Windows 10 could be completed.

[[Public Health England]] (PHE) wants all hospitals to help smokers quit.  One in thirteen smoking patients was referred to a hospital or community based cessation programme.  Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop.  Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation.  Smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement.  There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit.  Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently.  PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses.  Frank Ryan, psychologist said, \"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit.  And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39094713|title=NHS 'tobacco free' campaign launched by Public Health England|date=26 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>  The numbers of smokers getting help to quit has fallen due to cuts in funding for smoking cessation care though the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends such help.

It is the second largest [[single-payer healthcare]] system in the world, losing only to the Brazilian [[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]. Primarily funded by the government from general taxation (plus a small amount from [[National Insurance]] contributions), and overseen by the [[Department of Health and Social Care]], the NHS provides [[healthcare]] to all legal English residents and residents from other regions of the UK, with most services free at the point of use. Some services, such as emergency treatment and treatment of infectious diseases, are free for everyone, including visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1086.aspx?categoryid=68 |title=Am I entitled to NHS treatment when I visit England? |work=www.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\nFree healthcare at the point of use comes from the core principles at the founding of the National Health Service. The 1942 Beveridge cross party report established the principles of the NHS which was implemented by the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in 1948. In practice, \"free at the point of use\" normally means that anyone legitimately and fully registered with the system (i.e., in possession of an [[NHS number]]), available to legal UK residents regardless of nationality (but not non-resident British citizens), can access the full breadth of critical and non-critical medical care, without payment except for some specific NHS services, for example [[eye test]]s, [[Dentistry|dental care]], [[Prescription charges|prescriptions]] and aspects of [[long-term care]]. These charges are usually lower than equivalent services provided by a private provider and many are free to vulnerable or low-income patients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/dentist/nhs-private-prices.html |title=UK Dentist Prices \u2013 Compare NHS and Private Dental Treatment Costs |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whatprice.co.uk/health/optician-prices.html |title=Optician and Eye Care Prices \u2013 Compare the Cost of Eye Tests |accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS provides the majority of healthcare in England, including [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[long-term care|long-term healthcare]], [[ophthalmology]] and [[dentistry]]. The [[National Health Service Act 1946]] came into effect on 5 July 1948.

Cronin]]'s controversial novel ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'', published in 1937, had fomented extensive debate about the severe inadequacies of healthcare. The author's innovative ideas were not only essential to the conception of the NHS, but in fact, his best-selling novels are said to have greatly contributed to the Labour Party's victory in 1945.<ref>R. Samuel, \"North and South,\" ''London Review of Books'' 17.12 (22 June 1995): 3-6.</ref>\n\nA national [[health]] service was one of the fundamental assumptions in the [[Beveridge Report]]. The [[Emergency Hospital Service]] established in 1939 gave a taste of what a National Health Service might look like.\n\nHealthcare prior to the war had been an unsatisfactory mix of private, municipal and charity schemes. Bevan decided that the way forward was a national system rather than a system operated by local authorities. He proposed that each resident of the UK would be signed up to a specific [[General practitioner|General Practice]] (GP) as the point of entry into the system, building on the foundations laid in 1912 by the introduction of [[National Insurance]] and the list system for general practice. Patients would have access to all medical, dental and nursing care they needed without having to pay for it at the time.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Thatcherism]] represented a systematic, decisive rejection and reversal of the [[post-war consensus]], wherein the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of [[Keynesianism]], the welfare state, the mixed economy, supplies both of public and private housing, and close regulation of the economy. There was one major exception: the National Health Service, which was widely popular and had wide support inside the Conservative Party. In 1982, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised Britons that the NHS is \"safe in our hands.\"<ref>Rudolf Klein, \"Why Britain's conservatives support a socialist health care system.\" ''Health Affairs'' 4#1 (1985): 41-58.

At its launch by the then minister of health, Aneurin Bevan, on 5 July 1948, it had at its heart three core principles:\n* That it meet the needs of everyone\n* That it be free at the point of delivery\n* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay\n\nThese three principles have guided the development of the NHS over more than half a century and remain.

PCTs disbursed funds to them on an agreed tariff or contract basis, on guidelines set out by the Department of Health. The PCTs budget from the Department of Health was calculated on a formula basis relating to population and specific local needs. They were supposed to \"break even\" - that is, not show a deficit on their budgets at the end of the financial year. Failure to meet financial objectives could result in the dismissal and replacement of a Trust's Board of Directors, although such dismissals are enormously expensive for the NHS.<ref>{{cite web | title=Anger over C difficile payoff | publisher=Health Service Journal | url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/home/anger-over-c-difficile-pay-off/538529.article | date=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom April 2013 a new system was established as a result of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].  The NHS budget is largely in the hands of a new body, NHS England.  NHS England commission specialist services and primary care.  Acute services and community care is commissioned by local [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s led by GPs.\n\n=== Free services and contributory services ===\n\n==== Services free at the point of use ====\n\nThe vast majority of NHS services are free at the point of use.\n\nThis means that people generally do not pay anything for their doctor visits, nursing services, surgical procedures or appliances, consumables such as medications and bandages, plasters, medical tests, and investigations, x-rays, CT or MRI scans or other diagnostic services. Hospital inpatient and outpatient services are free, both medical and mental health services. Funding for these services is provided through general taxation and not a specific tax.\n\nBecause the NHS is not funded by contributory insurance scheme in the ordinary sense and most patients pay nothing for their treatment there is thus no billing to the treated person nor to any insurer or sickness fund as is common in many other countries. This saves hugely on administration costs that might otherwise involve complex consumable tracking and usage procedures at the patient level and concomitant invoicing,  reconciliation and bad debt processing.\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n\nEligibility for NHS services is based on having [[ordinary resident status]]. See [[National Health Service Eligibility for treatment]].\n\n==== Prescription charges ====\n\n{{As of|2019|May}} the NHS prescription charge in England was \u00a39 for each quantity of medicine<ref>{{NHS Web Site|url=https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/help-nhs-prescription-costs|title=NHS charges|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 July 2019}}</ref> (which contrasts with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland<ref>{{cite news|title=Prescription costs scrapped in Northern Ireland|publisher=BBC News|date=1 April 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8598011.stm|accessdate= 6 August 2010}}</ref> where items prescribed on the NHS are free). People over sixty, children under sixteen (or under nineteen if in full-time education), patients with certain medical conditions, and those with low incomes, are exempt from paying. Those who require repeated prescriptions may purchase a single-charge pre-payment certificate that allows unlimited prescriptions during its period of validity. The charge is the same regardless of the actual cost of the medicine, but higher charges apply to medical appliances. Pharmacies or other dispensing contractors are reimbursed for the cost of the medicines through NHS Prescription Services, a division of the NHS Business Services Authority. For more details of prescription charges, see [[Prescription charges]].\n\nThe high and rising costs of some medicines, especially some types of cancer treatment, means that prescriptions can present a heavy burden to the [[NHS Primary Care Trust|PCTs]], whose limited budgets include responsibility for the difference between medicine costs and the fixed prescription charge. This has led to disputes whether some expensive drugs (e.g., [[Herceptin]]) should be prescribed by the NHS.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Herceptin judgement|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4684852.stm|accessdate=15 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== NHS dentistry ====\n{{Main|NHS dentistry}}\n\nWhere available, NHS dentistry charges {{As of|2017|April|lc=on}} were: \u00a320.60 for an examination; \u00a356.30 for a filling or extraction; and \u00a3244.30 for more complex procedures such as crowns, dentures or bridges.<ref>{{cite web | title = Help with dental charges - Health Costs | publisher = NHS Choices | url = http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/Healthcosts/pages/Dentalcosts.aspx | accessdate = 8 April 2015 }}</ref> As of 2007, less than half of dentists' income came from treating patients under NHS coverage; about 52% of dentists' income was from treating private patients.<ref>{{cite news | title = Call for dentists' NHS-work quota &#124; BBC| date =  3 June 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6711379.stm | work=BBC News | accessdate=19 May 2010 | first=Nick | last=Triggle}}</ref>  Some people needing NHS dental care are unable to get it.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41113507 'We couldn't see an NHS dentist so we pulled out our own teeth'] ''[[BBC]]''</ref>\n\n==== NHS Optical Services ====\n{{main|Eye care in the United Kingdom}}\nFrom 1 April 2007 the NHS Sight Test Fee (in England) was \u00a319.32, and there were 13.1 million NHS sight tests carried out in the UK.\n\nFor those who qualify through need, the sight test is free, and a voucher system is employed to pay for or reduce the cost of lenses.  There is a free spectacles frame and most opticians keep a selection of low-cost items.  For those who already receive certain means-tested benefits, or who otherwise qualify, participating opticians use tables to find the amount of the subsidy.\n\n==== Injury cost recovery scheme ====\nUnder older legislation (mainly the [[Road Traffic Act 1930]]) a hospital treating the victims of a road traffic accident was entitled to limited compensation (under the 1930 Act before any amendment, up to \u00a325 per person treated) from the insurers of driver(s) of the vehicle(s) involved, but were not compelled to do so and often did not do so; the charge was in turn covered by the then legally required element of those drivers' motor vehicle insurance (commonly known as ''Road Traffic Act insurance'' when a driver held only that amount of insurance). As the initial bill went to the driver rather than the insurer, even when a charge was imposed it was often not passed on to the liable insurer. It was common to take no further action in such cases, as there was no practical financial incentive (and often a financial disincentive due to potential legal costs) for individual hospitals to do so.\n\nThe Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a standard national scheme for recovery of costs using a tariff based on a single charge for out-patient treatment or a daily charge for in-patient treatment; these charges again ultimately fell upon insurers.

This was outlined in the Griffiths Report of 1983.<!--\n  --><ref>{{cite book | author=Manfred Davidmann| title=Reorganising the National Health Service: An Evaluation of the Griffiths Report | edition=Second | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-85192-046-7 | url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/nhs.html | publisher=Social Organisation | location=Stanmore}}</ref>\nThis recommended the appointment of general managers in the NHS with whom responsibility should lie. The report also recommended that clinicians be better involved in management. Financial pressures continued to place strain on the NHS. In 1987, an additional \u00a3101 million was provided by the government to the NHS. In 1988 [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] announced a review of the NHS. From this review in 1989 two [[white paper]]s ''Working for Patients'' and ''Caring for People'' were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the ''internal market'', which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade.\n\nIn England, the [[National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990]] defined this \"internal market\", whereby health authorities ceased to run hospitals but \"purchased\" care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.  Certain GPs became \"fund holders\" and were able to purchase care for their patients.  The \"providers\" became [[NHS trust|independent trusts]], which encouraged competition but also increased [[Postcode lottery|local differences]]. Increasing competition may have been statistically associated with poor patient outcomes.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = NHS competition 'costs lives'\n| accessdate = 10 May 2008\n| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2701899.stm\n| date=29 January 2003\n| publisher=BBC News\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Changes under the Blair government ===\n\nThese innovations, especially the \"fund holder\" option, were condemned at the time by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Opposition to what was claimed to be the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] intention to [[privatise]] the NHS became a major feature of Labour's election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLabour came to power in 1997 with the promise to remove the \"internal market\" and abolish fundholding.  However, in his second term Blair renounced this direction. He pursued measures to strengthen the internal market as part of his plan to \"modernise\" the NHS.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nA number of factors drove these reforms; they include the rising costs of medical technology and medicines, the desire to improve standards and \"patient choice\", an ageing population, and a desire to contain government expenditure. (Since the National Health Services in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are not controlled by the UK government, these reforms have increased the differences between the National Health Services in different parts of the United Kingdom. See [[NHS Wales]] and [[NHS Scotland]] for descriptions of their developments).\n\nReforms included (amongst other actions) the laying down of detailed [[Standards for Better Health|service standards]], strict financial budgeting, revised job specifications, reintroduction of \"fundholding\" (under the description \"practice-based commissioning\"), closure of surplus facilities and emphasis on rigorous [[clinical governance|clinical]] and [[corporate governance]].  Some new services were developed to help manage demand, including [[NHS Direct]]. The [[Agenda for Change]] agreement aimed to provide harmonised pay and career progression.  These changes have given rise to controversy within the medical professions, the news media and the public. The [[British Medical Association]] in a 2009 document on [[Independent Sector Treatment Centre]]s (ISTCs) urged the government to restore the NHS to a service based on public provision, not private ownership; co-operation, not competition; integration, not fragmentation; and public service, not private profits.<ref name=BMAonISTCs>{{cite web|url=http://lookafterournhs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/independent-sector-treatment-centres-01062.pdf |title=BMA document on ISTCs |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Tony Blair|Blair]] government, whilst leaving services free at point of use, encouraged outsourcing of medical services and support to the private sector. Under the [[Private Finance Initiative]], an increasing number of hospitals were built (or rebuilt) by private sector consortia; hospitals may have both medical services such as ISTCs<ref>{{cite web | title = New generation surgery-centres to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=3 December 2002 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 15 September 2006}}</ref> and non-medical services such as catering provided under long-term contracts by the private sector. A study by a consultancy company for the Department of Health shows that every \u00a3200 million spent on privately financed hospitals will result in the loss of 1000 doctors and nurses.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The first PFI hospitals contain some 28 per cent fewer beds than the ones they replaced.<ref>{{cite web | author=George Monbiot | title=Private Affluence, Public Rip-Off |date=10 March 2002 | url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2002/03/10/private-affluence-public-rip-off/ | accessdate = 7 September 2006 | publisher = [[The Spectator]]| author-link=George Monbiot }}</ref>\n\nThe NHS was also required to take on pro-active socially \"directive\" policies, for example, in respect of [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[obesity]].\n\n=== Information technology ===\nIn the 1980s and 90s, NHS IT spent money on several failed IT projects. The Wessex project, in the 1980s, attempted to standardise IT systems across a regional health authority. The [[London Ambulance Service]] was to be a computer-aided dispatch system. [[Read code]] was an attempt to develop a new electronic language of health,<ref name=\"gamble\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/apr/25/epublic.technology|title=Blair's \u00a340bn gamble on IT|date=25 April 2002|accessdate=19 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Staff|first1=Guardian}}</ref> later scheduled to be replaced by [[SNOMED CT]].\n\nThe [[NHS Information Authority]] (NHSIA) was established by an Act of Parliament in 1999 with the goal to bring together four NHS IT and Information bodies (NHS Telecoms, Family Health Service (FHS), NHS Centre for Coding and Classification (CCC) and NHS Information Management Group (IMG)) to work together to deliver IT infrastructure and information solutions to the NHS in England. A 2002 plan was for NHSIA to implement four national IT projects: Basic infrastructure, Electronic records, Electronic prescribing, and Electronic booking, modelled after the large [[NHS Direct]] tele-nurse and healthcare website program.<ref name=\"gamble\" /> The NHSIA functions were divided into other organisations by April 2005.\n\nIn 2002, the [[NHS Connecting for Health|NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) was announced by the Department of Health.  It was widely seen as a failure, and blamed for delaying the implementation of IT in the service.  Even in 2020 it appeared most of the 1.38 million NHS computers were still using [[Windows 7]], which was released in 2009, and additional support had to be arranged by [[Microsoft]] until 14 January 2021 before the migration to Windows 10 could be completed.

[[Public Health England]] (PHE) wants all hospitals to help smokers quit.  One in thirteen smoking patients was referred to a hospital or community based cessation programme.  Over a quarter of patients were not asked if they smoke and nearly three quarters of smokers were not asked if they wanted to stop.  Half of frontline hospital staff were offered no training in smoking cessation.  Smoking patients should be offered specialised help to stop and nicotine replacement.  There should be dedicated staff helping patients to quit.  Seven tenths of smokers say they want to stop and those offered help are four times more likely to stop permanently.  PHE claims smoking causes 96,000 deaths per year in England and twenty times the number of smoking related illnesses.  Frank Ryan, psychologist said, \"It's really about refocusing our efforts and motivating our service users and staff to quit.  And of course, whatever investment we make in smoking cessation programmes, there's a payback many times more in terms of the health benefits and even factors such as attendance at work, because it's workers who smoke [who] tend to have more absent spells from work.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-39094713|title=NHS 'tobacco free' campaign launched by Public Health England|date=26 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>  The numbers of smokers getting help to quit has fallen due to cuts in funding for smoking cessation care though the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] recommends such help.

Independent accreditation groups exist within the UK, such as the public sector [[Trent Accreditation Scheme]] and the private sector CHKS.\n\nWith respect to assessing, maintaining and improving the quality of healthcare, in common with many other developed countries, the UK government has separated the roles of suppliers of healthcare and assessors of the quality of its delivery.  Quality is assessed by independent bodies such as the [[Healthcare Commission]] according to [[Standards for Better Health|standards]] set by the Department of Health and the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE).  Responsibility for assessing quality transferred to the [[Care Quality Commission]] in April 2009.\n\nA comparative analysis of health care systems in 2010 put the NHS second in a study of seven rich countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10375877|title=UK health system is top on \"efficiency\", says report|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=26 July 2010|publisher=BBC news}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Publications/Fund-Reports/2010/Jun/Mirror-Mirror-Update.aspx|title=Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: How the Performance of the U.S. Health Care System Compares Internationally, 2010 Update|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=26 July 2010|publisher=The Commonwealth fund}}</ref> The report put the UK health systems above those of Germany, Canada and the US; the NHS was deemed the most efficient among those health systems studied.\n\n700 hospital patients suffered harm in serious incidents due to treatment delays in part of 2015\u201316, 1,027 hospital patients suffered similar harm in 2016-17 and this rose to 1,515 in 2017\u201318.

They included data for the North East of England as an area more similar to the devolved areas than the rest of England. They found that there was little evidence that any one country was moving ahead of the others consistently across the available indicators of performance. There had been improvements in all four countries in life expectancy and in rates of mortality amenable to health care.  Despite the hotly contested policy differences between the four countries there was little evidence, where there was comparable data, of any significant differences in outcomes. The authors also complained about the increasingly limited set of comparable data on the four health systems of the UK.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bevan|first1=Gwyn|last2=Mays|first2=Nicholas|title=The four health systems of the UK: How do they compare?|url=http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/compare-UK-health|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=Nuffield Trust|date=11 April 2014}}</ref> Medical school places are set to increase by 25% from 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37546360|title=Student doctor numbers to rise by 25%|first=Nick|last=Triggle|date=4 October 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nA report from [[Public Health England]]\u2019s Neurology Intelligence Network based on hospital outpatient data for 2012\u201313 showed that there was significant variation in access to services by [[Clinical Commissioning Group]].
