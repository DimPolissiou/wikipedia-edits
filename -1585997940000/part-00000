After taking 1937 as a year away from the track, he acquired an [[Alta Car and Engineering Company|Alta]] and made a name for himself in English national racing during the 1938 and 1939 seasons. In 1939, he won the [[Imperial Trophy]] [[Formula Libre]] race at [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]], driving his Alta, defeating [[Birabongse Bhanudej|Prince Bira]], in the E.R.A. known as ''Romulus'', in a wet race,<ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1938, Page 388.</ref> \"that being the only time it was beaten by a {{cvt|1500|cc|abbr=on}} car in the British Isles.\"<ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1940, Page 202.</ref>\n\nAt one point, Abecassis held the Campbell circuit lap record at [[Brooklands]] at {{convert|72.61|mph|km/h}}<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1939, Page 135.</ref> On 3 July 1938 Abecassis broke the [[Prescott Speed Hill Climb|Prescott Hill Climb]] record with a climb of 47.85 seconds in his supercharged 1\u00bd-litre Alta.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1938, Page 246.</ref>\n\nWhen [[World War II]] broke out he joined the [[Royal Air Force]], as a member of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve|Volunteer Reserves]], and became an experienced pilot, ultimately becoming a member of the secret \"Moon Squadrons\",<ref name=gp>{{cite web|title= Drivers: George Abecassis |url= http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-abageo.html |work= GrandPrix.com |accessdate=26 November 2007}}</ref> ferrying secret agents in and out of occupied countries in Europe with specially-modified Halifax and Stirling aircraft.

He won a race at [[Gransden Lodge Airfield|Gransden Lodge]] in a road-going 3.3-litre [[Bugatti]] on 15 June 1946.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1946, Page 143.</ref> In 1947, Abecassis finished second in the Swedish Grand Prix, held on a frozen lake at Vallentuna, driving an E.R.A.<ref>''Motor Sport'', April 1947, Page 98.</ref>  In 1948, he finished second to [[Bob Gerard]] in the Jersey International Road Race.<ref>''Motor Sport'', June 1948, cover.</ref> He became a partner, with [[John Heath (racing driver)|John Heath]], in [[Hersham and Walton Motors]] Ltd., a motor dealership and garage in [[Walton-on-Thames]]. Building on his pre-war association with the Alta marque, Abecassis and HWM assisted in the development of the [[Alta GP]] car,<ref name=watn/> designed to comply with the recently introduced [[Formula One]] regulations.\n\nAfter the failure of this enterprise, Abecassis and Heath decided to construct their own cars under the HWM banner, but retaining Alta engines. Initially the HWM cars were designed to compete in the [[Formula Two]] class, but when the World Championship switched to Formula Two regulations in {{F1|1952}} HWM cars became eligible to compete in the Grand Prix events. During their prime, HWM employed such future stars as [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Peter Collins (racing driver)|Peter Collins]], and the Belgian [[Johnny Claes]] scored their first victory, in the [[Grand Prix des Fronti\u00e8res]] at a [[Chimay Street Circuit|street circuit]] in [[Chimay]], Belgium.<ref name=gp/> Abecassis's HWM team also took a notable victory in the [[BRDC International Trophy|International Trophy]] race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in 1952, this time with [[Lance Macklin]] at the wheel. With the reintroduction of Formula One cars to the World Championship in {{F1|1954}}, Abecassis and Heath attempted to produce a competitive car using the 2.5-litre version of the Alta engine but it was not a success;<ref name=gp/> HWM cars only contested two further Grand Prix events after 1953.\n\nIt was with his own HWM cars that Abecassis raced in his only two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, at the [[Circuit Bremgarten|Bremgarten]] circuit, in the [[1951 Swiss Grand Prix|1951]] and [[1952 Swiss Grand Prix]]. He was more successful as a sports car driver with [[Aston Martin]] and won his class at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in {{24hLM|1950}}, sharing his [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]] with Macklin. He also finished second in the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in 1953, partnered by [[Reg Parnell]]. In 1953, Abecassis constructed an HWM sports car for his own personal use, powered by a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] [[Straight-six engine|straight-6]] engine, with which he successfully contested many national British races until 1956.<ref name=autocourse>{{cite web|title=Driver: Abecassis, George |url=http://www.autocoursegpa.com/driver~driver_id~11549.htm |work=Autocourse Grand Prix Archive |accessdate=27 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221183618/http://www.autocoursegpa.com/driver~driver_id~11549.htm |archivedate=21 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Heath was killed in an accident in the [[Mille Miglia]] and Abecassis retired from racing, turning his attention to running the HWM operations. He was the [[Facel Vega]] importer for Britain, while his motor industry connections were aided by the fact that he was married to Angela, the daughter of Aston Martin chairman [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|Sir David Brown]]. He died aged 78, in [[Ibstone]], near [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]].\n\nIn September 2010 his son David Abecassis published a comprehensive biography of his father under the title ''A Passion for Speed''.\n\nHis grandson, Jonathan Abecassis, has an active interest in vintage sports car racing. He competes in the Fifties Sports Car Racing Club (\"FISCAR\") series, driving an [[Austin-Healey 100|Austin Healey 100/4]].\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career highlights===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

After taking 1937 as a year away from the track, he acquired an [[Alta Car and Engineering Company|Alta]] and made a name for himself in English national racing during the 1938 and 1939 seasons. In 1939, he won the [[Imperial Trophy]] [[Formula Libre]] race at [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]], driving his Alta, defeating [[Birabongse Bhanudej|Prince Bira]], in the E.R.A. known as ''Romulus'', in a wet race,<ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1938, Page 388.</ref> \"that being the only time it was beaten by a {{cvt|1500|cc|abbr=on}} car in the British Isles.\"<ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1940, Page 202.</ref>\n\nAt one point, Abecassis held the Campbell circuit lap record at [[Brooklands]] at {{convert|72.61|mph|km/h}}<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1939, Page 135.</ref> On 3 July 1938 Abecassis broke the [[Prescott Speed Hill Climb|Prescott Hill Climb]] record with a climb of 47.85 seconds in his supercharged 1\u00bd-litre Alta.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1938, Page 246.</ref>\n\nWhen [[World War II]] broke out he joined the [[Royal Air Force]], as a member of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve|Volunteer Reserves]], and became an experienced pilot, ultimately becoming a member of the secret \"Moon Squadrons\",<ref name=gp>{{cite web|title= Drivers: George Abecassis |url= http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-abageo.html |work= GrandPrix.com |accessdate=26 November 2007}}</ref> ferrying secret agents in and out of occupied countries in Europe with specially-modified Halifax and Stirling aircraft.

He won a race at [[Gransden Lodge Airfield|Gransden Lodge]] in a road-going 3.3-litre [[Bugatti]] on 15 June 1946.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1946, Page 143.</ref> In 1947, Abecassis finished second in the Swedish Grand Prix, held on a frozen lake at Vallentuna, driving an E.R.A.<ref>''Motor Sport'', April 1947, Page 98.</ref>  In 1948, he finished second to [[Bob Gerard]] in the Jersey International Road Race.<ref>''Motor Sport'', June 1948, cover.</ref> He became a partner, with [[John Heath (racing driver)|John Heath]], in [[Hersham and Walton Motors]] Ltd., a motor dealership and garage in [[Walton-on-Thames]]. Building on his pre-war association with the Alta marque, Abecassis and HWM assisted in the development of the [[Alta GP]] car,<ref name=watn/> designed to comply with the recently introduced [[Formula One]] regulations.\n\nAfter the failure of this enterprise, Abecassis and Heath decided to construct their own cars under the HWM banner, but retaining Alta engines. Initially the HWM cars were designed to compete in the [[Formula Two]] class, but when the World Championship switched to Formula Two regulations in {{F1|1952}} HWM cars became eligible to compete in the Grand Prix events. During their prime, HWM employed such future stars as [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Peter Collins (racing driver)|Peter Collins]], and the Belgian [[Johnny Claes]] scored their first victory, in the [[Grand Prix des Fronti\u00e8res]] at a [[Chimay Street Circuit|street circuit]] in [[Chimay]], Belgium.<ref name=gp/> Abecassis's HWM team also took a notable victory in the [[BRDC International Trophy|International Trophy]] race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in 1952, this time with [[Lance Macklin]] at the wheel. With the reintroduction of Formula One cars to the World Championship in {{F1|1954}}, Abecassis and Heath attempted to produce a competitive car using the 2.5-litre version of the Alta engine but it was not a success;<ref name=gp/> HWM cars only contested two further Grand Prix events after 1953.\n\nIt was with his own HWM cars that Abecassis raced in his only two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, at the [[Circuit Bremgarten|Bremgarten]] circuit, in the [[1951 Swiss Grand Prix|1951]] and [[1952 Swiss Grand Prix]]. He was more successful as a sports car driver with [[Aston Martin]] and won his class at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in {{24hLM|1950}}, sharing his [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]] with Macklin. He also finished second in the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in 1953, partnered by [[Reg Parnell]]. In 1953, Abecassis constructed an HWM sports car for his own personal use, powered by a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] [[Straight-six engine|straight-6]] engine, with which he successfully contested many national British races until 1956.<ref name=autocourse>{{cite web|title=Driver: Abecassis, George |url=http://www.autocoursegpa.com/driver~driver_id~11549.htm |work=Autocourse Grand Prix Archive |accessdate=27 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221183618/http://www.autocoursegpa.com/driver~driver_id~11549.htm |archivedate=21 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Heath was killed in an accident in the [[Mille Miglia]] and Abecassis retired from racing, turning his attention to running the HWM operations. He was the [[Facel Vega]] importer for Britain, while his motor industry connections were aided by the fact that he was married to Angela, the daughter of Aston Martin chairman [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|Sir David Brown]]. He died aged 78, in [[Ibstone]], near [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]].\n\nIn September 2010 his son David Abecassis published a comprehensive biography of his father under the title ''A Passion for Speed''.\n\nHis grandson, Jonathan Abecassis, has an active interest in vintage sports car racing.

Isobel and her lover Irwin own a small graphic design company that is struggling to stay afloat. Her sister suggests she and her [[born-again Christian]] husband Tom help them expand the business by finding investors and making Katherine a partner responsible for finding new business. Isobel has grave misgivings about the plan, but finally agrees to it when Marion convinces Irwin of its potential success. Before long, the strain of running the expanded business causes a deterioration in Isobel's relationship with Irwin, who is becoming increasingly dependent upon her, while at the same time Katherine's tenuous hold on sanity begins to unravel.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Act 1===\n\n====Scene 1====\nIsobel is sitting with the body of her father Robert, who has just died. Her elder sister Marion arrives to claim a ring she had given him and the two sisters begin to argue. Marion's husband Tom arrives and Marion leaves, angry with Isobel, then Tom and Isobel talk before leaving.\n\n====Scene 2====\nIsobel and her father's second wife, the alcoholic Katherine, sit in the garden of Robert's house just after his funeral. Marion and Tom arrive and an argument begins when Katherine suddenly introduces her idea that she would like to join Isobel's small design firm. Katherine storms out and finds a hidden bottle of drink before returning, whereupon the previously doubtful Isobel agrees that Katherine can join the firm.\n\n====Scene 3====\nIn the office of Isobel's firm she and her lover Irwin attempt to enjoy a rare evening without Katherine, until Katherine arrives to tell them how she has taken Isobel's friend Max out to dinner. Katherine criticises Irwin's design work before leaving and Irwin tries to convince Isobel to get rid of her. Katherine returns and, when Isobel proves unable or unwilling to eject Katherine, Irwin intervenes and asks Katherine to leave in the morning. Katherine leaves temporarily and Isobel refuses to agree to her ejection from the firm.\n\n====Scene 4====\nBack at Robert's house, Marion and Tom try to convince Isobel to let them invest in her firm to help it expand, with Irwin betraying Isobel by supporting them rather than her.\n\n===Act 2===\n\n====Scene 1====\nMarion's secretary Rhonda comes round to Isobel's firm's new offices for a shower, and she and Irwin flirt over a bottle of champagne until Isobel arrives back unexpectedly. Rhonda leaves for the shower and Isobel reveals that Katherine has stabbed one of the firm's clients and so has had to be put into a rehab clinic. Isobel and Irwin argue and Rhonda returns to the office before leaving to go to the cinema. Isobel surprises her and Irwin by suggesting that they come too and the three leave together.\n\n====Scene 2====\nThe expansion of Isobel's firm having failed, Marion and Tom wait in Tom's office, to which Irwin comes for a business meeting. He tells them how Isobel left the cinema halfway through the film and took a spur-of-the-moment holiday to Lanzarote, before returning to care for Katherine. He also admits how he is still in love with Isobel despite the friction that now exists between them and Marion criticises her sister's handling of the situation. Isobel arrives and refuses to come into the office until Irwin leaves. Irwin leaves, Isobel enters and she and Marion argue until Isobel finally leaves. A born-again evangelical Christian, Tom then criticises Marion and leaves to pray for Isobel and Irwin.\n\n====Scene 3====\nIn the lounge of Katherine's flat, Isobel attempts to make her dinner and the two talk before preparing a sofa-bed for Isobel to stay the night.

Isobel and her lover Irwin own a small graphic design company that is struggling to stay afloat. Her sister suggests she and her [[born-again Christian]] husband Tom help them expand the business by finding investors and making Katherine a partner responsible for finding new business. Isobel has grave misgivings about the plan, but finally agrees to it when Marion convinces Irwin of its potential success. Before long, the strain of running the expanded business causes a deterioration in Isobel's relationship with Irwin, who is becoming increasingly dependent upon her, while at the same time Katherine's tenuous hold on sanity begins to unravel.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Act 1===\n\n====Scene 1====\nIsobel is sitting with the body of her father Robert, who has just died. Her elder sister Marion arrives to claim a ring she had given him and the two sisters begin to argue. Marion's husband Tom arrives and Marion leaves, angry with Isobel, then Tom and Isobel talk before leaving.\n\n====Scene 2====\nIsobel and her father's second wife, the alcoholic Katherine, sit in the garden of Robert's house just after his funeral. Marion and Tom arrive and an argument begins when Katherine suddenly introduces her idea that she would like to join Isobel's small design firm. Katherine storms out and finds a hidden bottle of drink before returning, whereupon the previously doubtful Isobel agrees that Katherine can join the firm.\n\n====Scene 3====\nIn the office of Isobel's firm she and her lover Irwin attempt to enjoy a rare evening without Katherine, until Katherine arrives to tell them how she has taken Isobel's friend Max out to dinner. Katherine criticises Irwin's design work before leaving and Irwin tries to convince Isobel to get rid of her. Katherine returns and, when Isobel proves unable or unwilling to eject Katherine, Irwin intervenes and asks Katherine to leave in the morning. Katherine leaves temporarily and Isobel refuses to agree to her ejection from the firm.\n\n====Scene 4====\nBack at Robert's house, Marion and Tom try to convince Isobel to let them invest in her firm to help it expand, with Irwin betraying Isobel by supporting them rather than her.\n\n===Act 2===\n\n====Scene 1====\nMarion's secretary Rhonda comes round to Isobel's firm's new offices for a shower, and she and Irwin flirt over a bottle of champagne until Isobel arrives back unexpectedly. Rhonda leaves for the shower and Isobel reveals that Katherine has stabbed one of the firm's clients and so has had to be put into a rehab clinic. Isobel and Irwin argue and Rhonda returns to the office before leaving to go to the cinema. Isobel surprises her and Irwin by suggesting that they come too and the three leave together.\n\n====Scene 2====\nThe expansion of Isobel's firm having failed, Marion and Tom wait in Tom's office, to which Irwin comes for a business meeting. He tells them how Isobel left the cinema halfway through the film and took a spur-of-the-moment holiday to Lanzarote, before returning to care for Katherine. He also admits how he is still in love with Isobel despite the friction that now exists between them and Marion criticises her sister's handling of the situation. Isobel arrives and refuses to come into the office until Irwin leaves. Irwin leaves, Isobel enters and she and Marion argue until Isobel finally leaves. A born-again evangelical Christian, Tom then criticises Marion and leaves to pray for Isobel and Irwin.\n\n====Scene 3====\nIn the lounge of Katherine's flat, Isobel attempts to make her dinner and the two talk before preparing a sofa-bed for Isobel to stay the night. Katherine leaves for her bedroom and Isobel settles down to read, before Irwin arrives, thanks to Katherine who has secretly disobeyed Isobel and unbolted the door so he can get in. Irwin has brought a gun with him and begs Isobel to sleep with him - she refuses and the pair argue. Katherine returns and Isobel fails to convince her to go out to get the police to eject Irwin. Isobel then prepares to go out and Irwin shoots her just as she leaves.\n\n====Scene 4====\nBack at Robert's house, Marion, Tom and Katherine reinstate its furniture and prepare for Isobel's funeral.

His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973.

In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]].

''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain.

In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award.

Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''. However, poetry remained the most important to him. His later work, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967) onward took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection of 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/>\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967 - despite a hit-and-run accident in the middle that broke both his legs and dislocated his shoulder.<ref name=white/> That process became a subject for his writing. ''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.
