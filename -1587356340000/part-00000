Early April 2008 the Board of the S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello Foundation prepared a draft Resolution to be sponsored and adopted by the General Assembly designating 19 August as World Humanitarian Day.

They have released 10 studio albums, 6 live albums and 3 rarities collections as well as a couple of offshoot project albums in the guise of the Galahad Acoustic Quintet and the Galahad Electric Company. Over the last 32 years they have played with the likes of [[Pendragon (band)|Pendragon]], [[IQ (band)|IQ]] and [[Twelfth Night (band)|Twelfth Night]]. Galahad have performed their own shows and at festivals in Europe and North America, and have sold tens of thousands of albums despite never having had a major record deal. All releases are on their own 'Avalon Records' imprint other than some re-issues which are released in association with Polish label 'Oskar Productions'. \nIn 2012 and after 27 years of existence Galahad released their first ever LP 'Battle Scars' in conjunction with Ritual Echo Records, on high quality 180 gram vinyl, in a gatefold sleeve, as a limited edition pressing of 300 which is already fast becoming a  collectors item.<ref>{{Citation | year =2011 | title =One For The Record, The Official Biography of Galahad | publisher = Ministry of Prog}}</ref>\n\nThe band's vocalist Stuart Nicholson described Galahad's early days thus: \"...the band was formed just after the so called second wave of \u2018Prog\u2019 bands such as Marillion, Pallas, IQ, Twelfth Night, Pendragon etc. of Prog bands came to the fore in the early Eighties. They all started around 1978 \u2013 1981 and we started in 1985 after the bubble had effectively burst, but didn\u2019t really get going seriously until 1990 onwards. To be honest we really did play just for fun in the early days and weren\u2019t really that concerned about record deals etc. It was only after playing with some of the bigger bands when we thought. Actually, we are just as good as these guys so why not give it a go...\" <ref name=\"Stu-interview\">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/galahad Interview with Stu Nicholson], by Grande Rock.</ref>\n\nFounder member Roy Keyworth left the band in March 2017.

2017,<ref>https://www.galahadonline.com/news/blog/31-03-2017-an-official-statement-from-the-band</ref> but will not join the band full time.\n\nLee Abraham was officially announced as the new Galahad

[[England|English]] [[progressive rock]] band formed in 1985. They have released 10 studio albums, 6 live albums and 3 rarities collections as well as a couple of offshoot project albums in the guise of the Galahad Acoustic Quintet and the Galahad Electric Company. Over the last 32 years they have played with the likes of [[Pendragon (band)|Pendragon]], [[IQ (band)|IQ]] and [[Twelfth Night (band)|Twelfth Night]]. Galahad have performed their own shows and at festivals in Europe and North America, and have sold tens of thousands of albums despite never having had a major record deal. All releases are on their own 'Avalon Records' imprint other than some re-issues which are released in association with Polish label 'Oskar Productions'. \nIn 2012 and after 27 years of existence Galahad released their first ever LP 'Battle Scars' in conjunction with Ritual Echo Records, on high quality 180 gram vinyl, in a gatefold sleeve, as a limited edition pressing of 300 which is already fast becoming a  collectors item.<ref>{{Citation | year =2011 | title =One For The Record, The Official Biography of Galahad | publisher = Ministry of Prog}}</ref>\n\nThe band's vocalist Stuart Nicholson described Galahad's early days thus: \"...the band was formed just after the so called second wave of \u2018Prog\u2019 bands such as Marillion, Pallas, IQ, Twelfth Night, Pendragon etc. of Prog bands came to the fore in the early Eighties. They all started around 1978 \u2013 1981 and we started in 1985 after the bubble had effectively burst, but didn\u2019t really get going seriously until 1990 onwards. To be honest we really did play just for fun in the early days and weren\u2019t really that concerned about record deals etc. It was only after playing with some of the bigger bands when we thought. Actually, we are just as good as these guys so why not give it a go...\" <ref name=\"Stu-interview\">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/galahad Interview with Stu Nicholson], by Grande Rock.</ref>\n\nFounder member Roy Keyworth left the band in March 2017. Producer [[Karl Groom]] filled in for Keyworth on the band's ''Quiet Storms'' album released in May 2017,<ref>https://www.galahadonline.com/news/blog/31-03-2017-an-official-statement-from-the-band</ref> but will not join the band full time.\n\nLee Abraham was officially announced as the new Galahad
