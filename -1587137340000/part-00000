From 1989 she was the general secretary of the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK), a [[Dravidian party]] whose cadre revered her as their {{lang|ta|Amma}} (mother) and {{lang|ta|Puratchi Thalaivi}} (revolutionary leader). Her critics in the media and the opposition accused her of fostering a [[personality cult]] and of demanding absolute loyalty from AIADMK legislators and ministers, who often publicly prostrated themselves before her.<ref name=\"outlook20110321\" />\n\nJayalalithaa first came into prominence as a leading film actress in the mid-1960s. Though she had entered the profession reluctantly, upon the urging of her mother to support the family, Jayalalithaa worked prolifically. She appeared in [[Jayalalithaa filmography|140 films]] between 1961 and 1980, primarily in the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]], [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] and [[Kannada cinema|Kannada]] languages. Jayalalithaa received praise for her versatility as an actress and for her dancing skills, earning the sobriquet \"Queen of Tamil Cinema\".<ref name=\"jjte\">{{cite news|title=Jayalalithaa death: Telugu stars mourn Amma's loss!|url=http://zeenews.india.com/regional/jayalalithaa-death-telugu-stars-mourn-ammas-loss_1956451.html|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=[[Zee News]]|date=6 December 2016}}</ref> Among her frequent co-stars was [[M. G. Ramachandran]], a Tamil [[cultural icon]] who leveraged his immense popularity with the masses into a successful political career. In 1982, when MGR was chief minister, Jayalalithaa joined the AIADMK, the party he founded. Her political rise was rapid; within a few years she became AIADMK propaganda secretary and was elected to the [[Rajya Sabha]], the [[upper house]] of [[India's Parliament]]. After MGR's death in 1987, Jayalalithaa proclaimed herself his political heir and, having fought off the faction headed by [[Janaki Ramachandran]], MGR's widow, emerged as the sole leader of the AIADMK. Following the [[1989 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1989 election]], she became Leader of the Opposition to the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]]-led government headed by [[Karunanidhi]], her ''b\u00eate noire''.\n\nIn [[1991 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1991]] Jayalalithaa became chief minister, Tamil Nadu's youngest, for the first time. She earned a reputation for centralising state power among a coterie of bureaucrats; her [[Tamil Nadu Council of Ministers|council of ministers]], whom she often shuffled around, were largely ceremonial in nature. The successful cradle-baby scheme, which enabled mothers to anonymously offer their newborns for adoption, emerged during this time. Despite an official salary of only a rupee a month, Jayalalithaa indulged in public displays of wealth, culminating in a lavish wedding for her foster son in 1995. In the [[1996 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1996 election]], the AIADMK was nearly wiped out at the hustings; Jayalalithaa herself lost her seat. The new Karunanidhi government filed several corruption cases against her, and she had to spend time in jail. Her fortunes revived in the [[Indian general election, 1998 (Tamil Nadu)|1998 general election]], as the AIADMK became a key component of Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]'s 1998\u201399 government; her withdrawal of support toppled it and triggered [[Indian general election, 1999 (Tamil Nadu)|another general election]] just a year later.\n\nThe AIADMK returned to power in [[2001 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2001]], although Jayalalithaa was personally disbarred from contesting due to the corruption cases. Within a few months of her taking oath as chief minister, in September 2001, she was disqualified from holding office and forced to cede the chair to loyalist [[O. Panneerselvam]]. Upon her acquittal six months later, Jayalalithaa returned as chief minister to complete her term. Noted for its ruthlessness to political opponents, many of whom were arrested in midnight raids, her government grew unpopular. Another period (2006\u201311) in the opposition followed, before Jayalalithaa was sworn in as chief minister for the fourth time after the AIADMK swept the [[2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2011 assembly election]]. Her government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda, which included several subsidised {{lang|ta|\"Amma\"}}-branded goods such as canteens, bottled water, salt and cement. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a [[Disproportionate Asset case against Jayalalithaa|disproportionate-assets case]], rendering her disqualified to hold office. She returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In the [[2016 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2016 assembly election]], she became the first Tamil Nadu chief minister since MGR in 1984 to be voted back into office. That September, she fell severely ill and, following 75 days of hospitalisation, died on 5 December 2016 due to cardiac arrest.\n\n== Early life, education, and family ==\nJayalalithaa was born on 24 February 1948 at [[Melukote]], Pandavapura taluka, [[Mandya]] district, then in [[Mysore State]] (now [[Karnataka]]) to Jayaram and Vedavalli (Sandhya) in [[Tamils|Tamil]] [[Brahmin]] [[Iyengar]] family.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/why-j-jayalalithaa-was-buried-and-not-cremated/articleshow/55838340.cms|title=Why J Jayalalithaa was buried and not cremated|work=[[The Economic Times]]|date=7 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Yogesh Pawar |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-j-jayalalithaa-s-victory-in-tamil-nadu-finds-resonance-in-mumbai-1989569 |title=J Jayalalithaa's victory in Tamil Nadu finds resonance in Mumbai|work=Daily News & Analysis|date=19 May 2014|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-j-jayalalithaa-s-victory-in-tamil-nadu-finds-resonance-in-mumbai-1989569|title=Jayalilathaa victory finds resonance|work=DNA|access-date=2 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-in-school-her-name-was-komalavalli-1028237|title=In school her name was Komalavalli|website=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=7 May 2006 |accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe name Jayalalithaa was adopted at the age of one for the purpose of using the name in school and colleges. It was derived from the names of two houses where she resided in Mysore. One was \"Jaya Vilas\" and the other \"Lalitha Vilas\". Her paternal grandfather, Narasimhan Rengachary, was in the service of the [[Mysore kingdom]] as a surgeon, and served as the court physician to Maharaja [[Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV]] of Mysore.

From 1989 she was the general secretary of the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK), a [[Dravidian party]] whose cadre revered her as their {{lang|ta|Amma}} (mother) and {{lang|ta|Puratchi Thalaivi}} (revolutionary leader). Her critics in the media and the opposition accused her of fostering a [[personality cult]] and of demanding absolute loyalty from AIADMK legislators and ministers, who often publicly prostrated themselves before her.<ref name=\"outlook20110321\" />\n\nJayalalithaa first came into prominence as a leading film actress in the mid-1960s. Though she had entered the profession reluctantly, upon the urging of her mother to support the family, Jayalalithaa worked prolifically. She appeared in [[Jayalalithaa filmography|140 films]] between 1961 and 1980, primarily in the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]], [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] and [[Kannada cinema|Kannada]] languages. Jayalalithaa received praise for her versatility as an actress and for her dancing skills, earning the sobriquet \"Queen of Tamil Cinema\".<ref name=\"jjte\">{{cite news|title=Jayalalithaa death: Telugu stars mourn Amma's loss!|url=http://zeenews.india.com/regional/jayalalithaa-death-telugu-stars-mourn-ammas-loss_1956451.html|accessdate=18 December 2016|work=[[Zee News]]|date=6 December 2016}}</ref> Among her frequent co-stars was [[M. G. Ramachandran]], a Tamil [[cultural icon]] who leveraged his immense popularity with the masses into a successful political career. In 1982, when MGR was chief minister, Jayalalithaa joined the AIADMK, the party he founded. Her political rise was rapid; within a few years she became AIADMK propaganda secretary and was elected to the [[Rajya Sabha]], the [[upper house]] of [[India's Parliament]]. After MGR's death in 1987, Jayalalithaa proclaimed herself his political heir and, having fought off the faction headed by [[Janaki Ramachandran]], MGR's widow, emerged as the sole leader of the AIADMK. Following the [[1989 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1989 election]], she became Leader of the Opposition to the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]]-led government headed by [[Karunanidhi]], her ''b\u00eate noire''.\n\nIn [[1991 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1991]] Jayalalithaa became chief minister, Tamil Nadu's youngest, for the first time. She earned a reputation for centralising state power among a coterie of bureaucrats; her [[Tamil Nadu Council of Ministers|council of ministers]], whom she often shuffled around, were largely ceremonial in nature. The successful cradle-baby scheme, which enabled mothers to anonymously offer their newborns for adoption, emerged during this time. Despite an official salary of only a rupee a month, Jayalalithaa indulged in public displays of wealth, culminating in a lavish wedding for her foster son in 1995. In the [[1996 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|1996 election]], the AIADMK was nearly wiped out at the hustings; Jayalalithaa herself lost her seat. The new Karunanidhi government filed several corruption cases against her, and she had to spend time in jail. Her fortunes revived in the [[Indian general election, 1998 (Tamil Nadu)|1998 general election]], as the AIADMK became a key component of Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]'s 1998\u201399 government; her withdrawal of support toppled it and triggered [[Indian general election, 1999 (Tamil Nadu)|another general election]] just a year later.\n\nThe AIADMK returned to power in [[2001 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2001]], although Jayalalithaa was personally disbarred from contesting due to the corruption cases. Within a few months of her taking oath as chief minister, in September 2001, she was disqualified from holding office and forced to cede the chair to loyalist [[O. Panneerselvam]]. Upon her acquittal six months later, Jayalalithaa returned as chief minister to complete her term. Noted for its ruthlessness to political opponents, many of whom were arrested in midnight raids, her government grew unpopular. Another period (2006\u201311) in the opposition followed, before Jayalalithaa was sworn in as chief minister for the fourth time after the AIADMK swept the [[2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election|2011 assembly election]]. Her government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda, which included several subsidised {{lang|ta|\"Amma\"}}-branded goods such as canteens, bottled water, salt and cement. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a [[Disproportionate Asset case against Jayalalithaa|disproportionate-assets case]], rendering her disqualified to hold office.
