During the Spanish colonial era, the term was primarily applied to Spanish settlers of the region now known as the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Texas]] (first it was part of [[New Spain]] and after 1821 it was part of [[Mexico]]).<ref name=\"tamu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/txweb/txwebmain.htm |title=The Texian Web - Texas History on the Internet |publisher=Tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref> After settlers entered from the United States and gained the independence of the [[Republic of Texas]], the term was applied to mostly Spanish-speaking Texans, Hispanicized [[German Texan|Germans]], and other [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking residents.<ref name=\"tamu.edu\" />\n\nIn practice, many members of traditionally Tejano communities often have varying degrees of fluency in Spanish, with some having virtually no Spanish proficiency, though they are still considered culturally part of the community.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/drawl/|title=Do You Speak American .

It is also a term used to identify natives, as opposed to newcomers, in the areas settled. Latino people of Texas identify as Tejano if their ancestors were living there before the area was controlled by Anglo Americans.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Mexican Americans in Texas}}\n\n===Spanish government===\n{{Main|Spanish Texas}}\nAs early as 1519, [[Alonso Alvarez de Pineda]] claimed the area which is now Texas for [[Spain]]. The Spanish monarchy paid little attention to the province until 1685. In that year, the Crown learned of a French colony in the region and worried that it might threaten Spanish colonial [[Mining|mines]] and shipping routes. [[Charles II of Spain|King Carlos II]] sent ten expeditions to find the French colony, but they were unsuccessful. Between 1690 and 1693 expeditions were made to the Texas region, and they acquired better knowledge of it for the provincial government and settlers who came later.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nTejano settlements developed in three distinct regions: the northern [[Nacogdoches]] region, the [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar]]\u2013[[Goliad]] region along the [[San Antonio River]], and the frontier between the [[Nueces River]] and the Rio Grande, an area used largely for ranching. These populations shared certain characteristics, yet they were independent of one another. The main unifying factor was their shared responsibility for defending the northern frontier of [[New Spain]]. Some of the first settlers were [[Isle\u00f1os]] from the [[Canary Islands]]. Their families were among the first to reside at the [[Presidio San Antonio de Bexar]] in 1731 (modern-day San Antonio, Texas). Soon after, they established the first civil government at [[San Fernando, Tamaulipas|La Villa de San Fernando]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n[[Ranching]] was a major activity in the Bexar-Goliad area, which consisted of a belt of ranches that extended along the San Antonio River between Bexar ([[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] area) and [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]]. The [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] settlement was located farther north and east. Tejanos from Nacogdoches traded with the French and Anglo residents of Louisiana, and they were culturally influenced by them. The third settlement was located north of the Rio Grande, toward the Nueces River. The ranchers were citizens of [[Spanish people|Spanish origin]] from [[Tamaulipas]] and (what is now) northern Mexico, and they identified with Spanish [[Criollo people|Criollo]] culture.<ref>[http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/tejanoorigins.htm Tejano Origins in Mexican Texas<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509184531/http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/tejanoorigins.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 16, 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest, launched the Mexican War of Independence with the issuing of his Grito de Dolores, or \u201cCry of Delores.\u201d He marched across Mexico and gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and civilians. These troops ran up into an army of 6,000 well-trained and armed Spanish troops; most of Hidalgo's troops fled or were killed at the Battle of Calder\u00f3n Bridge<ref>[Minster, Christopher. Mexican War of Independence: The Battle of Calderon Bridge<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Jos\u00e9 Bernardo Maximiliano Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara, a believer in independence from Spain, organized a revolution army together with Jos\u00e9 Menchaca from the Villa de San Fernando de Bejar. After the defeat and execution of Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara traveled to Washington, D.C. to request help from the United States. He requested an audience with President James Madison, but was refused. He did meet with Secretary of State James Monroe, who was busy planning the invasion of Canada in the War against Great Britain. On December 10, 1810, Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara addressed the United State House of Representatives. There was no official help by the United States government to the revolution. However, Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara did return with financial help, weapons and almost 700 \"ex-United State Army veterans\". The challenges Monroe faced revolved around the Napoleonic War and American neutrality.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez de Lara's army would defeat the Spanish army and the first independent Republic of Texas, \"the Green Republic\" was born with the Declaration of Independence. Spain had reinforced their armies in the colonies and a well-equipped army led by General Juaquin de Arredondo known as the \"El Carnicero,\" invaded the Green Republic of Tejas. During the time of the Republic the Spaniard Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Dubois, had been undermining Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara's government. Toledo was successful and de Lara was ousted. Toledo then led the Republican Army of the North (the Green Army) into a trap against the Spanish army and no prisoners were taken by the Spanish at the Battle of Medina. The Spanish army would march into San Antonio. The Spanish army rounded everyone they could find from Nacogdoches to El Espiritu de Santo (Goliad) and brought them to San Antonio. The Spanish murdered four males a day for 270 days, eradicating the Tejano population and leaving the women when the Spanish army left in 1814. Toledo returned to Spain, a Spanish hero.<ref>Jarratt, Rie (1949). \"Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara: Mexican-Texan The Story of a Creole Hero\". Creole Texana. Archived from the original on 2012-04-11.

In addition, several thousand New Mexicans lived in the areas of Paso del Norte (now [[El Paso, Texas]]) and [[Nuevo Santander]], incorporating [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] and the [[Rio Grande Valley]].\n\nDuring the 1820s, many settlers from the United States and other nations moved to [[Mexican Texas]], settling mostly in the eastern area. The passage of a national colonization law encouraged immigration, granting the immigrants citizenship if they declared loyalty to Mexico. By 1830, the 30,000 recent settlers in Texas (who were primarily English speakers from the United States) outnumbered the [[Hispanos]] Tejano six to one.<ref name=\"Tejanos1\">{{cite web |title=Tejano Patriots |work=bexargenealogy.com |url=http://www.bexargenealogy.com/index_Tejanos.htm |accessdate=2008-10-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080502181031/http://bexargenealogy.com/index_Tejanos.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-02}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Texians]] and Tejano alike rebelled against attempts by the government to centralize authority in [[Mexico City]] and other measures implemented by [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]]. Tensions between the central Mexican government and the settlers eventually resulted in the [[Texas Revolution]]. The revolution raised tensions in the area between the Tejano and Texians.\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1915, insurgents in Mexico wrote a manifesto that was circulated in the town of [[San Diego, Texas|San Diego]], in [[South Texas]]. The manifesto \"[[Plan de San Diego]]\" called on Hispanics to reconquer the Southwest and kill the English speakers. Numerous cross-border raids, murders, and sabotage took place. The [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] suppressed the insurrection. Tejanos strongly repudiated the Plan. According to Benjamin H. Johnson, their desire to affirm their United States loyalty resulted in their founding the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC). It was headed by professionals, business leaders, and progressives, and it became the central Tejano organization promoting civic pride and civil rights.<ref>{{cite book |first=Benjamin H. |last=Johnson |title=Revolution in Texas: How a Forgotten Rebellion and Its Bloody Suppression turned Mexicans into Americans |url=https://archive.org/details/revolutionintexa00john |url-access=registration |year=2003 |location= |publisher= |isbn= |pages= }}</ref>\n\nOther sources attribute the founding of the organization in 1929 largely to Tejano veterans of World War I, who wanted to improve civil rights for Mexican-American citizens of the United States. They were socially discriminated against in Texas. Only American citizens were admitted as members to LULAC, and there was an emphasis on people becoming educated and assimilated in order to advance.<ref>Gutierrez, David G. (March 1995).

[[Chili con carne]], [[chalupa|crispy chalupas]], [[chili con queso]], [[enchilada]]s, and [[fajita]]s are all Tex-Mex specialties. A common feature of Tex-Mex is the combination plate, with several of the above on one large platter. Serving [[tortilla chip]]s and a [[hot sauce]] or [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]] as an appetizer is also a Tex-Mex development.<ref>[http://www.lightmillennium.org/2005_15th/emartinez_tex_mex_cuisine.html Etienne MARTINEZ, \"Mexicans in the U.S.A: Mexican-American / Tex-Mex Cousine\"], Light Millennium</ref> ''[[Cabrito]]'', ''[[barbacoa]]'', ''[[carne seca]]'', and other products of [[cattle]] culture have been common in the [[ranch]]ing cultures of [[South Texas]] and northern Mexico.

''[[The Tex-Mex Cookbook]]'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Broadway Books]], 2004), XVI</ref> Tex-Mex has imported flavors from other spicy cuisines, such as the use of [[cumin]]. Cumin is often referred to by its Spanish name, ''comino.''\n\nA common Tex-Mex breakfast dish served is a \"breakfast taco.\" This usually consists of a thicker-style flour tortilla or traditional corn tortilla, and is served using a single fold. This is in contrast to the burrito-style method of completely encasing the ingredients. Some of the typical ingredients used are: eggs, potatoes, cheese, beans, bacon, sausage, and barbacoa. A taco may combine variations of these elements. Breakfast tacos are traditionally served with an optional red or green salsa.\n\nDaniel D. Arreola states that a line of demarcation in the \"South Texas Mexican\" food region is based on the distinction between those who use the terms \"taco-burrito\", or \"taco-barbecue\".  To the west of this line, Mexican food served in a flour tortilla is often called a burrito, due to the influence of the Mexican state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. To the south and east of this line, the same food may be called a taco, showing a Tex-Mex influence. To the north, [[barbecue]] sandwiches are more popular, reflecting the influx of Europeans, European Americans, and African Americans.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Arreola\n  | first =Daniel David\n  | title =Tejano South Texas: A Mexican American Cultural Province\n  | publisher =[[University of Texas Press]]\n  | year =2002\n  | pages =174\u2013175\n  | url =http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/arrtej.html\n  | isbn =0-292-70511-5 }}</ref>\n\n===Geography===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nMost of the Tejanos are concentrated in southern Texas, in historic areas of Spanish colonial settlement and closer to the border that developed.

During the Spanish colonial era, the term was primarily applied to Spanish settlers of the region now known as the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Texas]] (first it was part of [[New Spain]] and after 1821 it was part of [[Mexico]]).<ref name=\"tamu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/txweb/txwebmain.htm |title=The Texian Web - Texas History on the Internet |publisher=Tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref> After settlers entered from the United States and gained the independence of the [[Republic of Texas]], the term was applied to mostly Spanish-speaking Texans, Hispanicized [[German Texan|Germans]], and other [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking residents.<ref name=\"tamu.edu\" />\n\nIn practice, many members of traditionally Tejano communities often have varying degrees of fluency in Spanish, with some having virtually no Spanish proficiency, though they are still considered culturally part of the community.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/texan/drawl/|title=Do You Speak American .

It is also a term used to identify natives, as opposed to newcomers, in the areas settled. Latino people of Texas identify as Tejano if their ancestors were living there before the area was controlled by Anglo Americans.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Mexican Americans in Texas}}\n\n===Spanish government===\n{{Main|Spanish Texas}}\nAs early as 1519, [[Alonso Alvarez de Pineda]] claimed the area which is now Texas for [[Spain]]. The Spanish monarchy paid little attention to the province until 1685. In that year, the Crown learned of a French colony in the region and worried that it might threaten Spanish colonial [[Mining|mines]] and shipping routes. [[Charles II of Spain|King Carlos II]] sent ten expeditions to find the French colony, but they were unsuccessful. Between 1690 and 1693 expeditions were made to the Texas region, and they acquired better knowledge of it for the provincial government and settlers who came later.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nTejano settlements developed in three distinct regions: the northern [[Nacogdoches]] region, the [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar]]\u2013[[Goliad]] region along the [[San Antonio River]], and the frontier between the [[Nueces River]] and the Rio Grande, an area used largely for ranching. These populations shared certain characteristics, yet they were independent of one another. The main unifying factor was their shared responsibility for defending the northern frontier of [[New Spain]]. Some of the first settlers were [[Isle\u00f1os]] from the [[Canary Islands]]. Their families were among the first to reside at the [[Presidio San Antonio de Bexar]] in 1731 (modern-day San Antonio, Texas). Soon after, they established the first civil government at [[San Fernando, Tamaulipas|La Villa de San Fernando]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n[[Ranching]] was a major activity in the Bexar-Goliad area, which consisted of a belt of ranches that extended along the San Antonio River between Bexar ([[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] area) and [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]]. The [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] settlement was located farther north and east. Tejanos from Nacogdoches traded with the French and Anglo residents of Louisiana, and they were culturally influenced by them. The third settlement was located north of the Rio Grande, toward the Nueces River. The ranchers were citizens of [[Spanish people|Spanish origin]] from [[Tamaulipas]] and (what is now) northern Mexico, and they identified with Spanish [[Criollo people|Criollo]] culture.<ref>[http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/tejanoorigins.htm Tejano Origins in Mexican Texas<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509184531/http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/tejanoorigins.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref>\n\nOn September 16, 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest, launched the Mexican War of Independence with the issuing of his Grito de Dolores, or \u201cCry of Delores.\u201d He marched across Mexico and gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and civilians. These troops ran up into an army of 6,000 well-trained and armed Spanish troops; most of Hidalgo's troops fled or were killed at the Battle of Calder\u00f3n Bridge<ref>[Minster, Christopher. Mexican War of Independence: The Battle of Calderon Bridge<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Jos\u00e9 Bernardo Maximiliano Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara, a believer in independence from Spain, organized a revolution army together with Jos\u00e9 Menchaca from the Villa de San Fernando de Bejar. After the defeat and execution of Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara traveled to Washington, D.C. to request help from the United States. He requested an audience with President James Madison, but was refused. He did meet with Secretary of State James Monroe, who was busy planning the invasion of Canada in the War against Great Britain. On December 10, 1810, Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara addressed the United State House of Representatives. There was no official help by the United States government to the revolution. However, Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara did return with financial help, weapons and almost 700 \"ex-United State Army veterans\". The challenges Monroe faced revolved around the Napoleonic War and American neutrality.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez de Lara's army would defeat the Spanish army and the first independent Republic of Texas, \"the Green Republic\" was born with the Declaration of Independence. Spain had reinforced their armies in the colonies and a well-equipped army led by General Juaquin de Arredondo known as the \"El Carnicero,\" invaded the Green Republic of Tejas. During the time of the Republic the Spaniard Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Dubois, had been undermining Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara's government. Toledo was successful and de Lara was ousted. Toledo then led the Republican Army of the North (the Green Army) into a trap against the Spanish army and no prisoners were taken by the Spanish at the Battle of Medina. The Spanish army would march into San Antonio. The Spanish army rounded everyone they could find from Nacogdoches to El Espiritu de Santo (Goliad) and brought them to San Antonio. The Spanish murdered four males a day for 270 days, eradicating the Tejano population and leaving the women when the Spanish army left in 1814. Toledo returned to Spain, a Spanish hero.<ref>Jarratt, Rie (1949). \"Guti\u00e9rrez de Lara: Mexican-Texan The Story of a Creole Hero\". Creole Texana. Archived from the original on 2012-04-11.

The passage of a national colonization law encouraged immigration, granting the immigrants citizenship if they declared loyalty to Mexico.

The revolution raised tensions in the area between the Tejano and Texians.\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1915, insurgents in Mexico wrote a manifesto that was circulated in the town of [[San Diego, Texas|San Diego]], in [[South Texas]]. The manifesto \"[[Plan de San Diego]]\" called on Hispanics to reconquer the Southwest and kill the English speakers. Numerous cross-border raids, murders, and sabotage took place. The [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] suppressed the insurrection. Tejanos strongly repudiated the Plan. According to Benjamin H. Johnson, their desire to affirm their United States loyalty resulted in their founding the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC). It was headed by professionals, business leaders, and progressives, and it became the central Tejano organization promoting civic pride and civil rights.<ref>{{cite book |first=Benjamin H. |last=Johnson |title=Revolution in Texas: How a Forgotten Rebellion and Its Bloody Suppression turned Mexicans into Americans |url=https://archive.org/details/revolutionintexa00john |url-access=registration |year=2003 |location= |publisher= |isbn= |pages= }}</ref>\n\nOther sources attribute the founding of the organization in 1929 largely to Tejano veterans of World War I, who wanted to improve civil rights for Mexican-American citizens of the United States.

They were generally of only Spanish heritage, or Hispanicized European heritage, including [[Frenchmen]] such as [[Juan Seguin]], [[Italians]] such as Jose Cassiano, or [[Corsica]]n like [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Navarro|Antonio Navarro]]. Spanish post-colonial settlers stayed in Texas as refugees fleeing [[Spanish Civil War]]. Their descendants were added to the Tejano population. Also represented are ethnic [[German Texan|Germans]], who were concentrated in the Edwards Plateau following mid-19th century immigration. The region's [[Poles]], [[Czechs]], [[Slovaks]], [[Danish people|Danes]], [[Dutch American|Dutch]], [[Swedish Americans|Swedes]], [[Irish people|Irish]] (''see also'' [[Irish Mexican]]), [[Scottish Americans|Scots]], [[Welsh Americans|Welsh]], and [[Anglo-American ethnic group|Anglo Americans]] who arrived in the 19th century \u2013 were also considered Tejanos, as they were Hispanicized. The former two ethnicities (with Germans) would contribute greatly to [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex music]]. Some Arabs are also considered Tejanos, as [[Arab Mexican]]s settled Texas during the Mexican Revolution. Natives of Texas with Spanish surnames and with Native American-Hispanic, and non-Spanish European-American ancestry may be considered Tejanos as well.\n\nCrypto-Jews (see [[Crypto-Judaism]]) are descendants of Spanish Jews who were compelled to convert to Christianity or face expulsion from the country. They choose to remain hidden since the Spanish and Mexican Inquisitions, but practice secret Jewish rites in privacy. (Library of Congress, Microfiche 7906177). [[Sephardim]] are found particularly in the northern state of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Mexico, the American Southwest, i.e., New Mexico, Arizona, and South Texas (formerly part of Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Spain/Mexico and Tejas).\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Music===\n\n{{main|Tejano music}}\nGenuine Tejano music is related to, and sounds more like, the folk music of Louisiana, known as \"[[Cajun music]]\", blended with the sounds of rock and roll, R&B, pop, and country, and with Mexican influences such as [Conjunto Music]. Mr. Narciso Martinez is the father of Conjunto Music. \n].  Sunny and the Sunglows, including Rudy Guerra, were originators of the genre.

It developed from [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and North American indigenous commodities with influences from [[Mexican cuisine]].<ref>{{Handbook of Texas|id=fon02|name=Juan de O\u00f1ate}}</ref>\n\nTex-Mex cuisine is characterized by its widespread use of melted [[cheese]], [[meat]] (particularly [[beef]]), [[bean]]s, and [[spice]]s, in addition to [[maize|corn]] or [[flour]] [[tortillas]]. [[Chili con carne]], [[chalupa|crispy chalupas]], [[chili con queso]], [[enchilada]]s, and [[fajita]]s are all Tex-Mex specialties. A common feature of Tex-Mex is the combination plate, with several of the above on one large platter. Serving [[tortilla chip]]s and a [[hot sauce]] or [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]] as an appetizer is also a Tex-Mex development.<ref>[http://www.lightmillennium.org/2005_15th/emartinez_tex_mex_cuisine.html Etienne MARTINEZ, \"Mexicans in the U.S.A: Mexican-American / Tex-Mex Cousine\"], Light Millennium</ref> ''[[Cabrito]]'', ''[[barbacoa]]'', ''[[carne seca]]'', and other products of [[cattle]] culture have been common in the [[ranch]]ing cultures of [[South Texas]] and northern Mexico. In the 20th century, Tex-Mex took on [[Americanized]] elements such as yellow cheese, as goods from the United States became cheap and readily available.<ref>[[Robb Walsh]]. ''[[The Tex-Mex Cookbook]]'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Broadway Books]], 2004), XVI</ref> Tex-Mex has imported flavors from other spicy cuisines, such as the use of [[cumin]]. Cumin is often referred to by its Spanish name, ''comino.''\n\nA common Tex-Mex breakfast dish served is a \"breakfast taco.\" This usually consists of a thicker-style flour tortilla or traditional corn tortilla, and is served using a single fold. This is in contrast to the burrito-style method of completely encasing the ingredients. Some of the typical ingredients used are: eggs, potatoes, cheese, beans, bacon, sausage, and barbacoa. A taco may combine variations of these elements. Breakfast tacos are traditionally served with an optional red or green salsa.\n\nDaniel D. Arreola states that a line of demarcation in the \"South Texas Mexican\" food region is based on the distinction between those who use the terms \"taco-burrito\", or \"taco-barbecue\".  To the west of this line, Mexican food served in a flour tortilla is often called a burrito, due to the influence of the Mexican state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. To the south and east of this line, the same food may be called a taco, showing a Tex-Mex influence.

Previously, he was the manager of the [[Boston Red Sox]], whom he led to two [[World Series]] titles, ending the franchise's [[Curse of the Bambino|86-year championship drought]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful four-year stint as the manager of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], Francona was hired to manage the Red Sox in 2004 and led the team to their [[2004 World Series|first championship]] since 1918. He won another World Series with Boston in [[2007 World Series|2007]] and continued to manage the team until the end of the 2011 season, when his contract was not renewed following a September collapse. In 2013, Francona was hired to manage the Cleveland Indians and led them to an [[List of American League pennant winners|American League pennant]] in 2016. In August and September 2017, he led the Indians to a 22-game win streak, the longest win streak in American League history and the longest without ties in MLB history.\n\n==Early life==\nFrancona was born on April 22, 1959, in [[Aberdeen, South Dakota]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://kxrb.com/indians-manager-terry-francona-was-born-in-aberdeen-south-dakota/|title=Indians Manager Terry Francona Was Born In Aberdeen South Dakota|first=Randy|last=McDaniel|work=[[KSOO (AM)|KXRB]]|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|location=[[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]|date=October 31, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}</ref> to [[Tito Francona]] (1933-2018), who played outfield for several Major League clubs from 1956 to 1970,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/francti01.shtml|title=Tito Francona Statistics|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|location=United States|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}</ref> and Roberta Jackson (1932\u20131992).\n\n===Youth===\nFrancona grew up in [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania]], about {{convert|30|mi}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh]], where he got his start in baseball at [[New Brighton Area School District#High School|New Brighton Area High School]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Elliott|title=New Brighton, Pa., Native Terry Francona Managing in Pittsburgh for First Time Since 2000|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/06/new-brighton-native-francona-managing-in-pittsburgh-for-first-time-since-2000.html|newspaper=NESN|date=June 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Golen|first=Jimmy|title=New Brighton's Terry Francona to be named manager of the Red Sox|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m2wyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ULUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3672,822268&dq=terry-francona+new-brighton&hl=en|newspaper=Beaver County Times (The Associated Press)|date=December 4, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===As a player===\nFrancona represented the United States at the [[Baseball at the 1979 Pan American Games|1979 Pan American Games]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/1979_Pan_American_Games_(Rosters)#USA|title=1979 Pan American Games (Rosters)|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref> and attended the [[University of Arizona]], where he played [[college baseball]] for the [[Arizona Wildcats baseball]] team.

After briefly playing in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], Francona made his major league debut with Montreal on August 19, 1981, a week after the end of that summer's [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|player strike]]. He appeared mainly as an [[outfielder]] that [[1981 Major League Baseball season|first year]], and he went 4-for-12 in the [[1981 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], an extra playoff round utilized that year because the season was conducted in two halves as the result of the strike. The Expos won that series, three games to two.\n\n====First base====\nAs the seasons went on, Francona shifted to [[first baseman|first base]], where he ultimately played one hundred games more than he had in the outfield. He also developed a reputation as a contact hitter, with very few [[home run]]s, [[base on balls|walks]], or [[strikeout]]s.\n\n====Journeyman years====\nThe Expos released Francona after the 1985 season, during which his [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] had slipped to .267 after posting a .346 average in limited action in 1984. He went on to sign one-year contracts with the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Cleveland Indians]], and [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. The Brewers re-signed Francona for 1990, but he only played in three games for the Brewers that year, the last on April 19. In 10 seasons and 708 games, he posted a .274 career average, with 16&nbsp;home runs and 143 [[run batted in|RBIs]].

In 1991, he managed the rookie league Sarasota White Sox of the [[Gulf Coast League]]. In 1992, he ran the [[South Bend Silver Hawks|South Bend White Sox]] of the mid-level Class A [[Midwest League]]. As manager of the AA franchise [[Birmingham Barons]] in 1993\u201395, he posted a 223-203 record and won two distinctions: [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] Manager of the Year in 1993, Baseball America's Minor League Manager of the Year in 1993, and top managerial candidate by ''Baseball America'' in 1994, the same year [[Michael Jordan]] played for Birmingham. Birmingham won the Southern League championship in 1993.\n\nHe managed in the Dominican Winter League with the [[\u00c1guilas Cibae\u00f1as]], and he also won the championship and the Serie del Caribe in 1995\u201396. That team included [[Miguel Tejada]], [[Manny Ramirez]], and [[Tony Batista]].\n\n====Major Leagues====\nFrancona became third-base [[coach (baseball)|coach]] for the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1996, working under their new skipper, [[Buddy Bell]], a former teammate of Francona on the Reds.\n\n===As a Manager===\n====Philadelphia Phillies====\nAfter the 1996 season ended, he was hired as manager of the Phillies, who had won the NL pennant in 1993 but then had three consecutive losing seasons. In Francona's four seasons (1997 through 2000) as the Phils' skipper, the club never rose above third place in the [[National League East]]. His best finish with the Phillies was 77\u201385 in 1999. In 1998 and 1999, the Phillies finished in third place, behind the [[Atlanta Braves]] and their [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|division-rival]] [[New York Mets]].\n\nHe was fired following the 2000 campaign. He finished with a 285\u2013363 record.<ref name=\"managerial record\">{{cite web|title=Terry Francona|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/francte01.shtml|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|location=United States|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}</ref> He spent the following season as a special assistant to the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 2001, which was followed by two one-year terms as a bench coach for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (2002) and [[Oakland Athletics]] (2003).\n\n====Boston Red Sox====\n[[File:Terry Francona on April 28, 2011.jpg|280px|thumb|Francona as a manager for the [[2011 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox in 2011]]]]\nThe Red Sox hired Francona to manage their club in 2004, after [[Grady Little]]'s contract was not renewed following the Red Sox loss in the [[2003 American League Championship Series]].\n\nFrancona led the Red Sox to a 98\u201364 record in 2004, the second-best record in the American League behind their [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|biggest rival]], the [[New York Yankees]]. The club gelled in the second half and won more games than any other team in the American League after the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]].\n\nAs the American League wild card, the Red Sox swept the AL West champion [[Anaheim Angels]], three games to none, in the Division Series. In the [[2004 American League Championship Series]], the Red Sox fell behind the Yankees, three games to none, including a 19\u20138 loss in Game 3 at home in [[Fenway Park]]. However, the club regained its composure and won the last four games of the series, the first time in Major League Baseball history that a team rallied from an 0\u20133 deficit to win a playoff series (only the third team to even make it as far as Game 6, and the only team to even force a Game 7 after trailing a series three games to zero). The Red Sox then swept the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] 4\u20130 in the [[2004 World Series]] to win the sixth world title in franchise history, and their first since 1918. The long-awaited victory ended 86 years of frustration for Red Sox fans.\n\nDuring the 2005 season, Francona was hospitalized after complaining of severe chest pains. Tests revealed significantly clogged arteries, but it was concluded that Francona had not suffered a heart attack. This incident, as well as a life-threatening [[pulmonary embolism]] suffered in 2002, painful knees, and ongoing treatment for [[blood clots]], has led to circulation issues which necessitate wearing extra clothes, including two pairs of tights. This is also why his regular uniform top is usually hidden by a pullover.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3582284|title=Terry Francona|work=ESPN the Magazine|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|first=Steve|last=Wulf|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2997982|title=MLB Acknowledges In-Game Uniform Check Timed Poorly|date=August 31, 2007|accessdate=August 31, 2009|first=Jerry|last=Crasnick}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, the Sox won the AL East Division, finishing two games ahead of the Yankees. Under Francona's leadership, the Sox swept the Angels in the Division Series before dropping three of the first four games to the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the ALCS. The Sox, facing elimination, went on to win their next three games, defeating Cleveland to advance to the [[2007 World Series]], where they swept the [[Colorado Rockies]] in four games. Terry Francona is the only manager in Major League history to win his first eight consecutive World Series games and just the second manager to guide two Red Sox clubs to World Series titles, the other being [[Bill Carrigan|Bill \"Rough\" Carrigan]] who led Boston to back-to-back championships in 1915 and 1916.\n\nAs of October 1, 2008, Francona's career regular-season managerial record was 755\u2013703 (.518), while his post-season record was 22\u20139 (.710). Among managers who have managed at least 20 post-season games, he has the highest winning percentage. Francona won his first seven playoff elimination games (not losing until being swept by the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 ALDS) and first nine ALCS elimination games (not losing until Game 7 of the 2008 ALCS at the Tampa Bay Rays).\n\nOn February 24, 2008, the Red Sox announced that they had extended Francona's contract.

Previously, he was the manager of the [[Boston Red Sox]], whom he led to two [[World Series]] titles, ending the franchise's [[Curse of the Bambino|86-year championship drought]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful four-year stint as the manager of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], Francona was hired to manage the Red Sox in 2004 and led the team to their [[2004 World Series|first championship]] since 1918. He won another World Series with Boston in [[2007 World Series|2007]] and continued to manage the team until the end of the 2011 season, when his contract was not renewed following a September collapse. In 2013, Francona was hired to manage the Cleveland Indians and led them to an [[List of American League pennant winners|American League pennant]] in 2016. In August and September 2017, he led the Indians to a 22-game win streak, the longest win streak in American League history and the longest without ties in MLB history.\n\n==Early life==\nFrancona was born on April 22, 1959, in [[Aberdeen, South Dakota]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://kxrb.com/indians-manager-terry-francona-was-born-in-aberdeen-south-dakota/|title=Indians Manager Terry Francona Was Born In Aberdeen South Dakota|first=Randy|last=McDaniel|work=[[KSOO (AM)|KXRB]]|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|location=[[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]|date=October 31, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}</ref> to [[Tito Francona]] (1933-2018), who played outfield for several Major League clubs from 1956 to 1970,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/francti01.shtml|title=Tito Francona Statistics|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|location=United States|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}</ref> and Roberta Jackson (1932\u20131992).\n\n===Youth===\nFrancona grew up in [[New Brighton, Pennsylvania]], about {{convert|30|mi}} northwest of [[Pittsburgh]], where he got his start in baseball at [[New Brighton Area School District#High School|New Brighton Area High School]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Elliott|title=New Brighton, Pa., Native Terry Francona Managing in Pittsburgh for First Time Since 2000|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/06/new-brighton-native-francona-managing-in-pittsburgh-for-first-time-since-2000.html|newspaper=NESN|date=June 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Golen|first=Jimmy|title=New Brighton's Terry Francona to be named manager of the Red Sox|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m2wyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ULUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3672,822268&dq=terry-francona+new-brighton&hl=en|newspaper=Beaver County Times (The Associated Press)|date=December 4, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===As a player===\nFrancona represented the United States at the [[Baseball at the 1979 Pan American Games|1979 Pan American Games]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/1979_Pan_American_Games_(Rosters)#USA|title=1979 Pan American Games (Rosters)|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref> and attended the [[University of Arizona]], where he played [[college baseball]] for the [[Arizona Wildcats baseball]] team.

After briefly playing in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], Francona made his major league debut with Montreal on August 19, 1981, a week after the end of that summer's [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|player strike]]. He appeared mainly as an [[outfielder]] that [[1981 Major League Baseball season|first year]], and he went 4-for-12 in the [[1981 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], an extra playoff round utilized that year because the season was conducted in two halves as the result of the strike. The Expos won that series, three games to two.\n\n====First base====\nAs the seasons went on, Francona shifted to [[first baseman|first base]], where he ultimately played one hundred games more than he had in the outfield. He also developed a reputation as a contact hitter, with very few [[home run]]s, [[base on balls|walks]], or [[strikeout]]s.\n\n====Journeyman years====\nThe Expos released Francona after the 1985 season, during which his [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] had slipped to .267 after posting a .346 average in limited action in 1984. He went on to sign one-year contracts with the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Cleveland Indians]], and [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. The Brewers re-signed Francona for 1990, but he only played in three games for the Brewers that year, the last on April 19. In 10 seasons and 708 games, he posted a .274 career average, with 16&nbsp;home runs and 143 [[run batted in|RBIs]]. He also made an appearance as a pitcher with Milwaukee on May 15, 1989, throwing 12&nbsp;pitches and striking out one batter ([[Stan Javier]]) on three pitches.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198905150.shtml|date=May 15, 1989|title=Milwaukee Brewers at Oakland Athletics Box Score and Play by Play|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|location=United States|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===As a coach===\n====Minor Leagues====\nAfter retiring as a player, Francona began coaching, spending several years in the [[Chicago White Sox]] organization. In 1991, he managed the rookie league Sarasota White Sox of the [[Gulf Coast League]]. In 1992, he ran the [[South Bend Silver Hawks|South Bend White Sox]] of the mid-level Class A [[Midwest League]]. As manager of the AA franchise [[Birmingham Barons]] in 1993\u201395, he posted a 223-203 record and won two distinctions: [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] Manager of the Year in 1993, Baseball America's Minor League Manager of the Year in 1993, and top managerial candidate by ''Baseball America'' in 1994, the same year [[Michael Jordan]] played for Birmingham. Birmingham won the Southern League championship in 1993.\n\nHe managed in the Dominican Winter League with the [[\u00c1guilas Cibae\u00f1as]], and he also won the championship and the Serie del Caribe in 1995\u201396. That team included [[Miguel Tejada]], [[Manny Ramirez]], and [[Tony Batista]].\n\n====Major Leagues====\nFrancona became third-base [[coach (baseball)|coach]] for the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1996, working under their new skipper, [[Buddy Bell]], a former teammate of Francona on the Reds.\n\n===As a Manager===\n====Philadelphia Phillies====\nAfter the 1996 season ended, he was hired as manager of the Phillies, who had won the NL pennant in 1993 but then had three consecutive losing seasons. In Francona's four seasons (1997 through 2000) as the Phils' skipper, the club never rose above third place in the [[National League East]]. His best finish with the Phillies was 77\u201385 in 1999. In 1998 and 1999, the Phillies finished in third place, behind the [[Atlanta Braves]] and their [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry|division-rival]] [[New York Mets]].\n\nHe was fired following the 2000 campaign. He finished with a 285\u2013363 record.<ref name=\"managerial record\">{{cite web|title=Terry Francona|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/francte01.shtml|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|location=United States|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}</ref> He spent the following season as a special assistant to the [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 2001, which was followed by two one-year terms as a bench coach for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (2002) and [[Oakland Athletics]] (2003).\n\n====Boston Red Sox====\n[[File:Terry Francona on April 28, 2011.jpg|280px|thumb|Francona as a manager for the [[2011 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox in 2011]]]]\nThe Red Sox hired Francona to manage their club in 2004, after [[Grady Little]]'s contract was not renewed following the Red Sox loss in the [[2003 American League Championship Series]].\n\nFrancona led the Red Sox to a 98\u201364 record in 2004, the second-best record in the American League behind their [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|biggest rival]], the [[New York Yankees]]. The club gelled in the second half and won more games than any other team in the American League after the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]].\n\nAs the American League wild card, the Red Sox swept the AL West champion [[Anaheim Angels]], three games to none, in the Division Series. In the [[2004 American League Championship Series]], the Red Sox fell behind the Yankees, three games to none, including a 19\u20138 loss in Game 3 at home in [[Fenway Park]]. However, the club regained its composure and won the last four games of the series, the first time in Major League Baseball history that a team rallied from an 0\u20133 deficit to win a playoff series (only the third team to even make it as far as Game 6, and the only team to even force a Game 7 after trailing a series three games to zero). The Red Sox then swept the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] 4\u20130 in the [[2004 World Series]] to win the sixth world title in franchise history, and their first since 1918. The long-awaited victory ended 86 years of frustration for Red Sox fans.\n\nDuring the 2005 season, Francona was hospitalized after complaining of severe chest pains. Tests revealed significantly clogged arteries, but it was concluded that Francona had not suffered a heart attack. This incident, as well as a life-threatening [[pulmonary embolism]] suffered in 2002, painful knees, and ongoing treatment for [[blood clots]], has led to circulation issues which necessitate wearing extra clothes, including two pairs of tights. This is also why his regular uniform top is usually hidden by a pullover.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3582284|title=Terry Francona|work=ESPN the Magazine|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|first=Steve|last=Wulf|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2997982|title=MLB Acknowledges In-Game Uniform Check Timed Poorly|date=August 31, 2007|accessdate=August 31, 2009|first=Jerry|last=Crasnick}}</ref>\n\nTwo years later, the Sox won the AL East Division, finishing two games ahead of the Yankees. Under Francona's leadership, the Sox swept the Angels in the Division Series before dropping three of the first four games to the [[Cleveland Indians]] in the ALCS. The Sox, facing elimination, went on to win their next three games, defeating Cleveland to advance to the [[2007 World Series]], where they swept the [[Colorado Rockies]] in four games. Terry Francona is the only manager in Major League history to win his first eight consecutive World Series games and just the second manager to guide two Red Sox clubs to World Series titles, the other being [[Bill Carrigan|Bill \"Rough\" Carrigan]] who led Boston to back-to-back championships in 1915 and 1916.\n\nAs of October 1, 2008, Francona's career regular-season managerial record was 755\u2013703 (.518), while his post-season record was 22\u20139 (.710). Among managers who have managed at least 20 post-season games, he has the highest winning percentage. Francona won his first seven playoff elimination games (not losing until being swept by the Chicago White Sox in the 2005 ALDS) and first nine ALCS elimination games (not losing until Game 7 of the 2008 ALCS at the Tampa Bay Rays).\n\nOn February 24, 2008, the Red Sox announced that they had extended Francona's contract. Instead of expiring at the end of the 2008 season, it would expire after the 2011 season. The team also held club options for 2012 and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080224&content_id=2386948&vkey=news_bos&fext=.jsp&c_id=bos&partnered=rss_bos|title=Red Sox extend Francona's contract|date=February 24, 2008|accessdate=August 31, 2009|first=Ian|last=Browne|work=redsox.com|publisher=MLB.com}}</ref> Francona was guaranteed a total of $12 million over the first three years of the contract, plus a $750,000 buyout to be received if his 2012 and 2013 options were not exercised.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2008/02/updated_info_on.html|title=Updated info on Tito's deal|date=February 24, 2008|accessdate=August 31, 2009|first=Gordon|last=Edes|publisher=|newspaper=Boston Globe|authorlink=Gordon Edes}}</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 2009, Francona recorded his 500th win as manager of the Red Sox, making him the third manager in club history to have 500 wins.

The highlight of the season was a 22-game win streak that spanned August 24\u2212September 15.

Dominant in all aspects, the Indians trailed at the end of just eight of the 199 innings, and their run-differential of plus-105 (142\u221237) was higher than all but six teams through that point in the entire 2017 season.  The offense produced a .937 OPS, 54 points higher the next best team, the [[2017 Minnesota Twins season|Twins]].

y>z -> {x,z,y,k}\n(* Rule[Condition[List[PatternSequence[x, BlankNullSequence[]], Pattern[y, Blank[]], Pattern[z, Blank[]], PatternSequence[k, BlankNullSequence[]]], Greater[y, z]], List[x, z, y, k]] *)\n</source>\nThe {{code|/;}} operator is \"condition\", so that the rule only applies when {{code|y>z}}. The three underscores are an syntax for a {{code|BlankNullSequence[]}}, for a sequence that can be null.\n\nA ReplaceRepeated {{code|//.}} operator can be used to apply this rule repeatedly, until no more change happens:\n<source lang=mathematica>\n{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 } //. sortRule\n(* = ReplaceRepeated[{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 }, sortRule] *)\n(* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} *)\n</source>\n\nThe pattern matching system also easily gives rise to rule-based integration and derivation.

The three underscores are an syntax for a {{code|BlankNullSequence[]}}, for a sequence that can be null.\n\nA ReplaceRepeated {{code|//.}} operator can be used to apply this rule repeatedly, until no more change happens:\n<source lang=mathematica>\n{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 } //. sortRule\n(* = ReplaceRepeated[{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 }, sortRule] *)\n(* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} *)\n</source>\n\nThe pattern matching system also easily gives rise to rule-based integration and derivation.

He believed that contemporary buildings are disconnected with the past and so his architecture carries a memory which he calls \"issue is continuity between the past, the future and the present, and making people aware of their place in time and space.\" In a particular interview<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Shubert, Howard.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62593714|title=Richard Henriquez : selected works, 1964-2005|date=2006|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|others=Henriquez, Richard., Smedley, Geoffrey, 1927-, Enright, Robert.|isbn=1-55365-048-4|location=Berkeley, CA|oclc=62593714}}</ref>, Henriquez notes that roman cities were layed out by cardines (running north to south) and decamanus (running east to west), all in line with the rising sun. He believed that cities once had a relationship to nature, and wanted to take inspiration from the past.  He incorporates historic elements in a variety of ways such as relating the archaeology of the site to the traditional mythic stories that were passed down the generation.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also explored the depths of spatial relationships beyond the quintessential floor heights, material, setback, etc. but in their cosmic and metaphorical relationships elements. Henriquez says his work is \"not to invoke nostalgia but to rather give people a new way of looking at what they take for granted.\"<ref name=\":3\" />   \n\nHe was also known for bringing a distinct style of high-density urban design to Vancouver, designing buildings that have slim proportions, low rise buildings, view corridors and parks that create livable communities. A notable example would be the Sylvia hotel tower, with large glazing area and thin floorplates that influence the high rises of Vancouver for years to come. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/senate/hdr/1508.html|title=University of Manitoba - University Governance - Richard G. Henriquez, D.Litt., June 7, 2018|website=www.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>   \n\n== Childhood influences ==\nHenriquez was born from a modest family. When Henriquez was three years old, a hurricane almost destroyed his family's home. Later that year, he discovered his father - an agricultural instructor drafted in the war - was killed in action. <ref name=\":0\" /> Due to these circumstances, Henriquez and his siblings went on to live with their grandparents while the mother worked. During his time with his grandparents, Henriquez would hear stories on how his grandparents and his father lived in the past. Although he lacked first-hand contact with his father, he valued objects his father made before his passing such as wooden bowls and furniture. Henriquez comments that his interest in history may have stemmed from his absent father, inspiring the architectural work that he produced over the years.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Enright|first=Robert|date=1989|title=Richard Henriquez: Architect of Radical Memory|url=|journal=Border Crossings|volume=Volume 8 Number 4|issue=32|pages=76-85|via=}}</ref>  \n\nHenriquez also credits his grand-uncle for his inspiration of pursuing architecture. His grand-uncle was a multifaceted artisan that was a sculptor, painter, architect and an engineer. This influenced young Henriquez to follow his footsteps and explored artistic endeavors such as creating sculptures out of limestone and painting. None of his other 4 brothers and sisters followed the same artistic pursuits, although his older sister who grew up good at mathematics works with him as a bookkeeper in his firm.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGrowing up in Jamaica had affected Henriquez's design sensibility. In Jamaica, material was costly while labor was cheap and therefore, Henriquez believed that nothing of value should go to waste and should be instead reused. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Education ==\nOnce Henriquez graduated from highschool, he immediately pursued his Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Manitoba in Canada from 1958-1964.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe program was highly technical and even included four years of structural engineering in its curriculum.<ref name=\":3\" /> The school provided Henriquez with a strong technical base and taught him the construction and how to build buildings, but all his work was still constrained to reality and any superfluous work was considered illegitimate.  \n\nUpon graduation, Henriquez returned to Jamaica to work for McMorris Sibley Robinson Architects. <ref name=\":3\" /> It was here where he took on over a dozen projects including corporate, cultural and domestic projects. Many of these residential projects, were situated on hilltop sites or steep slopes, giving Henriquez experience later in his life when he designs for Vancouver\u2019s hilly topography.\n\nHenriquez eventually attended MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to complete his Masters degree. It was here that he developed his theoretical and philosophical views in architecture that would be the basis of his work for years to come.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor his final thesis project, Henriquez developed a conceptual scheme of a satellite town for 100,000 people near Germantown, Maryland. His project was an exploration of flexibility, adaptability, which Henriquez puts as \u201callowing them freedom to live as they choose and meaningful choice as to where and how they live\u201d. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/67263/24932606-MIT.pdf;sequence=2|title=Germantown - A Prototype Satellite Town for 100,000 People|last=Henriquez|first=Richard G.|date=1964|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Henriquez had always designed for, however it was in this project when he started to develop his philosophical stances in architecture. The project was deeply influenced by his supervisor, Lubicz-Nycz who believed that architecture is spiritual, where it must honor the past and carry its narrative, while allowing future growth. This narrative approach becomes and integral part of Henriquez's design process in his future works.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Selected projects  ==\n\n=== Sylvia Hotel Tower ===\nThe Sylvia Hotel Tower, built in 1984 was an addition to the Edward [[Sylvia Hotel]] (a once popular Vancouver hotel, and a current designated heritage landmark) located near the Vancouver waterfront. Henriquez designed the building by drawing inspiration from its unique site conditions and adjacencies. On the site's immediate east are the 1958 Ocean Towers, both eighteen-stories tall, slab-form apartment building built in Miami Modern style.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Shubert|first=Howard|date=1994|title=Making History Become Memory: The Architecture of Richard Henriquez|url=https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/71200/vol21_2_50_55.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|volume=1|pages=50-55|via=Dalhousie Library}}</ref> On its west side is the Sylvia Hotel, built originally as a luxury apartment but was converted to be a  luxury hotel to keep up with the finances during the economic downturn of the roaring twenties. The Sylvia hotel had a \"streaky bacon style\" aesthetic, meaning it was a brick building with its base and corner cornice capitals made of strips of stone in a lighter color.<ref name=\":0\" /> The main tower itself contained both aesthetic elements of the historic Sylvia tower and the more progressive Ocean Towers of the time. However, the design avoids typical postmodernist strategy of combining bits and pieces of the building to create a hybrid building, but instead, the two polarizing characteristics of the adjacent buildings are distinctly separated and juxtaposed. It is analogous to a clash between the polarizing \"black\" against the \"white\" rather than the typical homogenous \"grey\" of postmodern design. On the seaward corner of the building are floor-to-ceiling glazing that reveal the building's concrete structural frame, and oriented at a 30 degree angle against the cartesian site grid which frames the mountainous views across the waters.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe building also introduced the \"small-plate\" style tower to Vancouver, which has become a defining characteristic of Vancouver's downtown peninsula high-rises. In 1999, Canadian Architect magazine deemed the tower to be on of the most influential Canadian buildings of the twentieth century.<ref name=\":0\" />                        \n\n[[File:Sinclair Centre (17328555728).jpg|thumb|Outside view of the Sinclair Centre]]\n\n=== Sinclair Centre ===\nThe [[Sinclair Centre]], is a shopping complex that was built by Henriquez Partners Architects in collaboration with Toby Russell Buckwell Architects in 1986. The Sinclair Centre was originally four separate historic buildings, but the renovation unified the buildings into one shopping mall by connecting them in a glazed atrium. <ref name=\":2\" /> The federal government's wanted to have more of a presence of public services in Vancouver. Therefore, The program of Sinclair Centre was called to transform an entire block into government office complex mixed with retail and public functions and replacing the image of the building from being austere to being open and accessible.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Shack|first=Joel|date=1987-03-01|title=Sinclair Centre, Vancouver|url=|journal=The Canadian Architect|volume=32|issue=3|pages=11|via=Ryerson Library}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Sinclair Centre (48868006343).jpg|thumb|Interior view of the Sinclair Centre]]\n\nA main objective in the architecture is to create an open concept space, and therefore the creation of a T-shaped galleria. The design of the building preserved each of the four building's historic character and individuality while the glazing was designed in a neutral manner.<ref name=\":2\" />  \n\nThe building is named after James Sinclair, a businessman and politician that was the former president of Lafarge Cement in North America and the maternal grandfather of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mickleburgh|first=Rod|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/family-members-protest-sale-of-sinclair-centre/article692058/|title=Family members protest sale of Sinclair Centre|date=2007-08-21|work=The Globe & Mail|access-date=2019-04-07|url-status=live}}</ref>    \n\n=== Trent University Campus Environmental Sciences Building ===\n\nThe Trent University campus site is located in the midpoint of Toronto and Ottawa. Its masterplan was developed by Canadian Architect Ron Thom, that was an integration of modern buildings with respect to the surrounding natural environment in the style of Eero Saarinen's design of Morse and Ezra Stiles College in Yale University. Henriquez's plan to design the new Earth Science's building was based on Thom's direction and intention for the Trent University's masterplan, while avoiding overt imitation. For example, the animal-care centre was designed architecturally to be farm-like as an echo to its agricultural past as in line with Thom's original intentions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another example, the use of a wall fragment from the original Thom's masterplan is sloped upwards so that it meets the roof of the Environmental Sciences building. The purpose of this is to create a \"groundhog ramp\" That is, it honours the small critters that inhabit the area that were displaced by the construction of the building by providing a green roof, inviting critters to be part of its community. The building linked and unified the university's pedestrian circulation pathway. An outdoor accessible walkway connects the main campus to the adjacent chemistry building, a facility that was undergoing major growth when the Environmental Sciences building was proposed.<ref name=\":0\" />        \n\n=== BC Cancer Research Centre ===\n[[File:BC_Cancer_Research_Centre.jpg|thumb|BC Cancer Research Centre Petri Dish Facade]]\nConstructed in 2004, The [[BC Cancer Research Centre]] is a cancer research centre for facilities such as the Genome Sequencing Centre that is dedicated to cancer research projects. It is located across the street from the British Columbia Treatment Centre in Vancouver, a facility that connects benchtop-to-bedside research and treatment. This requires quick absorption and relay of constantly updates and information on therapy and cures. As a result, the building is designed for high flexibility. There are six floors laboratory are designed as modules on a grid. There are also six interstitial floors that allows for quick access to mechanical and electrical systems.<ref name=\":0\" /> This arrangement allows for minimal disruptions when laboratories need to be reconfigured. The main program for the building are two main blocks, one for office and another for laboratories. Sectionally, one level of laboratories correspond to two levels of offices.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://henriquezpartners.com/projects/bc-cancer-research-centre/|title=BC Cancer Research Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=Henriquez Partners Architects|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The laboratory and office blocks are separated by space as well as by their architectural features. For example, the laboratory block fa\u00e7ade showcased round windows that mimic petri dishes , while the office building facade had vertical oriented glazing that mimic an abstraction of chromosome 6, a main focus of the cancer research done in the facilities. The building has amenities such as library, food and theater facilities, penthouse lounge and an outdoor terrace.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2005, the building was deemed the first health-care facility in Canada to attain LEED Gold certification.<ref name=\":5\" /> Throughout this project, Richard Henriquez continues his motif on memory. By careful thought on the design's adaptable space and sustainability, Henriquez was able to create a continuity between the present and the future.                                  \n\n=== Justice Institute of British Columbia ===\nBuilt in 1992, the Justice Institute of British Columbia is a professional training centre for public safety officers and officials.t is located in New Westminster and brings students from around the globe. The overarching philosophy for the Justice Institute is that it is there to nurture communities rather than demonstration of force. <ref name=\":0\" />The facility Is 161,400 square feet that include training academies for court staff, police, firefighters, emergency response and paramedics. The architect takes inspiration by the working methods of a variety of sources, including Kevin Lynch and even Louis Kahn (rotunda with its staircase and balcony). One building is a cubic gymnasium building that has clerestory lighting, administrative building with student services on the ground floor. <ref name=\":0\" />The main administrative building is semi-circled shape that encapsulates the outdoor garden and pool, protecting it from traffic noise. On one end of the building is the main atrium, that contains a staircase that comes out of a proscenium arch. This is to simulate this central atrium space as a stage, where in training demonstrations, where students present in uniforms or costumes would be actors on stage, while the students watching would be the audience. The top of the atrium is a triangular glazed roof supported by thin trusses to allow ample light into the stage.<ref name=\":0\" />                                  \n\n=== Memory Theatre ===\nMemory Theatre is an exhibition showcasing twenty-five years of accomplishment by Richard Henriquez. It was a travelling exhibition co-produced by the Canadian Centre for Architecture and Vancouver Art Gallery. <ref name=\":4\" />The exhibition was physically a cylindrical structure that was held up by a surveyor's tripod and accessed by a bridge. Once visitors enter the cylindrical structure, they will be surrounded by ten cabinets with glass cases that contain found objects ranging from a diversity of architectural models, notes, sculptures, drawings, letters and photographs that demonstrate Henriquez's creative process. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Ann|date=1994-10-08|title=Memories are made of this; What we remember and what we forget are key in the art of Richard Henriquez: [FINAL Edition]|url=|journal=The Gazette|publication-place=Montreal, Quebec|volume=|pages=I5/BREAK|issn=03841294|via=Ryerson Library}}</ref> Right at the centre of the Theatre is a cylindrical globe.

He believed that contemporary buildings are disconnected with the past and so his architecture carries a memory which he calls \"issue is continuity between the past, the future and the present, and making people aware of their place in time and space.\" In a particular interview<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Shubert, Howard.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62593714|title=Richard Henriquez : selected works, 1964-2005|date=2006|publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|others=Henriquez, Richard., Smedley, Geoffrey, 1927-, Enright, Robert.|isbn=1-55365-048-4|location=Berkeley, CA|oclc=62593714}}</ref>, Henriquez notes that roman cities were layed out by cardines (running north to south) and decamanus (running east to west), all in line with the rising sun. He believed that cities once had a relationship to nature, and wanted to take inspiration from the past.  He incorporates historic elements in a variety of ways such as relating the archaeology of the site to the traditional mythic stories that were passed down the generation.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also explored the depths of spatial relationships beyond the quintessential floor heights, material, setback, etc. but in their cosmic and metaphorical relationships elements. Henriquez says his work is \"not to invoke nostalgia but to rather give people a new way of looking at what they take for granted.\"<ref name=\":3\" />   \n\nHe was also known for bringing a distinct style of high-density urban design to Vancouver, designing buildings that have slim proportions, low rise buildings, view corridors and parks that create livable communities. A notable example would be the Sylvia hotel tower, with large glazing area and thin floorplates that influence the high rises of Vancouver for years to come. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/senate/hdr/1508.html|title=University of Manitoba - University Governance - Richard G. Henriquez, D.Litt., June 7, 2018|website=www.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>   \n\n== Childhood influences ==\nHenriquez was born from a modest family. When Henriquez was three years old, a hurricane almost destroyed his family's home. Later that year, he discovered his father - an agricultural instructor drafted in the war - was killed in action. <ref name=\":0\" /> Due to these circumstances, Henriquez and his siblings went on to live with their grandparents while the mother worked. During his time with his grandparents, Henriquez would hear stories on how his grandparents and his father lived in the past. Although he lacked first-hand contact with his father, he valued objects his father made before his passing such as wooden bowls and furniture. Henriquez comments that his interest in history may have stemmed from his absent father, inspiring the architectural work that he produced over the years.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Enright|first=Robert|date=1989|title=Richard Henriquez: Architect of Radical Memory|url=|journal=Border Crossings|volume=Volume 8 Number 4|issue=32|pages=76-85|via=}}</ref>  \n\nHenriquez also credits his grand-uncle for his inspiration of pursuing architecture. His grand-uncle was a multifaceted artisan that was a sculptor, painter, architect and an engineer. This influenced young Henriquez to follow his footsteps and explored artistic endeavors such as creating sculptures out of limestone and painting. None of his other 4 brothers and sisters followed the same artistic pursuits, although his older sister who grew up good at mathematics works with him as a bookkeeper in his firm.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGrowing up in Jamaica had affected Henriquez's design sensibility. In Jamaica, material was costly while labor was cheap and therefore, Henriquez believed that nothing of value should go to waste and should be instead reused. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Education ==\nOnce Henriquez graduated from highschool, he immediately pursued his Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Manitoba in Canada from 1958-1964.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe program was highly technical and even included four years of structural engineering in its curriculum.<ref name=\":3\" /> The school provided Henriquez with a strong technical base and taught him the construction and how to build buildings, but all his work was still constrained to reality and any superfluous work was considered illegitimate.  \n\nUpon graduation, Henriquez returned to Jamaica to work for McMorris Sibley Robinson Architects. <ref name=\":3\" /> It was here where he took on over a dozen projects including corporate, cultural and domestic projects. Many of these residential projects, were situated on hilltop sites or steep slopes, giving Henriquez experience later in his life when he designs for Vancouver\u2019s hilly topography.\n\nHenriquez eventually attended MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to complete his Masters degree. It was here that he developed his theoretical and philosophical views in architecture that would be the basis of his work for years to come.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor his final thesis project, Henriquez developed a conceptual scheme of a satellite town for 100,000 people near Germantown, Maryland. His project was an exploration of flexibility, adaptability, which Henriquez puts as \u201callowing them freedom to live as they choose and meaningful choice as to where and how they live\u201d. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/67263/24932606-MIT.pdf;sequence=2|title=Germantown - A Prototype Satellite Town for 100,000 People|last=Henriquez|first=Richard G.|date=1964|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Henriquez had always designed for, however it was in this project when he started to develop his philosophical stances in architecture. The project was deeply influenced by his supervisor, Lubicz-Nycz who believed that architecture is spiritual, where it must honor the past and carry its narrative, while allowing future growth. This narrative approach becomes and integral part of Henriquez's design process in his future works.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Selected projects  ==\n\n=== Sylvia Hotel Tower ===\nThe Sylvia Hotel Tower, built in 1984 was an addition to the Edward [[Sylvia Hotel]] (a once popular Vancouver hotel, and a current designated heritage landmark) located near the Vancouver waterfront. Henriquez designed the building by drawing inspiration from its unique site conditions and adjacencies. On the site's immediate east are the 1958 Ocean Towers, both eighteen-stories tall, slab-form apartment building built in Miami Modern style.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Shubert|first=Howard|date=1994|title=Making History Become Memory: The Architecture of Richard Henriquez|url=|journal=https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/71200/vol21_2_50_55.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|volume=1|pages=50-55|via=Dalhousie Library}}</ref> On its west side is the Sylvia Hotel, built originally as a luxury apartment but was converted to be a  luxury hotel to keep up with the finances during the economic downturn of the roaring twenties. The Sylvia hotel had a \"streaky bacon style\" aesthetic, meaning it was a brick building with its base and corner cornice capitals made of strips of stone in a lighter color.<ref name=\":0\" /> The main tower itself contained both aesthetic elements of the historic Sylvia tower and the more progressive Ocean Towers of the time. However, the design avoids typical postmodernist strategy of combining bits and pieces of the building to create a hybrid building, but instead, the two polarizing characteristics of the adjacent buildings are distinctly separated and juxtaposed. It is analogous to a clash between the polarizing \"black\" against the \"white\" rather than the typical homogenous \"grey\" of postmodern design. On the seaward corner of the building are floor-to-ceiling glazing that reveal the building's concrete structural frame, and oriented at a 30 degree angle against the cartesian site grid which frames the mountainous views across the waters.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe building also introduced the \"small-plate\" style tower to Vancouver, which has become a defining characteristic of Vancouver's downtown peninsula high-rises. In 1999, Canadian Architect magazine deemed the tower to be on of the most influential Canadian buildings of the twentieth century.<ref name=\":0\" />                        \n\n[[File:Sinclair Centre (17328555728).jpg|thumb|Outside view of the Sinclair Centre]]\n\n=== Sinclair Centre ===\nThe [[Sinclair Centre]], is a shopping complex that was built by Henriquez Partners Architects in collaboration with Toby Russell Buckwell Architects in 1986. The Sinclair Centre was originally four separate historic buildings, but the renovation unified the buildings into one shopping mall by connecting them in a glazed atrium. <ref name=\":2\" /> The federal government's wanted to have more of a presence of public services in Vancouver. Therefore, The program of Sinclair Centre was called to transform an entire block into government office complex mixed with retail and public functions and replacing the image of the building from being austere to being open and accessible.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Shack|first=Joel|date=1987-03-01|title=Sinclair Centre, Vancouver|url=|journal=The Canadian Architect|volume=32|issue=3|pages=11|via=Ryerson Library}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Sinclair Centre (48868006343).jpg|thumb|Interior view of the Sinclair Centre]]\n\nA main objective in the architecture is to create an open concept space, and therefore the creation of a T-shaped galleria. The design of the building preserved each of the four building's historic character and individuality while the glazing was designed in a neutral manner.<ref name=\":2\" />  \n\nThe building is named after James Sinclair, a businessman and politician that was the former president of Lafarge Cement in North America and the maternal grandfather of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mickleburgh|first=Rod|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/family-members-protest-sale-of-sinclair-centre/article692058/|title=Family members protest sale of Sinclair Centre|date=2007-08-21|work=The Globe & Mail|access-date=2019-04-07|url-status=live}}</ref>    \n\n=== Trent University Campus Environmental Sciences Building ===\n\nThe Trent University campus site is located in the midpoint of Toronto and Ottawa. Its masterplan was developed by Canadian Architect Ron Thom, that was an integration of modern buildings with respect to the surrounding natural environment in the style of Eero Saarinen's design of Morse and Ezra Stiles College in Yale University. Henriquez's plan to design the new Earth Science's building was based on Thom's direction and intention for the Trent University's masterplan, while avoiding overt imitation. For example, the animal-care centre was designed architecturally to be farm-like as an echo to its agricultural past as in line with Thom's original intentions.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another example, the use of a wall fragment from the original Thom's masterplan is sloped upwards so that it meets the roof of the Environmental Sciences building. The purpose of this is to create a \"groundhog ramp\" That is, it honours the small critters that inhabit the area that were displaced by the construction of the building by providing a green roof, inviting critters to be part of its community. The building linked and unified the university's pedestrian circulation pathway. An outdoor accessible walkway connects the main campus to the adjacent chemistry building, a facility that was undergoing major growth when the Environmental Sciences building was proposed.<ref name=\":0\" />        \n\n=== BC Cancer Research Centre ===\n[[File:BC_Cancer_Research_Centre.jpg|thumb|BC Cancer Research Centre Petri Dish Facade]]\nConstructed in 2004, The [[BC Cancer Research Centre]] is a cancer research centre for facilities such as the Genome Sequencing Centre that is dedicated to cancer research projects. It is located across the street from the British Columbia Treatment Centre in Vancouver, a facility that connects benchtop-to-bedside research and treatment. This requires quick absorption and relay of constantly updates and information on therapy and cures. As a result, the building is designed for high flexibility. There are six floors laboratory are designed as modules on a grid. There are also six interstitial floors that allows for quick access to mechanical and electrical systems.<ref name=\":0\" /> This arrangement allows for minimal disruptions when laboratories need to be reconfigured. The main program for the building are two main blocks, one for office and another for laboratories. Sectionally, one level of laboratories correspond to two levels of offices.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://henriquezpartners.com/projects/bc-cancer-research-centre/|title=BC Cancer Research Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=Henriquez Partners Architects|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> The laboratory and office blocks are separated by space as well as by their architectural features. For example, the laboratory block fa\u00e7ade showcased round windows that mimic petri dishes , while the office building facade had vertical oriented glazing that mimic an abstraction of chromosome 6, a main focus of the cancer research done in the facilities. The building has amenities such as library, food and theater facilities, penthouse lounge and an outdoor terrace.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2005, the building was deemed the first health-care facility in Canada to attain LEED Gold certification.<ref name=\":5\" /> Throughout this project, Richard Henriquez continues his motif on memory. By careful thought on the design's adaptable space and sustainability, Henriquez was able to create a continuity between the present and the future.                                  \n\n=== Justice Institute of British Columbia ===\nBuilt in 1992, the Justice Institute of British Columbia is a professional training centre for public safety officers and officials.t is located in New Westminster and brings students from around the globe. The overarching philosophy for the Justice Institute is that it is there to nurture communities rather than demonstration of force. <ref name=\":0\" />The facility Is 161,400 square feet that include training academies for court staff, police, firefighters, emergency response and paramedics. The architect takes inspiration by the working methods of a variety of sources, including Kevin Lynch and even Louis Kahn (rotunda with its staircase and balcony). One building is a cubic gymnasium building that has clerestory lighting, administrative building with student services on the ground floor. <ref name=\":0\" />The main administrative building is semi-circled shape that encapsulates the outdoor garden and pool, protecting it from traffic noise. On one end of the building is the main atrium, that contains a staircase that comes out of a proscenium arch. This is to simulate this central atrium space as a stage, where in training demonstrations, where students present in uniforms or costumes would be actors on stage, while the students watching would be the audience. The top of the atrium is a triangular glazed roof supported by thin trusses to allow ample light into the stage.<ref name=\":0\" />                                  \n\n=== Memory Theatre ===\nMemory Theatre is an exhibition showcasing twenty-five years of accomplishment by Richard Henriquez.

This time, Smith hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]] that came with two outs and two runners in scoring position in the bottom of the fourth inning with the Rockies down, 1\u20130. The double drove in both runners to give Colorado a 2\u20131 lead. Smith then went on to score during the inning after a Matsui [[Single (baseball)|single]].

Smith played in seven games during the regular season, racking up five hits in eight at bats.\n\nSmith's successful stint during the regular season earned him a spot on the Rockies' 2007 postseason roster. In the [[2007 National League Division Series]] against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], Smith had one [[pinch hitter|pinch hit]] in two at bats. His lone hit came in the second game of the series in a 10\u20135 win against the Phillies. It was an [[infield hit]] in the top of the fourth inning that loaded the bases with the Rockies down, 3\u20132. The next batter, Colorado [[second baseman]] [[Kazuo Matsui]], went on to hit a memorable [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] to give the Rockies a lead that they would never relinquish. Colorado went on to sweep the Phillies in three games and then went on to sweep the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in four games in the [[2007 National League Championship Series]]. Once again, Smith had one pinch hit in two at bats. The one hit was in the fourth game of the series in a 6\u20134 series-clinching win against the Diamondbacks. This time, Smith hit a [[Double (baseball)|double]] that came with two outs and two runners in scoring position in the bottom of the fourth inning with the Rockies down, 1\u20130. The double drove in both runners to give Colorado a 2\u20131 lead. Smith then went on to score during the inning after a Matsui [[Single (baseball)|single]]. Colorado [[left fielder]] [[Matt Holliday]] also hit a three-run home run in the fourth inning to cap off a six-run fourth inning, all with two outs.\n\nSmith was the final out in the [[2007 World Series]], striking out against [[Boston Red Sox]]'s [[closer (baseball)|closer]] [[Jonathan Papelbon]]. In that postseason Smith excelled, hitting above .500.\n\nSmith hit his first career home run, a three-run shot, on May 25, [[2008 Colorado Rockies season|2008]], in a 4\u20131 home win over the [[New York Mets]].<ref>[http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=280525127 ESPN \u2013 Mets vs. Rockies \u2013 Recap \u2013 May 25, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He hit the home run off of [[John Maine]] in the bottom of the fourth inning.
