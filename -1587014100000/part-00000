Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following: suspension of [[election]]s and [[civil liberties]]; proclamation of a [[state of emergency]]; [[rule by decree]]; [[political repression|repression of political opponents]]; not abiding by the [[rule of law]] procedures, and [[cult of personality]].

They may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or may be [[Apoliticism|apolitical]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n{{main|Roman dictator}}\nOriginally an emergency legal appointment in the [[Roman Republic]], the term \"Dictator\" did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal [[Roman consul|Consular rule]] whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.\n\nThe term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Sulla|Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in [[Rome]] in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''[[de facto]]'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. [[Julius Caesar]] followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''[[Dictator perpetuo]]'', \"Dictator in perpetuity\", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination]] the following month.\n\nFollowing Julius' assassination, his heir [[Augustus]] was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=300|align=right|image1=2017 Freedom House world map.png|image2=EIU Democracy Index 2017.svg|caption1=Country ratings from Freedom House's ''Freedom in the World 2017'' survey concerning the state of world freedom in 2016<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf Freedom in The World 2017 - Populists and Autocrats: The Dual Threat to Global Democracy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727054703/https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf |date=2017-07-27 }} by ''Freedom House'', January 31, 2017</ref>\n<center>{{legend inline|#16A983|Free (86)}} {{legend inline|#E5B63B|Partly Free (59)}} {{legend inline|#6973A5|Not Free (50)}}</center>|caption2=2017 [[Democracy Index]] by ''[[The Economist]]'' in which countries marked in different shades of red of are considered undemocratic, with many being dictatorships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|title=Democracy Index 2017 - Economist Intelligence Unit|last=|first=|date=|website=EIU.com|access-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218214151/http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|archive-date=18 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></center>}}\nAs late as the second half of the 19th century, the term ''dictator'' had occasional positive implications. For example, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the national leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lajos-Kossuth</ref> When creating a provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] in [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] officially assumed the title of \"Dictator\" (see [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]]). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland, \"Dictator\" was also the official title of four leaders, the first being [[Ludwik Mieros\u0142awski]]. \n   \nPast that time, however, the term ''dictator'' assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a ''dictatorship'' is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself \"''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''\".<ref name=\"guardian_obit\">{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=2008-03-18 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205070235/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |archive-date=2013-12-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[movie]] ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.\n\nA benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an [[authoritarian]] leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with the regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator.

In other cases, the association is mere pretense.\n\nSome dictators have been masters of [[crowd manipulation]], such as Mussolini and Hitler. Others were more prosaic speakers, such as Stalin and Franco.  Typically the dictator's people seize control of all media, censor or destroy the opposition, and give strong doses of [[propaganda]] daily, often built around a [[cult of personality]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Morstein |first=Marx Fritz |display-authors=etal |title=Propaganda and Dictatorship |publisher=Princeton UP |isbn=978-1406747249|date=March 2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Modern usage in formal titles ==\n[[File:Ritratto di Giuseppe Garibaldi - Salvatore Lo Forte.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] proclaimed himself dictator of Sicily in 1860.]]\n[[File:Gen Aguinaldo.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Emilio Aguinaldo]], [[Dictatorial Government of the Philippines|Dictator of the Philippines]], 1889]]\nBecause of its negative and pejorative [[connotation]]s, modern authoritarian leaders very rarely (if ever) use the term ''dictator'' in their formal titles, instead they most often simply have title of [[President (government title)|president]].

The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.\n* ''The strong dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].\n* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to \"give their orders\", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately.

Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following: suspension of [[election]]s and [[civil liberties]]; proclamation of a [[state of emergency]]; [[rule by decree]]; [[political repression|repression of political opponents]]; not abiding by the [[rule of law]] procedures, and [[cult of personality]].

They may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or may be [[Apoliticism|apolitical]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n{{main|Roman dictator}}\nOriginally an emergency legal appointment in the [[Roman Republic]], the term \"Dictator\" did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal [[Roman consul|Consular rule]] whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.\n\nThe term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Sulla|Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in [[Rome]] in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''[[de facto]]'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. [[Julius Caesar]] followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''[[Dictator perpetuo]]'', \"Dictator in perpetuity\", officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination]] the following month.\n\nFollowing Julius' assassination, his heir [[Augustus]] was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.\n\n== Modern era ==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|width=300|align=right|image1=2017 Freedom House world map.png|image2=EIU Democracy Index 2017.svg|caption1=Country ratings from Freedom House's ''Freedom in the World 2017'' survey concerning the state of world freedom in 2016<ref>[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf Freedom in The World 2017 - Populists and Autocrats: The Dual Threat to Global Democracy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727054703/https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FH_FIW_2017_Report_Final.pdf |date=2017-07-27 }} by ''Freedom House'', January 31, 2017</ref>\n<center>{{legend inline|#16A983|Free (86)}} {{legend inline|#E5B63B|Partly Free (59)}} {{legend inline|#6973A5|Not Free (50)}}</center>|caption2=2017 [[Democracy Index]] by ''[[The Economist]]'' in which countries marked in different shades of red of are considered undemocratic, with many being dictatorships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|title=Democracy Index 2017 - Economist Intelligence Unit|last=|first=|date=|website=EIU.com|access-date=17 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218214151/http://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/Democracy_Index_2017.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWkRKbU1HWmxNVEUwTW1FdyIsInQiOiJPdlltVFV0blFRQzZNVERCZHhVeitZRElmUGplOHh3NWs1d2wzVzdRS1JvNU1kVmUxQVRESU9LbEVSOVwvR1F4aG1PV1NlS0ZZcng4NzBcLzVNZ09JOUxiZU5TTEVPekVHayttOTRqQkQ5TkNzWGNtRlowQTZ0UzlUK0pDdm9PVGlcLyJ9|archive-date=18 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref></center>}}\nAs late as the second half of the 19th century, the term ''dictator'' had occasional positive implications. For example, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the national leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lajos-Kossuth</ref> When creating a provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] in [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] officially assumed the title of \"Dictator\" (see [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]]). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland, \"Dictator\" was also the official title of four leaders, the first being [[Ludwik Mieros\u0142awski]]. \n   \nPast that time, however, the term ''dictator'' assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a ''dictatorship'' is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself \"''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''\".<ref name=\"guardian_obit\">{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=2008-03-18 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205070235/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |archive-date=2013-12-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the [[movie]] ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.\n\nA benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an [[authoritarian]] leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with the regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a dictator.

In other cases, the association is mere pretense.\n\nSome dictators have been masters of [[crowd manipulation]], such as Mussolini and Hitler. Others were more prosaic speakers, such as Stalin and Franco.

The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.\n* ''The strong dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].\n* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to \"give their orders\", rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the ''weak'' dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], who controlled Renaissance [[Florence]].\nNote that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in [[propaganda]] and controlling public opinion. [[Monarch]]s and [[Military dictatorship|military dictators]] are also excluded from these definitions, because their rule relies on the consent of other political powers (the [[nobility]] or the [[army]])..\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Authoritarian personality]]\n* [[Benevolent dictator for life]]\n* [[Benevolent dictatorship]]\n* [[Dictator novel]]\n* [[Emergency powers]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n* [[List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts by country]]\n* [[List of political leaders who held active military ranks in office]]\n* [[List of political leaders who suspended the constitution]]\n* [[Lists of state leaders by year]]\n* [[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Military rule (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Strongman (politics)]]\n*[[Supreme leader|Supreme Leader]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n* A&nbsp;{{note|Doctorate}}He conferred a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]] on himself from [[Makerere University]].<ref name=Byword>{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |title=Idi Amin: a byword for brutality |work=[[News24]] |accessdate=2007-12-02 |date=2003-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605070641/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html |archivedate=2008-06-05 }}</ref>\n* B&nbsp;{{note|VC}}The Victorious Cross (VC) was a medal made to emulate the British [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>Lloyd, Lorna (2007) p.239</ref>\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book| last=Bunce & Wolchik| first=Valerie, Sharon L.| ref=Bunce & Wolchik| year=2012| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=-IRc_W_YBV0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Socialism+Vanquished,+Socialism+Challenged:+Eastern+Europe+and+China,+1989-2009| title= Socialism Vanquished, Socialism Challenged: Eastern Europe and China, 1989-2009 | accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9780199996261}}\n* {{cite book| last=Issac| first=Jeffrey C.| ref=Issac| year=2000| publisher=[[Central European University Press]]|  url= https://books.google.com/?id=1pl5T45FwIwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Between+Past+and+Future:+The+Revolutions+of+1989+and+Their+Aftermath| title= Between Past and Future: The Revolutions of 1989 and Their Aftermath| accessdate=5 March 2013| isbn=9789639116719}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Pavlowitch\n  | first = Stevan K.\n  | year = 2002\n  | chapter = \n  | title = Serbia: The History of an Idea\n  | page = 128\n  | publisher = [[New York University Press]]\n  | location = New York, NY\n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u46G_l3Cz20C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serbia:+The+History+of+an+Idea\n  | isbn = 978-0-8147-6708-5\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* [http://www.planetrulers.com/current-dictators Current Dictators of the World]\n* [http://www.worldstatesmen.org/ WorldStatesmen]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dictatorship| ]]\n[[Category:Heads of government]]\n[[Category:Heads of state]]\n[[Category:Positions of authority]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Titles of national or ethnic leadership]]\n\n[[cs:Dikt\u00e1tor]]\n", "name_user": "Pastasauce1234", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator"}

A direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Happily N'Ever After 2: Snow White Another Bite @ the Apple]]'', was released on March 24, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with the idea that the [[Magician (fantasy)|Wizard]] controls all of the [[fairy tales]] and maintains the balance of good and evil in Fairy Tale Land. With the help of his assistants the uptight Munk and the decidedly goofy Mambo, the Wizard is checking to make sure that all the fairy tales under his care are \"on track\" to have their traditional [[happy ending]]s. As we meet him however, the Wizard is leaving for [[Scotland]] for a long-overdue vacation. He leaves the kingdom in the hands of Munk and Mambo.\n\nElla is a girl who is better known as [[Cinderella]]. She lives as a servant to her step family, dreams of the Prince who will sweep her off her feet. Her best friend at the palace is Rick, the palace dishwasher. Rick takes it upon himself to deliver the invitations to the royal ball to Ella. Ella sees Rick only as a friend, but Rick secretly loves Ella, although he is too cool and proud to admit it. Rick can't really understand what Ella likes about the Prince. Rick's Three Amigos, the comic chefs in the palace kitchen, believe that Rick has a bad case of \"Prince envy\".  The Prince does everything by the book, and plans to meet his maiden at the ball.\n \nHowever, things don't go as planned at the ball. Thanks to the assistants, Ella's evil stepmother, Frieda gains access to the Wizard's lair during the Prince's ball. She manages to chase off Munk and Mambo and tip the scales of good and evil, causing a series of fairy tales to go wrong and have unhappy endings, including [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] getting stepped on by the [[Giant (mythology)|Giant]] yet surviving, [[Rumpelstiltskin]] winning his bet with the miller's daughter and taking her baby, and the unseen demise of [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. She summons an army of trolls, witches, three [[Big Bad Wolf|Big Bad Wolves]], and Rumpelstiltskin to her castle. Ella finds out and escapes to the woods where she meets Munk and Mambo. The trio set out to find the prince who has goes looking for his maiden (not knowing it was actually Ella) in hopes that he will defeat Frieda and save the day.\n\nTogether, they flee to the [[Seven Dwarfs]] home. Witches and trolls led by [[The Snow Queen|The Ice Queen]] attack them. The Seven Dwarfs hold off the trolls, while they flee with the help of Rick who had stolen a flying broom. Frieda decides to go after Ella herself. She succeeds in capturing her and returns to the palace, with Rick, Munk and Mambo in pursuit. Frieda tortures Ella because if the story had run its course she would have married the prince while Frieda would never get anywhere in life. Rick, Munk, and Mambo slip into the castle and attack Frieda. During the fight, Frieda generates a pit in the floor. Mambo knocks her in, but she uses her staff to fly back up again. After a short battle, in which Rick takes a blast meant for Ella and falls into a deep sleep, Frieda creates a portal by accident. Ella knocks Frieda back and punches her into the portal. Rick awakes from the spell and he and Ella kiss, finally admitting their feelings for each other.\n\nElla and her true love Rick decide to choose their destinies in a world of happy endings and get married. Rumpelstiltskin has shown throughout the movie that he has come to care for the baby and the miller's daughter lets him stay in the castle as the baby's nanny. The Wizard returns from vacation where he wasn't told about what happened while he was away.\n\nIn the final scene, Frieda is shown trapped in the Arctic surrounded by [[elephant seal]]s.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Ella, a beautiful scullery maid from the tale \"Cinderella\" and the protagonist of the film. She was formerly in love with the Prince but later realized that her true love is her friend Rick.\n* [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] as Rick, a stressed out servant who works for the prince and finds him as a grand annoyance. He has a peculiar crush on Ella, enchanted by her beauty but wondering what she sees in the prince at all.\n* [[Andy Dick]] as Mambo, a rebellious and goofy purple cat-like creature who works for the wizard. Bored with the cycle of good endings, he wishes for things to go differently every once in a while but relents when he see how far out of control things went.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Munk, an uptight and smart orange [[pig]] creature who also works for the wizard. Unlike Mambo, he avoids causing trouble in the fairy tales'. He helps Ella stop Frieda from taking over fairy tale land. Although he and Mambo bicker, they're best friends.\n* [[Patrick Warburton]] as The Prince, the prince of the Cinderella story. Unlike the original prince, he is somewhat lazy and ignorant, but is determined to find his \"maiden\", Cinderella. He follows steps in a tiny booklet he carries around. His name is revealed to be Humperdink which is only mentioned in a deleted scene on the DVD release.\n* [[George Carlin]] as the Wizard, an ancient wizard who watches over the fairy tales of Fairy Tale Land making sure they go by the book and balances scales of good and evil to make sure they go well. He leaves his assistants in charge while he goes on vacation in Scotland.\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as Frieda, Cinderella's power hungry stepmother and the main antagonist. She takes over Fairy Tale Land by breaking the balance of good and evil on the scales and takes the Wizard's staff for more power.\n* [[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]] as [[Rumpelstiltskin]], the titular character from the tale \"Rumpelstiltskin\".

Witches and trolls led by [[The Snow Queen|The Ice Queen]] attack them. The Seven Dwarfs hold off the trolls, while they flee with the help of Rick who had stolen a flying broom. Frieda decides to go after Ella herself. She succeeds in capturing her and returns to the palace, with Rick, Munk and Mambo in pursuit. Frieda tortures Ella because if the story had run its course she would have married the prince while Frieda would never get anywhere in life. Rick, Munk, and Mambo slip into the castle and attack Frieda. During the fight, Frieda generates a pit in the floor. Mambo knocks her in, but she uses her staff to fly back up again. After a short battle, in which Rick takes a blast meant for Ella and falls into a deep sleep, Frieda creates a portal by accident. Ella knocks Frieda back and punches her into the portal. Rick awakes from the spell and he and Ella kiss, finally admitting their feelings for each other.\n\nElla and her true love Rick decide to choose their destinies in a world of happy endings and get married. Rumpelstiltskin has shown throughout the movie that he has come to care for the baby and the miller's daughter lets him stay in the castle as the baby's nanny.

Produced by [[ABC Studios]], the series was created by [[Joshua Safran]], who also served as the [[showrunner]]. [[Mark Gordon]], Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Safran are its executive producers. [[Michael Seitzman]] replaced Safran as the new showrunner and an executive producer in its third season, with Safran remaining as an executive producer. \n\n[[Priyanka Chopra]] stars as [[Alex Parrish]], who joins the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] after graduating from the [[FBI Academy]] and becomes a prime suspect in a terrorist attack on [[Grand Central Terminal]]. ''Quantico'' initially had two timelines: the present, when Parrish flees from captivity to prove her innocence, and the past, with her and her fellow recruits training at the academy, during which details of their individual lives are learned. The series switched to a single timeline from the middle of the second season onward.\n\nIn addition to Chopra, the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series, the original cast\u2014which changed significantly as the series progressed\u2014included [[Jake McLaughlin]], [[Yasmine Al Massri]], [[Johanna Braddy]], [[Tate Ellington]], and [[Graham Rogers (actor)|Graham Rogers]] as her fellow recruits, with [[Josh Hopkins]] and [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as their trainers at the FBI Academy in [[Quantico, Virginia]]. The series' first season was produced primarily in [[Montreal]], with [[downtown Montreal]] and [[Sherbrooke]], Canada standing in for [[New York City]] and [[Quantico, Virginia]] in the United States. Production moved to New York during the second season, with a few episodes being shot in Italy and Ireland for its third season.\n\n''Quantico'' received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Chopra's performance and the diversity of the cast. The \"confusing dual timelines\" were criticized by some. The series was nominated for four [[People's Choice Awards]], including Favorite Network TV Drama, with Chopra winning two: Favorite Actress in a New TV Series in [[42nd People's Choice Awards|2016]]\u2014making her the first South Asian to win a People's Choice Award\u2014and Favorite Dramatic TV Actress in [[43rd People's Choice Awards|2017]]. ABC canceled the series in May 2018, and it ended after three seasons.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Series overview==\n{{see also|List of Quantico episodes}}\nAlex Parrish, a former [[FBI]] recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a terrorist attack on [[Grand Central Terminal]] and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason for joining the Bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The present-day timeline focuses on Parrish's strained relationship with her friends while she is on the run and attempting to prove her innocence, even as additional violent attacks take place. \n\nIn the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI. In flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] recruit at [[Camp Peary|The Farm]] to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the present timeline, a hostage crisis at a G-20 summit in [[New York City]] is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President [[List of Quantico characters#Claire Hass|Claire Haas]] and CIA director [[List of Quantico characters#Matthew Keyes|Matthew Keyes]] form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by [[List of Quantico characters#Clay Haas|Clay Haas]]) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in the hostage crisis.\n\nThe third season is set three years after the events of the Constitutional Convention. After living anonymously in Italy, Parrish is forced to return to the United States after [[List of Quantico characters#Ryan Booth|Ryan Booth]] shares information to her about [[List of Quantico characters#Shelby Wyatt|Shelby Wyatt]]'s kidnapping by a notorious international arms dealer known as The Widow. In order to save Wyatt, Booth and Parrish recruit [[List of Quantico characters#Owen Hall|Owen Hall]] and [[List of Quantico characters#Harry Doyle|Harry Doyle]] to help them with their mission.

Produced by [[ABC Studios]], the series was created by [[Joshua Safran]], who also served as the [[showrunner]]. [[Mark Gordon]], Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Safran are its executive producers. [[Michael Seitzman]] replaced Safran as the new showrunner and an executive producer in its third season, with Safran remaining as an executive producer. \n\n[[Priyanka Chopra]] stars as [[Alex Parrish]], who joins the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] after graduating from the [[FBI Academy]] and becomes a prime suspect in a terrorist attack on [[Grand Central Terminal]]. ''Quantico'' initially had two timelines: the present, when Parrish flees from captivity to prove her innocence, and the past, with her and her fellow recruits training at the academy, during which details of their individual lives are learned. The series switched to a single timeline from the middle of the second season onward.\n\nIn addition to Chopra, the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series, the original cast\u2014which changed significantly as the series progressed\u2014included [[Jake McLaughlin]], [[Yasmine Al Massri]], [[Johanna Braddy]], [[Tate Ellington]], and [[Graham Rogers (actor)|Graham Rogers]] as her fellow recruits, with [[Josh Hopkins]] and [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as their trainers at the FBI Academy in [[Quantico, Virginia]]. The series' first season was produced primarily in [[Montreal]], with [[downtown Montreal]] and [[Sherbrooke]], Canada standing in for [[New York City]] and [[Quantico, Virginia]] in the United States. Production moved to New York during the second season, with a few episodes being shot in Italy and Ireland for its third season.\n\n''Quantico'' received positive reviews from critics, with praise for Chopra's performance and the diversity of the cast. The \"confusing dual timelines\" were criticized by some. The series was nominated for four [[People's Choice Awards]], including Favorite Network TV Drama, with Chopra winning two: Favorite Actress in a New TV Series in [[42nd People's Choice Awards|2016]]\u2014making her the first South Asian to win a People's Choice Award\u2014and Favorite Dramatic TV Actress in [[43rd People's Choice Awards|2017]]. ABC canceled the series in May 2018, and it ended after three seasons.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\n{{see also|List of Quantico episodes}}\nAlex Parrish, a former [[FBI]] recruit, becomes a prime suspect after a terrorist attack on [[Grand Central Terminal]] and is arrested for treason. In flashbacks, she and her fellow agents (each with their own reason for joining the Bureau) train at the FBI Academy. The present-day timeline focuses on Parrish's strained relationship with her friends while she is on the run and attempting to prove her innocence, even as additional violent attacks take place. \n\nIn the second season, Parrish has apparently been fired by the FBI. In flashbacks, she works undercover for the FBI as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] recruit at [[Camp Peary|The Farm]] to uncover the AIC, a rogue faction within the agency. In the present timeline, a hostage crisis at a G-20 summit in [[New York City]] is initiated by the Citizens Liberation Front, a terrorist group. Two weeks after the crisis, President [[List of Quantico characters#Claire Hass|Claire Haas]] and CIA director [[List of Quantico characters#Matthew Keyes|Matthew Keyes]] form a covert CIA-FBI task force (led by [[List of Quantico characters#Clay Haas|Clay Haas]]) to expose eight conspirators who were secretly involved in the hostage crisis.\n\nThe third season is set three years after the events of the Constitutional Convention. After living anonymously in Italy, Parrish is forced to return to the United States after [[List of Quantico characters#Ryan Booth|Ryan Booth]] shares information to her about [[List of Quantico characters#Shelby Wyatt|Shelby Wyatt]]'s kidnapping by a notorious international arms dealer known as The Widow. In order to save Wyatt, Booth and Parrish recruit [[List of Quantico characters#Owen Hall|Owen Hall]] and [[List of Quantico characters#Harry Doyle|Harry Doyle]] to help them with their mission. Hall invites [[List of Quantico characters#Jocelyn Turner|Jocelyn Turner]] to the team as the former FBI agent has intelligence about the arms dealer, due in part to their past encounter. Owing to the extreme circumstances of the covert operation, the team must retrieve Wyatt at all costs, before time runs out.\n{{:List of Quantico episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Quantico characters}}\n* [[Priyanka Chopra]] as [[Alex Parrish]], a promising FBI agent who becomes a prime suspect in the Grand Central Terminal bombing case<ref name=\"alex\" /> \n* [[Josh Hopkins]] as Liam O'Connor, a seasoned FBI agent who was demoted to work at the FBI academy as a teacher<ref name=\"liam\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Jake McLaughlin]] as Ryan Booth, an undercover FBI agent tasked with tracking Alex<ref name=\"castroundup\" /> \n* [[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Miranda Shaw, former assistant director of the FBI Academy at Quantico<ref name=\"miranda\" /> (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Graham Rogers (actor)|Graham Rogers]] as Caleb Haas, a former FBI agent<ref name=\"caleb\" /> (season 1, guest season 2)\n* [[Yasmine Al Massri]] as Nimah and Raina Amin, twins recruited by Miranda for the FBI<ref name=\"castroundup\" /> (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Johanna Braddy]] as Shelby Wyatt, Alex's best friend and fellow FBI agent<ref name=\"castroundup\" />\n* [[Tate Ellington]] as Simon Asher, Alex's fellow FBI trainee<ref name=\"simon\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Anabelle Acosta]] as Natalie Vasquez, an FBI trainee and Alex's former rival at the academy<ref name=\"natalie\" /> (season 1)\n* [[Russell Tovey]] as Harry Doyle, a former [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent and one of the CIA recruits at The Farm<ref name=\"harry\" /> (seasons 2\u20133)\n* [[Pearl Thusi]] as Dayana Mampasi, an attorney and one of the CIA recruits at The Farm<ref name=\"dayana\" /> (season 2)\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Owen Hall, a former CIA lead instructor at The Farm and current Deputy Director of the FBI<ref name=\"owen\" /> (seasons 2\u20133)\n* [[Marlee Matlin]] as Jocelyn Turner, an ex-FBI agent and undercover expert whose career was derailed after she was rendered deaf from a bombing<ref name=\"jocelynturner\" /> (season 3)\n* [[Alan Powell (actor)|Alan Powell]] as Mike McQuigg, an overly assertive and adept FBI operative with several years of undercover experience<ref name=\"mikemcquigg\" /> (season 3)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=To me this series is like those high octane summer blockbuster movies we used to have in the '80s and '90s with all of the action and stuff, but there's also like this Trojan horse quality to it as well in that within all the action you get to talk about domestic terrorism, religion, politics, and belief systems.

Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2013red and grey.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

'''jaguarundi''' (''Herpailurus yagouaroundi'') ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) is a wild [[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2013red and grey.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.
