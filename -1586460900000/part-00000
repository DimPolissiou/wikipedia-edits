Around 7,000 couples marry there each year.\n\n[[File:Vadapalani Temple 2.JPG|thumb|left|200 px|Main Entrance to the Temple from the [[Inner Ring Road, Chennai|Inner Ring Road]]]]\n\nAccording to the sthalapurana, Muruga devotee Annaswami Nayakar built the shed and kept a Murugan painting there for his personal worship. During his worship, he experienced divine power entering his body and inspiring him to speak surprising things later found to be true. His utterances were labeled 'arul vakku' ('God blessed statements') and could cure diseases, provide jobs, solemnize marriages and more.\n\n== Sannidhis (deities) ==\n\nMany sannidhis are present in the temple courtyards, including Varasiddhi Vinayaka, Chokkan\u0101thar (Lord [[Shiva]]), Meenakshi Amman, K\u0101li, Bhairava, Shanmuga with Valli and Devasen\u0101.\n\nThe [[moolavar]] in standing posture resembles Palani Murugan. In the inner prakara, many niches house Dakshina Murti, Chandikeswar, Mahalakshmi, and others. It has a spacious hall used for marriages and religious discourse. It is one of the most-frequented Murugan shrines in Chennai.\n\nThe entrance to this temple is crowned with a [[Rajagopuram]] adorned with several stucco images depicting legends from the [[Skanda Purana]]. In front of the temple is the temple tank. The eastern tower rises to a height of 40.8 metres. The 108 [[bharata natyam]] dance gestures can be seen on the eastern tower.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Vadapalani Andavar Temple}}\n* {{official website|http://www.vadapalaniandavartemple.tnhrce.in}}\n* [http://murugan.org/temples/vadapalani.htm Vadapalani Dandayudhapani Temple]\n* [http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/new_en.php?id=16 Dinamalar]\n\n{{Portal|India|Hinduism}}\n{{Chennai Topics}}\n{{Places of worship in Chennai}}\n{{Murugan temples}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Chennai]]\n[[Category:Murugan temples in Tamil Nadu]]\n\n\n{{India-Hindu-temple-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=September 2018}}\n{{Infobox Mandir\n| name               = Vadapalani Aandavar Temple\n| image              = Vadapalani murugan temple tank.jpg\n| alt          = \n| caption            = \n| map_type        = India Chennai\n| map_caption        = Location in Chennai\n| coordinates        = {{coord|13|03|10|N|80|12|49|E|type:landmark_region:IN|display=inline,title}}\n| other_names        = \n| proper_name        =\n \n| country            = [[India]]\n| state              = [[Tamil Nadu]]\n| district           = [[Chennai]]\n| location           = [[Vadapalani]]\n| elevation_m        = \n| deity  = Vadapalani Aandavar ([[Lord Muruga]])\n| primary_deity_Godess = \n| utsava_deity_God   = \n| utsava_deity_Godess= \n| Direction_posture  = \n| Pushakarani        = \n| Vimanam            = \n| Poets              = \n| Prathyaksham       = \n| festivals= \n| architecture       = [[Dravidian architecture]]\n| temple_quantity  = \n| monument_quantity= \n| inscriptions       = \n| year_completed         = \n| creator            = \n| website            = http://www.vadapalaniandavartemple.tnhrce.in\n}}\n\n'''Vadapalani Andavar Temple''' is a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple dedicated to [[Lord Muruga]].

Around 7,000 couples marry there each year.\n\n[[File:Vadapalani Temple 2.JPG|thumb|left|200 px|Main Entrance to the Temple from the [[Inner Ring Road, Chennai|Inner Ring Road]]]]\n\nAccording to the sthalapurana, Muruga devotee Annaswami Nayakar built the shed and kept a Murugan painting there for his personal worship. During his worship, he experienced divine power entering his body and inspiring him to speak surprising things later found to be true. His utterances were labeled 'arul vakku' ('God blessed statements') and could cure diseases, provide jobs, solemnize marriages and more.\n\n== Sannidhis (deities) ==\n\nMany sannidhis are present in the temple courtyards, including Varasiddhi Vinayaka, Chokkan\u0101thar (Lord [[Shiva]]), Meenakshi Amman, K\u0101li, Bhairava, Shanmuga with Valli and Devasen\u0101.\n\nThe [[moolavar]] in standing posture resembles Palani Murugan. In the inner prakara, many niches house Dakshina Murti, Chandikeswar, Mahalakshmi, and others. It has a spacious hall used for marriages and religious discourse. It is one of the most-frequented Murugan shrines in Chennai.\n\nThe entrance to this temple is crowned with a [[Rajagopuram]] adorned with several stucco images depicting legends from the [[Skanda Purana]]. In front of the temple is the temple tank. The eastern tower rises to a height of 40.8 metres. The 108 [[bharata natyam]] dance gestures can be seen on the eastern tower.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Vadapalani Andavar Temple}}\n* {{official website|http://www.vadapalaniandavartemple.tnhrce.in}}\n* [http://murugan.org/temples/vadapalani.htm Vadapalani Dandayudhapani Temple]\n* [http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/new_en.php?id=16 Dinamalar]\n\n{{Portal|India|Hinduism}}\n{{Chennai Topics}}\n{{Places of worship in Chennai}}\n{{Murugan temples}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Chennai]]\n[[Category:Murugan temples in Tamil Nadu]]\n\n\n{{Hindu-temple-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Titodutta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:stub classify", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadapalani_Andavar_Temple"}
