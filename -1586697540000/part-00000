The bulk of the volcanic field is in the [[Talca Province|Talca province]] of Chile's [[Maule Region]]. It is a segment of the [[Southern Volcanic Zone]], part of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]]. Many of the volcanic centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during [[postglacial]] times, after [[glacier]]s had retreated from the area. This activity has generated [[Volcanic cone|cones]], [[lava dome]]s, [[Lava dome#Lava coul\u00e9es|lava coulees]] and [[lava flows]] which surround [[Laguna del Maule]] lake. The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the [[Maule River|Maule river]]. Some of the volcanic centres were active during and before the [[last glacial period|last glaciation]]; at least three [[caldera]] formation events are associated with the system.\n\nAbout 130 {{Nbsp}}[[volcanic vents]] belong to the field, whose activity began 1.5{{Nbsp}}million years ago and continued into the [[Holocene]]. Postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with simultaneous [[Explosive eruption|explosive]] and [[Effusive eruption|effusive]] components, and [[volcanic rock]]s in the field vary from [[basalt]] over [[andesite]] and [[dacite]] to [[rhyolite]]. The field was a source of [[obsidian]] with regional importance.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, [[Bradyseism|ground inflation]] began in the volcanic field, indicating the intrusion of a [[Sill (geology)|sill]] beneath it. The rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as [[Uturunku]] in [[Bolivia]] and [[Yellowstone Caldera|Yellowstone]] in the United States and has been accompanied by anomalies in soil gas emission and [[seismic activity]]. This pattern has created concern about the potential for impending large-scale eruptive activity.\n\n== Geography and structure ==\n[[File:Descabezado Grande y Cerro Azul.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cerro Azul, on the right is at the northern edge of the Southern Volcanic Zone]]\n[[File:R\u00edo Blanco y Chait\u00e9n en erupci\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chait\u00e9n, here erupting, is located in the southern part of the Southern Volcanic Zone]]\nThe Laguna del Maule [[volcanic field]] is centred around {{coord|36.1|S|70.5|W}}, straddling the Chilean-[[Argentine]] frontier with most of the complex on the Chilean side.

The bulk of the volcanic field is in the [[Talca Province|Talca province]] of Chile's [[Maule Region]]. It is a segment of the [[Southern Volcanic Zone]], part of the [[Andean Volcanic Belt]]. Many of the volcanic centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during [[postglacial]] times, after [[glacier]]s had retreated from the area. This activity has generated [[Volcanic cone|cones]], [[lava dome]]s, [[Lava dome#Lava coul\u00e9es|lava coulees]] and [[lava flows]] which surround [[Laguna del Maule]] lake. The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the [[Maule River|Maule river]]. Some of the volcanic centres were active during and before the [[last glacial period|last glaciation]]; at least three [[caldera]] formation events are associated with the system.\n\nAbout 130 {{Nbsp}}[[volcanic vents]] belong to the field, whose activity began 1.5{{Nbsp}}million years ago and continued into the [[Holocene]]. Postglacial volcanic activity has included eruptions with simultaneous [[Explosive eruption|explosive]] and [[Effusive eruption|effusive]] components, and [[volcanic rock]]s in the field vary from [[basalt]] over [[andesite]] and [[dacite]] to [[rhyolite]]. The field was a source of [[obsidian]] with regional importance.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, [[Bradyseism|ground inflation]] began in the volcanic field, indicating the intrusion of a [[Sill (geology)|sill]] beneath it. The rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as [[Uturunku]] in [[Bolivia]] and [[Yellowstone Caldera|Yellowstone]] in the United States and has been accompanied by anomalies in soil gas emission and [[seismic activity]]. This pattern has created concern about the potential for impending large-scale eruptive activity.\n\n== Geography and structure ==\n[[File:Descabezado Grande y Cerro Azul.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Cerro Azul, on the right is at the northern edge of the Southern Volcanic Zone]]\n[[File:R\u00edo Blanco y Chait\u00e9n en erupci\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Chait\u00e9n, here erupting, is located in the southern part of the Southern Volcanic Zone]]\nThe Laguna del Maule [[volcanic field]] is centred around {{coord|36.1|S|70.5|W}}, straddling the Chilean-[[Argentine]] frontier with most of the complex on the Chilean side.

{"title_page": "Female infanticide in India", "text_new": "{{Use Indian English|date=December 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Violence against women}}\n\n'''Female infanticide in India''' has a history spanning centuries. [[Poverty in India|Poverty]], the [[Dowry system in India|dowry system]], births to unmarried women, deformed infants, famine, lack of support services and maternal illnesses such as [[postpartum depression]] are among the causes that have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of [[female infanticide]] in India.\n\nAlthough infanticide has been criminalised in India, it remains an under-reported crime due to the lack of reliable data. In 2010, the [[National Crime Records Bureau]] reported approximately 100 male and female infanticides, producing an official rate of less than one case of infanticide per million people.\n\nThe Indian practice of female infanticide and of [[sex-selective abortion]] have been cited to explain in part a gender imbalance that has been reported as being increasingly distorted since the [[1991 Census of India]], although there are also other influences that might affect the trend.{{sfnp|Hundal|2013|ps=}}\n\n== Definition ==\nSection 315 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] defines infanticide as the killing of an infant in the 0\u20131 year age group. The Code uses this definition to differentiate between infanticide and numerous other crimes against children, such as [[Female foeticide in India|foeticide]] and [[murder]].{{sfnp|National Crime Records Bureau|2010|p=1|ps=}}{{efn|According to statistics published by the [[National Crime Records Bureau]], a department of the [[Government of India]], kidnapping and abduction represented 40.3 per cent of recorded crimes against children in 2010, rape was 20.5 per cent, murder (other than infanticide) was 5.3 per cent, and exposure and abandonment was 2.7 per cent. All other crimes against children accounted for 31.5 per cent.{{sfnp|National Crime Records Bureau|2010|p=6|ps=}}}}\n\nSome scholarly publications on infanticide use the legal definition.{{sfnp|Craig|2004|ps=: referring to the United Kingdom [[Infanticide Act 1938]].}}{{sfnp|Miller|1987|p=97|ps=: \"Most broadly defined, infanticide applies to the killing of children under the age of twelve months (deaths after that age would generally be classified as child ''homicide'', although the definition and, hence, duration of childhood is culturally variable).\" }} Others, such as the collaboration of Renu Dube, Reena Dube and Rashmi Bhatnagar, who describe themselves as \"postcolonial feminists\", adopt a broader scope for ''infanticide'', applying it from foeticide through to [[femicide]] at an unspecified age.{{sfnp|Dube|Dube|Bhatnagar|1999|p=74|ps=}} Barbara Miller, an anthropologist, has \"for convenience\"  used the term to refer to all non-accidental deaths of children up to the age of around 15\u201316, which is culturally considered to be the age when childhood ends in rural India. She notes that the act of infanticide can be \"outright\", such as a physical beating, or take a \"passive\" form through actions such as neglect and starvation. [[Neonaticide]], being the killing of a child within 24 hours of birth, is sometimes considered as a separate study.{{sfnp|Miller|1987|pp=96-97|ps=}}\n\n== Colonial period ==\n\n=== Causation ===\nBritish colonists in India first became aware of the practice of female infanticide in 1789, during the period of [[Company Rule in India|Company Rule]]. It was noted among members of a [[Rajput]] clan by [[Jonathan Duncan (Governor of Bombay)|Jonathan Duncan]], then the [[British Resident]] in [[Jaunpur district]] of what is now the northern [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Later, in 1817, officials noted that the practice was so entrenched that there were entire [[taluk]]s of the [[Jadeja]] Rajputs in [[Gujarat]] where no female children of the clan existed.{{sfnp|Vishwanath|2007|p=270|ps=}} In the mid-19th century, a magistrate who was stationed in the north-west of the country claimed that for several hundred years no daughter had ever been raised in the strongholds of the Rajahs of [[Mainpuri district|Mynpoorie]] and that only after the intervention of a [[District Collector]] in 1845 did the Rajput ruler there keep a daughter alive.{{sfnp|Miller|1987|pp=97\u201398|ps=}} The British identified other [[Caste in India|high-caste]] communities as practitioners in north, western and central areas of the country; these included the [[Ahir]]s, [[Bedi clan|Bedis]], [[Gurjar]]s, [[Jat people|Jats]], [[Khatri]]s, [[Kanbi|Lewa Kanbis]], [[Mohyal]] Brahmins and [[Patidar]]s.{{sfnp|Vishwanath|2007|p=270|ps=}}{{sfnp|Snehi|2003|ps=}}\n\nAccording to [[Marvin Harris]], another anthropologist and among the first proponents of [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]], these killings of legitimate children occurred only among the Rajputs and other elite land-owning and warrior groups. The rationale was mainly economic, lying in a desire not to split land and wealth among too many heirs and in avoiding the payment of dowries. Sisters and daughters would marry men of similar standing and thus pose a challenge to the cohesion of wealth and power, whereas concubines and their children would not and thus could be allowed to live.{{sfnp|Scott|2001|pp=6-7|ps=: Citing {{cite book |title=Our Kind: Who We Are, Where We Came From, Where We Are Going |first=Marvin |last=Harris |authorlink=Marvin Harris |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1989 |isbn= |pages=213, 226\u2013227}}}}{{sfnp|Harris|1998|p=558|ps=}} He further argues that the need for warriors in the villages of a pre-industrial society meant female children were devalued, and the combination of war casualties and infanticide acted as a necessary form of population control.{{sfnp|Hawkes|1981|ps=}}\n\n[[Sociobiology|Sociobiologists]] have a different theory to Harris. Indeed, his theory and interest in the topic of infanticide is born of his more generalised opposition to the sociobiological hypothesis of the procreative imperative.{{sfnp|Scott|2001|p=6|ps=}}{{sfnp|Kuznar|Sanderson|2007|p=209|ps=}} According to this theory of imperative, based on the 19th-century vogue for explanations rooted in evolution and its premise of natural selection,{{sfnp|Scott|2001|pp=3-4|ps=}} the biological differences between men and women meant that many more children could be gained among the elites through support for male offspring, whose fecundity was naturally much greater: the line would spread and grow more extensively. Harris believes this to be a fallacious explanation because the elites had sufficient wealth easily to support both male and female children.{{sfnp|Harris|1998|p=558|ps=}} Thus, Harris and others, such as [[William Divale]], see female infanticide as a way to restrict population growth, while sociobiologists such as [[Mildred Dickemann]] view the same practice as a means of expanding it.{{sfnp|Hawkes|1981|ps=}}\n\nAnother anthropologist, [[Kristen Hawkes]], has criticised both of these theories. On the one hand, opposing Harris, she says both that the quickest way to get more male warriors would have been to have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory she points out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.{{sfnp|Hawkes|1981|ps=}}\n\n=== Reliability of colonial reports on infanticide ===\n\nThere is no data for the [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] in India prior to the British colonial era. Reliant as the British were on local high-caste communities for the collection of taxes and the maintenance of law and order, the administrators were initially reluctant to peer too deeply into their private affairs, such as the practice of infanticide. Although this did change in the 1830s, the reluctance reappeared following the cathartic events of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], which caused government by the [[East India Company]] to be supplanted by the [[British Raj]].{{sfnp|Vishwanath|2007|pp=268-269|ps=}} In 1857, John Cave Browne, a chaplain serving in [[Bengal Presidency]], reported a Major Goldney speculating that the practice of female infanticide among the Jats in the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] originated from \"Malthusian motives\".{{sfnp|Browne|1857|pp=121\u2013122|ps=}} In the Gujarat region, the first cited examples of discrepancies in the sex ratio among Lewa Patidars and [[Kunbi|Kanbis]] dates from 1847.{{sfnp|Vishwanath|2007|p=278|ps=}} These historical records have been questioned by modern scholars. The British made their observations from a distance and never mixed with their Indian subjects to understand their poverty, frustrations, life or culture at close hand.{{sfnp|Cohn|1996|p=10|ps=}} Browne documented his speculations on female infanticide using \"they tell\" hearsay.{{sfnp|Browne|1857|pp=121\u2013122|ps=}} [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard Cohn]] states that the colonial British residents in India would not accuse an individual or family of infanticide as the crime was difficult to prove in a British court, nevertheless accused an entire clan or social group of female infanticide. Cohn says, \"female infanticide thus became a 'statistical crime'\", during the colonial rule of India.{{sfnp|Cohn|1996|pp=10-11|ps=}}\n\nAside from numerous reports and correspondence on infanticide from colonial officials,{{sfnp|Snehi|2003|ps=}} there was also documentation from Christian missionaries. who were significant writers of ethnographies of India during the 19th century. They sent letters back to Britain announcing their missionary accomplishments and characterising the culture as savage, ignorant and depraved.{{sfnp|Grey|2011|ps=}}{{sfnp|Dirks|2001|pp=173-174|ps=}} Scholars have questioned this distorted construction of Indian culture during the colonial era, stating that infanticide was as common in England during the 18th and 19th century, as in India.{{sfnp|Grey|2011|ps=}}<ref name=\"anagol\">{{cite journal |first=Padma |last=Anagol |authorlink = Padma Anagol |title=The Emergence of the Female Criminal in India: Infanticide and Survival under the Raj |journal=History Workshop Journal |issue=53 |date=Spring 2002 |pages=73\u201393 |jstor=4289774 }}</ref><ref>GA Oddie (1994), Orientalism and British [[Protestant]] missionary constructions of India in the nineteenth century, Journal of South Asian Studies, 17(2), pp. 27\u201342</ref> Some British Christian missionaries of the late 19th century, states Daniel Grey, wrongly believed that female infanticide was sanctioned by the scriptures of Hinduism and Islam, and against which Christianity had \"centuries after centuries come into victorious conflict\".{{sfnp|Grey|2011|ps=}}\n\n=== Location and direct method ===\n\n[[File:6th Earl of Mayo.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo]], who was [[Governor-General of India]] at the time of the [[Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870]].]]\n\nA review of scholarship by Miller has shown that the majority of female infanticides in India during the colonial period occurred in the north-west, and that it was widespread although not all groups carried out this practice.{{sfnp|Miller|1987|p=99|ps=}}\n\n[[David Arnold (historian)|David Arnold]], a member of the [[Subaltern studies|subaltern studies group]] who has used a lot of contemporary sources, says that various methods of outright infanticide were used, including reputedly including poisoning with [[opium]], strangulation and suffocation. Poisonous substances such as the root of the ''[[plumbago rosea]]'' and [[arsenic]] were used for abortion, with the latter also ironically being used as an [[aphrodisiac]] and cure for [[male impotence]]. The act of direct infanticide among Rajputs was usually performed by women, often the mother herself or a nurse. Administration of poison was in any event a type of killing particularly associated with women; Arnold describes it as \"often murder by proxy\", with the man at a remove from the event and thus able to claim innocence.{{sfnp|Arnold|2013|pp=176, 179|ps=}}\n\nThe passing of the [[Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870]] made the practice illegal in the [[British India]]n regions of Punjab and the [[North-Western Provinces]].{{sfnp|Miller|1987|p=99|ps=}} The [[Governor-General of India]] had the authority to expand the Act to other regions at his discretion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Impact of famines on infanticide ===\n\nMajor [[Famine in India|famines occurred in India]] every five to eight years in the 19th- and early 20th-centuries,<ref>B Murton (2000), Famine, in The Cambridge World History of Food 2, pp. 1411\u20131427, Cambridge University Press</ref><ref>Mike Davis (2001), Late Victorian Holocausts: El Ni\u00f1o Famines and the Making of the Third World, pp. 7\u20138, Verso</ref> resulting in millions starving to death.<ref>Mike Davis (2004), Liberation Ecologies: Environment, Development and Social Movements, pp. 44\u201349, Routledge</ref><ref>A Sen (1983), Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation, Oxford University Press</ref> As also happened in China, these events begat infanticide: desperate starving parents would either kill a suffering infant, sell a child to buy food for the rest of the family, or beg people to take them away for nothing and feed them.<ref name=cog1>Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da, Famine: A Short History, pp. 61\u201367, Princeton University Press</ref><ref>William Digby, The Famine Campaign in Southern India (Madras and Bombay): 1876\u20131878, pp. 458\u2013459, Longmans London</ref><ref name=gupshu1>Gupta and Shuzhuo, Gender Bias in China, South Korea and India 1920\u20131990: Effects of War, Famine and Fertility Decline, Development and Change, Volume 30, Issue 3, pp. 619\u2013652, July 1999</ref> Gupta and Shuzhou state that massive famines and poverty-related historical events had influenced historical sex ratios, and they have had deep cultural ramifications on girls and regional attitudes towards female [[infant mortality]].<ref name=gupshu1 />\n\n=== Impact of economic policies on infanticide ===\n\nAccording to [[Mara Hvistendahl]], documents left behind by the colonial administration following [[Partition of India|independence]] showed a direct correlation between the taxation policies of the [[British East India Company]] and the rise in female infanticide.{{sfnp|Hvistendahl|2011|p=67|ps=}}\n\n=== Regional and religious demographics ===\n\nThe [[Census of India prior to independence|decennial census of India]] from 1881 through 1941 recorded a consistently skewed ratio whereby the number of males exceeded the number of females. The gender difference was particularly high in north and western regions of India, with an overall sex ratio&nbsp;\u2013 males per 100 females&nbsp;\u2013 of between 110.2 and 113.7 in the north over the 60-year period, and 105.8 to 109.8 males for every 100 female in western India for all ages. Visaria states that female deficit among Muslims was markedly higher, next only to Sikhs. South India region was an exception reporting excess females overall, which scholars attribute partly to selective emigration of males and the regional practice of matriarchy.{{sfn|Visaria|Visaria|Patel|1983|pp=496-499}}\n\nThe overall sex ratios, and excess males, in various regions were highest among the [[Islam in India|Muslim population of India]] from 1881 to 1941, and the sex ratio of each region correlated with the proportion of its Muslim population, with the exception of eastern region of India where the overall sex ratio was relatively low while it had a high percentage of Muslims in the population.{{sfn|Visaria|Visaria|Patel|1983|p=499 with footnote 2}} If regions that are now part of modern Pakistan are excluded (Baluchistan, North West Frontier, Sind for example), Visaria states that the regional and overall sex ratios for the rest of India over the 1881\u20131941 period improve in favour of females, with a lesser gap between male and female population.{{sfn|Visaria|Visaria|Patel|1983|p=499 with footnote 1}}\n\n== Contemporary data and statistics ==\n\nInfanticide in India, and elsewhere in the world, is a difficult issue to objectively access because reliable data is unavailable.{{sfn | Hausfater | 2008 | pp=445\u2013450 (Susan Scrimshaw)}}<ref>John Cole, Geography of the World\u2019s major regions (1996), Routledge, p. 14, {{ISBN|978-0-415-11742-5}}</ref> Scrimshaw states that not only accurate frequency of female infanticide is unknown, differential care between male and female infants is even more elusive data.{{sfn | Hausfater | 2008 | pp=445\u2013450 (Susan Scrimshaw)}} Reliable data for female infanticide is unavailable.

[[Poverty in India|Poverty]], the [[Dowry system in India|dowry system]], births to unmarried women, deformed infants, famine, lack of support services and maternal illnesses such as [[postpartum depression]] are among the causes that have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of [[female infanticide]] in India.\n\nAlthough infanticide has been criminalised in India, it remains an under-reported crime due to the lack of reliable data. In 2010, the [[National Crime Records Bureau]] reported approximately 100 male and female infanticides, producing an official rate of less than one case of infanticide per million people.\n\nThe Indian practice of female infanticide and of [[sex-selective abortion]] have been cited to explain in part a gender imbalance that has been reported as being increasingly distorted since the [[1991 Census of India]], although there are also other influences that might affect the trend.{{sfnp|Hundal|2013|ps=}}\n\n== Definition ==\nSection 315 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] defines infanticide as the killing of an infant in the 0\u20131 year age group. The Code uses this definition to differentiate between infanticide and numerous other crimes against children, such as [[Female foeticide in India|foeticide]] and [[murder]].{{sfnp|National Crime Records Bureau|2010|p=1|ps=}}{{efn|According to statistics published by the [[National Crime Records Bureau]], a department of the [[Government of India]], kidnapping and abduction represented 40.3 per cent of recorded crimes against children in 2010, rape was 20.5 per cent, murder (other than infanticide) was 5.3 per cent, and exposure and abandonment was 2.7 per cent. All other crimes against children accounted for 31.5 per cent.{{sfnp|National Crime Records Bureau|2010|p=6|ps=}}}}\n\nSome scholarly publications on infanticide use the legal definition.{{sfnp|Craig|2004|ps=: referring to the United Kingdom [[Infanticide Act 1938]].}}{{sfnp|Miller|1987|p=97|ps=: \"Most broadly defined, infanticide applies to the killing of children under the age of twelve months (deaths after that age would generally be classified as child ''homicide'', although the definition and, hence, duration of childhood is culturally variable).\" }} Others, such as the collaboration of Renu Dube, Reena Dube and Rashmi Bhatnagar, who describe themselves as \"postcolonial feminists\", adopt a broader scope for ''infanticide'', applying it from foeticide through to [[femicide]] at an unspecified age.{{sfnp|Dube|Dube|Bhatnagar|1999|p=74|ps=}} Barbara Miller, an anthropologist, has \"for convenience\"  used the term to refer to all non-accidental deaths of children up to the age of around 15\u201316, which is culturally considered to be the age when childhood ends in rural India. She notes that the act of infanticide can be \"outright\", such as a physical beating, or take a \"passive\" form through actions such as neglect and starvation. [[Neonaticide]], being the killing of a child within 24 hours of birth, is sometimes considered as a separate study.{{sfnp|Miller|1987|pp=96-97|ps=}}\n\n== Colonial period ==\n\n=== Causation ===\nBritish colonists in India first became aware of the practice of female infanticide in 1789, during the period of [[Company Rule in India|Company Rule]]. It was noted among members of a [[Rajput]] clan by [[Jonathan Duncan (Governor of Bombay)|Jonathan Duncan]], then the [[British Resident]] in [[Jaunpur district]] of what is now the northern [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Later, in 1817, officials noted that the practice was so entrenched that there were entire [[taluk]]s of the [[Jadeja]] Rajputs in [[Gujarat]] where no female children of the clan existed.{{sfnp|Vishwanath|2007|p=270|ps=}} In the mid-19th century, a magistrate who was stationed in the north-west of the country claimed that for several hundred years no daughter had ever been raised in the strongholds of the Rajahs of [[Mainpuri district|Mynpoorie]] and that only after the intervention of a [[District Collector]] in 1845 did the Rajput ruler there keep a daughter alive.{{sfnp|Miller|1987|pp=97\u201398|ps=}} The British identified other [[Caste in India|high-caste]] communities as practitioners in north, western and central areas of the country; these included the [[Ahir]]s, [[Bedi clan|Bedis]], [[Gurjar]]s, [[Jat people|Jats]], [[Khatri]]s, [[Kanbi|Lewa Kanbis]], [[Mohyal]] Brahmins and [[Patidar]]s.{{sfnp|Vishwanath|2007|p=270|ps=}}{{sfnp|Snehi|2003|ps=}}\n\nAccording to [[Marvin Harris]], another anthropologist and among the first proponents of [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]], these killings of legitimate children occurred only among the Rajputs and other elite land-owning and warrior groups. The rationale was mainly economic, lying in a desire not to split land and wealth among too many heirs and in avoiding the payment of dowries. Sisters and daughters would marry men of similar standing and thus pose a challenge to the cohesion of wealth and power, whereas concubines and their children would not and thus could be allowed to live.{{sfnp|Scott|2001|pp=6-7|ps=: Citing {{cite book |title=Our Kind: Who We Are, Where We Came From, Where We Are Going |first=Marvin |last=Harris |authorlink=Marvin Harris |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1989 |isbn= |pages=213, 226\u2013227}}}}{{sfnp|Harris|1998|p=558|ps=}} He further argues that the need for warriors in the villages of a pre-industrial society meant female children were devalued, and the combination of war casualties and infanticide acted as a necessary form of population control.{{sfnp|Hawkes|1981|ps=}}\n\n[[Sociobiology|Sociobiologists]] have a different theory to Harris. Indeed, his theory and interest in the topic of infanticide is born of his more generalised opposition to the sociobiological hypothesis of the procreative imperative.{{sfnp|Scott|2001|p=6|ps=}}{{sfnp|Kuznar|Sanderson|2007|p=209|ps=}} According to this theory of imperative, based on the 19th-century vogue for explanations rooted in evolution and its premise of natural selection,{{sfnp|Scott|2001|pp=3-4|ps=}} the biological differences between men and women meant that many more children could be gained among the elites through support for male offspring, whose fecundity was naturally much greater: the line would spread and grow more extensively. Harris believes this to be a fallacious explanation because the elites had sufficient wealth easily to support both male and female children.{{sfnp|Harris|1998|p=558|ps=}} Thus, Harris and others, such as [[William Divale]], see female infanticide as a way to restrict population growth, while sociobiologists such as [[Mildred Dickemann]] view the same practice as a means of expanding it.{{sfnp|Hawkes|1981|ps=}}\n\nAnother anthropologist, [[Kristen Hawkes]], has criticised both of these theories. On the one hand, opposing Harris, she says both that the quickest way to get more male warriors would have been to have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory she points out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.{{sfnp|Hawkes|1981|ps=}}\n\n=== Reliability of colonial reports on infanticide ===\n\nThere is no data for the [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] in India prior to the British colonial era. Reliant as the British were on local high-caste communities for the collection of taxes and the maintenance of law and order, the administrators were initially reluctant to peer too deeply into their private affairs, such as the practice of infanticide. Although this did change in the 1830s, the reluctance reappeared following the cathartic events of the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]], which caused government by the [[East India Company]] to be supplanted by the [[British Raj]].{{sfnp|Vishwanath|2007|pp=268-269|ps=}} In 1857, John Cave Browne, a chaplain serving in [[Bengal Presidency]], reported a Major Goldney speculating that the practice of female infanticide among the Jats in the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] originated from \"Malthusian motives\".{{sfnp|Browne|1857|pp=121\u2013122|ps=}} In the Gujarat region, the first cited examples of discrepancies in the sex ratio among Lewa Patidars and [[Kunbi|Kanbis]] dates from 1847.{{sfnp|Vishwanath|2007|p=278|ps=}} These historical records have been questioned by modern scholars. The British made their observations from a distance and never mixed with their Indian subjects to understand their poverty, frustrations, life or culture at close hand.{{sfnp|Cohn|1996|p=10|ps=}} Browne documented his speculations on female infanticide using \"they tell\" hearsay.{{sfnp|Browne|1857|pp=121\u2013122|ps=}} [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard Cohn]] states that the colonial British residents in India would not accuse an individual or family of infanticide as the crime was difficult to prove in a British court, nevertheless accused an entire clan or social group of female infanticide. Cohn says, \"female infanticide thus became a 'statistical crime'\", during the colonial rule of India.{{sfnp|Cohn|1996|pp=10-11|ps=}}\n\nAside from numerous reports and correspondence on infanticide from colonial officials,{{sfnp|Snehi|2003|ps=}} there was also documentation from Christian missionaries. who were significant writers of ethnographies of India during the 19th century. They sent letters back to Britain announcing their missionary accomplishments and characterising the culture as savage, ignorant and depraved.{{sfnp|Grey|2011|ps=}}{{sfnp|Dirks|2001|pp=173-174|ps=}} Scholars have questioned this distorted construction of Indian culture during the colonial era, stating that infanticide was as common in England during the 18th and 19th century, as in India.{{sfnp|Grey|2011|ps=}}<ref name=\"anagol\">{{cite journal |first=Padma |last=Anagol |authorlink = Padma Anagol |title=The Emergence of the Female Criminal in India: Infanticide and Survival under the Raj |journal=History Workshop Journal |issue=53 |date=Spring 2002 |pages=73\u201393 |jstor=4289774 }}</ref><ref>GA Oddie (1994), Orientalism and British [[Protestant]] missionary constructions of India in the nineteenth century, Journal of South Asian Studies, 17(2), pp. 27\u201342</ref> Some British Christian missionaries of the late 19th century, states Daniel Grey, wrongly believed that female infanticide was sanctioned by the scriptures of Hinduism and Islam, and against which Christianity had \"centuries after centuries come into victorious conflict\".{{sfnp|Grey|2011|ps=}}\n\n=== Location and direct method ===\n\n[[File:6th Earl of Mayo.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo]], who was [[Governor-General of India]] at the time of the [[Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870]].]]\n\nA review of scholarship by Miller has shown that the majority of female infanticides in India during the colonial period occurred in the north-west, and that it was widespread although not all groups carried out this practice.{{sfnp|Miller|1987|p=99|ps=}}\n\n[[David Arnold (historian)|David Arnold]], a member of the [[Subaltern studies|subaltern studies group]] who has used a lot of contemporary sources, says that various methods of outright infanticide were used, including reputedly including poisoning with [[opium]], strangulation and suffocation. Poisonous substances such as the root of the ''[[plumbago rosea]]'' and [[arsenic]] were used for abortion, with the latter also ironically being used as an [[aphrodisiac]] and cure for [[male impotence]]. The act of direct infanticide among Rajputs was usually performed by women, often the mother herself or a nurse. Administration of poison was in any event a type of killing particularly associated with women; Arnold describes it as \"often murder by proxy\", with the man at a remove from the event and thus able to claim innocence.{{sfnp|Arnold|2013|pp=176, 179|ps=}}\n\nThe passing of the [[Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870]] made the practice illegal in the [[British India]]n regions of Punjab and the [[North-Western Provinces]].{{sfnp|Miller|1987|p=99|ps=}} The [[Governor-General of India]] had the authority to expand the Act to other regions at his discretion.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Impact of famines on infanticide ===\n\nMajor [[Famine in India|famines occurred in India]] every five to eight years in the 19th- and early 20th-centuries,<ref>B Murton (2000), Famine, in The Cambridge World History of Food 2, pp. 1411\u20131427, Cambridge University Press</ref><ref>Mike Davis (2001), Late Victorian Holocausts: El Ni\u00f1o Famines and the Making of the Third World, pp. 7\u20138, Verso</ref> resulting in millions starving to death.<ref>Mike Davis (2004), Liberation Ecologies: Environment, Development and Social Movements, pp. 44\u201349, Routledge</ref><ref>A Sen (1983), Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation, Oxford University Press</ref> As also happened in China, these events begat infanticide: desperate starving parents would either kill a suffering infant, sell a child to buy food for the rest of the family, or beg people to take them away for nothing and feed them.<ref name=cog1>Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da, Famine: A Short History, pp. 61\u201367, Princeton University Press</ref><ref>William Digby, The Famine Campaign in Southern India (Madras and Bombay): 1876\u20131878, pp. 458\u2013459, Longmans London</ref><ref name=gupshu1>Gupta and Shuzhuo, Gender Bias in China, South Korea and India 1920\u20131990: Effects of War, Famine and Fertility Decline, Development and Change, Volume 30, Issue 3, pp. 619\u2013652, July 1999</ref> Gupta and Shuzhou state that massive famines and poverty-related historical events had influenced historical sex ratios, and they have had deep cultural ramifications on girls and regional attitudes towards female [[infant mortality]].<ref name=gupshu1 />\n\n=== Impact of economic policies on infanticide ===\n\nAccording to [[Mara Hvistendahl]], documents left behind by the colonial administration following [[Partition of India|independence]] showed a direct correlation between the taxation policies of the [[British East India Company]] and the rise in female infanticide.{{sfnp|Hvistendahl|2011|p=67|ps=}}\n\n=== Regional and religious demographics ===\n\nThe [[Census of India prior to independence|decennial census of India]] from 1881 through 1941 recorded a consistently skewed ratio whereby the number of males exceeded the number of females. The gender difference was particularly high in north and western regions of India, with an overall sex ratio&nbsp;\u2013 males per 100 females&nbsp;\u2013 of between 110.2 and 113.7 in the north over the 60-year period, and 105.8 to 109.8 males for every 100 female in western India for all ages. Visaria states that female deficit among Muslims was markedly higher, next only to Sikhs. South India region was an exception reporting excess females overall, which scholars attribute partly to selective emigration of males and the regional practice of matriarchy.{{sfn|Visaria|Visaria|Patel|1983|pp=496-499}}\n\nThe overall sex ratios, and excess males, in various regions were highest among the [[Islam in India|Muslim population of India]] from 1881 to 1941, and the sex ratio of each region correlated with the proportion of its Muslim population, with the exception of eastern region of India where the overall sex ratio was relatively low while it had a high percentage of Muslims in the population.{{sfn|Visaria|Visaria|Patel|1983|p=499 with footnote 2}} If regions that are now part of modern Pakistan are excluded (Baluchistan, North West Frontier, Sind for example), Visaria states that the regional and overall sex ratios for the rest of India over the 1881\u20131941 period improve in favour of females, with a lesser gap between male and female population.{{sfn|Visaria|Visaria|Patel|1983|p=499 with footnote 1}}\n\n== Contemporary data and statistics ==\n\nInfanticide in India, and elsewhere in the world, is a difficult issue to objectively access because reliable data is unavailable.{{sfn | Hausfater | 2008 | pp=445\u2013450 (Susan Scrimshaw)}}<ref>John Cole, Geography of the World\u2019s major regions (1996), Routledge, p. 14, {{ISBN|978-0-415-11742-5}}</ref> Scrimshaw states that not only accurate frequency of female infanticide is unknown, differential care between male and female infants is even more elusive data.{{sfn | Hausfater | 2008 | pp=445\u2013450 (Susan Scrimshaw)}} Reliable data for female infanticide is unavailable.

This is not only for the benefit of the client but also for the benefit of those belonging to that profession. Disciplinary codes allow the profession to define a standard of conduct and ensure that individual practitioners meet this standard, by disciplining them from the professional body if they do not practice accordingly. This allows those professionals who act with a conscience to practice in the knowledge that they will not be undermined commercially by those who have fewer ethical qualms. It also maintains the public\u2019s trust in the profession, encouraging the public to continue seeking their services.\n\n===Internal regulation===\nIn cases where professional bodies regulate their own ethics, there are possibilities for such bodies to become self-serving and fail to follow their own ethical code when dealing with renegade members. This is particularly true of professions in which they have almost a complete monopoly on a particular area of knowledge. For example, until recently, the English courts deferred to the professional consensus on matters relating to their practice that lay outside case law and legislation.<ref>Margaret Brazier, \u2018\u2019Medicine, Patients and the Law\u2019\u2019, Penguin, 1987 page 147</ref>\n\n==Statutory regulation==\nIn many countries there is some statutory regulation of professional ethical standards such as the [[statutory body|statutory bodies]] that regulate [[nursing]] and [[midwife]]ry in England and Wales.<ref>[http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry-Professional regulation - nursing: the UKCC ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729062133/http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm |date=2012-07-29 }}</ref> Failure to comply with these standards can thus become a matter for the courts.\n\n==Examples==\nFor example, a lay member of the public should not be held responsible for failing to act to save a [[car crash]] victim because they could not give an appropriate [[emergency treatment]]. Though, they are responsible for attempting to get help for the victim. This is because they do not have the relevant knowledge and experience. In contrast, a fully trained doctor (with the correct equipment) would be capable of making the correct [[diagnosis]] and carrying out appropriate procedures. Failure of a doctor to not help at all in such a situation would generally be regarded as [[negligent]] and [[unethical]]. Though, if a doctor helps and makes a mistake that is considered negligent and unethical, there could be [[wikt:egregious|egregious]] repercussions. An untrained person would only be considered to be negligent for failing to act if they did nothing at all to help and is protected by the [[Good Samaritan law|\"Good Samaritan\" laws]] if they unintentionally caused more damage and possible loss of life.\n\nA business may approach a professional engineer to certify the safety of a project which is not safe. While one engineer may refuse to certify the project on moral grounds, the business may find a less [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrupulous scrupulous] engineer who will be prepared to certify the project for a [[bribe]], thus saving the business the expense of redesigning.<ref>Michael Davis, \u2018Thinking like an Engineer\u2019 in Philosophy and Public Affairs, 20.2 (1991) page 158</ref>\n\n===Separatism===\nOn a theoretical level, there is debate as to whether an ethical code for a profession should be consistent with the requirements of morality governing the public. Separatists argue that professions should be allowed to go beyond such confines when they judge it necessary. This is because they are trained to produce certain outcomes which may take moral precedence over other functions of society.<ref name=Gewirth>{{cite journal\n | last =Gewirth\n | first =Alan\n | title =Professional Ethics: The Separatist Thesis\n | journal =Ethics\n | volume =96\n | issue =2\n | pages =282\u2013300\n | date =Jan 1986\n | jstor =2381378\n | doi=10.1086/292747}}\n</ref>{{rp|282}} For example, it could be argued that a doctor may lie to a patient about the severity of his or her condition if there is reason to believe that telling the patient would cause so much distress that it would be [[detrimental]] to his or her health. This would be a disrespect of the patient's [[autonomy]], as it denies the patient information that could have a great impact on his or her life. This would generally be seen as morally wrong. However, if the end of improving and maintaining health is given a moral priority in society, then it may be justifiable to [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contravene contravene] other moral demands in order to meet this goal.<ref name=Gewirth/>{{rp|284}} Separatism is based on a relativist conception of morality that there can be different, equally valid, moral codes that apply to different sections of society and differences in codes between societies (see [[moral relativism]]). If [[moral universalism]] is ascribed to, then this would be inconsistent with the view that professions can have a different moral code, as the universalist holds that there is only one valid moral code for all.<ref name=Gewirth/>{{rp|285}}.\n\n==Student ethics==\nAs attending college after high school graduation becomes a standard in the lives of young people, [[colleges]] and [[universities]] are becoming more business-like in their expectations of the students.  Although people have differing opinions about if it is effective, surveys state that it is the overall goal of the university administrators.<ref>{{cite web|title=Are Colleges Preparing Students For The Workplace|url=http://www.thecollegesolution.com/are-colleges-preparing-students-for-the-workplace}}</ref>  Setting up a business-like atmosphere helps students get adjusted from a more relaxed nature, like high school, towards what will be expected of them in the business world upon graduating from College.\n\n===Codes of conduct===\nCodes of conduct, such as the St. Xavier Code of Conduct, are becoming more a staple in the academic lives of students.<ref>{{cite web|title=SXU Code of Conduct|url=http://www.sxu.edu/academics/resources/cie/conduct.asp|accessdate=12 February 2016}}</ref> While some of these rules are based solely on academics others are more in depth than in previous years. Such as, detailing the level of respect expected towards staff and gambling.\n\nNot only do codes of conduct apply while attending the schools at home, but also while studying abroad. Schools also implement a code of conduct for international study abroad programs which carry over many of the same rules found in most student handbooks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Conduct|url=http://handbook.sxu.edu/Student/Code_Conduct/student_conduct.html}}</ref>\n\n== How to acquire Professional Attitude? ==\n[https://www.jinglingmoney.com/professional-attitude-in-business/ Professional attitude] reflects at how we treat people?

Retrieved October 20, 2006, from https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/professional-ethics/v-1</ref>\n\nIt is capable of making judgments, applying their skills, and reaching informed decisions in situations that the general public cannot because they have not attained the necessary knowledge and skills.<ref>Caroline Whitbeck, \"Ethics in Engineering Practice and Research\" Cambridge University Press, 1998 page 40</ref> One of the earliest examples of professional ethics is the [[Hippocratic oath]] to which medical [[physician|doctors]] still adhere to this day.\n\n==Components==\nSome professional organizations may define their ethical approach in terms of a number of discrete components.<ref>[http://www.rics.org/site/download_feed.aspx?fileID=6309&fileExtension=PDF RICS- MAINTAINING PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216090731/http://www.rics.org/site/download_feed.aspx?fileID=6309&fileExtension=PDF |date=2011-12-16 }}</ref> Typically these include [[Honesty]], [[Integrity]], [[Transparency (behavior)|Transparency]], [[Accountability]], [[Confidentiality]], [[Objectivity (journalism)|Objectivity]], [[Respect]], [[Legal|Obedience to the law]], and [[Loyalty]].\n\n==Implementation==\nMost professionals have internally enforced codes of practice that members of the profession must follow to prevent [[wikt: exploitation|exploitation]] of the client and to preserve the integrity and reputation of the profession. This is not only for the benefit of the client but also for the benefit of those belonging to that profession. Disciplinary codes allow the profession to define a standard of conduct and ensure that individual practitioners meet this standard, by disciplining them from the professional body if they do not practice accordingly. This allows those professionals who act with a conscience to practice in the knowledge that they will not be undermined commercially by those who have fewer ethical qualms. It also maintains the public\u2019s trust in the profession, encouraging the public to continue seeking their services.\n\n===Internal regulation===\nIn cases where professional bodies regulate their own ethics, there are possibilities for such bodies to become self-serving and fail to follow their own ethical code when dealing with renegade members. This is particularly true of professions in which they have almost a complete monopoly on a particular area of knowledge. For example, until recently, the English courts deferred to the professional consensus on matters relating to their practice that lay outside case law and legislation.<ref>Margaret Brazier, \u2018\u2019Medicine, Patients and the Law\u2019\u2019, Penguin, 1987 page 147</ref>\n\n==Statutory regulation==\nIn many countries there is some statutory regulation of professional ethical standards such as the [[statutory body|statutory bodies]] that regulate [[nursing]] and [[midwife]]ry in England and Wales.<ref>[http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry-Professional regulation - nursing: the UKCC ] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729062133/http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk/final_report/annex_a/chapter_4_15.htm |date=2012-07-29 }}</ref> Failure to comply with these standards can thus become a matter for the courts.\n\n==Examples==\nFor example, a lay member of the public should not be held responsible for failing to act to save a [[car crash]] victim because they could not give an appropriate [[emergency treatment]]. Though, they are responsible for attempting to get help for the victim. This is because they do not have the relevant knowledge and experience. In contrast, a fully trained doctor (with the correct equipment) would be capable of making the correct [[diagnosis]] and carrying out appropriate procedures. Failure of a doctor to not help at all in such a situation would generally be regarded as [[negligent]] and [[unethical]]. Though, if a doctor helps and makes a mistake that is considered negligent and unethical, there could be [[wikt:egregious|egregious]] repercussions. An untrained person would only be considered to be negligent for failing to act if they did nothing at all to help and is protected by the [[Good Samaritan law|\"Good Samaritan\" laws]] if they unintentionally caused more damage and possible loss of life.\n\nA business may approach a professional engineer to certify the safety of a project which is not safe. While one engineer may refuse to certify the project on moral grounds, the business may find a less [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrupulous scrupulous] engineer who will be prepared to certify the project for a [[bribe]], thus saving the business the expense of redesigning.<ref>Michael Davis, \u2018Thinking like an Engineer\u2019 in Philosophy and Public Affairs, 20.2 (1991) page 158</ref>\n\n===Separatism===\nOn a theoretical level, there is debate as to whether an ethical code for a profession should be consistent with the requirements of morality governing the public. Separatists argue that professions should be allowed to go beyond such confines when they judge it necessary. This is because they are trained to produce certain outcomes which may take moral precedence over other functions of society.<ref name=Gewirth>{{cite journal\n | last =Gewirth\n | first =Alan\n | title =Professional Ethics: The Separatist Thesis\n | journal =Ethics\n | volume =96\n | issue =2\n | pages =282\u2013300\n | date =Jan 1986\n | jstor =2381378\n | doi=10.1086/292747}}\n</ref>{{rp|282}} For example, it could be argued that a doctor may lie to a patient about the severity of his or her condition if there is reason to believe that telling the patient would cause so much distress that it would be [[detrimental]] to his or her health. This would be a disrespect of the patient's [[autonomy]], as it denies the patient information that could have a great impact on his or her life. This would generally be seen as morally wrong. However, if the end of improving and maintaining health is given a moral priority in society, then it may be justifiable to [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/contravene contravene] other moral demands in order to meet this goal.<ref name=Gewirth/>{{rp|284}} Separatism is based on a relativist conception of morality that there can be different, equally valid, moral codes that apply to different sections of society and differences in codes between societies (see [[moral relativism]]). If [[moral universalism]] is ascribed to, then this would be inconsistent with the view that professions can have a different moral code, as the universalist holds that there is only one valid moral code for all.<ref name=Gewirth/>{{rp|285}}.\n\n==Student ethics==\nAs attending college after high school graduation becomes a standard in the lives of young people, [[colleges]] and [[universities]] are becoming more business-like in their expectations of the students.  Although people have differing opinions about if it is effective, surveys state that it is the overall goal of the university administrators.<ref>{{cite web|title=Are Colleges Preparing Students For The Workplace|url=http://www.thecollegesolution.com/are-colleges-preparing-students-for-the-workplace}}</ref>  Setting up a business-like atmosphere helps students get adjusted from a more relaxed nature, like high school, towards what will be expected of them in the business world upon graduating from College.\n\n===Codes of conduct===\nCodes of conduct, such as the St. Xavier Code of Conduct, are becoming more a staple in the academic lives of students.<ref>{{cite web|title=SXU Code of Conduct|url=http://www.sxu.edu/academics/resources/cie/conduct.asp|accessdate=12 February 2016}}</ref> While some of these rules are based solely on academics others are more in depth than in previous years. Such as, detailing the level of respect expected towards staff and gambling.\n\nNot only do codes of conduct apply while attending the schools at home, but also while studying abroad. Schools also implement a code of conduct for international study abroad programs which carry over many of the same rules found in most student handbooks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Conduct|url=http://handbook.sxu.edu/Student/Code_Conduct/student_conduct.html}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Business ethics]]\n* [[Deontological ethics]]\n* [[Ethical code]]\n* [[Ethics]]\n* [[Engineering ethics]]\n* [[Legal ethics]]\n* [[Medical ethics]]\n* [[Nursing ethics]]\n* [[Outline of ethics]]\n* [[Professional]]\n* [[Professional abuse]]\n* [[Professional boundaries]]\n* [[Professional negligence in English Law]]\n* [[Professional responsibility]]\n* [[Virtue ethics]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n==Further reading==\n{{Wikibooks|Professionalism}}\n* [http://changingminds.org/explanations/values/values_morals_ethics.htm Values, morals, and ethics.
