This may produce feelings of intense depression, remorse, and high levels of anxiety, or the desire to achieve youthfulness or make drastic changes to their current lifestyle or feel the wish to change past decisions and events.\n\nThe term was coined by [[Elliott Jaques]] in 1965.  More modern research has shown this is not a phase that most middle-aged people actually experience, and some have questioned the existence of this phenomenon.\n\n==Crisis vs. stressors==\nAcademic research since the 1980s rejects the notion of mid-life crisis as a phase that most adults go through.

However, those events could have happened earlier or later in life, making them a \"crisis,\" but not necessarily a mid-life one. In the same study, 15% of middle-aged adults experienced this type of midlife turmoil.

A mid-life crisis could be caused by aging itself, or aging in combination with changes, problems, or regrets over:\n\n*work or [[career]] (or lack of them)\n*spousal relationships (or lack of them)\n*maturation of children (or lack of children)\n*aging or death of parents\n*physical changes associated with aging\n\nMid-life crisis can affect men and women differently because their stressors differ. An American cultural stereotype of a man going through a midlife crisis may include the purchase of a luxury item such as an exotic car, or seeking [[intimacy]] with a younger woman. Some men seek younger women who are able to procreate, not necessarily with an intention to produce offspring.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why do men go through midlife crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>  A man's midlife crises is more likely to be caused by work issues,<ref name=\"auto4\"/> a woman's crisis by personal evaluations of their roles.

Psychologist Oliver Robinson's research characterizes each decade of life by describing frequent occurrences or situations particular to those age periods. He describes that a crisis can begin in a person's early 20s, when they usually try to map out their whole life. Moreover, the later age period, between 50 and 60, may be a time of illness or even the thought of death.

An example supporting such a theory can be derived from the research conducted by Dr. Susan Krauss Whitbourne. People who changed jobs before their midlife years had a greater sense of [[generativity]] when they reached mid-life. They also experienced a greater sense of [[motivation]] to deviate from stagnation and a desire to help the younger generation thrive. This is a psychological stage proposed by Erik Erikson that describes a normal stage adults go through during their mid-life years.<ref name=\"Online Dictionary\">{{cite web|title=Merriam Webster Dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/generativity|website=Merriam-Webster}}</ref>\n\n== Theoretical basis ==\nThe notion of the mid-life crisis began with followers of [[Sigmund Freud]], who thought that during middle age everyone\u2019s thoughts were driven by the fear of impending death.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-is-the-midlife Scientific American MIND Magazine] February 2009 article titled \"[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=ask-the-brains-is-the-midlife Ask the Brains: Is the Midlife Crisis a Myth?]\" by David Almeida, professor of human development and family studies at Pennsylvania State University</ref> Although mid-life crisis has lately received more attention in [[popular culture]] than serious research, there are some theoretical constructs supporting the notion. [[Jungian theory]] holds that mid-life is key to [[individuation]], a process of [[self-actualization]] and [[self-awareness]] that contains many potential paradoxes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/individuationprocess.htm | title=The Individuation Process}}</ref> Although [[Carl Jung]] did not describe midlife crisis ''per se'', the mid-life integration of thinking, sensation, feeling, and intuition that he describes could, it seems, lead to confusion about one's life and goals.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[Erik Erikson]]'s life stage of generativity versus stagnation also coincides with the idea of a mid-life crisis. Erikson believed that in this stage adults begin to understand the pressure of being committed to improving the lives of generations to come. In this stage a person realizes the inevitability of mortality and the virtue of this stage is the creating of a better world for future generations in order for the human race to grow. [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stagnation Stagnation] is the lack of psychological movement or growth. Instead of helping the community a person is barely able to help their own family. Those who experience stagnation do not invest in the growth of themselves or others.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Barbara M.|last1=Newman|first2=Philip R.|last2=Newman|title=Development Through Life|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=512\u201315}}</ref>\n\nSome psychologists{{weasel-inline|date=November 2018}} believe men's mid-life crisis is a psychological reaction to the imminent menopause and end of reproductive career of their spouses.<ref name=\"Online Psychology Page\">{{cite web|title=Why Do Men Go Through a Midlife Crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref> Their [[genes]] may be influencing men to be more attracted to reproductive women, and less attached to their non-reproductive spouses.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSome people have challenged the existence of mid-life crises altogether. One study found that 23% of participants had what they called a \"midlife crisis,\" but in digging deeper, only one-third of those\u20148% of the total\u2014said the crisis was associated with awareness of aging.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>https://oxfordre.com/psychology/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-397</ref>\n\nThe balance (15% of those surveyed) had experienced major life experiences or transitions such as [[divorce]] or loss of a job in middle age and described them as \"midlife crisis.\" While there is no doubt these events can be traumatic\u2014the associated grief reactions can be indistinguishable from [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nCosta and McCrae (1980) found little evidence for an increase in [[neuroticism]] in midlife.  While they did find that some people were likely to experience such crises, these individuals were likely to experience crises in their 20s and 30s, and these experiences were not unique to midlife. Robinson, Rosenberg, and Farrell (1999) re-interviewed (500) men. Looking back over their midlife period, it became evident that while not necessarily entailing crisis, it was a time for re-evaluation.\n\nWrapping up their review of men's mid-life crisis, Alwin and Levenson wrote that \"[...] Given the bulk of the data, it is likely that, for most men, mid-life is a time of achievement and satisfaction. For a certain proportion of men, however, the passage is not at all smooth.\" They found a similar pattern when they reviewed research on what are commonly thought to be triggers for women's mid-life crisis: menopause, children leaving home, the \"sandwich\" of caring for both parents and children. Most women navigated those periods without a traumatic psychological \"crisis.\"\n\nThe enduring popularity of the mid-life crisis concept may be explained by another finding by Robinson et al. As Alwin and Levenson summarize: \"... younger men, now middle-aged [[Baby Boomers]], used the term \"midlife crisis\" to describe nearly any setback, either in their career or family life.\"\n\nLevenson researched the possible existence of a midlife crisis and its implications. Whereas Levenson (1978) found that 80% of middle-aged participants had a crisis, and Ciernia (1985) reported that 70% of men in midlife said they had a crisis (Shek, 1996) others could not replicate those findings including Shek (1996), Kruger (1994),  McCrae and Costa (1990). The debate of whether or not there is a midlife crisis is being answered through recent research that attempts to balance such factors as response bias and experimenter effects in order to establish internal validity. The above mentioned research does not support Levenson's model of a single age in the middle years that is a designated time of transition and potential \"crisis.\" Instead, changes in personality can occur throughout the adult years with no peak in general distress or psychosocial crisis.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newpassages00gail|url-access=registration|title=New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time|first=Gail|last=Sheehy|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780345404459}}</ref>\n\nMany view mid-life as a negative, but in reality many experience this time positively.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If looked at as a time of personal growth, the experience can be greatly beneficial and rewarding.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If treated as a transitional phase,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> psychologists believe the initial experience may be difficult and confusing but as time passes it becomes an experience of self growth and self-realization.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Chandra|first=Prabha|title=Is midlife crisis for real?|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=7&hid=15&sid=3b299085-01b8-48da-b217-775619bbcedf%40sessionmgr13&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=61440319|newspaper=Prevention India|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>Erikson, Erik H.

Those who experience stagnation do not invest in the growth of themselves or others.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Barbara M.|last1=Newman|first2=Philip R.|last2=Newman|title=Development Through Life|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth|pages=512\u201315}}</ref>\n\nSome psychologists{{weasel-inline|date=November 2018}} believe men's mid-life crisis is a psychological reaction to the imminent menopause and end of reproductive career of their spouses.<ref name=\"Online Psychology Page\">{{cite web|title=Why Do Men Go Through a Midlife Crisis?|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201007/why-do-men-go-through-midlife-crisis|website=Psychology Today}}</ref> Their [[genes]] may be influencing men to be more attracted to reproductive women, and less attached to their non-reproductive spouses.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nSome people have challenged the existence of mid-life crises altogether. One study found that 23% of participants had what they called a \"midlife crisis,\" but in digging deeper, only one-third of those\u20148% of the total\u2014said the crisis was associated with awareness of aging.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>https://oxfordre.com/psychology/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.001.0001/acrefore-9780190236557-e-397</ref>\n\nThe balance (15% of those surveyed) had experienced major life experiences or transitions such as [[divorce]] or loss of a job in middle age and described them as \"midlife crisis.\" While there is no doubt these events can be traumatic\u2014the associated grief reactions can be indistinguishable from [[clinical depression|depression]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nCosta and McCrae (1980) found little evidence for an increase in [[neuroticism]] in midlife.  While they did find that some people were likely to experience such crises, these individuals were likely to experience crises in their 20s and 30s, and these experiences were not unique to midlife. Robinson, Rosenberg, and Farrell (1999) re-interviewed (500) men. Looking back over their midlife period, it became evident that while not necessarily entailing crisis, it was a time for re-evaluation.\n\nWrapping up their review of men's mid-life crisis, Alwin and Levenson wrote that \"[...] Given the bulk of the data, it is likely that, for most men, mid-life is a time of achievement and satisfaction. For a certain proportion of men, however, the passage is not at all smooth.\" They found a similar pattern when they reviewed research on what are commonly thought to be triggers for women's mid-life crisis: menopause, children leaving home, the \"sandwich\" of caring for both parents and children. Most women navigated those periods without a traumatic psychological \"crisis.\"\n\nThe enduring popularity of the mid-life crisis concept may be explained by another finding by Robinson et al. As Alwin and Levenson summarize: \"... younger men, now middle-aged [[Baby Boomers]], used the term \"midlife crisis\" to describe nearly any setback, either in their career or family life.\"\n\nLevenson researched the possible existence of a midlife crisis and its implications. Whereas Levenson (1978) found that 80% of middle-aged participants had a crisis, and Ciernia (1985) reported that 70% of men in midlife said they had a crisis (Shek, 1996) others could not replicate those findings including Shek (1996), Kruger (1994),  McCrae and Costa (1990). The debate of whether or not there is a midlife crisis is being answered through recent research that attempts to balance such factors as response bias and experimenter effects in order to establish internal validity. The above mentioned research does not support Levenson's model of a single age in the middle years that is a designated time of transition and potential \"crisis.\" Instead, changes in personality can occur throughout the adult years with no peak in general distress or psychosocial crisis.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newpassages00gail|url-access=registration|title=New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time|first=Gail|last=Sheehy|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Ballantine Books|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780345404459}}</ref>\n\nMany view mid-life as a negative, but in reality many experience this time positively.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If looked at as a time of personal growth, the experience can be greatly beneficial and rewarding.{{cn|date=November 2018}} If treated as a transitional phase,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> psychologists believe the initial experience may be difficult and confusing but as time passes it becomes an experience of self growth and self-realization.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Chandra|first=Prabha|title=Is midlife crisis for real?|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=7&hid=15&sid=3b299085-01b8-48da-b217-775619bbcedf%40sessionmgr13&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=61440319|newspaper=Prevention India|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>Erikson, Erik H.

Located at the corner of Duval and Greene street since 1937 (201 Duval Street, Key West, FL  33040).  [http://www.sloppyjoes.com www.sloppyjoes.com] \n\n==HISTORY OF SLOPPY JOE\u2019S BAR, KEY WEST, FL==\n\nThe official beginning of what would become Sloppy Joe's Bar, the famous and infamous Key West saloon, was December 5, 1933--the day Prohibition was repealed. The bar was destined to go through two name changes and a sudden change of location before it would become Sloppy Joe's seen by millions of visitors to Florida's southernmost outpost.\n\n\nIn Key West, being a bastion of free thinkers even in the thirties, Prohibition was looked on as an amusing exercise dreamed up by the government, and Joe Russell was just one of the enterprising individuals who operated an illegal Speak Easy on Front Street. Even Ernest Hemingway, who made Key West his home at the time, slipped over to Russell's on occasion to buy illicit bottles of Scotch and the two struck up an enduring friendship.\n\n\nWhen the government's Great Experiment ended a dismal failure, Joe Russell moved his business to Greene Street and became a legitimate saloon-keeper-proprietor of the Blind Pig, a droll rundown building that Russell leased for three dollars a week.\n\n\nThe rowdy, come-as-you-are saloon, was renamed the Silver Slipper upon the addition of a dance floor; but that did not matter, it remained a place of shabby discomfort, good friends and gambling, fifteen-cent whiskey, and ten-cent shots of gin.\n\n\nIt was Hemingway, a favorite patron of Russell's bar from the start, who encouraged its name change to Sloppy Joe's. The new name was adopted from Jose Garcia Rios Havana Club selling liquor and iced seafood. Because the floor was always wet with melted ice, his patrons taunted Jose (Joe) with running a sloppy place... Sloppy Joe\u2019s \u2026and the name stuck.\n\n\nIn its early days in Key West, Sloppy Joe's boasted several trademark \"fixtures\" besides Hemingway. There was \"Big\" Skinner, the hearty Bartender who tipped the scales at 300 pounds and served Sloppy Joe's customers for more than two decades.  Big Skinner was captured by Erik Smith a WPA-era artist, along with Russell and Hemingway, in a famous mural that hangs in Sloppy Joe\u2019s today titled \u201cHemingway and Friends.\u201d\n\n\nCorner of Greene and Duval Street since 1937\nSloppy Joe's migrated across the street to its present location on May 5, 1937. The move was occasioned by a rent increase that Joe Russell refused to pay: from three dollars a week to a whopping four dollars. Luckily, the former Victoria Restaurant owned by Spanish emigrant Juan Farto was vacant. Located at the corner of Duval and Greene Streets, the building had been built in 1917 and incorporated beautiful Cuban tile work, busily whirring ceiling fans, and jalousie doors. Joe Russell paid $2,500 for it.\n\n\nIn true Key West fashion, the bar never actually closed during the transition--customers simply picked up their drinks and carried them, along with every piece of furniture in the place, down the block to 201 Duval Street. Service resumed with barely a blink. The new Sloppy Joe's boasted the longest bar in town.  Behind the bar, in the back room, were gambling and the requisite pool tables. Skinner had pride of place above his new long curved bar. The bat that Skinner used to control his patrons now hangs on the wall.\n\n\nNicknames \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell and \u201cJosie Grunts\u201d\nJoe Russell was a Conch.  Born and raised in Key West.  Conch is the name given to Key West natives; a name that derived from that of the tough, tasty mollusk found in the surrounding waters.  Russell was a charter boat captain, rum runner, Hemingway's boat pilot, and the author's fishing companion for twelve years. In his company, Papa once caught an astonishing fifty-four Marlin in 115 days. Hemingway called him \"Josie Grunts\" and used him as the model for Freddy, the owner of Freddy's Bar and captain of the Queen Conch in To Have and Have Not. \n\n\nWhen Joe officially opened the bar, Hemingway and his \"Mob\" of cohorts were enthusiastic regular customers. In fact, the author once called himself a co-owner or silent partner in the enterprise. The \"Mob\" was comprised of some of the literary lights of the day as well as a variety of famous and infamous local residents: John Dos Pasos, Waldo Pierce, J.B. Sullivan, Hamilton Adams, Captain Eddie Saunders, Henry Strater. They wrangled, drank, and philosophized the days away, never knowing they were building a legend.\n\n\nWhen Hemingway left Key West in 1939, he left a number of personal effects stored in a house next to Sloppy Joe's. After the house was sold, the effects were moved into the back room behind the bar at Sloppy Joe's. They remained there until 1962, a year after Hemingway's death, when his widow (fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway) opened the room and took possession of them, finding uncashed royalty checks, unfinished manuscripts, sections of original manuscript of \u201cTo Have and Have Not,\u201d letters, and personal items. Some of the memorabilia was given to the then-owner of the bar, Stan Smith, to be displayed.  One of the items was the snow skis that hang in the bar today.\n\n\nJoe Russell died June 20,1941 of a heart attack, he was 53 years old.  At the time Russell and Ernest Hemingway had been fishing in Cuba for three weeks, Hemingway telephoned Joe Russell Jr. to tell him of his father\u2019s death.  He is buried in the Key West Cemetery.\n\n\nSloppy Joe's Today\n\nSloppy Joe\u2019s was purchased September 8, 1978 by Sid Snelgrove and Jim Mayer and has been owned by the two families since that time.\n\n\nOver the years Sloppy Joe's, like rare Cuban rum, has gained a richness and flavor while essentially remaining unchanged. The ceiling fans still whisper busily, a little bit wobbly but carrying on. The jalousie doors open on a Duval Street busier than even Hemingway could imagine, yet still bearing the off-beat ambience that prompted him to brand Key West \"the St. Tropez of the Poor.\" The long curving bar wears the scars of generations of visitors and Hemingway aficionados, drawn by the legend and hoping some measure of magic will rub off on them - and it does.\n\n\nOpen 365 days a year, each day begins at 9:00 am (noon on Sundays).  Sloppy Joe\u2019s has four complimentary divisions: bar, food, entertainment, and the Retail Store. The bar offers generous drinks, live music on stage every day Noon to 2:00am, and dancing. The quality of the entertainment, showcased on the huge stage facing Duval Street, is exceptional.  The performers offer a wide range of music styles and comical entertainment.\n\n\nJust as in Joe Russell's day, hospitable Bartenders welcome patrons at virtually all hours of the day or night. The generous drinks and casual, undemanding atmosphere so successful in Russell's reign remain, as does the sense that something unusual is always about to happen at Sloppy Joe's.\n\n \t  \nThe main Bar structure was built in 1917; and the second building, which houses the Kitchen and Joe\u2019s Tap Room, was built in 1892.\n\n\nJoe\u2019s Tap Room is attached to Sloppy Joe\u2019s. Open daily at Noon, Joe\u2019s Tap Room has the same food menu as Sloppy Joe\u2019s and offers variety of crafted beers on tap.  The neighborhood has found Joe\u2019s Tap Room as a great place to meet friends and watch sports.\n\n\nSloppy Joe\u2019s Owners\nJoe \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell Original owner, nickname Josie Grunts.

The bar was destined to go through two name changes and a sudden change of location before it would become Sloppy Joe's seen by millions of visitors to Florida's southernmost outpost.\n\n\nIn Key West, being a bastion of free thinkers even in the thirties, Prohibition was looked on as an amusing exercise dreamed up by the government, and Joe Russell was just one of the enterprising individuals who operated an illegal Speak Easy on Front Street. Even Ernest Hemingway, who made Key West his home at the time, slipped over to Russell's on occasion to buy illicit bottles of Scotch and the two struck up an enduring friendship.\n\n\nWhen the government's Great Experiment ended a dismal failure, Joe Russell moved his business to Greene Street and became a legitimate saloon-keeper-proprietor of the Blind Pig, a droll rundown building that Russell leased for three dollars a week.\n\n\nThe rowdy, come-as-you-are saloon, was renamed the Silver Slipper upon the addition of a dance floor; but that did not matter, it remained a place of shabby discomfort, good friends and gambling, fifteen-cent whiskey, and ten-cent shots of gin.\n\n\nIt was Hemingway, a favorite patron of Russell's bar from the start, who encouraged its name change to Sloppy Joe's. The new name was adopted from Jose Garcia Rios Havana Club selling liquor and iced seafood. Because the floor was always wet with melted ice, his patrons taunted Jose (Joe) with running a sloppy place... Sloppy Joe\u2019s \u2026and the name stuck.\n\n\nIn its early days in Key West, Sloppy Joe's boasted several trademark \"fixtures\" besides Hemingway. There was \"Big\" Skinner, the hearty Bartender who tipped the scales at 300 pounds and served Sloppy Joe's customers for more than two decades.  Big Skinner was captured by Erik Smith a WPA-era artist, along with Russell and Hemingway, in a famous mural that hangs in Sloppy Joe\u2019s today titled \u201cHemingway and Friends.\u201d\n\n\nCorner of Greene and Duval Street since 1937\nSloppy Joe's migrated across the street to its present location on May 5, 1937. The move was occasioned by a rent increase that Joe Russell refused to pay: from three dollars a week to a whopping four dollars. Luckily, the former Victoria Restaurant owned by Spanish emigrant Juan Farto was vacant. Located at the corner of Duval and Greene Streets, the building had been built in 1917 and incorporated beautiful Cuban tile work, busily whirring ceiling fans, and jalousie doors. Joe Russell paid $2,500 for it.\n\n\nIn true Key West fashion, the bar never actually closed during the transition--customers simply picked up their drinks and carried them, along with every piece of furniture in the place, down the block to 201 Duval Street. Service resumed with barely a blink. The new Sloppy Joe's boasted the longest bar in town.  Behind the bar, in the back room, were gambling and the requisite pool tables. Skinner had pride of place above his new long curved bar. The bat that Skinner used to control his patrons now hangs on the wall.\n\n\nNicknames \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell and \u201cJosie Grunts\u201d\nJoe Russell was a Conch.  Born and raised in Key West.  Conch is the name given to Key West natives; a name that derived from that of the tough, tasty mollusk found in the surrounding waters.  Russell was a charter boat captain, rum runner, Hemingway's boat pilot, and the author's fishing companion for twelve years. In his company, Papa once caught an astonishing fifty-four Marlin in 115 days. Hemingway called him \"Josie Grunts\" and used him as the model for Freddy, the owner of Freddy's Bar and captain of the Queen Conch in To Have and Have Not. \n\n\nWhen Joe officially opened the bar, Hemingway and his \"Mob\" of cohorts were enthusiastic regular customers. In fact, the author once called himself a co-owner or silent partner in the enterprise. The \"Mob\" was comprised of some of the literary lights of the day as well as a variety of famous and infamous local residents: John Dos Pasos, Waldo Pierce, J.B. Sullivan, Hamilton Adams, Captain Eddie Saunders, Henry Strater. They wrangled, drank, and philosophized the days away, never knowing they were building a legend.\n\n\nWhen Hemingway left Key West in 1939, he left a number of personal effects stored in a house next to Sloppy Joe's. After the house was sold, the effects were moved into the back room behind the bar at Sloppy Joe's. They remained there until 1962, a year after Hemingway's death, when his widow (fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway) opened the room and took possession of them, finding uncashed royalty checks, unfinished manuscripts, sections of original manuscript of \u201cTo Have and Have Not,\u201d letters, and personal items. Some of the memorabilia was given to the then-owner of the bar, Stan Smith, to be displayed.  One of the items was the snow skis that hang in the bar today.\n\n\nJoe Russell died June 20,1941 of a heart attack, he was 53 years old.  At the time Russell and Ernest Hemingway had been fishing in Cuba for three weeks, Hemingway telephoned Joe Russell Jr. to tell him of his father\u2019s death.  He is buried in the Key West Cemetery.\n\n\nSloppy Joe's Today\n\nSloppy Joe\u2019s was purchased September 8, 1978 by Sid Snelgrove and Jim Mayer and has been owned by the two families since that time.\n\n\nOver the years Sloppy Joe's, like rare Cuban rum, has gained a richness and flavor while essentially remaining unchanged. The ceiling fans still whisper busily, a little bit wobbly but carrying on. The jalousie doors open on a Duval Street busier than even Hemingway could imagine, yet still bearing the off-beat ambience that prompted him to brand Key West \"the St. Tropez of the Poor.\" The long curving bar wears the scars of generations of visitors and Hemingway aficionados, drawn by the legend and hoping some measure of magic will rub off on them - and it does.\n\n\nOpen 365 days a year, each day begins at 9:00 am (noon on Sundays).  Sloppy Joe\u2019s has four complimentary divisions: bar, food, entertainment, and the Retail Store. The bar offers generous drinks, live music on stage every day Noon to 2:00am, and dancing. The quality of the entertainment, showcased on the huge stage facing Duval Street, is exceptional.  The performers offer a wide range of music styles and comical entertainment.\n\n\nJust as in Joe Russell's day, hospitable Bartenders welcome patrons at virtually all hours of the day or night. The generous drinks and casual, undemanding atmosphere so successful in Russell's reign remain, as does the sense that something unusual is always about to happen at Sloppy Joe's.\n\n \t  \nThe main Bar structure was built in 1917; and the second building, which houses the Kitchen and Joe\u2019s Tap Room, was built in 1892.\n\n\nJoe\u2019s Tap Room is attached to Sloppy Joe\u2019s. Open daily at Noon, Joe\u2019s Tap Room has the same food menu as Sloppy Joe\u2019s and offers variety of crafted beers on tap.  The neighborhood has found Joe\u2019s Tap Room as a great place to meet friends and watch sports.\n\n\nSloppy Joe\u2019s Owners\nJoe \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell Original owner, nickname Josie Grunts.

He is a cranky doctor who takes the lead in going on voluntary medical service abroad. He may be a rogue, but he's the finest doctor. People call him an arrogant, rude and unruly \"mad dog,\" but he doesn't mind it at all because thanks to this nickname, no other doctor would try to irritate him. Surprisingly, he is the most caring brother and uncle to his older sister and his niece, and he's as generous as a saint to his patients. His late father was in the forefront of overseas medical services. Back then, he resented his father for being neglectful of his family while he was busy taking care of his patients. But when he followed his father's footsteps and served in Africa, at last he came to understand his father. But as a side effect, he decided not to marry. Dating is fine, but forget marriage. He doesn't want to hurt his family like his father did. He would commit to practicing medicine for his entire life. After serving in Africa for several years, he returns to Korea when his brother-in-law, who is the director of Jahan Hospital, calls for help. Eventually, he will start dating Yoo-ha\n*[[Yoo Dong-geun]] as Park Hyo-seob\n**Yoo In-hyuk as young Park Hyo-seob\n:He is a master shoemaker and owner of a handmade shoe store.

His town, where he has lived his entire life, is targeted for redevelopment. On top of all, his first love, Miyeon, shows up after 36 years, just like a storm. And she's no ordinary woman. She's a proud building owner.\n*[[Jang Mi-hee]] as Lee Mi-yeon\n**[[Jung Chae-yeon]] as young Lee Mi-yeon\n:She is a woman of overbearing haughtiness. But she's also a majestic and elegant landlord. She is arrogant, but she behaves with common decency. She is rude, but she keeps it within bounds. She makes poignant remarks, but she only says the right things. That's why even her audacity and evil tongue seem to make her more charming. Every single investment she makes hits the jackpot, and everything prospers with her. Nevertheless, her life was not without a few bumps on the road. After her husband ran off overseas when his company went bankrupt, she started from the bottom and kept on rolling until she came to own a building. Although she is enjoying a glamorous single life, she feels empty inside somehow. In the beginning, she lives with her \u201cson\u201d Moon-sik.

His life takes a turn when he meets his first love, Lee Mi-yeon after 36 years.\n\nAfter their mother's untimely death, Park Sun-ha takes the responsibility of her younger siblings. She acts as a mother to the family.\n\nIn the other hand, the second daughter, Park Yoo-ha studied hard in medical school and finished her intern course but sacrifices her dream to become a doctor in order to get married to her love, who is from a rich family. They have a daughter, Eun-su. However, her life isn't perfect as people think it to be.\n\nMeanwhile, Jung Eun-tae is an enthusiastic doctor. He volunteered for performing medical service abroad in Africa, but he comes back to Korea. Eun-tae is not interested in marriage because he believes he is like his father, who placed priority on his medical work over family.\n\nLater, Park Yoo-ha and Jung Eun-tae's lives become intertwined.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main=== \n*[[Han Ji-hye]] as Park Yoo-ha<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hancinema.net/han-ji-hye-coming-back-with-kbs-weekend-drama-113306.html|title=Han Ji-hye Coming Back with KBS Weekend Drama|date=December 13, 2017|website=Hancinema}}</ref>\n:She is Hyo-seob\u2019s second daughter. She is a rational woman with a passionate heart. Whereas the eldest daughter Sun-ha looked after the siblings like a mother, Yoo-ha was the type who would give her younger siblings a lesson. The fact that she got into medical school made her the pride and joy of the family. When she married Seongun, a millionaire's son, she was called a Cinderella and became the envy of many women. Although Seongun made her forgo her dream of becoming a doctor, she still loved him. As time went by, she found herself gradually becoming a woman befitting a member of Seongun's family. As she did for Seongun, she starts to endure everything for her lovely daughter Eun-su.\n*[[Lee Sang-woo]] as Jung Eun-tae<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hancinema.net/lee-sang-woo-joins-han-ji-hye-for-shall-we-live-together-113331.html|title=\nLee Sang-woo Joins Han Ji-hye for \"Shall We Live Together\"|date=December 14, 2017|website=Hancinema}}</ref>\n:He's an internist at Jahan Hospital. He is a cranky doctor who takes the lead in going on voluntary medical service abroad. He may be a rogue, but he's the finest doctor. People call him an arrogant, rude and unruly \"mad dog,\" but he doesn't mind it at all because thanks to this nickname, no other doctor would try to get on his nerves. Surprisingly, he is the most caring brother and uncle to his older sister and his niece, and he's as generous as a saint to his patients. His late father was in the forefront of overseas medical services. Back then, he resented his father for being neglectful of his family while he was busy taking care of his patients. But when he followed his father's footsteps and served in Africa, at last he came to understand his father. But as a side effect, he decided not to get married. Dating is fine, but forget marriage. He doesn't want to hurt his family like his father did. He would commit to practicing medicine for his entire life. After serving in Africa for several years, he returns to Korea when his brother-in-law, who is the director of Jahan Hospital, calls for help.

He had wished that his eldest daughter would marry a reliable man, but she brings a younger boyfriend as a potential spouse.

She's a proud building owner.\n*[[Jang Mi-hee]] as Lee Mi-yeon\n**[[Jung Chae-yeon]] as young Lee Mi-yeon\n:She is a woman of overbearing haughtiness. But she's also a majestic and elegant landlord.

Today is 1300.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe village existed during the Medieval years and -during the era of Frank domination, administratively it belonged to the village of Empa.\u00a0 It probably is the village that was granted in 1375 -along with others -to Tibaldi Belfarang by King Peter II of Cyprus as a reward for the services he offered in the war against the Genoese.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Churches and Chapels ===\n\n==== Church of Agios Reginos & Orestis ====\nThe old church of the village that was dedicated to Riginos and Orestis, two foreign saints -which were however reported as having lead an ascetic life in Cyprus and are celebrated together on the 20<sup>th</sup> of August -was located a bit outside of the village, to the east and near a river.\u00a0 The church got destroyed and collapsed with the earthquake that occurred in 1953.\u00a0 Indeed, there is a tradition reporting that, a bit further from this church, there was a bridge with a cave right beneath it, which had stalactites in its interior.\u00a0 Water was springing from that spot.\u00a0 During their tour of Cyprus for the purpose of preaching Christianity, the two saints hid in that cave and remained there for two-three days after being persecuted.\u00a0 This place is considered as a holy one and many are the faithful that seek to be healed by washing their hands and face with the miraculous water of this cave, the two saints also being known as miracle makers with regards to having fever and shivering.\u00a0 The cave is extant today although it is deserted.\n\nIn 1963 the new church of the Saints Riginos and Orestis started being built.\u00a0 The church was completed and baptised in 1965 in a location at the centre of the village and a bit further from the church of St George.\u00a0 Amidst the houses of the village, it is made of stone and has a semicircular roof that is covered with tiles.\u00a0 The steeple is a simple structure adjacent to the rest of the building, it is not very tall, and it has two bells. \u00a0It can accommodate 100-150 Christians.\u00a0 Internally, the icon screen is made as a mosaic (intarsia) and it is completed by the embedded holy icons.\u00a0 The Psalters are wooden -an old making -as is the High Priest\u2019s throne.\u00a0 There is no women\u2019s loft but the holy icon dedicated to the saints (18<sup>th</sup> century) is placed on a special, sealed kneeling desk to the left of the icon screen and towards the corner.\u00a0 A liturgy takes place in it once or twice a month.\u00a0 The day of the two saints is

located at Southwest of the village Tremithousa.\u00a0 It is now the main church of the village, since -until recently -the one that is dedicated to the Saints Riginos and Orestis functioned as the main church in Tremithousa.\n\nThe foundation stone was set in 2001 and the church was \u201cbaptised\u201d on the 13<sup>th</sup> of June 2004.\u00a0 Architecturally it is constructed in the Byzantine style with a dome.\u00a0 It can accommodate around 500-600 faithful.\u00a0 Externally it is painted and whitewashed.\n\nSimplicity prevails in its interior.\n\nIts ecclesiastical wealth makes itself present since the Holy See of Pafos, the Church Committee, and the community\u2019s inhabitants made sure that everything was done to complete the church in all its splendour.\u00a0 The icon screen, which cost quite a lot, is woodcut and made of walnut.\u00a0 The Psalters are also made of walnut-wood and were donated by the sculptor and constructor.\n\nThe fabulous and convenient women\u2019s loft, constructed in a semicircular fashion, allows the faithful of comfortably viewing and enjoying the services every Sunday and on holidays.\n\nExternally, there are plans to enrich and complete the yard by paving it with slates.\u00a0 The church celebrates on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of April, a day when the saint\u2019s Holy icon is carried about in procession and many believers from the surrounding regions come to honour the day of Saint George.<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br />\n== Naming ==\nTremithousa took its name because of the \u201cTremithia\u201d.\u00a0 Tremithia (Terebinth: ''[[Pistacia terebinthus]]'') is a tree that was found in large quantities in the surrounding area.\u00a0 Thus the name Tremithousa implies an area that is filled with Terebinth trees.\u00a0 Indeed, in the old times the village was known for its production of \u201cPafitiki Pissa\u201d (gum of Pafos) ([[Cypriot Greek]]: \u03a0\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u03a0\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1) , which is made out of the resin of the Terebinth tree. Also in the old years with the traditional mills grind the fruit of the tremithia and produced the traditional oil, which was used by all the families.

Today is 1300.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\nThe village existed during the Medieval years and -during the era of Frank domination -administratively it belonged to the village of Empa.\u00a0 It probably is the village that was granted in 1375 -along with others -to Tibaldi Belfarang by King Peter II of Cyprus as a reward for the services he offered in the war against the Genoese.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Churches and Chapels ===\n\n==== Church of Agios Reginos & Orestis ====\nThe old church of the village that was dedicated to Riginos and Orestis, two foreign saints -which were however reported as having lead an ascetic life in Cyprus and are celebrated together on the 20<sup>th</sup> of August -was located a bit outside of the village, to the east and near a river.\u00a0 The church got destroyed and collapsed with the earthquake that occurred in 1953.\u00a0 Indeed, there is a tradition reporting that, a bit further from this church, there was a bridge with a cave right beneath it, which had stalactites in its interior.\u00a0 Water was springing from that spot.\u00a0 During their tour of Cyprus for the purpose of preaching Christianity, the two saints hid in that cave and remained there for two-three days after being persecuted.\u00a0 This place is considered as a holy one and many are the faithful that seek to be healed by washing their hands and face with the miraculous water of this cave, the two saints also being known as miracle makers with regards to having fever and shivering.\u00a0 The cave is extant today although it is deserted.\n\nIn 1963 the new church of the Saints Riginos and Orestis started being built.\u00a0 The church was completed and baptised in 1965 in a location at the centre of the village and a bit further from the church of St George.\u00a0 Amidst the houses of the village, it is made of stone and has a semicircular roof that is covered with tiles.\u00a0 The steeple is a simple structure adjacent to the rest of the building, it is not very tall, and it has two bells. \u00a0It can accommodate 100-150 Christians.\u00a0 Internally, the icon screen is made as a mosaic (intarsia) and it is completed by the embedded holy icons.\u00a0 The Psalters are wooden -an old making -as is the High Priest\u2019s throne.\u00a0 There is no women\u2019s loft but the holy icon dedicated to the saints (18<sup>th</sup> century) is placed on a special, sealed kneeling desk to the left of the icon screen and towards the corner.\u00a0 A liturgy takes place in it once or twice a month.\u00a0 The day of the two saints is celebrated jointly on the 20<sup>th</sup> of August, their holy icon being carried about in procession.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite

{"title_page": "Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII", "text_new": "{{Main article|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology<ref>Frattini, p. 230</ref> as \"insane and arrogant\".

Following their 1939 invasion of West Poland, the Nazis instigated a policy of genocide against Poland's Jewish minority and of murdering or suppressing the ethnic Polish elites, including religious leaders. In 1940, Hitler proclaimed: \"Poles may have only one master \u2013 a German.

Treatment was at its most severe in the annexed regions, where churches were systematically closed and the majority of priests were either murdered, imprisoned or deported. Seminaries and convents were closed.<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/>\n\nEighty per cent of the Catholic clergy and five bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939, where 1,992 Polish clergy died throughout the period;<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/> 108 from Warthegua are regarded as blessed martyrs.<ref name=\"Craughwell\"/> Around 1.5 million Poles were transported to work as forced labor in Germany.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis|''Ad Apostolorum Principis'']] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]]; to the Vatican it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943.

This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church had operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81,628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living.

[[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],<ref>AAS 20 1928 165\u2013178</ref> Caritate Christi,<ref>AAS 24 1932 177\u2013194</ref> and [[Divini Redemptoris]]''.<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65\u2013106</ref> The pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]], and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> Pius also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]. Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nWith the Catholic Church robbed of its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became the subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for it. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] thwarted major results aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed the willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which was called identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, and 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries in Lithuania. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref> The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, and orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy. Pope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, the suffering continues ten years afterwards. [[Cum Jam Lustri|''Cum Jam Lustri'']] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha, and encourages the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issued [[Poloniae Annalibus|''Poloniae Annalibus'']], giving consolation and again expressing his certitude that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests were incarcerated, all seminaries closed, and [[religious institute]]s dissolved.<ref>Giovannetti, 150</ref> On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps|diplomatic corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].<ref>AAS, 1953, 755</ref> After the arrest of the cardinal, authorities supported patriotic priests who were open to separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII wrote again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam|''Gloriosam Reginam'']] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory for Mary, Queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nWith ''[[Invicti athletae]] i''n 1957, Pope Pius addressed in strong words the Polish episcopate for the 300th. anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] by the Russians: \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church.\" The Pope counselled endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, with sacrifices of time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref> The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]: \"Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom.

After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refused to participate and were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" took complete control of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained ground only gradually in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost 3.300 [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]], and [[newspapers]], while 11.500 [[religious]] were asked to leave their convents, monasteries, and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreement with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism was the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]], which led to a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army, and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944.

None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d mentally and physically and beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]].  \"The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956 when he was freed. during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].

Because of rival interpretations the concordat was reenacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, and the others considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed and Catholic activities outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, and religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests, and religious were killed, jailed, or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929, [[Muslim]]s in 1931, and [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other Communist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated. including 139 Franciscan friars. and 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify to their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times.\" Pius explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15,500 priests, religious, and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious, and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"''Untermenschen''\" was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids led to the murdering, assassination, and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day if I was beaten only once or twice.\" Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions and their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions.

Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology<ref>Frattini, p. 230</ref> as \"insane and arrogant\".

The [[Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands#Old Catholic Archbishops of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis|''Ad Apostolorum Principis'']] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]]; to the Vatican it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943.

This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church had operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81,628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision.

[[Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]],<ref>AAS 20 1928 165\u2013178</ref> Caritate Christi,<ref>AAS 24 1932 177\u2013194</ref> and [[Divini Redemptoris]]''.<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65\u2013106</ref> The pontificate of Pius XII from the very beginning faced problems, as large parts of Poland, the [[Baltic States]], and their Catholic populations were incorporated into the [[USSR]]. At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> Pius also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]. Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nWith the Catholic Church robbed of its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became the subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for it. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] thwarted major results aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed the willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which was called identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, and 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries in Lithuania. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref> The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, and orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy. Pope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, the suffering continues ten years afterwards. [[Cum Jam Lustri|''Cum Jam Lustri'']] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha, and encourages the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issued [[Poloniae Annalibus|''Poloniae Annalibus'']], giving consolation and again expressing his certitude that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests were incarcerated, all seminaries closed, and [[religious institute]]s dissolved.<ref>Giovannetti, 150</ref> On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps|diplomatic corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].<ref>AAS, 1953, 755</ref> After the arrest of the cardinal, authorities supported patriotic priests who were open to separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII wrote again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam|''Gloriosam Reginam'']] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory for Mary, Queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nWith ''[[Invicti athletae]] i''n 1957, Pope Pius addressed in strong words the Polish episcopate for the 300th. anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] by the Russians: \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church.\" The Pope counselled endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, with sacrifices of time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref> The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]: \"Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom. Keep Catholic faith and unity.\"<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 34,  in AAS 1957, 321</ref>\n==== Czechoslovakia ====\n\"They can take away your freedom, but they cannot tear the Catholic faith from your hearts. They can turn you into martyrs, but they can never turn you into traitors.\"<ref>AAS, XXXVII, 1945, 252</ref> In 1945, the [[Czechoslovakian]] government expelled its [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Germans|German]] populations from Czechoslovakian territories, thus greatly reducing the percentage of [[Catholics]] in the country. After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refused to participate and were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" took complete control of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained ground only gradually in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost 3.300 [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]], and [[newspapers]], while 11.500 [[religious]] were asked to leave their convents, monasteries, and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreement with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism was the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]], which led to a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army, and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944. After the communist party coup in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> Pope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and admitted him to the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946. \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d mentally and physically and beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]].  \"The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956 when he was freed. during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania, Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was reenacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, and the others considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed and Catholic activities outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, and religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests, and religious were killed, jailed, or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929, [[Muslim]]s in 1931, and [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other Communist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated. including 139 Franciscan friars. and 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify to their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times.\" Pius explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15,500 priests, religious, and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!
