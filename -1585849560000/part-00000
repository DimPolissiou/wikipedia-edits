The basic version consists of three phases as follows:\n\n#Controlled hyperventilation: The first phase involves 30 cycles of breathing. Each cycle goes as follows: take a powerful breath in, fully filling the lungs. Breathe out by passively releasing the breath, but not forcefully. Repeat this cycle at a steady pace thirty times. Hof says that this form of [[hyperventilation]] may lead to [[Paresthesia|tingling sensations]] or [[Lightheadedness|light-headedness]].\n#Exhalation: After completion of the 30 cycles of controlled hyperventilation, take another deep breath in, and let it out completely. Hold the breath (with lungs empty) for as long as possible.\n#Breath retention: When strong urges to breathe occur, take a full deep breath in. Hold the breath for around 15 \u2013 20 seconds and let it go. The body may experience a normal head-rush sensation.\n\nThese three phases may be repeated for three consecutive rounds.<ref name=HofBreathing/>\n\nThe Hof family has offered these basic WHM techniques for free that can be accessed through the official platform of the wim hof method: \n\nhttps://www.wimhofmethod.com/free-mini-class\n\n==Scientific investigations==\nPreliminary and proof-of-principle studies of Hof's method, as well as similar breathing practices, have shown that hyperventilating can temporarily suppress the [[innate immune response]] as well as temporarily increase heart rate and adrenaline levels.<ref name=BiologyNow>{{cite book |last1=Houtman |first1=Anne |last2=Scudellari |first2=Megan |last3=Malone |first3=Cindy |last4=Singh-Cundy |first4=Anu |chapter=22.

The rest was due to their vigorous breathing, which increased the metabolic activity in their respiratory muscles.<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\nThe related [[Tummo|g-Tummo]] practice is called \"psychic heat\" practice because it is accompanied by intense sensations of heat in the spine. It involves special breathing accompanied by meditation involving mental images of flames at certain locations in the body. There are two types of breathing, \"forceful\" and \"gentle\". A scientific study found that only the forceful type results in an increase in body temperature, and that meditation was required to sustain the temperature increase.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kozhevnikov |first1=Maria |last2=Elliott |first2=James |last3=Shephard |first3=Jennifer |last4=Gramann |first4=Klaus |last5=Romanovsky |first5=Andrej A. |title=Neurocognitive and Somatic Components of Temperature Increases during g-Tummo Meditation: Legend and Reality |journal=PLOS One |date=29 March 2013 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e58244 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244|pmc=3612090 |pmid=23555572}}</ref>\n\n===Immune system suppression===\nPeter Pickkers and his PhD student Matthijs Kox of the [[Radboud University Medical Center]] in the Netherlands took blood samples from Hof before and after his regimen of breathing, meditation and an 80-minute full-body ice bath, and found that afterwards he had reduced levels of proteins associated with the immune response.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox injected him with an [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin]] that normally would stimulate a rapid immune response. Most subjects responded with [[influenza|flu]]-like symptoms ([[fever]], [[headache]]s and shivering), with affected cells releasing signalling proteins called [[cytokine]]s. Hof, on the other hand, had no flu-like symptoms and half as many cytokines as control subjects. Moreover, later,  after he had trained some volunteers for a week, they too had reduced symptoms.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox attributed the effect on the immune system to a stress-like response. In the [[hypothalamus]], stress messages from the brain trigger a release of [[adrenaline]], which increases the pumping of blood and releases [[glucose]], both of which can help the body deal with an emergency. It also suppresses the immune system. In Hof and the trained subjects, the adrenaline release was higher than it would be after a person's first bungee jump.<ref name=BiologyNow/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kox M, van Eijk LT, Zwaag J, van den Wildenberg J, GJ Sweep FC, van der Hoeven JG, Pickkers P |date=May 20, 2014 |title=Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=111 |issue=20 |pages=7379\u20137384 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1322174111 |pmc=4034215 |access-date=January 28, 2017 |pmid=24799686}}</ref> It is not yet known which part of the training (cold exposure, breathing or meditation) is primarily responsible for the effect, or whether there are long-term training effects.<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\n== Controversies ==\nPeople have died while attempting the Wim Hof Method.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gezondheid.eenvandaag.nl/tv-items/67565/_iceman_onder_vuur |title='Iceman' onder vuur |first1=Fannie |last1=Tijmstra |first2=Loes |last2=Bomers |date=10 June 2016 |publisher=[[EenVandaag]] |language=Dutch |trans-title='Iceman' under fire |access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.parool.nl/binnenland/-iceman-oefening-eist-opnieuw-leven~a4332186 |title='Iceman'-oefening eist opnieuw leven |first1=Roelf Jan |last1=Duin |date=2 July 2016 |newspaper=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch |trans-title='Iceman' exercise claims a new life |access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref>  Four practitioners of the WHM drowned in 2015 and 2016, and relatives suspected the breathing exercises were to blame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gezondheid.eenvandaag.nl/tv-items/67565/_iceman_onder_vuur|title='Iceman' onder vuur|last1=Tijmstra|first1=Fannie|last2=Bomers|first2=Loes|date=10 June 2016|publisher=[[EenVandaag]]|language=Dutch|trans-title='Iceman' under fire|access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref>{{deadlink|date=February 2020}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/binnenland/-iceman-oefening-eist-opnieuw-leven~a4332186|title='Iceman'-oefening eist opnieuw leven|last1=Duin|first1=Roelf Jan|date=2 July 2016|newspaper=[[Het Parool]]|access-date=23 February 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title='Iceman' exercise claims a new life}}</ref> The WHM website advises doing the exercises in a safe manner and location.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wimhofmethod.com/pages/practice-the-method|title=Practice the Wim Hof Method|website=Wim Hof Method|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129181133/https://www.wimhofmethod.com/pages/practice-the-method|archivedate=29 November 2016|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nCritics of Hof say he overstates the benefits of his method, giving false hope to people suffering from serious diseases, and some of his claims have been uncritically reported by the media.<ref name=trickery>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pepijnvanerp.nl/2016/01/wim-hof-method/|first=Pepijn|last=van Erp|author-link=Pepijn van Erp|title=Wim Hof's Cold Trickery|website=Pepijn van Erp|date=1 January 2016|access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref> On his website he says that it has reduced symptoms of several diseases including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[Parkinson's disease]];<ref name=HofBreathing/> He has also said it might cure some forms of cancer.<ref name=trickery/> Wouter van Marken Lichtenbelt, one of the scientists who studied Hof, stated that \"[Hof's] scientific vocabulary is [[wiktionary:galimatias|galimatias]].

The basic version consists of three phases as follows:\n\n#Controlled hyperventilation: The first phase involves 30 cycles of breathing. Each cycle goes as follows: take a powerful breath in, fully filling the lungs. Breathe out by passively releasing the breath, but not forcefully. Repeat this cycle at a steady pace thirty times. Hof says that this form of [[hyperventilation]] may lead to [[Paresthesia|tingling sensations]] or [[Lightheadedness|light-headedness]].\n#Exhalation: After completion of the 30 cycles of controlled hyperventilation, take another deep breath in, and let it out completely. Hold the breath (with lungs empty) for as long as possible.\n#Breath retention: When strong urges to breathe occur, take a full deep breath in. Hold the breath for around 15 \u2013 20 seconds and let it go. The body may experience a normal head-rush sensation.\n\nThese three phases may be repeated for three consecutive rounds.<ref name=HofBreathing/>\n\nThe Hof family has offered these basic WHM techniques for free that can be accessed through the official platform of the wim hof method: \n\nhttps://www.wimhofmethod.com/free-mini-class\n\n==Scientific investigations==\nPreliminary and proof-of-principle studies of Hof's method, as well as similar breathing practices, have shown that hyperventilating can temporarily suppress the [[innate immune response]] as well as temporarily increase heart rate and adrenaline levels.<ref name=BiologyNow>{{cite book |last1=Houtman |first1=Anne |last2=Scudellari |first2=Megan |last3=Malone |first3=Cindy |last4=Singh-Cundy |first4=Anu |chapter=22.

The rest was due to their vigorous breathing, which increased the metabolic activity in their respiratory muscles.<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\nThe related [[Tummo|g-Tummo]] practice is called \"psychic heat\" practice because it is accompanied by intense sensations of heat in the spine. It involves special breathing accompanied by meditation involving mental images of flames at certain locations in the body. There are two types of breathing, \"forceful\" and \"gentle\". A scientific study found that only the forceful type results in an increase in body temperature, and that meditation was required to sustain the temperature increase.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kozhevnikov |first1=Maria |last2=Elliott |first2=James |last3=Shephard |first3=Jennifer |last4=Gramann |first4=Klaus |last5=Romanovsky |first5=Andrej A. |title=Neurocognitive and Somatic Components of Temperature Increases during g-Tummo Meditation: Legend and Reality |journal=PLOS One |date=29 March 2013 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e58244 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244|pmc=3612090 |pmid=23555572}}</ref>\n\n===Immune system suppression===\nPeter Pickkers and his PhD student Matthijs Kox of the [[Radboud University Medical Center]] in the Netherlands took blood samples from Hof before and after his regimen of breathing, meditation and an 80-minute full-body ice bath, and found that afterwards he had reduced levels of proteins associated with the immune response.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox injected him with an [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin]] that normally would stimulate a rapid immune response. Most subjects responded with [[influenza|flu]]-like symptoms ([[fever]], [[headache]]s and shivering), with affected cells releasing signalling proteins called [[cytokine]]s. Hof, on the other hand, had no flu-like symptoms and half as many cytokines as control subjects. Moreover, later,  after he had trained some volunteers for a week, they too had reduced symptoms.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox attributed the effect on the immune system to a stress-like response. In the [[hypothalamus]], stress messages from the brain trigger a release of [[adrenaline]], which increases the pumping of blood and releases [[glucose]], both of which can help the body deal with an emergency.

Massimo e l'episcopato di questo Santo non potendosi protrarre molto in su nel secolo IV, noi incliniamo a credere che l'episcopato di Torino fosse instituto insieme con quello di Novara nel 398, oppure verso questo tempo''.</ref> Maximus, many of whose [[homily|homilies]] are extant, died between 408 and 423.<ref>Savio, pp. 283-294, at p. 293. Semeria, pp. 24-26.</ref>\n\nBishop Ursicinus (569-609) underwent captivity and loss of his property at the hands of the [[Franks]].

Migne, ''Patrologia Latina'' Vol 77, p. 1045 no 115.</ref> It has been inferred that the [[Diocese of Moriana]] (Maurienne) was detached from that of Turin on this occasion.{{sfn|Herbermann|1913}}\n\nDuke Garibold of Turin, who had assassinated the Lombard King Godebert in 662, was murdered in an act of revenge, in the Baptistry of S. Giovanni il Battisto in the Cathedral of Turin.<ref>Rondolino, p. 10, citing Paul the Deacon at p. 23 note 10. Semeria, p. 50.</ref>\n\nOther bishops were: [[Claudius of Turin]] (817-27), a copious and controversial writer, famous for his opposition to the veneration of images;<ref name=\"ODCC\">{{harvnb|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=359}}</ref> Regimirus (of uncertain date, in the 9th century), who established a rule of common life among his canons; [[Amulo]] (880-98), who incurred the ill-will of the Turinese and was driven out by them; [[Gezo (bishop of Turin)|Gezo]] (1000), who founded the monastery of San Solutore in Turin; [[Landulf (bishop of Turin)|Landulf]] (1037), who founded the Abbey of [[Cavour (TO)|Cavour]] and repaired the damage inflicted on his Church by the [[Saracen]] incursions; [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080), to whom [[Peter Damian|St Peter Damian]] wrote a letter (''Epistolae'' IV.iii) exhorting him to repress the laxity of his clergy in matters of clerical celibacy; [[Boso of Sant'Anastasia|Boso]] (1122\u2013c.1127), who resigned as a cardinal to become bishop.\n\nIn 1074 Bishop [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080) was summoned by [[Pope Gregory VII]] to attend a synod which was announced for 30 November in that year. One of the matters to be treated was the controversy between Cunibert and Abbot Benedict of S. Michele di Chiusa.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. E. J. Cowdrey|title=Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9SG3pEWGfkC&pg=PA66|date=20 August 1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-158459-6|pages=66, 282\u2013283}} The controversy had already involved [[Pope Alexander II]], according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'' [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_1925-1933__MGH__1_Scriptores._SS_12._Historiae_Aevi_Salici__LT.pdf.html Tomus XII] (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204.</ref> The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situated on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and collect the [[Tithe|''decima'' tax]]. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83. Kehr, pp. 82-84, nos. 7-13.</ref>\n\n===Two episcopal 'elections'===\nIn 1243, Bishop Hugo (Uguccione) de Cagnola (1231\u20131243) abdicated the bishopric of Turin and became a [[Cistercian]]. Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from metropolitan obedience of Milan, and made Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism. Archbishop [[Girolamo della Rovere]], in 1566, engaged in a public disputation with the Protestants of the Piedmont and was victorious, which was greeted with great satisfaction by the Duke.

In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S. Andrea, founded in 1028, which was in charge of four parishes, there was a college of Canons Regular; [[Pope Clement XII]] secularized the Canons, who were thereafter sixteen in number (of whom one was the Penitentiary), presided over by an Abbot, an Archpriest and a Primicerius.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 72-73</ref>\n\n===Seminary===\nThe seminary of the diocese of Turin was established by Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere on 4 June 1567, in accordance with the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].

Fedele Savio, in fact, argues that Maximus was the first bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 285-286: ''Ma niuna memoria essendo rimasta di vescovi anteriori a S. Massimo e l'episcopato di questo Santo non potendosi protrarre molto in su nel secolo IV, noi incliniamo a credere che l'episcopato di Torino fosse instituto insieme con quello di Novara nel 398, oppure verso questo tempo''.</ref> Maximus, many of whose [[homily|homilies]] are extant, died between 408 and 423.<ref>Savio, pp. 283-294, at p. 293. Semeria, pp. 24-26.</ref>\n\nBishop Ursicinus (569-609) underwent captivity and loss of his property at the hands of the [[Franks]]. [[Pope Gregory I]] complained to Bishop Syagrius of Autun that someone else was made bishop in place of Ursicinus, in violation of Canon Law, and Ursicinus' diocese was taken away from him.<ref>Savio, pp. 225-226. Kehr, p. 81, no. 1. J. P. Migne, ''Patrologia Latina'' Vol 77, p. 1045 no 115.</ref> It has been inferred that the [[Diocese of Moriana]] (Maurienne) was detached from that of Turin on this occasion.{{sfn|Herbermann|1913}}\n\nDuke Garibold of Turin, who had assassinated the Lombard King Godebert in 662, was murdered in an act of revenge, in the Baptistry of S.

Semeria, p. 50.</ref>\n\nOther bishops were: [[Claudius of Turin]] (817-27), a copious and controversial writer, famous for his opposition to the veneration of images;<ref name=\"ODCC\">{{harvnb|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=359}}</ref> Regimirus (of uncertain date, in the 9th century), who established a rule of common life among his canons; [[Amulo]] (880-98), who incurred the ill-will of the Turinese and was driven out by them; [[Gezo (bishop of Turin)|Gezo]] (1000), who founded the monastery of San Solutore in Turin; [[Landulf (bishop of Turin)|Landulf]] (1037), who founded the Abbey of [[Cavour (TO)|Cavour]] and repaired the damage inflicted on his Church by the [[Saracen]] incursions; [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080), to whom [[Peter Damian|St Peter Damian]] wrote a letter (''Epistolae'' IV.iii) exhorting him to repress the laxity of his clergy in matters of clerical celibacy; [[Boso of Sant'Anastasia|Boso]] (1122\u2013c.1127), who resigned as a cardinal to become bishop.\n\nIn 1074 Bishop [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080) was summoned by [[Pope Gregory VII]] to attend a synod which was announced for 30 November in that year. One of the matters to be treated was the controversy between Cunibert and Abbot Benedict of S. Michele di Chiusa.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. E. J. Cowdrey|title=Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9SG3pEWGfkC&pg=PA66|date=20 August 1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-158459-6|pages=66, 282\u2013283}} The controversy had already involved [[Pope Alexander II]], according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'' [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_1925-1933__MGH__1_Scriptores._SS_12._Historiae_Aevi_Salici__LT.pdf.html Tomus XII] (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204.</ref> The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situated on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and collect the [[Tithe|''decima'' tax]]. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83. Kehr, pp. 82-84, nos. 7-13.</ref>\n\n===Two episcopal 'elections'===\nIn 1243, Bishop Hugo (Uguccione) de Cagnola (1231\u20131243) abdicated the bishopric of Turin and became a [[Cistercian]]. Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from metropolitan obedience of Milan, and made Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism. Archbishop [[Girolamo della Rovere]], in 1566, engaged in a public disputation with the Protestants of the Piedmont and was victorious, which was greeted with great satisfaction by the Duke. In 1567, he conducted a visitation of the valley of the Stura, and preached to and conversed with many Protestants who had come into Piedmont from France, again with some success.<ref>Semeria, p. 287.</ref> During his episcopacy, [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Duke Emanuele Filiberto]] brought to Turin from his castle in Chamb\u00e9ry the Holy [[Shroud of Turin|Shroud]], the personal property of his family, and, on 29 December 1590, the body of [[St Maurice]], the martyr.<ref>Semeria, pp. 338-341.</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the wars between France and Savoy with the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559#Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis (1559)|Peace of Cateau Cambresis]] and the French withdrawal, in 1563 the permanent principal residence of the Dukes of Savoy became the city of Turin. The university was moved from Mondov\u00ec, where it had retreated during the French occupation. A Jesuit college was opened in Turin in 1567 with an annual subsidy from the Duke, and the Jesuit Collegio dei Nobili in 1572.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aldo Scaglione|title=The Liberal Arts and the Jesuit College System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dD09hNd79pIC&pg=PA138|year=1986|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam-Philadelphia|isbn=90-272-2035-2|pages=137\u2013138}}</ref> In 1577, Archbishop della Rovere began the construction of the church ''Santi Martiri'' for the Jesuits in Turin.<ref>Semeria, p. 288-289.</ref>\n\nCardinal Gerolamo della Rovere (1564-1592) had the rare honor of dying while in Conclave in Rome to elect a successor to [[Pope Innocent IX]] (Facchinetti).

At the same time the [[Risorgimento]] and the operations of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] had brought about a revolution in Rome, which drove [[Pope Pius IX]] into exile. Piedmontese policy called for a reform of the rights of the Church, especially of the regular clergy.

It is conjectured that the building was the work of the first Bishop, Maximus, which would place the date around the beginning of the 5th century.<ref>Rondolino, pp. 9-10.</ref> It was constituted of three interconnected churches, San Salvatore, San Giovanni Battista and Santa Maria.

Voters with disabilities may be provided with electronic [[ballot marking device]]s. Optical scan technology has also been used by many standardized tests. Tabulating machines count the ballots either after the polls close or as the voters feed the ballots into the machine, in which case the results are not known until after the polls close. Officials often will manually count any ballots that cannot be read or with a [[write-in]] candidate and may recount the ballots in the event of a dispute.\n* In a jurisdiction using a [[Voting machine#Punched card|punched card system]], voters choose by removing or \"punching out\" a perforated [[Chad (paper)|chad]] from the ballot next each choice, sometimes with tools as simple as a pin, but usually with a [[ballot marking device]] such as the Votomatic. The ballot may be preprinted with candidates and referendums, or may be a generic ballot placed under a printed list of candidates and referendums. Tabulating machines count ballots after the polls close. Officials may manually count the ballots in the event of a dispute. Punched card voting systems are being replaced by other voting systems because of a high rate of inaccuracy related to the incomplete removal of the perforated chad and the inaccessibility to voters with disabilities.\n* In a jurisdiction using a mechanical voting system, often called a \"voting machine\", voters choose by pulling a lever next to their choice. There is a printed list of candidates, parties and referendums next to the levers indicating which lever is assigned to which choice. When the voter pulls a lever, it turns a connected gear in the machine, which turns a counter wheel. Each counter wheel shows a number, which is the number of votes cast using that lever. After the polls close, election officials check the wheels' positions and record the totals. No physical ballot is used in this system, except when the voter chooses to write-in a candidate. Other systems are replacing mechanical voting systems because they are inaccessible to disabled voters, do not have a physical ballot and are getting old.\n* In a jurisdiction using an electronic [[DRE voting machine|direct record voting system]] (DRE), voters choose by pushing a button next to a printed list of candidates and referendums, or by touching the candidate or referendums box on a [[touchscreen]] interface. As the voter makes a selection, the DRE creates an electronic ballot stored by in the memory components of the system. After the polls close, the system counts the votes and reports the totals to the election officials. Many DREs include a communication device to transmit vote totals to a central tabulator. The touchscreen systems remind people of an [[automated teller machine|automated teller machine (ATM)]] and often are described as such.\n* The bonser method is a method used in different parties such as the [[green party of Canada]]. This method requires the voter to select a color related to a proposition. Choices made can be red, yellow or green.

Flies of the family Conopidae are distributed worldwide in all the [[ecozone]]s except for the poles and many of the Pacific islands. About 800 species in 47 genera are described worldwide, about 70 of which are found in North America. The majority of conopids are black and yellow, or black and white, and often strikingly resemble wasps, bees, or flies of the family [[Syrphidae]], themselves notable bee [[mimic]]s. A conopid is most frequently found at flowers, feeding on nectar with its [[proboscis]], which is often long.\n\n[[File:WillistonConopidae.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Conopidae morphology]]\n\n==Description==\nFor terms see [[Morphology of Diptera]].\n\nRather thinly pilose or nearly bare, elongate or stout flies of small to large size (3\u201320&nbsp;mm, usually 5\u201315&nbsp;mm). They are often lustrous with a black and yellow colour pattern or with reddish brown markings. The head is broad and the frons is broad in both sexes. Ocelli may be present or absent (Conopinae). Ocellar bristles are small or absent. Interfrontal bristles and vibrissae are absent. The antennae have three segments, the third bearing a dorsal bare arista or terminal style. Above the antennae is an inflatable ptilinum. The oral opening is large and the proboscis is long and slender and often geniculate. The base of the abdomen is often constricted and the genitalia of both sexes are conspicuous. In the females the genitalia  are often large or greatly elongated. The wing is usually clear, in some cases with dark markings often along the costa. The costa is continuous and the subcostal vein is complete. The anal cell is closed and the first basal cell is always very long, the second moderately\nlong. The apical cell is closed or much narrowed. Tibiae are with (Myopinae) or without dorsal preapical bristle.\n\nSample genera: ''[[Conops]]'', ''[[Dalmannia]]'', ''[[Physocephala]]'', ''[[Stylogaster]]'', ''[[Myopa]]'', and  ''[[Physoconops]]''.\n\n==Biology==\nThe larvae of all conopids are [[endoparasitoid|internal parasites]], most of aculeate (stinging) [[Aculeata|Hymenoptera]]. Adult females aggressively intercept their hosts in flight to deposit eggs. Accordingly, in the species ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', it has been shown that vulnerable foraging bees are likely the most susceptible to parasitism by conopids.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Konig, C. and P.

The subfamily [[Stylogastrinae]], including the genus ''[[Stylogaster]]'', is somewhat different, in that the egg itself is shaped somewhat like a [[harpoon]], with a rigid barbed tip, and the egg is forcibly jabbed into the host. Some species of ''Stylogaster'' are obligate associates of [[army ant]]s, using the ants' raiding columns to flush out their prey. Certain members of the genus ''Physocephala'' have minor economic importance as parasites of honey bees. Some members of this genus, such as ''[[Physocephala tibialis]]'' have been shown to induce honeybees to bury themselves before they die, allowing the adult fly to emerge from their hosts underground.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Malfi|first=Rosemary L.|last2=Davis|first2=Staige E.|last3=Roulston|first3=T'ai H.|date=2014-06-01|title=Parasitoid fly induces manipulative grave-digging behaviour differentially across its bumblebee hosts|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=92|pages=213\u2013220|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.04.005|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> More research is needed to determine the life histories of most conopids.\n\n==Species lists==\n*[http://www.nearctica.com/nomina/main.htm Nearctic]\n*[http://www.faunaeur.org/full_results.php?id=10904  West Palaearctic including Russia]\n*[http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/aocat/conopidae.html  Australasian/Oceanian]\n*[http://konchudb.agr.agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mokuroku/  Japan]\n*[http://eol.org/pages/477/overview World list]\n\n==Identification==\n*[[Otto Kr\u00f6ber|Krober]]. 1925.

They are often lustrous with a black and yellow colour pattern or with reddish brown markings. The head is broad and the frons is broad in both sexes. Ocelli may be present or absent (Conopinae). Ocellar bristles are small or absent. Interfrontal bristles and vibrissae are absent. The antennae have three segments, the third bearing a dorsal bare arista or terminal style. Above the antennae is an inflatable ptilinum. The oral opening is large and the proboscis is long and slender and often geniculate. The base of the abdomen is often constricted and the genitalia of both sexes are conspicuous. In the females the genitalia  are often large or greatly elongated. The wing is usually clear, in some cases with dark markings often along the costa. The costa is continuous and the subcostal vein is complete. The anal cell is closed and the first basal cell is always very long, the second moderately\nlong. The apical cell is closed or much narrowed. Tibiae are with (Myopinae) or without dorsal preapical bristle.\n\nSample genera: ''[[Conops]]'', ''[[Dalmannia]]'', ''[[Physocephala]]'', ''[[Stylogaster]]'', ''[[Myopa]]'', and  ''[[Physoconops]]''.\n\n==Biology==\nThe larvae of all conopids are [[endoparasitoid|internal parasites]], most of aculeate (stinging) [[Aculeata|Hymenoptera]]. Adult females aggressively intercept their hosts in flight to deposit eggs. Accordingly, in the species ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', it has been shown that vulnerable foraging bees are likely the most susceptible to parasitism by conopids.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Konig, C. and P. Schmid-Hempel | year = 1995 | title = Foraging and immunocompetence in workers of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris L. | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 260 | pages = 225\u2013227 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0084}}</ref> The female's abdomen is modified to form what amounts to a \"can opener\" to pry open the segments of the host's abdomen as the egg is inserted. The subfamily [[Stylogastrinae]], including the genus ''[[Stylogaster]]'', is somewhat different, in that the egg itself is shaped somewhat like a [[harpoon]], with a rigid barbed tip, and the egg is forcibly jabbed into the host. Some species of ''Stylogaster'' are obligate associates of [[army ant]]s, using the ants' raiding columns to flush out their prey. Certain members of the genus ''Physocephala'' have minor economic importance as parasites of honey bees. Some members of this genus, such as ''[[Physocephala tibialis]]'' have been shown to induce honeybees to bury themselves before they die, allowing the adult fly to emerge from their hosts underground.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Malfi|first=Rosemary L.|last2=Davis|first2=Staige E.|last3=Roulston|first3=T'ai H.|date=2014-06-01|title=Parasitoid fly induces manipulative grave-digging behaviour differentially across its bumblebee hosts|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=92|pages=213\u2013220|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.04.005|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> More research is needed to determine the life histories of most conopids.\n\n==Species lists==\n*[http://www.nearctica.com/nomina/main.htm Nearctic]\n*[http://www.faunaeur.org/full_results.php?id=10904  West Palaearctic including Russia]\n*[http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/aocat/conopidae.html  Australasian/Oceanian]\n*[http://konchudb.agr.agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp/mokuroku/  Japan]\n*[http://eol.org/pages/477/overview World list]\n\n==Identification==\n*[[Otto Kr\u00f6ber|Krober]]. 1925.

It was originally published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' on December 6, 1894, as \"'''The Dream of an Hour'''\". It was later reprinted in ''St. Louis Life'' on January 5, 1895, as \"The Story of an Hour\". <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nhung|first=Nguyen|title=The Story of an Hour|url=https://www.academia.edu/37918395/The_Story_of_an_Hour|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the short story refers to the time elapsed between the moments at which the protagonist, Louise Mallard, hears that her husband is dead, then discovers that he is alive after all. Featuring a female protagonist who feels liberation at the news of her husband's death, \"The Story of an Hour\" was controversial by American standards of the 1890s. In ''Unveiling Kate Chopin'', [[Emily Toth]] argues that Chopin \"had to have her heroine die\" in order to make the story publishable\".<ref>Toth, Emily (1999).

After being informed of her husband Brently's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is '''happy that her husband died.''' Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home, and she dies of shock at the sight, due to complications of her heart disease. \"From the joy that kills.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite wikisource|title=The Story of an Hour|first=Kate|last=Chopin|year=1894}}</ref>\n\n==Critical responses==\nBert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459\u2013473.</ref>\n\nLawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L. (2000) \"Fatal Self-Assertion in Kate Chopin's 'The Story of an Hour.'\" ''American Literary Realism'' '''32''' (2): 152\u2013158.</ref> Xuding Wang has criticized Berkove's interpretation.<ref>Xuding Wang, \"[http://ir.lib.au.edu.tw/dspace/bitstream/987654321/83/1/019604107120.pdf Feminine Self-Assertion in 'The Story of an Hour']\", English Department, Tamkang University, Taiwan</ref>\n\nIn her article, \"Emotions in 'The Story of An Hour'\",<ref>Jamil, Selina S. \"Emotions in 'The Story of an Hour'\" Explicator (2009): 215\u2013220. EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she can realize her newfound freedoms). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\". This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Perdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and people) are moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.\n\n==Characters==\nLouise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard.

It was originally published in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' on December 6, 1894, as \"'''The Dream of an Hour'''\". It was later reprinted in ''St. Louis Life'' on January 5, 1895, as \"The Story of an Hour\". <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nhung|first=Nguyen|title=The Story of an Hour|url=https://www.academia.edu/37918395/The_Story_of_an_Hour|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the short story refers to the time elapsed between the moments at which the protagonist, Louise Mallard, hears that her husband is dead, then discovers that he is alive after all. Featuring a female protagonist who feels liberation at the news of her husband's death, \"The Story of an Hour\" was controversial by American standards of the 1890s. In ''Unveiling Kate Chopin'', [[Emily Toth]] argues that Chopin \"had to have her heroine die\" in order to make the story publishable\".<ref>Toth, Emily (1999).

After being informed of her husband Brently's tragic death in a railroad accident by a close friend of his, Louise reacts with immediate grief. Louise heads to her room and gradually comes to the realization that she is '''happy that her husband died.''' Later, she heads back downstairs, only to witness Brently coming home, and she dies of shock at the sight, due to complications of her heart disease. \"From the joy that kills.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite wikisource|title=The Story of an Hour|first=Kate|last=Chopin|year=1894}}</ref>\n\n==Critical responses==\nBert Bender, a professor of English at Arizona State University, offers a biographical reading of the text and argues that writing of the 1890s was influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[sexual selection]]. Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\". ''American Literature'' '''63''' (3):  459\u2013473.</ref>\n\nLawrence I. Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L. (2000) \"Fatal Self-Assertion in Kate Chopin's 'The Story of an Hour.'\" ''American Literary Realism'' '''32''' (2): 152\u2013158.</ref> Xuding Wang has criticized Berkove's interpretation.<ref>Xuding Wang, \"[http://ir.lib.au.edu.tw/dspace/bitstream/987654321/83/1/019604107120.pdf Feminine Self-Assertion in 'The Story of an Hour']\", English Department, Tamkang University, Taiwan</ref>\n\nIn her article, \"Emotions in 'The Story of An Hour'\",<ref>Jamil, Selina S. \"Emotions in 'The Story of an Hour'\" Explicator (2009): 215\u2013220. EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she is feeling). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\". This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote, a researcher at Perdue University, argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and people) are moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.\n\n==Characters==\nLouise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard.

He gave daily lessons after the Morning Prayer, where he talked about the authoritative collections of Hadith - Sah\u00eeh al-Bukh\u00e2r\u00ee, Sah\u00eeh Muslim and discussed the Qur'an. He described the content of the books Kit\u00e2b al-Tawh\u00eed, al-Us\u00fbl al-Thal\u00e2thah, and Nukhbah al-Fikr. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe 1990\u20131991 [[Gulf Crisis]] and War, in which an American-led coalition of forces aligned against the Iraqi regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] in response to its seizure of [[Kuwait]], proved an opportunity for al-Ouda and others to tap into an already-existing current of discontent within the Kingdom. When the then-Grand Mufti Abd al-Aziz bin Baz issued a [[fatwa]] lending Islamic justification for the regime to invite American forces to defend Saudi Arabia from Hussein, al-Ouda raised questions about the ability of the Saudi military to defend the Kingdom with so much investment in U.S. armaments. During the war, al-Ouda was a moving force behind two reform petitions addressed to the King. The first, in 1991, was known as the Letter of Demands and was signed by leading Saudi religious, mercantile, and socially prominent figures seeking changes in the form of government, notably the establishment of a Shura (consultative) Council. A year later, the second petition, known as the Memorandum of Advice, which was signed by more than one hundred religious scholars, including establishment Ulama, called for a Shura Council as well as media censorship under religious guidance and review of all the kingdom's laws to insure their conformity with Shari'a. Both petitions expressed loyalty to the house of Sa'ud while opposing the lack of representation in the existing government. Meanwhile, audiotapes of al-Ouda's sermons gained wide circulation and encouraged to other opposition voices after the first Gulf War, as the United States military settled in for a long stay at an airbase outside the capital.<ref name=\"encyclopedia.jrank.org\"/>\n\nAl-Ouda was one of the leaders of the [[Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights]] (CDLR) that was a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] dissident group created in 1993 and was the first ever opposition organization in the Kingdom openly challenging the absolute monarchy, accusing the government and senior Saudi scholars of not doing enough to protect the legitimate Islamic rights of the Muslims.<ref name=\"CDLR_Kapisz\" />\n\nIn September 1994 Salman al-Ouda was imprisoned for alleged \"anti-government activities.\" He and [[Safar al-Hawali]] were arrested together with a large number of their followers in the city of [[Buraidah|Burayda]], [[Al Qassim Province|Qasim]] region. Moreover, Sheikh [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Abd Allah ibn Baaz|Abd al-Aziz Ibn Baz]] issued a fatwa, that unless al-Ouda and al-Hawali repented their former conduct, they would be banned from lecturing, meetings and cassette-recording.\n\nFollowing his five years of imprisonment for having incited opposition to the Saudi government, al-Ouda emerged \"rehabilitated\" in 1999 to become one of the kingdom's most prominent religious spokespersons. With a television program and a website in four languages, he was viewed in 2007 as a supporter of the Saudi government, operating under its protection and in competition with the government-sponsored establishment Ulama (clergy).<ref name=\"encyclopedia.jrank.org\" />\n\nHe was an advocate for [[Shia\u2013Sunni relations|Sunni-Shia dialogue]],<ref name=\"economist_appeal_mercy\" >{{cite news |author= |title=A Muslim appeal for Saudi Arabia to show mercy |url=https://www.economist.com/erasmus/2019/06/02/a-muslim-appeal-for-saudi-arabia-to-show-mercy |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2 June 2019}}</ref> calling for a more inclusive society that would end the marginalization of Saudi Shia citizens.

When the then-Grand Mufti Abd al-Aziz bin Baz issued a [[fatwa]] lending Islamic justification for the regime to invite American forces to defend Saudi Arabia from Hussein, al-Ouda raised questions about the ability of the Saudi military to defend the Kingdom with so much investment in U.S. armaments. During the war, al-Ouda was a moving force behind two reform petitions addressed to the King. The first, in 1991, was known as the Letter of Demands and was signed by leading Saudi religious, mercantile, and socially prominent figures seeking changes in the form of government, notably the establishment of a Shura (consultative) Council. A year later, the second petition, known as the Memorandum of Advice, which was signed by more than one hundred religious scholars, including establishment Ulama, called for a Shura Council as well as media censorship under religious guidance and review of all the kingdom's laws to insure their conformity with Shari'a. Both petitions expressed loyalty to the house of Sa'ud while opposing the lack of representation in the existing government. Meanwhile, audiotapes of al-Ouda's sermons gained wide circulation and encouraged to other opposition voices after the first Gulf War, as the United States military settled in for a long stay at an airbase outside the capital.<ref name=\"encyclopedia.jrank.org\"/>\n\nAl-Ouda was one of the leaders of the [[Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights]] (CDLR) that was a [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] dissident group created in 1993 and was the first ever opposition organization in the Kingdom openly challenging the absolute monarchy, accusing the government and senior Saudi scholars of not doing enough to protect the legitimate Islamic rights of the Muslims.<ref name=\"CDLR_Kapisz\" />\n\nIn September 1994 Salman al-Ouda was imprisoned for alleged \"anti-government activities.\" He and [[Safar al-Hawali]] were arrested together with a large number of their followers in the city of [[Buraidah|Burayda]], [[Al Qassim Province|Qasim]] region.
