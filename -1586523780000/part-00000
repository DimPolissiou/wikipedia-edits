Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions.

Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons.

Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector.

Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket.

It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588}}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment.

It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]].

It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toCross section(link changed toCross section (physics)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2K_experiment"}
{"title_page": "Hull (watercraft)", "text_new": "{{short description|Watertight buoyant body of a ship or boat}}\n[[File:Plano formas.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hull form lines, lengthwise and in cross-section]]\nA '''hull''' is the [[watertight]] body of a [[ship]] or boat. The hull may open at the top (such as a [[dinghy]]), or it may be fully or partially covered with a deck. Atop the deck may be a [[deckhouse]] and other [[superstructure]]s, such as a funnel, derrick, or [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]. The line where the hull meets the water surface is called the [[waterline]].\n\n==General features==\nThere is a wide variety of hull types that are chosen for suitability for different usages, the hull shape being dependent upon the needs of the design. Shapes range from a nearly perfect box in the case of scow barges, to a needle-sharp surface of revolution in the case of a racing multihull sailboat. The shape is chosen to strike a balance between cost, hydrostatic considerations (accommodation, load carrying and stability), hydrodynamics (speed, power requirements, and motion and behavior in a seaway) and special considerations for the ship's role, such as the rounded bow of an [[icebreaker]] or the flat bottom of a [[landing craft]].\n\nIn a typical modern steel ship, the hull will have watertight decks, and major transverse members called [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]]. There may also be intermediate members such as [[girders]], [[wikt:stringer|stringers]] and [[I-beam|webs]], and minor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals, depending on the [[structural arrangement]]. The uppermost continuous deck may be called the \"upper deck\", \"weather deck\", \"spar deck\", \"[[main deck]]\", or simply \"deck\". The particular name given depends on the context\u2014the type of ship or boat, the arrangement, or even where it sails.\n\nIn a typical wooden sailboat, the hull is constructed of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often referred to as ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a [[keel]]. In [[fiberglass]] or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a [[Monocoque#Boats and ships|monocoque]] arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.\n\nPerhaps the earliest proper hulls were built by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, who by  [[30th century BC|3000 BC]] knew how to assemble wooden [[plank (wood)|planks]] into a hull.<ref name=\"AIA\">Ward, Cheryl.  \"World's Oldest Planked Boats,\" in ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001). [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. [http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html Archaeology.org]</ref>\n\n==Hull shapes==\nHulls come in many varieties and can have composite shape, (e.g., a fine entry forward and inverted bell shape aft), but are grouped primarily as follows:\n* Chined and hard-chined. Examples are the flat-bottom (chined), v-bottom, and multi-bottom hull (hard chined). These types have at least one pronounced knuckle throughout all or most of their length.\n* Moulded, round bilged or soft-[[chine (boating)|chined]]. These hull shapes all have smooth curves. Examples are the round bilge, semi-round bilge, and s-bottom hull.\n\n===Planing and displacement hulls===\n<!-- [[Waterline]] links to this section -->\n[[File:Royal Navy MTB 5.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Navy]] World War II [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTB]] planing at speed on calm water showing its [[Chine (boating)#Various types of chine hulls|hard chine hull]] with most of the forepart of the boat out of the water.]]\n* Displacement hull: here the hull is supported exclusively or predominantly by [[buoyancy]]. Vessels that have this type of hull travel through the water at a limited rate that is defined by the waterline length. They are often, though not always, heavier than planing types.\n* Planing hull: here, the [[Planing (boat)|planing]] hull form is configured to develop positive [[dynamic pressure]] so that its [[Draft (hull)|draft decreases]] with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is to have at least one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds<!-- Removed the suggestion that hull speed is a \"maximum\" speed which can't be overcome -- see [[Hull speed]] or <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boatdesign.net/forums/boat-design/hull-speed-1220.html|title=Hull speed|publisher=}}</ref> for an explanation of this missconception -->, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.\n* Semi-displacement, or semi-planing: here the hull form is capable of developing a moderate amount of dynamic lift; however, most of the vessel's weight is still supported through buoyancy.\n\n===Hull forms===\nAt present, the most widely used form is the round bilge hull.<ref>Zeilen: Van beginner tot gevorderde by Karel Heijnen</ref> It gives hulls the rough [[Multiview orthographic projection#Section|cross-section]]al shape of an [[inverted bell]]. \n\nWith a small payload such a craft has less of it s hull below the [[waterline]], giving less resistance and more speed. With a greater  payload resistance is greater and speed lower, but the hull\u2019s outward bend provides smoother performance in waves. As such, the inverted bell shape is a popular form used with planing hulls.\n\n====Chined and hard-chined hulls====\n{{Further|Chine (boating)}}\n\nA chined hull does not have a smooth rounded lower cross-section. Instead, its contours are interrupted by hard angles where components of the hull meet underwater. The sharper the intersection, the \u201charder\u201c the chine. \n\nThe Cajun \"pirogue\" is an example of a craft with hard chines. \n\nBenefits of this type of hull inclde potentially lower production cost and a (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at [[Planing (sailing)|planing]]. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.{{why|date=March 2020}}\n\nChined hulls may have one of three shapes:\n* Flat-bottom chined hulls\n* Multi-chined hulls\n* V-bottom chined hulls. Sometimes called hard chine.\n\nEach of these chine hulls has its own unique characteristics and use. The flat-bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag. To counter the high drag, hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sailboat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced maximum lift and a smooth, fast ride in flat water, but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat-bottom boat. Multi chines are more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc-bottom chine boats have a V{{nbsp}}shape between 6{{nbsp}}and 23{{nbsp}}degrees. This is called the deadrise angle. The flatter shape of a 6-degree hull will plane with less wind or a lower-horsepower engine but will pound more in waves. The deep V{{nbsp}}form (between 18{{nbsp}}and 23{{nbsp}}degrees) is only suited to high-powered planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster, smoother ride in waves.\nDisplacement chined hulls have more wetted surface area, hence more drag, than an equivalent round-hull form, for any given displacement.\n\n====Smooth curve hulls====\n{{Further|Smooth curve hull}}\n{{See also|Boat building}}\n{{bad translation}}\nSmooth curve hulls are hulls which use, just like the curved hulls, a centreboard or an attached keel.\n\nSemi round bilge hulls are somewhat less round.

The hull may open at the top (such as a [[dinghy]]), or it may be fully or partially covered with a deck. Atop the deck may be a [[deckhouse]] and other [[superstructure]]s, such as a funnel, derrick, or [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]. The line where the hull meets the water surface is called the [[waterline]].\n\n==General features==\nThere is a wide variety of hull types that are chosen for suitability for different usages, the hull shape being dependent upon the needs of the design. Shapes range from a nearly perfect box in the case of scow barges, to a needle-sharp surface of revolution in the case of a racing multihull sailboat. The shape is chosen to strike a balance between cost, hydrostatic considerations (accommodation, load carrying and stability), hydrodynamics (speed, power requirements, and motion and behavior in a seaway) and special considerations for the ship's role, such as the rounded bow of an [[icebreaker]] or the flat bottom of a [[landing craft]].\n\nIn a typical modern steel ship, the hull will have watertight decks, and major transverse members called [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]]. There may also be intermediate members such as [[girders]], [[wikt:stringer|stringers]] and [[I-beam|webs]], and minor members called ordinary transverse frames, frames, or longitudinals, depending on the [[structural arrangement]]. The uppermost continuous deck may be called the \"upper deck\", \"weather deck\", \"spar deck\", \"[[main deck]]\", or simply \"deck\". The particular name given depends on the context\u2014the type of ship or boat, the arrangement, or even where it sails.\n\nIn a typical wooden sailboat, the hull is constructed of wooden planking, supported by transverse frames (often referred to as ribs) and bulkheads, which are further tied together by longitudinal stringers or ceiling. Often but not always there is a centerline longitudinal member called a [[keel]]. In [[fiberglass]] or composite hulls, the structure may resemble wooden or steel vessels to some extent, or be of a [[Monocoque#Boats and ships|monocoque]] arrangement. In many cases, composite hulls are built by sandwiching thin fiber-reinforced skins over a lightweight but reasonably rigid core of foam, balsa wood, impregnated paper honeycomb or other material.\n\nPerhaps the earliest proper hulls were built by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, who by  [[30th century BC|3000 BC]] knew how to assemble wooden [[plank (wood)|planks]] into a hull.<ref name=\"AIA\">Ward, Cheryl.  \"World's Oldest Planked Boats,\" in ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' (Volume 54, Number 3, May/June 2001). [[Archaeological Institute of America]]. [http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html Archaeology.org]</ref>\n\n==Hull shapes==\nHulls come in many varieties and can have composite shape, (e.g., a fine entry forward and inverted bell shape aft), but are grouped primarily as follows:\n* Chined and hard-chined. Examples are the flat-bottom (chined), v-bottom, and multi-bottom hull (hard chined). These types have at least one pronounced knuckle throughout all or most of their length.\n* Moulded, round bilged or soft-[[chine (boating)|chined]]. These hull shapes all have smooth curves. Examples are the round bilge, semi-round bilge, and s-bottom hull.\n\n===Planing and displacement hulls===\n<!-- [[Waterline]] links to this section -->\n[[File:Royal Navy MTB 5.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Navy]] World War II [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTB]] planing at speed on calm water showing its [[Chine (boating)#Various types of chine hulls|hard chine hull]] with most of the forepart of the boat out of the water.]]\n* Displacement hull: here the hull is supported exclusively or predominantly by [[buoyancy]]. Vessels that have this type of hull travel through the water at a limited rate that is defined by the waterline length. They are often, though not always, heavier than planing types.\n* Planing hull: here, the [[Planing (boat)|planing]] hull form is configured to develop positive [[dynamic pressure]] so that its [[Draft (hull)|draft decreases]] with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is to have at least one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds<!-- Removed the suggestion that hull speed is a \"maximum\" speed which can't be overcome -- see [[Hull speed]] or <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boatdesign.net/forums/boat-design/hull-speed-1220.html|title=Hull speed|publisher=}}</ref> for an explanation of this missconception -->, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.\n* Semi-displacement, or semi-planing: here the hull form is capable of developing a moderate amount of dynamic lift; however, most of the vessel's weight is still supported through buoyancy.\n\n===Hull forms===\nAt present, the most widely used form is the round bilge hull.<ref>Zeilen: Van beginner tot gevorderde by Karel Heijnen</ref> It gives hulls the rough [[cross-section]]al shape of an [[inverted bell]]. \n\nWith a small payload such a craft has less of it s hull below the [[waterline]], giving less resistance and more speed. With a greater  payload resistance is greater and speed lower, but the hull\u2019s outward bend provides smoother performance in waves. As such, the inverted bell shape is a popular form used with planing hulls.\n\n====Chined and hard-chined hulls====\n{{Further|Chine (boating)}}\n\nA chined hull does not have a smooth rounded lower cross-section. Instead, its contours are interrupted by hard angles where components of the hull meet underwater. The sharper the intersection, the \u201charder\u201c the chine. \n\nThe Cajun \"pirogue\" is an example of a craft with hard chines. \n\nBenefits of this type of hull inclde potentially lower production cost and a (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at [[Planing (sailing)|planing]]. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.{{why|date=March 2020}}\n\nChined hulls may have one of three shapes:\n* Flat-bottom chined hulls\n* Multi-chined hulls\n* V-bottom chined hulls. Sometimes called hard chine.\n\nEach of these chine hulls has its own unique characteristics and use. The flat-bottom hull has high initial stability but high drag. To counter the high drag, hull forms are narrow and sometimes severely tapered at bow and stern. This leads to poor stability when heeled in a sailboat. This is often countered by using heavy interior ballast on sailing versions. They are best suited to sheltered inshore waters. Early racing power boats were fine forward and flat aft. This produced maximum lift and a smooth, fast ride in flat water, but this hull form is easily unsettled in waves. The multi chine hull approximates a curved hull form. It has less drag than a flat-bottom boat. Multi chines are more complex to build but produce a more seaworthy hull form. They are usually displacement hulls. V or arc-bottom chine boats have a V{{nbsp}}shape between 6{{nbsp}}and 23{{nbsp}}degrees. This is called the deadrise angle. The flatter shape of a 6-degree hull will plane with less wind or a lower-horsepower engine but will pound more in waves. The deep V{{nbsp}}form (between 18{{nbsp}}and 23{{nbsp}}degrees) is only suited to high-powered planing boats. They require more powerful engines to lift the boat onto the plane but give a faster, smoother ride in waves.\nDisplacement chined hulls have more wetted surface area, hence more drag, than an equivalent round-hull form, for any given displacement.\n\n====Smooth curve hulls====\n{{Further|Smooth curve hull}}\n{{See also|Boat building}}\n{{bad translation}}\nSmooth curve hulls are hulls which use, just like the curved hulls, a centreboard or an attached keel.\n\nSemi round bilge hulls are somewhat less round. The advantage of the semi-round is that it is a nice middle between the S-bottom and chined hull. Typical examples of a semi-round bilge hull can be found in the [[Centaur]] and [[Laser (sailboat)|Laser]] cruising [[dinghies]].\n\n[[Image:Chine types.svg|thumb|right|100px|(A) S-bottom hull<br>compared to a<br>(B) hard and<br>(C) soft chine hull]]\n\nS-bottom hulls are hulls shaped like an ''s''.{{clarify|date=March 2019}} In the s-bottom, the hull runs smooth to the keel.

The Saltoro Ridge originates in the north from the [[Sia Kangri]] peak on the China border in the Karakoram range. The crest of the Saltoro Ridge's altitudes range from 5,450 to 7,720 m (17,880 to 25,330 feet).

Janaki is constantly worried about Radha and protects her like a child, Janaki is close to Doctor S. V. Lakshmi ([[S. Varalakshmi]]) and Lakshmi's son Manohar ([[K. Balaji]]) is a psychologist.\n\nRamu's brother Captain Muthu ([[R. Muthuraman]]) returns to Chennai. In the train, he meets Rani (Radhika), daughter of Bhoopathy Raja ([[V. K. Ramasamy (actor)|V. K. Ramasamy]]), a local Zamindar. Rani, after reading about the bravery award conferred to Muthu, is attracted to him. Rani's cousin Mohan ([[Nagesh]]) likes Radha and she too likes his soft behaviour.\n\nOn reaching home, Muthu is surprised to see the grown up and beautiful Radha and is attracted to her. At the party hosted Ramu for Muthu's achievement, Muthu scolds Radha for mingling with Mohan and Manohar, and Radha doesn't like it.\n\nOne day Muthu sees Radha whiling away time on the road and sends her home. While returning, Radha stops at Manohar's place, where he tries a hypnosis on her. Muthu, who returns home realises that Radha not returned and goes in search of her. They find her chatting happily with Manohar and Janaki reprimands her.\n\nRamu and his family go to [[Kodaikanal]] for a short vacation. Mohan, Rani and her father join them. Janaki notices Mohan's interest in Radha and warns him. Muthu rejects Rani's advances and makes it clear that he loves Radha.\n\nJanaki and Ramu decide to get Muthu married to Radha. Muthu is happy, but Radha refuses stating that she cannot marry a person who always scolds her. But both Janaki and Ramu go ahead with their plan.\n\nRamu leaves to Trivandrum to investigate a case. Janaki's friend Mala is critical and Janaki rushes to the hospital. Radha is alone and Muthu decides to make use of the opportunity and mixes sedatives in the milk. Radha drinks it and fall unconscious. Muthu walks into her room that night. Next day he leaves for his army camp.\n\nThree months pass by and Ramu returns home from Trivandrum. Meanwhile, Janaki notices changes in Radha's health and takes her to Dr. Lakshmi, who confirms that Radha is pregnant. Janaki is shocked and does not know who is responsible for it and informs Ramu about the pregnancy.\n\nRamu is excited to learn about the pregnancy assuming it to be Janaki's. Ramu's higher officials asks him to travel to [[London]] for an urgent investigation which he is unable to refuse and hence travels again.\n\nJanaki decides to find out the person responsible for Radha's pregnancy. Janaki informs indirectly to both Manohar and Mohan and seeks a solution from them. When she mentions that it is Radha who is affected, both of them suddenly leave.\n\nJanaki takes Radha to their estate in [[Kodaikanal]] to avoid others knowing the truth. A local Doctor Majula attends to Radha there and she delivers a baby boy. In the process, Radha also becomes normal and they return home.\n\nRamu returns from [[London]] and is excited to see his son, Babu with Janaki. She tries to tell the truth, but he does not listen. Doctor Majula from [[Kodaikanal]] comes to [[Chennai]] with her husband Chandran and visits Ramu's house. Majula starts talking about Radha's delivery and Janaki stops her.\n\nMuthu, who was in a state of shock in the army for a few months, gets discharged on the grounds of medical condition. He does not reveal anything to Janaki and she suspects Muthu to be responsible. Chadran is Mohan's friend and he seeks his help for his register marriage with Doctor Manjula. Mohan tells him that he wants to marry Radha and Chandran discloses the secret about her. Mohan meets Janaki and tells that he is innocent and that he doubts Muthu. Janaki shares her suspicion on Manohar.\n\nRamu decides to get Muthu married to Radha but Janaki seeks more time, Janaki finally agrees for the marriage, but now Muthu refuses, stating that he does not wish to marry the girl who refused him a year back. Mohan confronts Manohar about Radha's pregnancy. Manhar explains his innocence and reveals that Muthu had come to get sedatives and after which he mentioned a big mistake. Mohan informs Janaki and now she confirms that Muthu is the one.\n\nAt the time, Janaki gets a call from her friend Mala, who says that Muthu will marry Rani at Tiruthani. Janaki rushes with Mohan to stop the marriage, but is too late, Janaki brings the newlyweds home. At home, Rani treats the child badly and Radha slaps her. Rani feels that Radha is jealous of her marriage to Muthu and decides to leave. So Janaki sends Radha to her friend Mala's place.\n\nRadha comes for Babu's first birthday function, Janaki takes her separately and scolds her for coming home when they still have no clarity about the father of the child. This is overheard by Ramu and he demands the truth from Janaki. Radha now confesses that babu is her child. Ramu demands to know the father and Mohan and Manohar say that it was Muthu. Ramu, angry with Muthu comes with his revolver and demands the truth.\n\nMuthu finally reveals the truth about that night when he entered her room. Radha fell unconscious after drinking the milk and Muthu visited her room. He decides to take a medication to help him in his act and steps out. When about to take the tablet mixed in water, he hears a car and assuming it to be Janaki, he rushes into his room. But it was Ramu who had arrived and he drinks the medication thinking it to be water and enters Radha's room mistakenly. After a couple of hours, Ramu attends to a phone call which Muthu overhears. Ramu in a drowsy states comes out of Radha's room and informs Muthu that Janaki is sleeping inside and that he is leaving on work.

office in the [[history of France]]. As First Secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], he was the first [[Left-wing politics|left-wing politician]] to assume the presidency under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].\n\nReflecting family influences, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the [[Vichy Regime]] during its earlier years. Subsequently he joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand opposed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965\u201388; with the exception of 1969. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was elected President at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. He was [[1988 French presidential election|re-elected in 1988]] and remained in office until 1995.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand invited the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the [[death penalty]], the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] advanced European integration via the [[Maastricht Treaty]], but he reluctantly accepted [[German reunification]]. During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly \"[[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Grands Projets]]\". He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]], in 1991. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation governments]]\" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by [[Jacques Chirac]] (1986\u20131988), and [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995). Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the [[prostate cancer]] he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency.\n\nBeyond making the French left electable, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the rise of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term).\n\n==Family==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was born in [[Jarnac]], [[Charente]], and [[baptism|baptized]] '''Fran\u00e7ois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand''', the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain. His family was devoutly Catholic<ref>Tiersky, Ronald. ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President''. 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. pp. 38\u201342.</ref> and conservative. His father worked as an engineer for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans|Compagnie Paris Orl\u00e9ans]] railway. He had three brothers, Robert, Jacques, and Philippe, and four sisters, Antoinette, Marie-Jos\u00e8phe, Colette, and Genevi\u00e8ve.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's wife, [[Danielle Mitterrand]] (''n\u00e9e'' Gouze, 1924\u20132011), came from a socialist background and worked for various left-wing causes. They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June \u2013 17 September 1945), [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand|Jean-Christophe]], born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949. He also had two children as results of extra-marital affairs: an acknowledged daughter, [[Mazarine Pingeot|Mazarine]] (born 1974), with his mistress [[Anne Pingeot]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/francois-mitterrands-love-letters-to-secret-mistress-to-be-published |title=Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's love letters to secret mistress to be published|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|date=5 October 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref> and an unacknowledged son, [[Hravn Forsne]] (born 1988), with Swedish journalist [[Christina Forsne]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Okay, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was my dad,' Swedish politician reveals|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20140809-swedish-politician--french-president-mitterrand-son-illegitimate/|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=France 24|date=9 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810011156/http://www.france24.com/en/20140809-swedish-politician--french-president-mitterrand-son-illegitimate/|archive-date=10 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's nephew [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand]] is a journalist, Minister of Culture and Communications under [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (and a supporter of [[Jacques Chirac]], former French President), and his wife's brother-in-law [[Roger Hanin]] was a well-known French actor.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Further|France in the twentieth century|French Third Republic|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and the far right}}\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand studied from 1925 to 1934 in the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Paul in [[Angoul\u00eame]], where he became a member of the [[Jeunesse Etudiante Chr\u00e9tienne]] (JEC), the student organisation of ''[[Catholic Action|Action catholique]]''. Arriving in Paris in autumn 1934, he then went to the [[\u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques]] until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the ''Volontaires nationaux'' (National Volunteers), an organisation related to [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s far-right league, the ''[[Croix de Feu]]''; the league had just participated in the [[6 February 1934 riots]] which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' (Left-Wing Coalition).<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\">[[Pierre P\u00e9an]], ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'' (biography on Mitterrand), p.23\u201335</ref>\n\nContrary to some reports, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand never became a formal member of the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF) which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party.<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\" /> However, he did write news articles in the ''[[L'Echo de Paris]]'' newspaper, which was close to the PSF. He participated in the demonstrations against the \"''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8que]] invasion''\" in February 1935 and then in those against law teacher [[Gaston J\u00e8ze]], who had been nominated as juridical counsellor of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Negus]], in January 1936.\n\nWhen Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's involvement in these conservative nationalist movements was revealed in the 1990s, he attributed his actions to the milieu of his youth. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand furthermore had some personal and family relations with members of the [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]], a far-right terrorist group in the 1930s.<ref>[[Henry Rousso]], ''Le Syndrome de Vichy'', p.365</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand then served his [[Conscription in France|conscription]] from 1937 to 1939 in the 23rd r\u00e9giment d'infanterie coloniale. In 1938, he became the best friend of [[Georges Dayan]], a Jewish socialist, whom he saved from anti-Semitic aggressions by the national-royalist movement ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jean |last=Lacouture|title=Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais|publisher= \u00e9d. du Seuil, \u00ab Points \u00bb|page= 46/48}}</ref> His friendship with Dayan caused Mitterrand to begin to question some of his nationalist ideas. Finishing his law studies, he was sent in September 1939 to the [[Maginot line]] near [[Montm\u00e9dy]], with the rank of Sergeant-chief (infantry sergeant). He became engaged to Marie-Louise Terrasse (future actress and television presenter [[Catherine Langeais]]) in May 1940, when she was 16, but she broke it off in January 1942. Following an observation of Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became an [[agnostic]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiHLZQ6XtzEC|title=Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President|first=Ronald|last=Tiersky |date=1 January 2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|via=Google Books|isbn=9780742524736}}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's actions during [[World War II]] were the cause of much controversy in France during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n===Prisoner of War: 1940\u20131941===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was at the end of his national service when the war broke out.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand worked under [[Jean-Paul Favre de Thierrens]] who was a spy for the British secret service. He then moved to the [[Commissariat au reclassement des prisonniers de guerre]] (Service for the orientation of POWS). During this period, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was aware of Thierrens's activities and may have helped in his [[disinformation]] campaign{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. At the same time, he published an article detailing his time as a POW in the magazine ''France, revue de l'\u00c9tat nouveau'' (the magazine was published as propaganda by the Vichy Regime).<ref>reprinted in ''Politique I'', in 1978.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1942.jpg|thumb|Mitterrand (right) with [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] on 15 October 1942]]\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand has been called a \"Vichysto-r\u00e9sistant\" (an expression used by the historian Jean-Pierre Az\u00e9ma to describe people who supported Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], the head of the Vichy Regime, before 1943, but subsequently rejected the Vichy Regime).<ref>Robert Belot in ''La R\u00e9sistance sans De Gaulle'', \u00e9d.

In April, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Fric caused a major disturbance in a public meeting held by the collaborator [[Georges Claude]]. From mid-1942, he sent false papers to POWs in Germany{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} and on 12 June and 15 August 1942, he joined meetings at the Ch\u00e2teau de Montmaur which formed the base of his future network for the resistance.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', op. cit., pp. 75/79 et Franz-Olivier Giesbert, ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, une vie'', \u00e9d. du Seuil, \u00ab Points \u00bb, 1996, pp. 77/79</ref> From September, he made contact with [[Free France|Free French Forces]], but clashed with {{ill|Michel Cailliau|fr}}, General [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s nephew (and de Gaulle's candidate to head-up all POW-related resistance organizations).<ref>Pierre P\u00e9an, ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'', op. cit., pp. 217/218 et Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', op. cit., p. 81</ref> On 15 October 1942, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Marcel Barrois (a member of the resistance deported in 1944) met Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] along with other members of the ''Comit\u00e9 d'entraide aux prisonniers rapatri\u00e9s de l'Allier'' (Help group for repatriated POWs in the department of Allier).<ref>a photograph taken at this meeting is on the cover of Pierre P\u00e9an's book. Marcel Barrois is in the photo.</ref> By the end of 1942, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand met [[Pierre de B\u00e9nouville|Pierre Guillain de B\u00e9nouville]], an old friend from his days with [[La Cagoule]]. B\u00e9nouville was a member of the resistance groups ''[[Combat (French Resistance)|Combat]]'' and ''[[Noyautage des administrations publiques]]'' (NAP).\n\nIn late 1942, the non-occupied zone was invaded by the Germans. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand left the Commissariat in January 1943, when his boss {{ill|Maurice Pinot|fr}}, another vichysto-r\u00e9sistant, was replaced by the collaborator Andr\u00e9 Masson, but he remained in charge of the ''centres d'entraides''. In the spring of 1943, along with [[Gabriel Jeantet]], a member of Marshal P\u00e9tain's cabinet, and [[Simon Arbellot]] (both former members of La Cagoule), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received the [[Order of the Francisque]] (the honorific distinction of the Vichy Regime).\n\nDebate rages in France as to the significance of this. When Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's Vichy past was exposed in the 1950s, he at first denied having received the Francisque (some sources say he was designated for the award, but never received the medal because he went into hiding before the ceremony took place)<ref name=\"Glasbert\">\"autumn 1943\", from: Franz-Olivier Giesbert, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand ou la tentation de l'histoire, \u00c9ditions du Seuil, 1977 {{ISBN|2-02-004591-5}}, chap. 5, p.49.</ref> Jean Pierre-Bloch says that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was ordered to accept the medal as cover for his work in the resistance.<ref>[[Jean Pierre-Bloch]], ''De Gaulle ou le temps des m\u00e9prises'' (pp. 216/218) \u00ab C'\u00e9tait sur notre ordre que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 dans les services de prisonniers de Vichy.

When Andr\u00e9 Masson began to talk about \"''la trahison des gaullistes''\" (the Gaullist treason), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand stood up in the audience and shouted him down, saying Masson had no right to talk on behalf of POWs and calling ''la rel\u00e8ve'' a \"''con''\" (i.e., something stupid).

The man they arrested was [[Pol Pilven]], a member of the resistance who was to survive the war in a concentration camp. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was in Paris at the time.\n\nWarned by his friends, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand escaped to London aboard a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] plane on 15 November 1943 (piloted by then-[[Squadron Leader]] [[Lewis Hodges]]). He promoted his movement to the British and American Authorities, but he was sent to [[Algiers]], where he met de Gaulle, by then the uncontested leader of the Free French. The two men clashed, de Gaulle refused to jeopardize the Resistance by including a movement that gathered information from POWs.<ref name=\"Franz-Olivier Giesbert 1996, p. 100\">Franz-Olivier Giesbert, ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, une vie'', \u00e9d. du Seuil, 1996, p. 100</ref><ref>Charles de Gaulle, ''M\u00e9moires de guerre \u2013 L'Unit\u00e9 : 1942-1944'' (tome II)</ref> Later Mitterrand refused to merge his group with other POW movements if de Gaulle's nephew Cailliau was to be the leader.<ref name=\"Franz-Olivier Giesbert 1996, p. 100\"/> Under the influence of Henri Frenay, de Gaulle finally agreed to merge his nephew's network and the RNPG with Mitterrand in charge.<ref>Pierre P\u00e9an book pp. 364/365</ref> Thus the RNPG was listed in the French Force organization from spring 1944.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand returned to France by boat via England. In Paris, the three Resistance groups made up of POWs (Communists, Gaullists, RNPG) finally merged as the POWs and Deportees National Movement (''{{ill|Mouvement national des prisonniers de guerre et d\u00e9port\u00e9s|fr}}'', MNPGD) and Mitterrand took the lead. In his memoirs, he says that he had started this organisation while he was still officially working for the Vichy Regime. From 27 November 1943 Mitterrand worked for the [[Bureau central de renseignements et d'action]].<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', tome 1, p. 102</ref> In December 1943 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand ordered the execution of Henri Marlin (who was about to order attacks on the \"[[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]\") by Jacques Paris and Jean Munier, who later hid out with Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's father.\n\nAfter a second visit to London in February 1944, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took part in the liberation of Paris in August; he took over the headquarters of Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux prisonniers de guerre (general office for POW, the ministry he was working for), immediately he took up the vacant post of secretary general of POWs. When de Gaulle entered Paris following the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], he was introduced to various men who were to be part of the provisional government. Among them was Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, when they came face to face, de Gaulle is said to have muttered: \"You again!\" He dismissed Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 2 weeks later.\n\nIn October 1944 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and [[Jacques Foccart]] developed a plan to liberate the POW and concentration camps. This was called operation ''Vicarage''. On the orders of de Gaulle, in April 1945 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand accompanied General Lewis as the French representative at the liberation of the camps at [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. By chance Mitterrand discovered his friend and member of his network, [[Robert Antelme]], suffering from [[typhus]]. Antelme was restricted to the camp to prevent the spread of disease, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand arranged for his \"escape\" and sent him back to France for treatment.<ref>Jean Lacouture, Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e9d.

At the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 legislative election]], he led the list of the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts]] (''Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines'', RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (''Union d\u00e9mocratique et socialiste de la R\u00e9sistance'', UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the \"[[Three-parties]] alliance\" (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).\n\nIn the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 legislative election]], he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the [[Ni\u00e8vre]] ''d\u00e9partement''. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very [[anti-communist]] campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon (Ville)|Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon]] from 1959 to 1981.\n\nIn May 1948 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand participated in the [[Congress of The Hague]], together with [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Albert Copp\u00e9]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]. It originated the European Movement.\n\nAs Overseas Minister (1950\u20131951), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of [[Morocco]]'s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]].\n\nIn June 1953 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand attended the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Seated next to the elderly [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.\n\n===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954\u201358===\n\nAs [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] in [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]]'s cabinet (1954\u20131955), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had to direct the response to the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. He claimed: \"[[French Algeria|Algeria is France]].\" He was suspected of being the [[informant|informer]] of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.\n\nThe UDSR joined the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], a centre-left coalition, which won the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative election]]. As [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Justice Minister]] (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in [[Guy Mollet]]'s cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President [[Rene Coty]] to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret.<ref name=\"lepoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/les-guillotines-de-mitterrand-31-08-2001-56908_20.php|title=Les guillotin\u00e9s de Mitterrand \u2013 Le Point|publisher=lepoint.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=2001-08-31}}</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of [[Theodore Dalrymple]]) to accuse Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when was popular with the French people.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =  Dalrmymple\n  | first = Theodore\n  | title= The Battle of Algiers\n  | magazine = The New English Review\n  | date=March 2015| url = http://www.newenglishreview.org/Theodore_Dalrymple/A_Battle_of_Algiers/\n  | accessdate = 2016-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAs Minister of Justice he was an official representative of France during the wedding of [[Rainier III]], [[Prince of Monaco]], and actress [[Grace Kelly]].

He justified his opposition by the circumstances of de Gaulle's comeback: the [[May 1958 crisis|13 May 1958 quasi-putsch]] and military pressure. In September 1958, determinedly opposed to Charles de Gaulle, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand made an appeal to vote \"no\" in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum over the Constitution]], which was nevertheless adopted on 4 October 1958. This defeated coalition of the \"No\" was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\nThis attitude may have been a factor in Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's losing his seat in the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 elections]], beginning a long \"crossing of the desert\" (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle's decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] candidate. One year later, he was [[1959 French Senate election|elected]] to represent [[Ni\u00e8vre]] in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he was part of the [[Democratic Left (France)|Group of the Democratic Left]]. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste unifi\u00e9'', PSU) which was created by Mend\u00e8s-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet's cabinet and by his past in Vichy.\n\n[[File:Portret van Francois Mitterrand, Bestanddeelnr 910-7485.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 16 October 1959]]\nAlso in that same year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the ''Observatory Affair''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D9173BF93BA15755C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=The Mitterrand Mystery | first1=Robert O. | last1=Paxton | date=28 June 1987 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}{{sic}}</ref> The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy [[Robert Pesquet]] that he was the target of an ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]'' death squad and accused Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. \"No, and don't insist\" was the General's response, \"It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.\"<ref>Tiersky, Ronald.

Practicing left unity in Ni\u00e8vre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Ni\u00e8vre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]] (''Convention des institutions r\u00e9publicaines'', CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to [[Charles de Gaulle]] in publishing ''Le Coup d'\u00c9tat permanent'' (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle's personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President's exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.\n\nIn 1965, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the [[1965 French presidential election|presidential election]] by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (PR) and [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU)). He ended the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader [[Guy Mollet]], Mitterrand's candidacy prevented [[Gaston Defferre]], his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.\n\nDe Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists:  centrist [[Jean Monnet]], moderate conservative [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended [[Raoul Salan]], one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] during the [[Algerian War]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la gauche d\u00e9mocrate et socialiste'', FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1968.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 29 May 1968]]\nIn the [[1967 French legislative election|legislative election of March 1967]], the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of [[Jacques Duhamel]]). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).\n\nIn Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the [[Democratic Centre (France)|Democratic Centre]] of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle's [[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique|Union for the Fifth Republic]] remained the leading French party.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond]], ''Notre si\u00e8cle'', 1988, Fayard, p.664 ff.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] governmental crisis, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In [[1968 French legislative election|this election]], the right wing won its largest majority since the ''[[National Bloc (France)|Bloc National]]'' [[1919 French legislative election|in 1919]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: [[Guy Mollet]] refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. [[Georges Pompidou]] faced the centrist [[Alain Poher]] in the [[1969 French presidential election|second round]].\n\n===Socialist Party leader: 1971\u201381===\nAfter the FGDS's implosion, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand turned to the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the [[Epinay Congress]], the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by [[Guy Mollet]]'s supporters. They proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists. For Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet's faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: \"Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4t3wo_congres-d-epinay-1971-francois-mitt_news|title=Congr\u00e8s d'Epinay (1971)|last=|first=|date=2008-03-22|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22|quote=Celui qui n\u2019accepte pas la rupture avec l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli, avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capitaliste, celui l\u00e0, il ne peut pas \u00eatre adh\u00e8rent du Parti Socialiste.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/francois-mitterrand-socialist-party-common-program-communist-pcf-1981-elections-austerity/|title=The Many Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|last=Birch|first=Jonah|date=19 August 2015|website=[[Jacobin]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1972, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand signed the [[Programme commun|Common Programme of Government]] with the Communist [[Georges Marchais]] and the [[Left Radical Party|Left Radical]] [[Robert Fabre]]. With this programme, he led the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative campaign]] of the \"Union of the Left\".\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-1979-05-06 (3758237073).jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in Strasbourg on 5 May 1979]]\nAt the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d'Estaing criticised him as being \"a man of the past\", due to his long political career. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d'Estaing, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.\n\nIn 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'', then lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time [[1936 French legislative election|since 1936]], the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by [[Michel Rocard]] who criticized the programme of the PS as being \"archaic\" and \"unrealistic\". The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won the vote at the Party's [[Metz Congress]] (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nFor his third candidacy for presidency, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan \"the quiet force\". He campaigned for \"another politics\", based on the Socialist programme ''[[110 Propositions for France]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1981/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1981 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate [[Georges Marchais]]), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage.\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===First term: 1981\u20131988===\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Ronald Reagan (r.) 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mitterrand with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]\nIn the [[1981 French presidential election|presidential election of 10 May 1981]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named [[Pierre Mauroy]] as Prime Minister and organised a new [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.\n\n====Economic policy====\nThe beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing [[economic policy]] based on the [[110 Propositions for France]] and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]] and the [[Left Radical Party]]. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]], an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the [[Jean Auroux|Auroux Act]]). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity ([[Keynesianism]]), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained [[monetary policy]] implemented by the [[Bank of France]].<ref>Reichart, Alexandre (2015). \"[http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2015;1.11 French Monetary Policy (1981\u20131985), A Constrained Policy, between Volcker Shock, the EMS and Macroeconomic Imbalances]\".

Housing allocations for the low-paid were raised by 25% in 1981, and in the two years following May 1981 family allowances were increased by 44% for families with 3 children and by 81% for families with 2 children. In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7&nbsp;million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.<ref>''Socialism, the State and Public Policy'' in France edited by Philip G. Cerny and Martin A. Schain</ref>\n\nMajor efforts were made to improve access to housing and health care, while the government also attempted to tackle working-class under-achievement in schools by reinforcing the comprehensive system, modernising the curriculum and reducing [[Streaming (education)|streaming]]. As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for \"solidarity contracts\" whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Mitterrand's France'' Edited by Sonia Mazey and Michael Newman</ref> In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"Vail2009\">{{cite book |title=Recasting Welfare Capitalism Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany |first=Mark I. |last=Vail |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-967-5}}</ref> In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.<ref>''Contemporary France: Politics and Society Since 1945'' by D.

Priority was given to the struggle against inflation in order to remain competitive in the [[European Monetary System]]. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"Smith1998\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=W.

The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child\n\nIn order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers\u2019 rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers.<ref>''The French Socialist Party: Resurgence and Victory'' by D. S. Bell and Byron Criddle</ref> From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">France during the socialist years by Gino Raymond</ref> A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.\n\nAlthough the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women\u2019s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families to get back into employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other\u2019s debts.\n\nChildcare facilities were also expanded, with the number of places in cr\u00e8ches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased.

A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.\n\nThe Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A fonds regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.\n\nLibraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Domestic difficulties====\nThe Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the [[Alain Savary|Savary Bill]], to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. [[Laurent Fabius]] succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the [[Greenpeace]]-owned ex-[[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was docked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, [[whaling]], and [[seal hunting]]. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defense Minister [[Charles Hernu]]. France subsequently paid reparations of 1.8&nbsp;million USD to Greenpeace.\n\n====First Cohabitation====\nBefore the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]], [[proportional representation]] was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the [[Rally for the Republic]]/[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) coalition. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader [[Jacques Chirac]] as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as \"[[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |title=Socialist Party |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=1914-07-31 |accessdate=11 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303143326/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChirac mostly handled domestic policy while Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand concentrated on his \"reserved domain\" of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalization, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform ([[Alain Devaquet|Devaquet Bill]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac's cabinet, the President's popularity increased.\n\nWith the polls running in his favor, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. He proposed a moderate programme (promising \"neither nationalisations nor liberalisation\") and advocated a \"united France,\" and laid out his policy priorities in his \"Letter to the French People.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1988/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1988 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand decided to organize a new [[1988 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The PS obtained a relative parliamentary majority. Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.\n\nThe second term was marked by the creation of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|Insertion Minimum Revenue]] (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the [[Generalized social tax]]; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]; the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] on [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]]; the Besson law of 1990;<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the Mermaz Law of 1989;,<ref name=\"justlanded\">{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/France/Articles/Property/Letting-in-France|title=France: Letting in France, Rules & Regulations, Various rules and regulations apply to the letting of|publisher=justlanded.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the introduction of a private childcare allowance;<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Post-Industrial Welfare States: Adapting Post-War Social Policies to New Social Risks|author1=Armingeon, K.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-134-17910-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTi2SS8egosC|page=218|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the Urban Orientation Law of 1991;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/247-FR_Housing.pdf |title=National Analytical Study on Housing|date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the [[Pierre Arpaillange|Arpaillange Act]] on the financing of political parties; the reform of the [[penal code]]; the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]] concerning [[New Caledonia]]; the [[Loi Evin|Evin Act]] on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"securite-sociale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|title=Le portail du service public de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale / L'allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire est&nbsp;(...)|publisher=securite-sociale.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082739/http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities.<ref name=\"google8\">{{cite book|title=Implementing Inclusive Education|author=Innovation, C.E.R.|date=1997|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=9789264155893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7N3QP75Q9wC|page=24|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] with the building of the [[Louvre Pyramid]], the [[Channel Tunnel]], the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La D\u00e9fense]], the [[Bastille Opera]], the Finance Ministry in [[Bercy]], and the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|National Library of France]]. On 16 February 1993, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand inaugurated in [[Fr\u00e9jus]] a memorial to the [[Indochina War|wars in Indochina]].\n\nBut the second term was also marked by rivalries within the PS and the split of the ''Mitterrandist'' group (at the [[Rennes Congress]], where supporters of [[Laurent Fabius]] and [[Lionel Jospin]] clashed bitterly for control of the party), the scandals about the financing of the party, the [[Infected blood scandal (France)|contaminated blood scandal]] which implicated Laurent Fabius and former ministers Georgina Dufoix and Emond Herv\u00e9, and the Elys\u00e9e wiretaps affairs.\n\n====Second Cohabitation====\nDisappointed with Rocard's apparent failure to enact the Socialists' programme, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand dismissed Michel Rocard in 1991 and appointed [[\u00c9dith Cresson]] to replace him. She was the first woman to become Prime Minister in France, but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency for making acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left's 92. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] as Prime Minister. The second \"cohabitation\" was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]]'s suicide. His second and last term ended after the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] in May 1995 with the election of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] lost the presidential election.\n\nOverall, as President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand maintained the \"basic characteristic of a strong welfare base underpinned by a strong state.\" A United Nations Human Development report concluded that, from 1979 to 1989, France was the only country in the OECD (apart from Portugal) in which income inequalities did not get worse.<ref>''France since 1870: Culture, Politics, and Society'' by Charles Sowerine</ref> During his second term as president, however, the gap between rich and poor widened in France,<ref>''One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century'' by Donald Sassoon</ref> with both unemployment and poverty rising in the awake of the economic recession of 1991\u20131993.<ref>''The Mitterrand Years: Legacy and Evaluation'' edited by Mairi Maclean</ref> According to other studies, though, the percentage of the French population living in poverty (based on various criteria) fell between the mid-Eighties and the mid-Nineties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bT-3laKFEUsC&pg=PA149&dq=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995#v=onepage&q=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995&f=false|title=Statistical Handbook on the Social Safety Net|first=Fernando Francisco|last=Padr\u00f3|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9781573565165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cajWAgAAQBAJ|title=Innovations in Labour Market Policies The Australian Way: The Australian Way|last=OECD|date=17 July 2001|publisher=OECD Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9789264194502}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand}}\n\n====East/West relations====\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand supported closer European collaboration and the preservation of France's special relationship with its former colonies, which he feared were falling under \"[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] influence.\" His drive to preserve French power in Africa led to controversies concerning Paris' role during the [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref name=\"rwanda\">[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece Mitterrand's role revealed in Rwandan genocide warning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706182535/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece |date=6 July 2008 }}, 3 July 2007.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also sharply criticized the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention]] in [[Afghanistan]] as well as the country's nuclear weapons buildup. When Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand visited the USSR in November 1988, the Soviet media claimed to be 'leaving aside the virtually wasted decade and the loss of the [[France-Russia relations|Soviet-French]] 'special relationship' of the Gaullist era'.\n\nNevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was worried by the rapidity of the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc's]] [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]].

Seeing an \"East wind\" blowing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he stated that a \"Southern wind\" was also blowing in Africa, and that state leaders had to respond to the populations' wishes and aspirations by a \"democratic opening\", which included a [[representative democracy|representative system]], free elections, [[Multi-party system|multipartyism]], [[freedom of the press]], an independent judiciary, and abolition of censorship. Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of [[Third World debt]] during the 1980s). He likewise limited the [[interest rate]] to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Cameroon and [[Gabon]]).\n\nHe also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of \"[[colonialism]]\". However, according to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its [[French colonial empire|former colonies]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the [[French Community]]. All in all, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France's policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 ''loi-cadre [[Gaston Defferre|Defferre]]'' which was responding to [[anti-colonialist]] feelings.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117230046/http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/CERI/Mitterrand_et_la_democratie_en_Afrique.htm#UN%20DISCOURS%20DE%20CIRCONSTANCE Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand et la d\u00e9mocratie en Afrique, huit ans apr\u00e8s], by Albert Bourgi, {{ill|Centre de recherches internationales|fr}} (CERI) (mixed study unit with the [[CNRS]], dependent of the ''[[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]]'') {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfrican heads of state themselves reacted to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's speech at most with indifference.

[[Hassan II]], the king of Morocco, said for his part that \"Africa was too open to the world to remain indifferent to what was happening around it\", but that Western countries should \"help young democracies open out, without putting a knife under their throat, without a brutal transition to multipartyism.\"<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/B0100_-fiche22sommets.pdf Les 22 premi\u00e8res conf\u00e9rences des chefs d'Etat de France et d'Afrique], on French government website \u2013 URL accessed in January 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAll in all, the La Baule speech has been said to be on one hand \"one of the foundations of political renewal in Africa French speaking area\", and on the other hand \"cooperation with France\", this despite \"incoherence and inconsistency, like any [[public policy]]\".<ref>[http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/detail-memoire.html?ID=310 Le discours de la Baule et le pluralisme en Afrique noire francophone.

P\u00e9tain had been the leader of French forces at the dramatic [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I, for which he was revered by his contemporaries. Later, however, he became leader of [[Vichy France]] after the French [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|defeat by Germany]] (June 1940) in World War II, collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and putting [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] measures into place.\n\nThe placing of such a wreath was not without precedent. Presidents [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] had wreaths placed on P\u00e9tain's grave to commemorate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the end of World War I. Similarly, President [[Georges Pompidou]] had a wreath placed in 1973 when P\u00e9tain's remains were returned to the [[Ile d'Yeu]] after being stolen. Nonetheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's regular annual tributes went beyond the marking by his predecessors of exceptional occasions, and offended sensibilities at a time when France was re-examining its role in [[the Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Urba===\nThe Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to advise Socialist-led [[Communes of France|communes]] on infrastructure projects and public works. The [[Urba affair]] became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the [[Marseille]] regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by [[Henri Nallet]], who then became [[Minister of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] and therefore in charge of the investigation at national level. In 1990 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer [[Henri Emmanuelli]] was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n===Wiretaps===\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand established an \"anti-terror cell\" installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up, since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the [[French National Police|National Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie|''Gendarmerie'']], run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. 3000 conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti terrorist cell at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the \"[[Irish of Vincennes]]\" affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal [[presidential orders]], obtained [[wiretap]]s on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]''; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |title=(Subscription) |work=Le Monde |location=France |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324020235/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |archive-date=24 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a|title=Le proc\u00e8s des \"\u00e9coutes de l'Elys\u00e9e\" doit commencer lundi \u00e0 Paris|last=Von Derschau|first=Verena|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|access-date=5 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083952/http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a#|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 20 years for the 'affaire' to come before the courts because the instructing judge [[Jean-Paul Vallat]] was at first thwarted by the 'affaire' being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 la [[Commission consultative du secret de la d\u00e9fense nationale]] declassified part of the files concerned. The Judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the ''[[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|Tribunal correctionnel]] de Paris''. 12 people were charged with  \"atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e\" (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. 7 were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.\n\nThe affair finally ended before the ''Tribunal correctionnel de Paris'' with the court's judgement on 9 November 2005. 7 members of the President's anti-terrorist unit were condemned and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was designated as the \"inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.fr/actualite/societe/0,3800002050,39369829,00.htm |title=La police fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9ploie ses grandes oreilles, 30 mai 2007 |publisher=News.fr |accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe court's judgement revealed that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (which the writer [[Jean-Edern Hallier]], was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy R\u00e9gime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for \"obscure\" reasons, such as [[Carole Bouquet]]'s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, [[Edwy Plenel]], a journalist for ''le Monde'' who covered the ''Rainbow Warrior'' story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte. The court declared \"Les faits avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis sur ordre soit du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, soit des ministres de la D\u00e9fense successifs qui ont mis \u00e0 la disposition de ([[Christian Prouteau]]) tous les moyens de l'\u00c9tat afin de les ex\u00e9cuter\" (translation: these actions were committed following orders from the French President or his various Defence Ministers who gave [[Christian Prouteau]] full access to the state machinery so he could execute the orders) The court stated that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the principal instigator of the wire taps (l'inspirateur et le d\u00e9cideur de l'essentiel) and that he had ordered some of the taps and turned a blind eye to others and that none of the 3000 wiretaps carried out by the cell were legally obtained.<ref>''Les oreilles du Pr\u00e9sident'' de [[Jean-Marie Pontaut]] et [[J\u00e9rome Dupuis]], [[Fayard]], 1996.

With French assistance, the Rwandan army grew from a force of 9,000 men in October 1990 to 28,000 in 1991. France also provided training staff, experts and massive quantities of weaponry and facilitated arms contracts with Egypt and South Africa.

to 1995, the longest time in office in the [[history of France]]. As First Secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], he was the first [[Left-wing politics|left-wing politician]] to assume the presidency under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].\n\nReflecting family influences, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the [[Vichy Regime]] during its earlier years. Subsequently he joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand opposed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965\u201388; with the exception of 1969. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was elected President at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. He was [[1988 French presidential election|re-elected in 1988]] and remained in office until 1995.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand invited the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the [[death penalty]], the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] advanced European integration via the [[Maastricht Treaty]], but he reluctantly accepted [[German reunification]]. During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly \"[[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Grands Projets]]\". He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]], in 1991. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation governments]]\" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by [[Jacques Chirac]] (1986\u20131988), and [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995). Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the [[prostate cancer]] he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency.\n\nBeyond making the French left electable, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the rise of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term).\n\n==Family==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was born in [[Jarnac]], [[Charente]], and [[baptism|baptized]] '''Fran\u00e7ois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand''', the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain. His family was devoutly Catholic<ref>Tiersky, Ronald. ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President''. 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. pp. 38\u201342.</ref> and conservative. His father worked as an engineer for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans|Compagnie Paris Orl\u00e9ans]] railway. He had three brothers, Robert, Jacques, and Philippe, and four sisters, Antoinette, Marie-Jos\u00e8phe, Colette, and Genevi\u00e8ve.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's wife, [[Danielle Mitterrand]] (''n\u00e9e'' Gouze, 1924\u20132011), came from a socialist background and worked for various left-wing causes. They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June \u2013 17 September 1945), [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand|Jean-Christophe]], born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949. He also had two children as results of extra-marital affairs: an acknowledged daughter, [[Mazarine Pingeot|Mazarine]] (born 1974), with his mistress [[Anne Pingeot]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/francois-mitterrands-love-letters-to-secret-mistress-to-be-published |title=Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's love letters to secret mistress to be published|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|date=5 October 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref> and an unacknowledged son, [[Hravn Forsne]] (born 1988), with Swedish journalist [[Christina Forsne]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Okay, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was my dad,' Swedish politician reveals|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20140809-swedish-politician--french-president-mitterrand-son-illegitimate/|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=France 24|date=9 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810011156/http://www.france24.com/en/20140809-swedish-politician--french-president-mitterrand-son-illegitimate/|archive-date=10 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's nephew [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand]] is a journalist, Minister of Culture and Communications under [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (and a supporter of [[Jacques Chirac]], former French President), and his wife's brother-in-law [[Roger Hanin]] was a well-known French actor.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Further|France in the twentieth century|French Third Republic|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and the far right}}\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand studied from 1925 to 1934 in the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Paul in [[Angoul\u00eame]], where he became a member of the [[Jeunesse Etudiante Chr\u00e9tienne]] (JEC), the student organisation of ''[[Catholic Action|Action catholique]]''. Arriving in Paris in autumn 1934, he then went to the [[\u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques]] until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the ''Volontaires nationaux'' (National Volunteers), an organisation related to [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s far-right league, the ''[[Croix de Feu]]''; the league had just participated in the [[6 February 1934 riots]] which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' (Left-Wing Coalition).<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\">[[Pierre P\u00e9an]], ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'' (biography on Mitterrand), p.23\u201335</ref>\n\nContrary to some reports, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand never became a formal member of the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF) which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party.<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\" /> However, he did write news articles in the ''[[L'Echo de Paris]]'' newspaper, which was close to the PSF. He participated in the demonstrations against the \"''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8que]] invasion''\" in February 1935 and then in those against law teacher [[Gaston J\u00e8ze]], who had been nominated as juridical counsellor of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Negus]], in January 1936.\n\nWhen Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's involvement in these conservative nationalist movements was revealed in the 1990s, he attributed his actions to the milieu of his youth. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand furthermore had some personal and family relations with members of the [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]], a far-right terrorist group in the 1930s.<ref>[[Henry Rousso]], ''Le Syndrome de Vichy'', p.365</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand then served his [[Conscription in France|conscription]] from 1937 to 1939 in the 23rd r\u00e9giment d'infanterie coloniale. In 1938, he became the best friend of [[Georges Dayan]], a Jewish socialist, whom he saved from anti-Semitic aggressions by the national-royalist movement ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jean |last=Lacouture|title=Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais|publisher= \u00e9d. du Seuil, \u00ab Points \u00bb|page= 46/48}}</ref> His friendship with Dayan caused Mitterrand to begin to question some of his nationalist ideas. Finishing his law studies, he was sent in September 1939 to the [[Maginot line]] near [[Montm\u00e9dy]], with the rank of Sergeant-chief (infantry sergeant). He became engaged to Marie-Louise Terrasse (future actress and television presenter [[Catherine Langeais]]) in May 1940, when she was 16, but she broke it off in January 1942. Following an observation of Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became an [[agnostic]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiHLZQ6XtzEC|title=Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President|first=Ronald|last=Tiersky |date=1 January 2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|via=Google Books|isbn=9780742524736}}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's actions during [[World War II]] were the cause of much controversy in France during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n===Prisoner of War: 1940\u20131941===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was at the end of his national service when the war broke out.

When Andr\u00e9 Masson began to talk about \"''la trahison des gaullistes''\" (the Gaullist treason), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand stood up in the audience and shouted him down, saying Masson had no right to talk on behalf of POWs and calling ''la rel\u00e8ve'' a \"''con''\" (i.e., something stupid).

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was in Paris at the time.\n\nWarned by his friends, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand escaped to London aboard a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] plane on 15 November 1943 (piloted by then-[[Squadron Leader]] [[Lewis Hodges]]). He promoted his movement to the British and American Authorities, but he was sent to [[Algiers]], where he met de Gaulle, by then the uncontested leader of the Free French.

In his memoirs, he says that he had started this organisation while he was still officially working for the Vichy Regime. From 27 November 1943 Mitterrand worked for the [[Bureau central de renseignements et d'action]].<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', tome 1, p. 102</ref> In December 1943 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand ordered the execution of Henri Marlin (who was about to order attacks on the \"[[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]\") by Jacques Paris and Jean Munier, who later hid out with Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's father.\n\nAfter a second visit to London in February 1944, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took part in the liberation of Paris in August; he took over the headquarters of Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux prisonniers de guerre (general office for POW, the ministry he was working for), immediately he took up the vacant post of secretary general of POWs. When de Gaulle entered Paris following the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], he was introduced to various men who were to be part of the provisional government. Among them was Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, when they came face to face, de Gaulle is said to have muttered: \"You again!\" He dismissed Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 2 weeks later.\n\nIn October 1944 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and [[Jacques Foccart]] developed a plan to liberate the POW and concentration camps. This was called operation ''Vicarage''. On the orders of de Gaulle, in April 1945 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand accompanied General Lewis as the French representative at the liberation of the camps at [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. By chance Mitterrand discovered his friend and member of his network, [[Robert Antelme]], suffering from [[typhus]]. Antelme was restricted to the camp to prevent the spread of disease, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand arranged for his \"escape\" and sent him back to France for treatment.<ref>Jean Lacouture, Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais, \u00e9d.

At the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 legislative election]], he led the list of the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts]] (''Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines'', RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (''Union d\u00e9mocratique et socialiste de la R\u00e9sistance'', UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the \"[[Three-parties]] alliance\" (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).\n\nIn the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 legislative election]], he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the [[Ni\u00e8vre]] ''d\u00e9partement''. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very [[anti-communist]] campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon (Ville)|Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon]] from 1959 to 1981.\n\nIn May 1948 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand participated in the [[Congress of The Hague]], together with [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Albert Copp\u00e9]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]. It originated the European Movement.\n\nAs Overseas Minister (1950\u20131951), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of [[Morocco]]'s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]].\n\nIn June 1953 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand attended the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Seated next to the elderly [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.\n\n===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954\u201358===\n\nAs [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] in [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]]'s cabinet (1954\u20131955), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had to direct the response to the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. He claimed: \"[[French Algeria|Algeria is France]].\" He was suspected of being the [[informant|informer]] of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.\n\nThe UDSR joined the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], a centre-left coalition, which won the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative election]]. As [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Justice Minister]] (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in [[Guy Mollet]]'s cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President [[Rene Coty]] to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret.<ref name=\"lepoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/les-guillotines-de-mitterrand-31-08-2001-56908_20.php|title=Les guillotin\u00e9s de Mitterrand \u2013 Le Point|publisher=lepoint.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=2001-08-31}}</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of [[Theodore Dalrymple]]) to accuse Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when was popular with the French people.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =  Dalrmymple\n  | first = Theodore\n  | title= The Battle of Algiers\n  | magazine = The New English Review\n  | date=March 2015| url = http://www.newenglishreview.org/Theodore_Dalrymple/A_Battle_of_Algiers/\n  | accessdate = 2016-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAs Minister of Justice he was an official representative of France during the wedding of [[Rainier III]], [[Prince of Monaco]], and actress [[Grace Kelly]].

He justified his opposition by the circumstances of de Gaulle's comeback: the [[May 1958 crisis|13 May 1958 quasi-putsch]] and military pressure. In September 1958, determinedly opposed to Charles de Gaulle, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand made an appeal to vote \"no\" in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum over the Constitution]], which was nevertheless adopted on 4 October 1958. This defeated coalition of the \"No\" was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\nThis attitude may have been a factor in Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's losing his seat in the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 elections]], beginning a long \"crossing of the desert\" (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle's decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] candidate. One year later, he was [[1959 French Senate election|elected]] to represent [[Ni\u00e8vre]] in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he was part of the [[Democratic Left (France)|Group of the Democratic Left]]. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste unifi\u00e9'', PSU) which was created by Mend\u00e8s-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet's cabinet and by his past in Vichy.\n\n[[File:Portret van Francois Mitterrand, Bestanddeelnr 910-7485.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 16 October 1959]]\nAlso in that same year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the ''Observatory Affair''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D9173BF93BA15755C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=The Mitterrand Mystery | first1=Robert O. | last1=Paxton | date=28 June 1987 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}{{sic}}</ref> The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions.

He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy [[Robert Pesquet]] that he was the target of an ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]'' death squad and accused Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. \"No, and don't insist\" was the General's response, \"It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.\"<ref>Tiersky, Ronald.

F; Mitterrand cloture sa campagne \u00e0 Toulouse. (1965) - 53Fi3417.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in [[Toulouse]] on 17 December 1965 during the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]] campaign]]\n\nIn the [[1962 French legislative election|1962 election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand regained his seat in the National Assembly with the support of the PCF and the SFIO. Practicing left unity in Ni\u00e8vre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Ni\u00e8vre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]] (''Convention des institutions r\u00e9publicaines'', CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to [[Charles de Gaulle]] in publishing ''Le Coup d'\u00c9tat permanent'' (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle's personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President's exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.\n\nIn 1965, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the [[1965 French presidential election|presidential election]] by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (PR) and [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU)). He ended the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader [[Guy Mollet]], Mitterrand's candidacy prevented [[Gaston Defferre]], his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.\n\nDe Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists:  centrist [[Jean Monnet]], moderate conservative [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended [[Raoul Salan]], one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] during the [[Algerian War]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la gauche d\u00e9mocrate et socialiste'', FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1968.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 29 May 1968]]\nIn the [[1967 French legislative election|legislative election of March 1967]], the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of [[Jacques Duhamel]]). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).\n\nIn Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the [[Democratic Centre (France)|Democratic Centre]] of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle's [[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique|Union for the Fifth Republic]] remained the leading French party.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond]], ''Notre si\u00e8cle'', 1988, Fayard, p.664 ff.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] governmental crisis, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In [[1968 French legislative election|this election]], the right wing won its largest majority since the ''[[National Bloc (France)|Bloc National]]'' [[1919 French legislative election|in 1919]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: [[Guy Mollet]] refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. [[Georges Pompidou]] faced the centrist [[Alain Poher]] in the [[1969 French presidential election|second round]].\n\n===Socialist Party leader: 1971\u201381===\nAfter the FGDS's implosion, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand turned to the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the [[Epinay Congress]], the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by [[Guy Mollet]]'s supporters. They proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists. For Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet's faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: \"Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4t3wo_congres-d-epinay-1971-francois-mitt_news|title=Congr\u00e8s d'Epinay (1971)|last=|first=|date=2008-03-22|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22|quote=Celui qui n\u2019accepte pas la rupture avec l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli, avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capitaliste, celui l\u00e0, il ne peut pas \u00eatre adh\u00e8rent du Parti Socialiste.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/francois-mitterrand-socialist-party-common-program-communist-pcf-1981-elections-austerity/|title=The Many Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|last=Birch|first=Jonah|date=19 August 2015|website=[[Jacobin]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1972, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand signed the [[Programme commun|Common Programme of Government]] with the Communist [[Georges Marchais]] and the [[Left Radical Party|Left Radical]] [[Robert Fabre]]. With this programme, he led the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative campaign]] of the \"Union of the Left\".\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-1979-05-06 (3758237073).jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in Strasbourg on 5 May 1979]]\nAt the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d'Estaing criticised him as being \"a man of the past\", due to his long political career. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d'Estaing, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.\n\nIn 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'', then lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time [[1936 French legislative election|since 1936]], the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by [[Michel Rocard]] who criticized the programme of the PS as being \"archaic\" and \"unrealistic\". The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won the vote at the Party's [[Metz Congress]] (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nFor his third candidacy for presidency, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan \"the quiet force\". He campaigned for \"another politics\", based on the Socialist programme ''[[110 Propositions for France]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1981/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1981 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate [[Georges Marchais]]), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage.\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===First term: 1981\u20131988===\n[[File:Reagan Mitterrand 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mitterrand with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]\nIn the [[1981 French presidential election|presidential election of 10 May 1981]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named [[Pierre Mauroy]] as Prime Minister and organised a new [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.\n\n====Economic policy====\nThe beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing [[economic policy]] based on the [[110 Propositions for France]] and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]] and the [[Left Radical Party]]. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]], an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the [[Jean Auroux|Auroux Act]]). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity ([[Keynesianism]]), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained [[monetary policy]] implemented by the [[Bank of France]].<ref>Reichart, Alexandre (2015). \"[http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2015;1.11 French Monetary Policy (1981\u20131985), A Constrained Policy, between Volcker Shock, the EMS and Macroeconomic Imbalances]\".

Housing allocations for the low-paid were raised by 25% in 1981, and in the two years following May 1981 family allowances were increased by 44% for families with 3 children and by 81% for families with 2 children. In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7&nbsp;million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.<ref>''Socialism, the State and Public Policy'' in France edited by Philip G. Cerny and Martin A. Schain</ref>\n\nMajor efforts were made to improve access to housing and health care, while the government also attempted to tackle working-class under-achievement in schools by reinforcing the comprehensive system, modernising the curriculum and reducing [[Streaming (education)|streaming]]. As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for \"solidarity contracts\" whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Mitterrand's France'' Edited by Sonia Mazey and Michael Newman</ref> In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"Vail2009\">{{cite book |title=Recasting Welfare Capitalism Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany |first=Mark I. |last=Vail |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-967-5}}</ref> In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.<ref>''Contemporary France: Politics and Society Since 1945'' by D.

Priority was given to the struggle against inflation in order to remain competitive in the [[European Monetary System]]. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"Smith1998\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=W.

The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child\n\nIn order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers\u2019 rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers.<ref>''The French Socialist Party: Resurgence and Victory'' by D. S. Bell and Byron Criddle</ref> From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">France during the socialist years by Gino Raymond</ref> A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.\n\nAlthough the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women\u2019s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

From 1981 to 1984, the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period.<ref>''The Death of Politics: France under Mitterrand'' by John Laughland {{page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref> Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment. Between 1981 and 1986, there had been just over 800,000 young people placed on special work schemes, 800,000 early retirements, 200,000 enterprise allowance successes, and 30,000 retrained workers from declining industrial sectors.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Cultural policy====\nWith respect to cultural policies, grants were allocated to non-profit associations and community cultural initiatives,<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Hijab and the Republic: Uncovering the French Headscarf Debate|author=Winter, B.|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-5132-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint/page/113 113]|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Mitterrand [[Liberalization|liberalized]] the media, created the [[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel|CSA]] media regulation agency, and authorized [[pirate radios in France|pirate radio]] and the first private TV ([[Canal+]]), giving rise to the [[Media of France|private broadcasting]] sector.\n\nIn terms of the theatre, some transfer of resources was made from the subsidy of the national theatres to the support for theatre companies which did not necessarily have an institutional home. A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.\n\nThe Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A fonds regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.\n\nLibraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Domestic difficulties====\nThe Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the [[Alain Savary|Savary Bill]], to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. [[Laurent Fabius]] succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the [[Greenpeace]]-owned ex-[[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was docked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, [[whaling]], and [[seal hunting]]. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defense Minister [[Charles Hernu]]. France subsequently paid reparations of 1.8&nbsp;million USD to Greenpeace.\n\n====First Cohabitation====\nBefore the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]], [[proportional representation]] was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the [[Rally for the Republic]]/[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) coalition. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader [[Jacques Chirac]] as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as \"[[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |title=Socialist Party |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=1914-07-31 |accessdate=11 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303143326/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChirac mostly handled domestic policy while Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand concentrated on his \"reserved domain\" of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalization, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform ([[Alain Devaquet|Devaquet Bill]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac's cabinet, the President's popularity increased.\n\nWith the polls running in his favor, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. He proposed a moderate programme (promising \"neither nationalisations nor liberalisation\") and advocated a \"united France,\" and laid out his policy priorities in his \"Letter to the French People.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1988/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1988 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.

Rocard led the moderate wing of the PS and he was the most popular of the Socialist politicians. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand decided to organize a new [[1988 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The PS obtained a relative parliamentary majority. Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.\n\nThe second term was marked by the creation of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|Insertion Minimum Revenue]] (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the [[Generalized social tax]]; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]; the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] on [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]]; the Besson law of 1990;<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the Mermaz Law of 1989;,<ref name=\"justlanded\">{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/France/Articles/Property/Letting-in-France|title=France: Letting in France, Rules & Regulations, Various rules and regulations apply to the letting of|publisher=justlanded.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the introduction of a private childcare allowance;<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Post-Industrial Welfare States: Adapting Post-War Social Policies to New Social Risks|author1=Armingeon, K.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-134-17910-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTi2SS8egosC|page=218|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the Urban Orientation Law of 1991;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/247-FR_Housing.pdf |title=National Analytical Study on Housing|date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the [[Pierre Arpaillange|Arpaillange Act]] on the financing of political parties; the reform of the [[penal code]]; the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]] concerning [[New Caledonia]]; the [[Loi Evin|Evin Act]] on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"securite-sociale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|title=Le portail du service public de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale / L'allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire est&nbsp;(...)|publisher=securite-sociale.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082739/http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities.<ref name=\"google8\">{{cite book|title=Implementing Inclusive Education|author=Innovation, C.E.R.|date=1997|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=9789264155893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7N3QP75Q9wC|page=24|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] with the building of the [[Louvre Pyramid]], the [[Channel Tunnel]], the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La D\u00e9fense]], the [[Bastille Opera]], the Finance Ministry in [[Bercy]], and the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|National Library of France]]. On 16 February 1993, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand inaugurated in [[Fr\u00e9jus]] a memorial to the [[Indochina War|wars in Indochina]].\n\nBut the second term was also marked by rivalries within the PS and the split of the ''Mitterrandist'' group (at the [[Rennes Congress]], where supporters of [[Laurent Fabius]] and [[Lionel Jospin]] clashed bitterly for control of the party), the scandals about the financing of the party, the [[Infected blood scandal (France)|contaminated blood scandal]] which implicated Laurent Fabius and former ministers Georgina Dufoix and Emond Herv\u00e9, and the Elys\u00e9e wiretaps affairs.\n\n====Second Cohabitation====\nDisappointed with Rocard's apparent failure to enact the Socialists' programme, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand dismissed Michel Rocard in 1991 and appointed [[\u00c9dith Cresson]] to replace him. She was the first woman to become Prime Minister in France, but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency for making acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left's 92. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] as Prime Minister. The second \"cohabitation\" was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]]'s suicide. His second and last term ended after the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] in May 1995 with the election of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] lost the presidential election.\n\nOverall, as President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand maintained the \"basic characteristic of a strong welfare base underpinned by a strong state.\" A United Nations Human Development report concluded that, from 1979 to 1989, France was the only country in the OECD (apart from Portugal) in which income inequalities did not get worse.<ref>''France since 1870: Culture, Politics, and Society'' by Charles Sowerine</ref> During his second term as president, however, the gap between rich and poor widened in France,<ref>''One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century'' by Donald Sassoon</ref> with both unemployment and poverty rising in the awake of the economic recession of 1991\u20131993.<ref>''The Mitterrand Years: Legacy and Evaluation'' edited by Mairi Maclean</ref> According to other studies, though, the percentage of the French population living in poverty (based on various criteria) fell between the mid-Eighties and the mid-Nineties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bT-3laKFEUsC&pg=PA149&dq=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995#v=onepage&q=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995&f=false|title=Statistical Handbook on the Social Safety Net|first=Fernando Francisco|last=Padr\u00f3|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9781573565165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cajWAgAAQBAJ|title=Innovations in Labour Market Policies The Australian Way: The Australian Way|last=OECD|date=17 July 2001|publisher=OECD Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9789264194502}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand}}\n\n====East/West relations====\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand supported closer European collaboration and the preservation of France's special relationship with its former colonies, which he feared were falling under \"[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] influence.\" His drive to preserve French power in Africa led to controversies concerning Paris' role during the [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref name=\"rwanda\">[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece Mitterrand's role revealed in Rwandan genocide warning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706182535/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece |date=6 July 2008 }}, 3 July 2007. ''[[The Independent]]''</ref>\n\nDespite Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's left-wing affiliations, the 1980s saw France becoming more distant from the [[USSR]], especially following events such as the expulsion of 47 Soviet [[diplomat]]s and their families from the country in 1982 after they were accused of large-scale industrial and military [[espionage]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also sharply criticized the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention]] in [[Afghanistan]] as well as the country's nuclear weapons buildup. When Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand visited the USSR in November 1988, the Soviet media claimed to be 'leaving aside the virtually wasted decade and the loss of the [[France-Russia relations|Soviet-French]] 'special relationship' of the Gaullist era'.\n\nNevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was worried by the rapidity of the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc's]] [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]].

Seeing an \"East wind\" blowing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he stated that a \"Southern wind\" was also blowing in Africa, and that state leaders had to respond to the populations' wishes and aspirations by a \"democratic opening\", which included a [[representative democracy|representative system]], free elections, [[Multi-party system|multipartyism]], [[freedom of the press]], an independent judiciary, and abolition of censorship. Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of [[Third World debt]] during the 1980s). He likewise limited the [[interest rate]] to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Cameroon and [[Gabon]]).\n\nHe also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of \"[[colonialism]]\". However, according to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its [[French colonial empire|former colonies]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the [[French Community]]. All in all, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France's policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 ''loi-cadre [[Gaston Defferre|Defferre]]'' which was responding to [[anti-colonialist]] feelings.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117230046/http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/CERI/Mitterrand_et_la_democratie_en_Afrique.htm#UN%20DISCOURS%20DE%20CIRCONSTANCE Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand et la d\u00e9mocratie en Afrique, huit ans apr\u00e8s], by Albert Bourgi, {{ill|Centre de recherches internationales|fr}} (CERI) (mixed study unit with the [[CNRS]], dependent of the ''[[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]]'') {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfrican heads of state themselves reacted to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's speech at most with indifference.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's family then prosecuted Gubler and his publisher for violating [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|medical confidentiality]].\n\n===P\u00e9tain===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand came under fire in 1992 when it was revealed that he had arranged for the laying of a wreath of flowers on the grave of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] each [[Armistice Day]] since 1987. P\u00e9tain had been the leader of French forces at the dramatic [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I, for which he was revered by his contemporaries. Later, however, he became leader of [[Vichy France]] after the French [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|defeat by Germany]] (June 1940) in World War II, collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and putting [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] measures into place.\n\nThe placing of such a wreath was not without precedent. Presidents [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] had wreaths placed on P\u00e9tain's grave to commemorate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the end of World War I. Similarly, President [[Georges Pompidou]] had a wreath placed in 1973 when P\u00e9tain's remains were returned to the [[Ile d'Yeu]] after being stolen. Nonetheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's regular annual tributes went beyond the marking by his predecessors of exceptional occasions, and offended sensibilities at a time when France was re-examining its role in [[the Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Urba===\nThe Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to advise Socialist-led [[Communes of France|communes]] on infrastructure projects and public works. The [[Urba affair]] became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the [[Marseille]] regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by [[Henri Nallet]], who then became [[Minister of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] and therefore in charge of the investigation at national level. In 1990 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer [[Henri Emmanuelli]] was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n===Wiretaps===\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand established an \"anti-terror cell\" installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up, since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the [[French National Police|National Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie|''Gendarmerie'']], run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. 3000 conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti terrorist cell at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the \"[[Irish of Vincennes]]\" affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal [[presidential orders]], obtained [[wiretap]]s on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]''; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |title=(Subscription) |work=Le Monde |location=France |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324020235/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |archive-date=24 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a|title=Le proc\u00e8s des \"\u00e9coutes de l'Elys\u00e9e\" doit commencer lundi \u00e0 Paris|last=Von Derschau|first=Verena|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|access-date=5 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083952/http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a#|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 20 years for the 'affaire' to come before the courts because the instructing judge [[Jean-Paul Vallat]] was at first thwarted by the 'affaire' being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 la [[Commission consultative du secret de la d\u00e9fense nationale]] declassified part of the files concerned. The Judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the ''[[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|Tribunal correctionnel]] de Paris''. 12 people were charged with  \"atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e\" (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. 7 were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.\n\nThe affair finally ended before the ''Tribunal correctionnel de Paris'' with the court's judgement on 9 November 2005. 7 members of the President's anti-terrorist unit were condemned and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was designated as the \"inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.fr/actualite/societe/0,3800002050,39369829,00.htm |title=La police fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9ploie ses grandes oreilles, 30 mai 2007 |publisher=News.fr |accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe court's judgement revealed that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (which the writer [[Jean-Edern Hallier]], was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy R\u00e9gime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for \"obscure\" reasons, such as [[Carole Bouquet]]'s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, [[Edwy Plenel]], a journalist for ''le Monde'' who covered the ''Rainbow Warrior'' story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte. The court declared \"Les faits avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commis sur ordre soit du pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique, soit des ministres de la D\u00e9fense successifs qui ont mis \u00e0 la disposition de ([[Christian Prouteau]]) tous les moyens de l'\u00c9tat afin de les ex\u00e9cuter\" (translation: these actions were committed following orders from the French President or his various Defence Ministers who gave [[Christian Prouteau]] full access to the state machinery so he could execute the orders) The court stated that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the principal instigator of the wire taps (l'inspirateur et le d\u00e9cideur de l'essentiel) and that he had ordered some of the taps and turned a blind eye to others and that none of the 3000 wiretaps carried out by the cell were legally obtained.<ref>''Les oreilles du Pr\u00e9sident'' de [[Jean-Marie Pontaut]] et [[J\u00e9rome Dupuis]], [[Fayard]], 1996.

With French assistance, the Rwandan army grew from a force of 9,000 men in October 1990 to 28,000 in 1991. France also provided training staff, experts and massive quantities of weaponry and facilitated arms contracts with Egypt and South Africa. It also financed, armed and trained Habyrimana's Presidential Guard.
