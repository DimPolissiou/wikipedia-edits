Based on the character [[Conan the Barbarian]] created by [[Robert E. Howard]], it is the sequel to ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982). The film stars [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] reprising their roles as Conan and Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds, respectively. The cast also includes [[Grace Jones]], [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Tracey Walter]], and [[Olivia d'Abo]].\n\n''Conan the Destroyer'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 29, 1984, by [[Universal Pictures]]. Upon release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. It grossed between $26.4 million and $31 million in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nConan and his companion, the thief Malak, are confronted by Queen Taramis of Shadizar.  She tests their combat ability with several of her guards. Satisfied, she tells Conan that she has a quest for him. He refuses her, but when she promises to resurrect his lost love, Valeria, Conan agrees to the quest. He is to escort the Queen's niece, Jehnna, a virgin, who is destined to restore the jeweled horn of the dreaming god Dagoth; a magic gem must first be retrieved that will locate the horn. Conan and Malak are joined by Bombaata, the captain of Taramis's guard. Bombaata has secret orders to kill Conan once the gem is obtained.\n\nThe gem is secured in the fortress of a powerful wizard, so Conan seeks the help of his friend, Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds. Akiro has been captured by a tribe of [[cannibals]], and must first be rescued. The adventurers encounter Zula, a powerful bandit warrior being tortured by vengeful villagers. Freeing Zula at Jehnna's request, Conan accepts the indebted warrior's offer to join their quest.\n\nThe adventurers travel to the castle of Thoth-Amon, where the gem is located. As they camp for the night, the wizard takes the form of a giant bird and kidnaps Jehnna. The others wake in time to see the bird enter the castle. Sneaking in through a [[water gate]], they search the castle, but Conan is separated from the group, and the others are forced to watch him battle a fierce man-beast. Conan mortally wounds the creature, which is revealed as another form of Thoth-Amon. With the wizard's death, the castle begins to disintegrate, forcing the group's hasty retreat. They are ambushed by Taramis's guards, but drive them off. Bombaata feigns ignorance about the attack. The gem reveals the location of the jeweled horn. Jehnna expresses romantic interest in Conan, but he rebuffs her and declares his devotion to Valeria.\n\nThey reach an ancient temple, where the horn is secured. Jehnna obtains it while Akiro deciphers engravings. He learns that Jehnna will be ritually sacrificed to awaken Dagoth. They are attacked by the priests who guard the horn. A secret exit is revealed, but Bombaata blocks the others' escape and seizes Jehnna. Despite this treachery, Conan and his allies escape from the priests and trek to Shadizar to rescue Jehnna.\n\nMalak shows them a secret route to the throne room. Conan confronts Bombaata and kills him in combat. Zula impales the Grand Vizier before he can sacrifice Jehnna. The rising Dagoth becomes distorted from a human statue into a monstrous entity. Dagoth kills Taramis, then attacks Conan. Zula and Malak join the fight, but are effortlessly swept aside by the entity. Grappling with the monster, Conan tears out Dagoth's horn, weakening the creature enough to kill it.\n\nThe newly crowned Queen Jehnna offers each of her companions a place in her new court: Zula will be the new captain of the guard, Akiro the queen's advisor, and Malak the court jester. Jehnna offers Conan marriage and the opportunity to rule the kingdom with her, but he declines and departs to find further adventures and his own place in the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Destroyer]]\n* [[Grace Jones]] as Zula\n* [[Wilt Chamberlain]] as Bombaata\n* [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Akiro\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Malak\n* [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]] as [[Queen Taramis]]\n* [[Olivia d'Abo]] as Princess Jehnna\n* [[Pat Roach]] as [[Thoth-Amon]]\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Grand Vizier\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]] as Togra\n* [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] as Dagoth\n* Bruce Fleischer as Village Heckler\n* [[Ferdy Mayne]] as The Leader\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Toning down the violence===\nWhen [[John Milius]], director of ''Conan the Barbarian'', was unavailable, [[Dino De Laurentiis]] suggested Richard Fleischer to his daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis, who was producing ''Conan the Destroyer''. Fleischer had already made ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'' (1961) and ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'' (1975) for Dino De Laurentiis.\n\n''Conan the Barbarian'' made about $40 million at the U.S. box office when it was released in 1982 with an R-rating, and an additional $50 million in other markets. Because [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and producer Dino De Laurentiis thought it would have been even more successful if it had been less violent, they wanted to tone down the violence in the sequel. ''Conan the Destroyer'' originally received an R-rating like its predecessor, but the film was recut to secure a PG-rating. Fleischer delivered a movie that was less violent (and somewhat more humorous) than the first, although some scenes of violence have bloody results (the PG-13 rating did not exist until August of that same year). [[Carlo Rambaldi]] created the Dagoth monster.\n\n===Casting===\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Mako Iwamatsu, who played the Wizard of the Mound and narrator in the first film, return for the second film, while Mako's character is now named Akiro. [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]], who played Thorgrim in the first film, also returned, but this time he had to partially cover his face with a mask, as he was playing a different (yet more bearded) character. Singer Grace Jones performed the female warrior Zula, the last of her tribe. This was the seven-foot, one-inch-tall basketball player Wilt Chamberlain's only movie role and the debut of Olivia d'Abo, who played the petulant teenaged princess.<ref name=afi/> [[David Lander|David L. Lander]] was originally cast to play the foolish thief Malak, but due to his deteriorating health from the onset of [[multiple sclerosis]], he was forced to quit the project, and the part was recast with Tracey Walter. Former professional wrestler Pat Roach, who memorably played the German Mechanic in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and the Thuggee Overseer in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', was cast as crystal palace Man Ape/sorcerer Toth-Amon. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://buffalonews.com/2004/06/15/squiggy-upbeat-after-ms-storms-into-his-life/|title='SQUIGGY' UPBEAT AFTER MS STORMS INTO HIS LIFE|last=Kearns|first=Michelle|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=June 15, 2004|accessdate=November 11, 2017}}</ref> Andr\u00e9 the Giant played Dagoth, but was not credited in the film, as he was in costume.<ref>{{cite book|title=Andre the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2009|isbn=9781439188132|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8RNM7QmEqkC&pg=PA79}}</ref>\n\n===Photography===\n''Conan the Destroyer'' was the fourth film on which British director of photography [[Jack Cardiff]] worked with Fleischer. Cardiff had already photographed ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958), ''[[Crossed Swords (1977 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1977), and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]'' (1983) for the director. They worked together twice more on ''[[Million Dollar Mystery]]'' (1987), and Fleischer\u2019s last film, the short ''[[Call from Space]]'' (1989), which was shot in the 65-mm Showscan process. Cardiff\u2019s other notable films include [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), [[King Vidor]]'s ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985).

It grossed between $26.4 million and $31 million in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nConan and his companion, the thief Malak, are confronted by Queen Taramis of Shadizar.  She tests their combat ability with several of her guards. Satisfied, she tells Conan that she has a quest for him. He refuses her, but when she promises to resurrect his lost love, Valeria, Conan agrees to the quest. He is to escort the Queen's niece, Jehnna, a virgin, who is destined to restore the jeweled horn of the dreaming god Dagoth; a magic gem must first be retrieved that will locate the horn. Conan and Malak are joined by Bombaata, the captain of Taramis's guard. Bombaata has secret orders to kill Conan once the gem is obtained.\n\nThe gem is secured in the fortress of a powerful wizard, so Conan seeks the help of his friend, Akiro, the Wizard of the Mounds. Akiro has been captured by a tribe of [[cannibals]], and must first be rescued. The adventurers encounter Zula, a powerful bandit warrior being tortured by vengeful villagers. Freeing Zula at Jehnna's request, Conan accepts the indebted warrior's offer to join their quest.\n\nThe adventurers travel to the castle of Thoth-Amon, where the gem is located. As they camp for the night, the wizard takes the form of a giant bird and kidnaps Jehnna. The others wake in time to see the bird enter the castle. Sneaking in through a [[water gate]], they search the castle, but Conan is separated from the group, and the others are forced to watch him battle a fierce man-beast. Conan mortally wounds the creature, which is revealed as another form of Thoth-Amon. With the wizard's death, the castle begins to disintegrate, forcing the group's hasty retreat. They are ambushed by Taramis's guards, but drive them off. Bombaata feigns ignorance about the attack. The gem reveals the location of the jeweled horn. Jehnna expresses romantic interest in Conan, but he rebuffs her and declares his devotion to Valeria.\n\nThey reach an ancient temple, where the horn is secured. Jehnna obtains it while Akiro deciphers engravings. He learns that Jehnna will be ritually sacrificed to awaken Dagoth. They are attacked by the priests who guard the horn. A secret exit is revealed, but Bombaata blocks the others' escape and seizes Jehnna. Despite this treachery, Conan and his allies escape from the priests and trek to Shadizar to rescue Jehnna.\n\nMalak shows them a secret route to the throne room. Conan confronts Bombaata and kills him in combat. Zula impales the Grand Vizier before he can sacrifice Jehnna. The rising Dagoth becomes distorted from a human statue into a monstrous entity. Dagoth kills Taramis, then attacks Conan. Zula and Malak join the fight, but are effortlessly swept aside by the entity. Grappling with the monster, Conan tears out Dagoth's horn, weakening the creature enough to kill it.\n\nThe newly crowned Queen Jehnna offers each of her companions a place in her new court: Zula will be the new captain of the guard, Akiro the queen's advisor, and Malak the court jester. Jehnna offers Conan marriage and the opportunity to rule the kingdom with her, but he declines and departs to find further adventures and his own place in the world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Destroyer]]\n* [[Grace Jones]] as Zula\n* [[Wilt Chamberlain]] as Bombaata\n* [[Mako Iwamatsu|Mako]] as Akiro\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Malak\n* [[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]] as [[Queen Taramis]]\n* [[Olivia d'Abo]] as Princess Jehnna\n* [[Pat Roach]] as [[Thoth-Amon]]\n* [[Jeff Corey]] as Grand Vizier\n* [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]] as Togra\n* [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] as Dagoth\n* Bruce Fleischer as Village Heckler\n* [[Ferdy Mayne]] as The Leader\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Toning down the violence===\nWhen [[John Milius]], director of ''Conan the Barbarian'', was unavailable, [[Dino De Laurentiis]] suggested Richard Fleischer to his daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis, who was producing ''Conan the Destroyer''. Fleischer had already made ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'' (1961) and ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'' (1975) for Dino De Laurentiis.\n\n''Conan the Barbarian'' made about $40 million at the U.S. box office when it was released in 1982 with an R-rating, and an additional $50 million in other markets. Because [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and producer Dino De Laurentiis thought it would have been even more successful if it had been less violent, they wanted to tone down the violence in the sequel. ''Conan the Destroyer'' originally received an R-rating like its predecessor, but the film was recut to secure a PG-rating. Fleischer delivered a movie that was less violent (and somewhat more humorous) than the first, although some scenes of violence have bloody results (the PG-13 rating did not exist until August of that same year). [[Carlo Rambaldi]] created the Dagoth monster.\n\n===Casting===\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Mako Iwamatsu, who played the Wizard of the Mound and narrator in the first film, return for the second film, while Mako's character is now named Akiro. [[Sven-Ole Thorsen]], who played Thorgrim in the first film, also returned, but this time he had to partially cover his face with a mask, as he was playing a different (yet more bearded) character. Singer Grace Jones performed the female warrior Zula, the last of her tribe. This was the seven-foot, one-inch-tall basketball player Wilt Chamberlain's only movie role and the debut of Olivia d'Abo, who played the petulant teenaged princess.<ref name=afi/> [[David Lander|David L. Lander]] was originally cast to play the foolish thief Malak, but due to his deteriorating health from the onset of [[multiple sclerosis]], he was forced to quit the project, and the part was recast with Tracey Walter.

They worked together twice more on ''[[Million Dollar Mystery]]'' (1987), and Fleischer\u2019s last film, the short ''[[Call from Space]]'' (1989), which was shot in the 65-mm Showscan process. Cardiff\u2019s other notable films include [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), [[King Vidor]]'s ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985).

It was carried out primarily by brutal executions in [[Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia|death camps]], as well as through [[mass murder]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[deportation|expulsion]] and [[forced conversion]]. This genocidal campaign was carried out simultaneously with [[The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia|the Holocaust in NDH]], based on [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial theory]] and Ustashe ideology.\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]] and the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]], Croatia became part of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ruled by the Serbian [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. The [[6 January Dictatorship]] and later [[Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia#6_January_dictatorship|anti-Croat policies]] by the Serb-dominated [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav government]] in the 1920's and 1930's fueled the rise of nationalist and far-right movements. This culminated in the Usta\u0161e, the most extreme of these movements and their disproportionate and genocidal anti-Serbian policies during the Second World War. The Usta\u0161e was an [[ultranationalist]], fascist and [[terrorism|terrorist]] movement that was founded by [[Ante Paveli\u0107]]. At its core, the Usta\u0161e held a deep ethnic hatred of Serbs and Serbian centralized power. Prior to the Second World War, the party organized an [[Velebit uprising|uprising]] in 1932 and assisted in the assassination of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]]. Following the [[Nazi German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, a German [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] was implemented, comprising most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as parts of modern-day Serbia and Slovenia, ruled by the Usta\u0161e.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e's goal was to create an ethnically pure [[Greater Croatia]] by eliminating all non-Croats, with the Serbs being the primary target but also [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]]. In addition to Nazi racial theory and fascism, the Usta\u0161e ideology incorporated [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Croatian nationalism]]. A major ideological influence on the Croatian nationalism of the Usta\u0161e was [[Ante Star\u010devi\u0107]], who envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia and who was both anti-[[Habsburg]] and [[Anti-Serbian sentiment|anti-Serb]]. A third of Serbs were to be killed, a third expelled and a third converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Large scale massacres took place and concentration camps were set up in the region, the largest one being the [[Jasenovac camp]], which was notorious for its high mortality rate and barbaric practices. Furthermore, the Independent State of Croatia was the only Axis [[puppet state]] to establish [[Children in the Holocaust|concentration camps specifically for children]].\n\nThe regime systematically murdered approximately 200,000 to 500,000 Serbs, with most authors agreeing on a range of around 300,000 to 350,000 fatalities. At least 52,000 perished at Jasenovac. 300,000 Serbs were further expelled and at least 200,000 were forcibly converted, most of whom de-converted following the war.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Inter-war period ===\nEthnic tensions between [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] can be traced back to the [[Great Schism of 1054]]. During the time of the [[Austrian Empire]], land privileges were granted to Serbs living in the [[Military Frontier]] of the Habsburg Monarchy.{{sfn|Mojzes|2008|p=158}} Some Serbian historians, citing a document issued by Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in 1690, claim that the masses were \"invited\" to come to Hungary. The original text in Latin shows that Serbs were actually advised to rise up against the Ottomans and \"not to desert\" their ancestral lands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ramet |first1=Sabrina P. |title=Thinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-52161-690-4 |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSc6lOY1M2YC&pg=PA206}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Noel Malcolm|title=Kosovo: A Chain of Causes 1225 B.C. - 1991 and Consequences 1991-1999|year=2004|publisher=Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia|pp=1-27}}</ref> As Habsburg frontier militiamen, they were exempt from communal and church autonomy as well as feudal obligations while Croats were not.

This new state failed to gain recognition from the [[Great Powers]]. In a note of 31 October, the National Council in Zagreb informed the governments of the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[United States]] that the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was constituted in the South-Slavic areas that had been part of Austria-Hungary, and that the new state intended to form a common state with Serbia and Montenegro. The same note was sent to the government of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and the Yugoslav Committee in London. Serbia's prime minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] responded to the note on 8 November, recognizing the National Council in Zagreb as \"legal government of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes living in the territory of the Austria-Hungary\", and notified the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States asking them to do the same.{{sfn|Boban|1993}}\n\nOn 23\u201324 November, the National Council declared \"unification of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs formed on the entire, contiguous South-Slavic area of the former Austria-Hungary with the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro into a unified State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs\". 28 members of the council were appointed to implement that decision based on National Council's adopted directions on implementation of the agreement of organization of the unified state with the government of the Kingdom of Serbia and representatives of political parties in Serbia and Montenegro. The instructions were largely ignored by the delegation members who negotiated with [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Regent Alexander]] instead.{{sfn|Boban|1993}}\n\nThis left Croats and Slovenes no choice but to join a union largely dominated by ethnic Serbs, which came to be known as the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. Upon its creation, the state was composed of six million Serbs, 3.5 million Croats and 1 million Slovenes. Being the largest ethnic group, the Serbs favoured a centralised state, whereas Croats, Slovenes and [[Bosnian Muslims]] did not.{{sfn|Rogel|2004|p=6}}\n\nApproved on 28 June 1921 and based on the Serbian constitution of 1903, the so-called [[Vidovdan Constitution]] established the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a [[parliamentary monarchy]] under the Serbian [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. [[Belgrade]] was chosen as the capital of the new state, assuring Serb and [[Orthodox Christian]] political dominance.{{sfn|Rogel|2004|pp=6\u20137}} In 1928, [[Croatian Peasant Party]] leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]] was assassinated on the floor of the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|country's parliament]] by a [[Montenegrin Serb]] leader and [[People's Radical Party]] politician [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]], who attended parliamentary sessions armed.

Yugoslavia was divided into nine administrative units called [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|''banovinas'']], six of which had ethnic Serb majorities. \n\nThe anti-Croatian policies of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav government in the 1920's and 1930's, especially the assassination of Croatian Peasant Party leaders in Parliament in June 1928 by a deputy of the main Serbian political party, were largely responsible for the creation, growth and nature of Croatian nationalist forces.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=404}} In 1931, the King issued a decree which allowed the Yugoslav Parliament to reconvene on the condition that only pro-Yugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it. Marginalised, far-right and far-left movements thrived. The [[Usta\u0161e]], a Croatian [[fascist]] party, emerged as the most extreme movement of these.{{sfn|Rogel|2004|p=8}} The Usta\u0161e were driven by a deep hatred of Serbs and [[Serbdom]] and claimed that, \"Croats and Serbs were separated by an unbridgable cultural gulf\" which prevented them from ever living alongside each other.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=118}} They organized the so-called [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932, assaulting a police station in the village of Bru\u0161ani in [[Lika]].

Instead, countries that had assisted the organisation, such as [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]], cracked down on its members, arrested them, and destroyed their training camps at Yugoslavia's behest.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=92}} According to historian [[Slavko Goldstein]], the Usta\u0161e planned to commit a genocide against ethnic Serbs for years prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. \n\nOne of Paveli\u0107's main ideologues, [[Mijo Babi\u0107]], wrote in 1932:\n\n{{quote|When blood starts to spill it will gush in streams.

By signing the agreement, Belgrade sought to accommodate moderate Croats through the creation of a largely autonomous [[Banovina of Croatia]] which covered 27 percent of Yugoslavia's territory and included 29 percent of its population. It also ensured that Ma\u010dek became Yugoslavia's deputy premier. Ultimately, the agreement was not successful\u2014it led to other Yugoslav ethnic groups demanding a status similar to that of [[Croatia]] and failed to satisfy right-wing Croats such as those that had joined the Usta\u0161e, who wanted a fully independent Croatian state.{{sfn|Rogel|2004|p=8}} The Usta\u0161e were enraged by the very notion of Ma\u010dek having negotiated with Belgrade, denouncing him as a \"sell out\". Right-wing Croats quickly orchestrated anti-Serbian incidents across the newly formed Banovina, and in June 1940, a Croatian National-Socialist Party was established in [[Zagreb]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=108}} On 25 March 1941, Yugoslavia bowed to German pressure and signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] in an effort to avoid war with the [[Axis powers]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=13\u201314}} The Ustashe movement functioned as a [[terrorist organization]] as well.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=32}}<ref name=\"kroatische\">Ladislaus Hory und Martin Broszat.

It was carried out primarily by brutal executions in [[Concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia|death camps]], as well as through [[mass murder]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[deportation|expulsion]] and [[forced conversion]]. This genocidal campaign was carried out simultaneously with [[The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia|the Holocaust in NDH]], based on [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial theory]] and [[Greater Croatia]] ideology.\n\nAfter the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]] and the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]], Croatia became part of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] ruled by the Serbian [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. The [[6 January Dictatorship]] and later [[Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia#6_January_dictatorship|anti-Croat policies]] by the Serb-dominated [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav government]] in the 1920's and 1930's fueled the rise of nationalist and far-right movements. This culminated in the Usta\u0161e, the most extreme of these movements and their disproportionate and genocidal anti-Serbian policies during the Second World War. The Usta\u0161e was an [[ultranationalist]], fascist and [[terrorism|terrorist]] movement that was founded by [[Ante Paveli\u0107]]. At its core, the Usta\u0161e held a deep ethnic hatred of Serbs and Serbian centralized power. Prior to the Second World War, the party organized an [[Velebit uprising|uprising]] in 1932 and assisted in the assassination of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]]. Following the [[Nazi German]]-led [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, a German [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] was implemented, comprising most of modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as parts of modern-day Serbia and Slovenia, ruled by the Usta\u0161e.\n\nThe Usta\u0161e's goal was to create an ethnically pure [[Greater Croatia]] by eliminating all non-Croats, with the Serbs being the primary target but also [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]]. In addition to Nazi racial theory and fascism, the Usta\u0161e ideology incorporated [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Croatian nationalism]]. A major ideological influence on the Croatian nationalism of the Usta\u0161e was [[Ante Star\u010devi\u0107]], who envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia and who was both anti-[[Habsburg]] and [[Anti-Serbian sentiment|anti-Serb]]. A third of Serbs were to be killed, a third expelled and a third converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Large scale massacres took place and concentration camps were set up in the region, the largest one being the [[Jasenovac camp]], which was notorious for its high mortality rate and barbaric practices. Furthermore, the Independent State of Croatia was the only Axis [[puppet state]] to establish [[Children in the Holocaust|concentration camps specifically for children]].\n\nThe regime systematically murdered approximately 200,000 to 500,000 Serbs, with most authors agreeing on a range of around 300,000 to 350,000 fatalities. At least 52,000 perished at Jasenovac. 300,000 Serbs were further expelled and at least 200,000 were forcibly converted, most of whom de-converted following the war.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Inter-war period ===\nEthnic tensions between [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] can be traced back to the [[Great Schism of 1054]]. During the time of the [[Austrian Empire]], land privileges were granted to Serbs living in the [[Military Frontier]] of the Habsburg Monarchy.{{sfn|Mojzes|2008|p=158}} Some Serbian historians, citing a document issued by Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in 1690, claim that the masses were \"invited\" to come to Hungary. The original text in Latin shows that Serbs were actually advised to rise up against the Ottomans and \"not to desert\" their ancestral lands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ramet |first1=Sabrina P. |title=Thinking about Yugoslavia: Scholarly Debates about the Yugoslav Breakup and the Wars in Bosnia and Kosovo |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-52161-690-4 |page=206 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSc6lOY1M2YC&pg=PA206}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Noel Malcolm|title=Kosovo: A Chain of Causes 1225 B.C. - 1991 and Consequences 1991-1999|year=2004|publisher=Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia|pp=1-27}}</ref> As Habsburg frontier militiamen, they were exempt from communal and church autonomy as well as feudal obligations while Croats were not.

This new state failed to gain recognition from the [[Great Powers]]. In a note of 31 October, the National Council in Zagreb informed the governments of the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[United States]] that the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs was constituted in the South-Slavic areas that had been part of Austria-Hungary, and that the new state intended to form a common state with Serbia and Montenegro. The same note was sent to the government of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and the Yugoslav Committee in London. Serbia's prime minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] responded to the note on 8 November, recognizing the National Council in Zagreb as \"legal government of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes living in the territory of the Austria-Hungary\", and notified the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States asking them to do the same.{{sfn|Boban|1993}}\n\nOn 23\u201324 November, the National Council declared \"unification of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs formed on the entire, contiguous South-Slavic area of the former Austria-Hungary with the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro into a unified State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs\". 28 members of the council were appointed to implement that decision based on National Council's adopted directions on implementation of the agreement of organization of the unified state with the government of the Kingdom of Serbia and representatives of political parties in Serbia and Montenegro. The instructions were largely ignored by the delegation members who negotiated with [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Regent Alexander]] instead.{{sfn|Boban|1993}}\n\nThis left Croats and Slovenes no choice but to join a union largely dominated by ethnic Serbs, which came to be known as the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. Upon its creation, the state was composed of six million Serbs, 3.5 million Croats and 1 million Slovenes. Being the largest ethnic group, the Serbs favoured a centralised state, whereas Croats, Slovenes and [[Bosnian Muslims]] did not.{{sfn|Rogel|2004|p=6}}\n\nApproved on 28 June 1921 and based on the Serbian constitution of 1903, the so-called [[Vidovdan Constitution]] established the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a [[parliamentary monarchy]] under the Serbian [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]].

Yugoslavia was divided into nine administrative units called [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|''banovinas'']], six of which had ethnic Serb majorities. \n\nThe anti-Croatian policies of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav government in the 1920's and 1930's, especially the assassination of Croatian Peasant Party leaders in Parliament in June 1928 by a deputy of the main Serbian political party, were largely responsible for the creation, growth and nature of Croatian nationalist forces.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=404}} In 1931, the King issued a decree which allowed the Yugoslav Parliament to reconvene on the condition that only pro-Yugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it. Marginalised, far-right and far-left movements thrived. The [[Usta\u0161e]], a Croatian [[fascist]] party, emerged as the most extreme movement of these.{{sfn|Rogel|2004|p=8}} The Usta\u0161e were driven by a deep hatred of Serbs and [[Serbdom]] and claimed that, \"Croats and Serbs were separated by an unbridgable cultural gulf\" which prevented them from ever living alongside each other.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=118}} They organized the so-called [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932, assaulting a police station in the village of Bru\u0161ani in [[Lika]].

Instead, countries that had assisted the organisation, such as [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]], cracked down on its members, arrested them, and destroyed their training camps at Yugoslavia's behest.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=92}} According to historian [[Slavko Goldstein]], the Usta\u0161e planned to commit a genocide against ethnic Serbs for years prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. \n\nOne of Paveli\u0107's main ideologues, [[Mijo Babi\u0107]], wrote in 1932:\n\n{{quote|When blood starts to spill it will gush in streams.

By signing the agreement, Belgrade sought to accommodate moderate Croats through the creation of a largely autonomous [[Banovina of Croatia]] which covered 27 percent of Yugoslavia's territory and included 29 percent of its population. It also ensured that Ma\u010dek became Yugoslavia's deputy premier. Ultimately, the agreement was not successful\u2014it led to other Yugoslav ethnic groups demanding a status similar to that of [[Croatia]] and failed to satisfy right-wing Croats such as those that had joined the Usta\u0161e, who wanted a fully independent Croatian state.{{sfn|Rogel|2004|p=8}} The Usta\u0161e were enraged by the very notion of Ma\u010dek having negotiated with Belgrade, denouncing him as a \"sell out\". Right-wing Croats quickly orchestrated anti-Serbian incidents across the newly formed Banovina, and in June 1940, a Croatian National-Socialist Party was established in [[Zagreb]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=108}} On 25 March 1941, Yugoslavia bowed to German pressure and signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] in an effort to avoid war with the [[Axis powers]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=13\u201314}} The Ustashe movement functioned as a [[terrorist organization]] as well.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=32}}<ref name=\"kroatische\">Ladislaus Hory und Martin Broszat.

The movie, directed by [[Thor Freudenthal]], was adapted by [[Bob Schooley]] and [[Mark McCorkle]] (both of ''[[Kim Possible]]'' fame) along with Jeff Lowell. The picture stars [[Jake T. Austin]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Troy Gentile]], [[Kyla Pratt]], [[Johnny Simmons]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Kevin Dillon]] and [[Don Cheadle]]. It tells the story of two orphans, Andi and Bruce (played by Roberts and Austin respectively), who attempt to hide their dog at an abandoned hotel after their strict new [[legal guardian|guardians]] tell them that pets are forbidden at their home. They also take in other dogs to avoid the dogs being taken away by cold hearted animal pound workers and police officers.\n\nThe film is [[Nickelodeon Movies|Nickelodeon]]'s second film to be produced by [[DreamWorks Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/films/270/Hotel-for-Dogs |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121064607/http://www.darkhorizons.com/films/270/Hotel-for-Dogs |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-21 |title=Hotel for Dogs |accessdate=2009-07-21 |last=Franklin |first=Garth (ed.) |date=2009-01-16 |publisher=Dark Horizons }}</ref> after ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' and the first Nickelodeon film ever to be produced outside of [[Paramount Pictures]], which still distributed the film for DreamWorks.

Austin]]) swindle a pawn shop owner in order to buy food to feed their dog, Friday. However, they are quickly caught and brought to the police station where they get picked up by social worker Bernie Wilkins ([[Don Cheadle]]) who takes them back to their foster parents, Lois and Carl Scudder ([[Lisa Kudrow]] and [[Kevin Dillon]]), who do not appear to care for either Andi or Bruce. Despite his sympathy for the two siblings, Bernie warns them that they are playing a dangerous game by deliberately getting into trouble in order to escape Carl and Lois.\n\nThe next morning, Friday leaves to go looking for food, only to be caught by Animal Control.  Desperate and worried, Andi and Bruce go into a local [[pet store|pet shop]] to ask if anybody has seen him.  They meet Dave ([[Johnny Simmons]]) and Heather, ([[Kyla Pratt]]) who advise them to check the [[dog pound|pound]]. They learn that Friday is indeed in the Pound but cannot be claimed without their parents present. While walking home, they discover a gang of youths committing a crime, causing them to flee before the police arrive. They look for Friday, who has already begun to hide in an abandoned hotel.  They find a tiny [[Boston Terrier]] and an [[English Mastiff]] and name them Georgia and Lenny.  Confident the three dogs will get along, Andi and Bruce leave Friday at the hotel for the night.\n\nThe next day, Bruce stays at the hotel to keep the dogs quiet, while Andi heads to the same pet shop to get some food for the dogs, where she runs into Dave and Heather again. Andi lies to them that their parents often rescue dogs, causing Dave to ask her to take in three more dogs that nobody seems to want to adopt, which she reluctantly agrees. With six dogs to look after, the friends set about trying to get the hotel in a decent state to accommodate the dogs' needs, with help from a local boy named Mark ([[Troy Gentile]]), as they rescue more stray dogs to occupy the hotel.\n\nEventually, Dave invites Andi to a party, which she agrees.  Meanwhile, Bruce is caught stealing a hairdryer from Lois and is immediately interrogated by his foster parents. The party is ruined for Andi when she bumps into Jason, an old acquaintance who accidentally reveals to everyone that Andi is an orphan. Bruce manages to escape his house, only to find out that the hotel has fallen into chaos. Lois and Carl follow him, while the police are called, and the dogs are found and sent to the Pound, while Bruce and Andi are taken away by the police. Friday is also sent to the Pound. When Lois and Carl refuse to take Andi and Bruce back, Bernie is forced to send them to separate foster homes.\n\nThe dogs are all scheduled to be put down the next day, but Friday manages to escape captivity.  He rushes over to find Dave, Heather, and Mark, who, in turn, find Andi and Bruce. Meanwhile, Bernie explores the hotel where he finds a dog named Harley, who had managed to avoid getting caught by animal control the previous night. Bernie then realizes why the kids loved doing what they did. Andi and Bruce manage to break into the Pound and release the dogs in an attempt to get them across the county line, where they will be safe. However, the dogs instead make their way back towards the hotel, believing it to be their real home. The strange event attracts the attention of citizens, reporters, and the police, who follow the dogs to the hotel, causing a large crowd to gather inside the hotel. Bernie appears and tells them how Bruce and Andi managed to create a family of dogs.  He introduces all the dogs who live at the hotel and tells the stories of their past owners, which wins over the crowd, and the police allow the children to keep the dogs together.\n\nAs people eagerly explore the hotel, Bernie reveals to an overjoyed Andi and Bruce that he and his wife have decided to adopt them. Sometime later, the hotel re-opens as a grand \"Hotel For Dogs\", where people can either adopt strays or board their dogs, while Andi, Bruce, and Friday happily settle into their new family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jake T.

Freudenthal said that DreamWorks \"really embraced and responded to\" the film and sent him an early version of the script. He was initially hesitant to sign onto the project, balking at the seemingly shallow title. However, he stated that after reading the script that he \"realized you don't think much about the logistics involved\" and saw deeper messages and more complex aspects of the film.<ref name=\"moviesonline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_16276.html |title=  Freudenthal Interview, Hotel For Dogs |accessdate=2010-01-02|publisher= MoviesOnline}}</ref> Freudenthal was attracted to the \"urban fairytale aspect\" of the film, noting in an interview:\n\n{{quote|It's basically these unwanted children, these unwanted animals coming together and making their own place in their own home.

According to her, \"It was the way he framed shots, the way he moved the camera, the use of color, the use of light. He's very visually savvy and very specific.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nEmma Roberts was cast in August 2007 to play teenage older sister Andi. Freudenthal began his search for a young actress \"who could carry a whole movie\" and settled on then-16 year old Roberts. Ewan Leslie, a producer of the film, said in an interview of Roberts that she \"is one of those young actors whose face just lights up the screen and she has the ability to play a wide range of emotions without any dialogue.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\nFilmmakers [[Casting (performing arts)|conducted a nationwide search]] for an actor to play Bruce, Andi's whimsical and inventive younger brother. [[Jake T. Austin]] auditioned late, after nearly 80 other boys had tried out for the part. Jason Clark, another producer of the film, stated that Austin \"was amazing on every level. He played the emotional beats very well, felt the role and also understood timing.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\nThe rest of the roles were cast in the following months. [[Don Cheadle]], who plays Andi and Bruce's protective social worker, joined the film in September 2007. [[Lisa Kudrow]] was cast as the siblings' foster mother in October, and Johnny Simmons was cast that same month as Dave. [[Kyla Pratt]] was chosen to play Heather soon after.<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\nThe dogs were carefully cast as well. Filmmakers wanted a variety of [[Dog breed|breed]]s with different colors and facial structures \"so that their look suggested their personality.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/> Freudenthal said that he deliberately chose both very small and very large dogs to create a contrast similar to the characters of Lenny and George in the [[John Steinbeck]] [[novella]] ''[[Of Mice And Men]]''. The majority of the dogs cast were rescues. The lead dog, who plays Friday, was rescued about six months before shooting began. Crew members also helped to find adoptive homes for the abandoned dogs and several adopted dogs themselves.<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nA Hollywood [[animal trainer]], Mark Forbes, was hired to prepare the dogs before shooting began. Forbes and his team began working with the dogs about four months before shooting. Those dogs with no prior training were first taught basic commands, such as \"sit\" and \"roll over.\" They were then trained to respond to more complex commands and learned to retrieve objects and to wave. [[Image:Hotel for dogs contraptions.jpg|thumb|left|The dogs sit in replicas of cars surrounded by fans that simulate driving on a highway with the wind blowing.]] The next phase of training involved using the dogs' body language to express emotions: sadness, for example, was conveyed when a dog tucked its tail between its legs. Finally, the dogs were taken to public places to review the commands that they had learned. The purpose of this was to ensure that the dogs would perform in any location. According to Forbes, \"You want the dogs to sense that everything is fine and they'll still get their treat regardless of the location. The set becomes just another place for them to go.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/> The trainers worked with the human actors as well to \"familiarize them with how the dogs behave and create a comfort level between the human and the dog actors.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/> The dogs were also trained to interact with the various gadgets in the film with early prototypes built by the special effects team.\nSpecial effects supervisor [[Michael Lantieri]] enlisted to create the various contraptions invented by Bruce throughout the film to keep the dogs fed. One such gadget is a device which can be operated by the dogs to throw a ball to be fetched.\n\n{{quote|The first was a simple spring-loaded device that throws a ball and spoon down hallways, while the second device was a bit more sophisticated. 'This fetching machine uses a bicycle and a hand from a mannequin. It is timed so that the wheels turn, and the ball is magnetic so it sticks in the hand, which comes round and launches the object so the dog can chase it,' explains Lantieri. 'Things can seem simple when you read them, but making it work on screen has to do with timing, the weight of the ball and how the ball stays in the hand until you want it to move.'<ref name=\"thecia\"/>}}\n\nOther devices built for the film include a feeding machine that drops food into each of the dogs' bowls on a timed schedule, a [[vending machine]] filled with shoes and other [[chew toy]]s, a room filled with doors whose [[doorbell]]s go off on their own, and another containing a replica of a car surrounded by fans which simulates for the dogs the experience of placing their heads through an open car window while driving.\n\nAll of the contraptions were created using objects that might actually be found in an abandoned hotel, and in such a way that they looked like they had been created by a gifted 13-year-old boy.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Hotel for Dogs'' was released in [[Puerto Rico]] on January 15, 2009, and in the United States on January 16, 2009, to 3,271 theaters.

The movie, directed by [[Thor Freudenthal]], was adapted by [[Bob Schooley]] and [[Mark McCorkle]] (both of ''[[Kim Possible]]'' fame) along with Jeff Lowell. The picture stars [[Jake T. Austin]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Troy Gentile]], [[Kyla Pratt]], [[Johnny Simmons]], [[Lisa Kudrow]], [[Kevin Dillon]] and [[Don Cheadle]]. It tells the story of two orphans, Andi and Bruce (played by Roberts and Austin respectively), who attempt to hide their dog at an abandoned hotel after their strict new [[legal guardian|guardians]] tell them that pets are forbidden at their home. They also take in other dogs to avoid the dogs being taken away by cold hearted animal pound workers and police officers.\n\nThe film is [[Nickelodeon Movies|Nickelodeon]]'s second film to be produced by [[DreamWorks Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/films/270/Hotel-for-Dogs |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121064607/http://www.darkhorizons.com/films/270/Hotel-for-Dogs |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-21 |title=Hotel for Dogs |accessdate=2009-07-21 |last=Franklin |first=Garth (ed.) |date=2009-01-16 |publisher=Dark Horizons }}</ref> after ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' and the first Nickelodeon film ever to be produced outside of [[Paramount Pictures]], which still distributed the film for DreamWorks.

Austin]]) swindle a pawn shop owner in order to buy food to feed their dog, Friday. However, they are quickly caught and brought to the police station where they get picked up by social worker Bernie Wilkins ([[Don Cheadle]]) who takes them back to their foster parents, Lois and Carl Scudder ([[Lisa Kudrow]] and [[Kevin Dillon]]), who do not appear to care for either Andi or Bruce. Despite his sympathy for the two siblings, Bernie warns them that they are playing a dangerous game by deliberately getting into trouble in order to escape Carl and Lois.\n\nThe next morning, Friday leaves to go looking for food, only to be caught by Animal Control.  Desperate and worried, Andi and Bruce go into a local [[pet store|pet shop]] to ask if anybody has seen him.  They meet Dave ([[Johnny Simmons]]) and Heather, ([[Kyla Pratt]]) who advise them to check the [[dog pound|pound]]. They learn that Friday is indeed in the Pound but cannot be claimed without their parents present. While walking home, they discover a gang of youths committing a crime, causing them to flee before the police arrive. They look for Friday, who has already begun to hide in an abandoned hotel.  They find a tiny [[Boston Terrier]] and an [[English Mastiff]] and name them Georgia and Lenny.  Confident the three dogs will get along, Andi and Bruce leave Friday at the hotel for the night.\n\nThe next day, Bruce stays at the hotel to keep the dogs quiet, while Andi heads to the same pet shop to get some food for the dogs, where she runs into Dave and Heather again. Andi lies to them that their parents often rescue dogs, causing Dave to ask her to take in three more dogs that nobody seems to want to adopt, which she reluctantly agrees. With six dogs to look after, the friends set about trying to get the hotel in a decent state to accommodate the dogs' needs, with help from a local boy named Mark ([[Troy Gentile]]), as they rescue more stray dogs to occupy the hotel.\n\nEventually, Dave invites Andi to a party, which she agrees.  Meanwhile, Bruce is caught stealing a hairdryer from Lois and is immediately interrogated by his foster parents. The party is ruined for Andi when she bumps into Jason, an old acquaintance who accidentally reveals to everyone that Andi is an orphan. Bruce manages to escape his house, only to find out that the hotel has fallen into chaos. Lois and Carl follow him, while the police are called, and the dogs are found and sent to the Pound, while Bruce and Andi are taken away by the police. Friday is also sent to the Pound. When Lois and Carl refuse to take Andi and Bruce back, Bernie is forced to send them to separate foster homes.\n\nThe dogs are all scheduled to be put down the next day, but Friday manages to escape captivity.  He rushes over to find Dave, Heather, and Mark, who, in turn, find Andi and Bruce. Meanwhile, Bernie explores the hotel where he finds a dog named Harley, who had managed to avoid getting caught by animal control the previous night. Bernie then realizes why the kids loved doing what they did. Andi and Bruce manage to break into the Pound and release the dogs in an attempt to get them across the county line, where they will be safe. However, the dogs instead make their way back towards the hotel, believing it to be their real home. The strange event attracts the attention of citizens, reporters, and the police, who follow the dogs to the hotel, causing a large crowd to gather inside the hotel. Bernie appears and tells them how Bruce and Andi managed to create a family of dogs.  He introduces all the dogs who live at the hotel and tells the stories of their past owners, which wins over the crowd, and the police allow the children to keep the dogs together.\n\nAs people eagerly explore the hotel, Bernie reveals to an overjoyed Andi and Bruce that he and his wife have decided to adopt them. Sometime later, the hotel re-opens as a grand \"Hotel For Dogs\", where people can either adopt strays or board their dogs, while Andi, Bruce, and Friday happily settle into their new family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jake T.

According to her, \"It was the way he framed shots, the way he moved the camera, the use of color, the use of light. He's very visually savvy and very specific.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nEmma Roberts was cast in August 2007 to play teenage older sister Andi. Freudenthal began his search for a young actress \"who could carry a whole movie\" and settled on then-16 year old Roberts. Ewan Leslie, a producer of the film, said in an interview of Roberts that she \"is one of those young actors whose face just lights up the screen and she has the ability to play a wide range of emotions without any dialogue.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\nFilmmakers [[Casting (performing arts)|conducted a nationwide search]] for an actor to play Bruce, Andi's whimsical and inventive younger brother. [[Jake T. Austin]] auditioned late, after nearly 80 other boys had tried out for the part. Jason Clark, another producer of the film, stated that Austin \"was amazing on every level. He played the emotional beats very well, felt the role and also understood timing.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\nThe rest of the roles were cast in the following months. [[Don Cheadle]], who plays Andi and Bruce's protective social worker, joined the film in September 2007. [[Lisa Kudrow]] was cast as the siblings' foster mother in October, and Johnny Simmons was cast that same month as Dave. [[Kyla Pratt]] was chosen to play Heather soon after.<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\nThe dogs were carefully cast as well. Filmmakers wanted a variety of [[Dog breed|breed]]s with different colors and facial structures \"so that their look suggested their personality.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/> Freudenthal said that he deliberately chose both very small and very large dogs to create a contrast similar to the characters of Lenny and George in the [[John Steinbeck]] [[novella]] ''[[Of Mice And Men]]''. The majority of the dogs cast were rescues. The lead dog, who plays Friday, was rescued about six months before shooting began. Crew members also helped to find adoptive homes for the abandoned dogs and several adopted dogs themselves.<ref name=\"thecia\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nA Hollywood [[animal trainer]], Mark Forbes, was hired to prepare the dogs before shooting began. Forbes and his team began working with the dogs about four months before shooting. Those dogs with no prior training were first taught basic commands, such as \"sit\" and \"roll over.\" They were then trained to respond to more complex commands and learned to retrieve objects and to wave. [[Image:Hotel for dogs contraptions.jpg|thumb|left|The dogs sit in replicas of cars surrounded by fans that simulate driving on a highway with the wind blowing.]] The next phase of training involved using the dogs' body language to express emotions: sadness, for example, was conveyed when a dog tucked its tail between its legs. Finally, the dogs were taken to public places to review the commands that they had learned. The purpose of this was to ensure that the dogs would perform in any location. According to Forbes, \"You want the dogs to sense that everything is fine and they'll still get their treat regardless of the location. The set becomes just another place for them to go.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/> The trainers worked with the human actors as well to \"familiarize them with how the dogs behave and create a comfort level between the human and the dog actors.\"<ref name=\"thecia\"/> The dogs were also trained to interact with the various gadgets in the film with early prototypes built by the special effects team.\nSpecial effects supervisor [[Michael Lantieri]] enlisted to create the various contraptions invented by Bruce throughout the film to keep the dogs fed. One such gadget is a device which can be operated by the dogs to throw a ball to be fetched.\n\n{{quote|The first was a simple spring-loaded device that throws a ball and spoon down hallways, while the second device was a bit more sophisticated. 'This fetching machine uses a bicycle and a hand from a mannequin. It is timed so that the wheels turn, and the ball is magnetic so it sticks in the hand, which comes round and launches the object so the dog can chase it,' explains Lantieri. 'Things can seem simple when you read them, but making it work on screen has to do with timing, the weight of the ball and how the ball stays in the hand until you want it to move.'<ref name=\"thecia\"/>}}\n\nOther devices built for the film include a feeding machine that drops food into each of the dogs' bowls on a timed schedule, a [[vending machine]] filled with shoes and other [[chew toy]]s, a room filled with doors whose [[doorbell]]s go off on their own, and another containing a replica of a car surrounded by fans which simulates for the dogs the experience of placing their heads through an open car window while driving.\n\nAll of the contraptions were created using objects that might actually be found in an abandoned hotel, and in such a way that they looked like they had been created by a gifted 13-year-old boy.\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Hotel for Dogs'' was released in [[Puerto Rico]] on January 15, 2009, and in the United States on January 16, 2009, to 3,271 theaters.

It centers on the relationship between a workaholic father (Murphy) and his daughter, Olivia ([[Yara Shahidi]]), whose imaginary world becomes the solution to her father's success. \n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Paramount Theater on the Paramount Studios Lot in Los Angeles, California and was then widely released on June 12, 2009.

Whitefeather seems to have the whole company under some spell as he spiels his nonsensical idioms filled with Native American mumbo jumbo. These top executives seem more content with chanting Indian style noises rather than listen to how they can make money through sound investments. \n\nWhen Evan finally discovers that his daughter, Olivia ([[Yara Shahidi]]), is somehow able to tell the future within the financial world by using her 'goo-gaa' comfort [[blanket]] and her [[imaginary friends]] (Queen Qwali and Princesses Kupida, Sopida and Mopida), he discovers he has an invaluable upper hand now at the office. During work, Olivia accidentally drew all over Evan's 11:00 worksheets for a meeting. Outraged, Evan goes to the meeting and he shows off the paperwork like ChemStar is sparkly, Aerodyne and Yellowfin get married, and that brought confusion to his workers. \n\nIn order for Evan to ask these imaginary friends any question he must travel through the imaginary world, through a dense forest, past a dragon, through caves, and even walk through France. Before, Evan who is a part-time father really had no time for his daughter, now is forced to play with her and by her rules. \n\nAfter only a couple of days with her, he rediscovers the inner child within himself and genuinely has a lot of fun playing these imaginary games with Olivia. Whitefeather becomes suspicious and begins to search for Evan's secret. When he finds out that Evan was just playing with a wakalyapi blanket, he purchases a six thousand dollar blanket and forces his son to tell him the \"future\" and making him extremely hyperactive by making him drink many cans of [[Red Bull]]. \n\nWhitefeather and Evan are now competing for the position of heading the Western division of the company D.D.E. In order to be prepared for the most important presentation of his life, Evan must once again invoke the use of the Goo-Gaa blanket and meet up with the princesses. The only problem is that Olivia is spending the night at her friends house, and there is no way for Evan to obtain the Goo-Gaa without taking it from her. \n\nAlso, the presentations will be held on the day of Olivia's class play. Evan manages to get Olivia to give him the Goo-Gaa, but she is soon seen crying because he seems to care only about the blanket, not her. Evan returns home and tries to get the princesses' attention. Evan then starts working on his presentation. As hours pass, he stretches, and the Goo-Gaa falls on the floor, but he continues working without noticing. \n\nEvan decides to go to the presentation instead of Olivia's class concert. Johnny gives his presentation, but his idea is too crazy for the owner of the company. Then it's Evan's turn. When he is about to present, he suddenly decides to go to Olivia's class concert, and leaves the presentation. As he drives over, he changes into a king costume. \n\nBack at the class concert, Olivia is about to sing her solo part, then all of a sudden Evan appears dressed as a king, and Olivia starts singing, delighted to see him. \n\nAfter the class concert, Evan starts talking to Olivia about how sorry he is for misusing her blanket, not caring about her, and for using the princesses for the wrong reason. Meanwhile, the owner of the company, D.D.E. appears, and wants to talk to Evan. He and Evan talk, and he decides to give the position to Evan because of how much Evan cares about his family. Evan accepts. Evan goes back to Olivia, for whom it is time to say good-bye to the princesses. They both start waving, and as a gust of wind blows, some leaves form into the shape of a person then fly off into the sky. Evan, Olivia's mother, and Olivia leave happy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Evan Danielson\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Johnny Whitefeather\n* [[Yara Shahidi]] as Olivia Danielson\n* [[Marin Hinkle]] as Ms. Davis\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Tom Stevens\n* [[Stephen Rannazzisi]] as Noah Kulick\n* [[Nicole Ari Parker]] as Trish\n* [[DeRay Davis]] as John Strother\n* [[Vanessa Estelle Williams]] as Lori Strother\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Dante D'Enzo\n* [[Lauren Weedman]] as Rose\n* [[Heidi Marnhout]] as Cheryl Whitefeather\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Fred Franklin\n* [[Jonathan Mangum]] as Franklin's Associate\n* [[Mike Vorhaus]] as Franklin's Associate 1\n* [[Catherine McGoohan]] as Mrs. Pressman\n* [[James Patrick Stuart]] as Mr. Pratt\n* Anastasia Pineschi as School Choir Member\n* Chelsea Barker as School Choir Member\n* David Freese as School Choir Member\n* [[Traci Paige Johnson]] As Blue (voice, uncredited)\n* [[Donovan Patton]] as Joe (uncredited)\n* [[Timm Sharp]] as Todd\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's production ran from September 10 to December 14, 2007.

When he finds out that Evan was just playing with a wakalyapi blanket, he purchases a six thousand dollar blanket and forces his son to tell him the \"future\" and making him extremely hyperactive by making him drink many cans of [[Red Bull]]. \n\nWhitefeather and Evan are now competing for the position of heading the Western division of the company D.D.E. In order to be prepared for the most important presentation of his life, Evan must once again invoke the use of the Goo-Gaa blanket and meet up with the princesses. The only problem is that Olivia is spending the night at her friends house, and there is no way for Evan to obtain the Goo-Gaa without taking it from her. \n\nAlso, the presentations will be held on the day of Olivia's class play. Evan manages to get Olivia to give him the Goo-Gaa, but she is soon seen crying because he seems to care only about the blanket, not her. Evan returns home and tries to get the princesses' attention. Evan then starts working on his presentation. As hours pass, he stretches, and the Goo-Gaa falls on the floor, but he continues working without noticing. \n\nEvan decides to go to the presentation instead of Olivia's class concert. Johnny gives his presentation, but his idea is too crazy for the owner of the company. Then it's Evan's turn. When he is about to present, he suddenly decides to go to Olivia's class concert, and leaves the presentation. As he drives over, he changes into a king costume. \n\nBack at the class concert, Olivia is about to sing her solo part, then all of a sudden Evan appears dressed as a king, and Olivia starts singing, delighted to see him. \n\nAfter the class concert, Evan starts talking to Olivia about how sorry he is for misusing her blanket, not caring about her, and for using the princesses for the wrong reason. Meanwhile, the owner of the company, D.D.E. appears, and wants to talk to Evan. He and Evan talk, and he decides to give the position to Evan because of how much Evan cares about his family. Evan accepts. Evan goes back to Olivia, for whom it is time to say good-bye to the princesses. They both start waving, and as a gust of wind blows, some leaves form into the shape of a person then fly off into the sky. Evan, Olivia's mother, and Olivia leave happy.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as Evan Danielson\n* [[Thomas Haden Church]] as Johnny Whitefeather\n* [[Yara Shahidi]] as Olivia Danielson\n* [[Marin Hinkle]] as Ms. Davis\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Tom Stevens\n* [[Stephen Rannazzisi]] as Noah Kulick\n* [[Nicole Ari Parker]] as Trish\n* [[DeRay Davis]] as John Strother\n* [[Vanessa Estelle Williams]] as Lori Strother\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Dante D'Enzo\n* [[Lauren Weedman]] as Rose\n* [[Heidi Marnhout]] as Cheryl Whitefeather\n* [[Stephen Root]] as Fred Franklin\n* [[Jonathan Mangum]] as Franklin's Associate\n* [[Mike Vorhaus]] as Franklin's Associate 1\n* [[Catherine McGoohan]] as Mrs. Pressman\n* [[James Patrick Stuart]] as Mr. Pratt\n* Anastasia Pineschi as School Choir Member\n* Chelsea Barker as School Choir Member\n* David Freese as School Choir Member\n* [[Traci Paige Johnson]] As Blue (voice, uncredited)\n* [[Donovan Patton]] as Joe (uncredited)\n* [[Timm Sharp]] as Todd\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film's production ran from September 10 to December 14, 2007.
