The subject has their current fashion sense evaluated. The presenters take particular regard to the participant's body-shape and self-image (with the help of a 360 degree mirror cabinet) and determine what will work best for them. The participant is then given \u00a32000 to go shopping for a new wardrobe, which is supposed to be in accordance with the advice they have been given. Although they are free to spend how they wish, they are spied upon and counselled on the ways of fashion by the show's two hosts.\n\nTrinny and Susannah were often known for their tactile behaviour with the participants and for frequently referring to breasts as \"[[Breast|tit]]s\".<ref name=\"mia\"/> They were also renowned for their direct comments on the show, where Trinny's comments have reduced some participants to tears, and Susannah once spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible.<ref name=\"deceivingappearances\">''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050313151857/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/spectrum.cfm?id=1414982004 Deceiving appearances]'' &mdash; scotsman.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.</ref>\n\n==Episode format==\nThe participant is nominated by their friends and relatives for being particularly unfashionable. The show then secretly follows and videotapes the nominated participant for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the fashion experts review the secret footage and prepare to surprise the participant. During the surprise visit, the participant is offered a \u00a32000 [[cheque]] to buy a whole new wardrobe.<ref name=\"Time\"/> But they must hand over their entire existing wardrobe and be prepared for some harsh criticism and to receive fashion advice from the two experts.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005167,00.html Trading Faces]'' &mdash; time.com. Retrieved 20 June 2007.</ref>\n\nOn the first day of the participant's visit to the studios, there is a review of the secret footage along with the participant. On the [[videotape]], there are normally comments from family members and friends about the participant's style and appearance. The experts then go through their entire wardrobe, which has been brought with the participant. They critique the items and then most of the clothing gets discarded or even cut up with scissors. The participant is asked to put on an outfit, that they like and think most suits their figure, and then must face the 360 degree [[mirror]].<ref>''[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=464773&in_page_id=1773 Posh 'purchases \u00a3250,000 closet that scans her body and tells her what to wear]'' &mdash; dailymail.co.uk.

On the first day, they are left to their own devices, to test how much they have learnt about which clothes are \"suitable\" and comply with the rules. On the second day, the experts ambush the nominee and comment on whether the previous day's purchases complied with the correct guide lines as to which clothes to buy. The second day, the fashion gurus sit in a [[caf\u00e9]] and watch live video footage of the participant shopping and comment on whether the participant is following the rules given. If the participant is struggling, they rush to the scene to help. The experts then accompany the participant around the shops, providing advice and assistance, often being critical.\n\nAfter all the shopping, hair stylists and [[makeup]] artists work on the nominee's hair and makeup respectively. After the makeover, the participant reveals themselves to the experts and are brought to a full-length mirror to see their transformed state. The participant models three outfits for the experts, often showing confidence and poise. The participant departs and, soon after, reveals themselves with their transformed appearance to their friends and family. Sometime after the participant's makeover, the fashion gurus pay them a surprise visit, in order to establish whether they have adhered to the rules for their clothing.\n\nIn later series, the format changed. It saw the hosts receiving hundreds of videos from certain groups of people that had nominated themselves for a makeover, instead of other people nominating them. There were select groups such as women facing [[menopause]] and those who had lost partners. The hosts would have to watch and choose five people from these [[video]]s, as to who they thought were in need of help the most. The five selected candidates were then invited to the studios where they would be interviewed on why they thought they needed a makeover \u00e0 la ''What Not to Wear''. Then two candidates were selected and offered a ''What Not to Wear'' makeover. The series also saw the hosts spending a day as the two participants, where they would drive their cars, work in their jobs and live in their homes. There, they would make the participant's husbands a meal, meet their other close family and venture into the participants wardrobe to dispose of any \"unsuitable\" clothing. The rest of the episode would sustain the format seen in previous series.<ref>''[http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/140/about.jsp About the show] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331062733/http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/140/about.jsp |date=31 March 2007 }}'' &mdash; bbcamerica.com.

The subject has their current fashion sense evaluated. The presenters take particular regard to the participant's body-shape and self-image (with the help of a 360 degree mirror cabinet) and determine what will work best for them. The participant is then given \u00a32000 to go shopping for a new wardrobe, which is supposed to be in accordance with the advice they have been given. Although they are free to spend how they wish, they are spied upon and counselled on the ways of fashion by the show's two hosts.\n\nTrinny and Susannah were often known for their tactile behaviour with the participants and for frequently referring to breasts as \"[[Breast|tit]]s\".<ref name=\"mia\"/> They were also renowned for their direct comments on the show, where Trinny's comments have reduced some participants to tears, and Susannah once spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible.<ref name=\"deceivingappearances\">''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050313151857/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/spectrum.cfm?id=1414982004 Deceiving appearances]'' &mdash; scotsman.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.</ref>\n\n==Episode format==\nThe participant is nominated by their friends and relatives for being particularly unfashionable. The show then secretly follows and videotapes the nominated participant for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the fashion experts review the secret footage and prepare to surprise the participant. During the surprise visit, the participant is offered a \u00a32000 [[cheque]] to buy a whole new wardrobe.<ref name=\"Time\"/> But they must hand over their entire existing wardrobe and be prepared for some harsh criticism and to receive fashion advice from the two experts.<ref name=\"Time\">''[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005167,00.html Trading Faces]'' &mdash; time.com.

On the [[videotape]], there are normally comments from family members and friends about the participant's style and appearance. The experts then go through their entire wardrobe, which has been brought with the participant. They critique the items and then most of the clothing gets discarded or even cut up with scissors. The participant is asked to put on an outfit, that they like and think most suits their figure, and then must face the 360 degree [[mirror]].<ref>''[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=464773&in_page_id=1773 Posh 'purchases \u00a3250,000 closet that scans her body and tells her what to wear]'' &mdash; dailymail.co.uk.

On the first day, they are left to their own devices, to test how much they have learnt about which clothes are \"suitable\" and comply with the rules. On the second day, the experts ambush the nominee and comment on whether the previous day's purchases complied with the correct guide lines as to which clothes to buy. The second day, the fashion gurus sit in a [[caf\u00e9]] and watch live video footage of the participant shopping and comment on whether the participant is following the rules given. If the participant is struggling, they rush to the scene to help. The experts then accompany the participant around the shops, providing advice and assistance, often being critical.\n\nAfter all the shopping, hair stylists and [[makeup]] artists work on the nominee's hair and makeup respectively. After the makeover, the participant reveals themselves to the experts and are brought to a full-length mirror to see their transformed state. The participant models three outfits for the experts, often showing confidence and poise. The participant departs and, soon after, reveals themselves with their transformed appearance to their friends and family. Sometime after the participant's makeover, the fashion gurus pay them a surprise visit, in order to establish whether they have adhered to the rules for their clothing.\n\nIn later series, the format changed. It saw the hosts receiving hundreds of videos from certain groups of people that had nominated themselves for a makeover, instead of other people nominating them. There were select groups such as women facing [[menopause]] and those who had lost partners. The hosts would have to watch and choose five people from these [[video]]s, as to who they thought were in need of help the most. The five selected candidates were then invited to the studios where they would be interviewed on why they thought they needed a makeover \u00e0 la ''What Not to Wear''. Then two candidates were selected and offered a ''What Not to Wear'' makeover. The series also saw the hosts spending a day as the two participants, where they would drive their cars, work in their jobs and live in their homes. There, they would make the participant's husbands a meal, meet their other close family and venture into the participants wardrobe to dispose of any \"unsuitable\" clothing. The rest of the episode would sustain the format seen in previous series.<ref>''[http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/140/about.jsp About the show] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331062733/http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/140/about.jsp |date=31 March 2007 }}'' &mdash; bbcamerica.com.

The preferred nesting trees were [[Ficus benghalensis|Banyan]], [[sacred fig|Peepul]], [[Terminalia arjuna|Arjun]], and [[Neem]]. The main nesting period was November to March with eggs being laid mainly in January. Several pairs nest in the vicinity of each other and isolated nests tend to be those of younger birds. Nests are nearly 3 feet in diameter and half a foot in thickness, and are lined with green leaves.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> Solitary nests are not used regularly and are sometimes taken over by the red-headed vulture and large owls such as ''[[Bubo coromandus]]''. The male initially brings twigs and arranges them to form the nest. During courtship the male bills the female's head, back and neck. The female invites copulation, and the male mounts and hold the head of the female in his bill.<ref name=Sharma /> Usually, the female lays a single egg, which is white with a tinge of bluish-green. Female birds destroy the nest on loss of an egg. They are usually silent but make hissing and roaring sounds at the nest or when jostling for food.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> The eggs hatch after about 30 to 35 days of incubation. The young chick is covered with grey down. The parents feed them with bits of meat from a carcass. The young birds remain for about three months in the nest.<ref name=Sharma>{{cite journal|first=I.

It is much smaller than the Eurasian Griffon. It has a white neck ruff. The adult's whitish back, rump, and underwing coverts contrast with the otherwise dark plumage. The body is black and the secondaries are silvery grey. The head is tinged in pink and bill is silvery with dark ceres. The nostril openings are slit-like. Juveniles are largely dark and take about four or five years to acquire the adult plumage. In flight, the adults show a dark leading edge of the wing and has a white wing-lining on the underside. The undertail coverts are black.<ref name=\"RasmussenAnderton2005\" />\n\nThis is the smallest of the ''[[Gyps]]'' vultures, but is still a very large bird.

The preferred nesting trees were [[Ficus benghalensis|Banyan]], [[sacred fig|Peepul]], [[Terminalia arjuna|Arjun]], and [[Neem]]. The main nesting period was November to March with eggs being laid mainly in January. Several pairs nest in the vicinity of each other and isolated nests tend to be those of younger birds. Nests are nearly 3 feet in diameter and half a foot in thickness, and are lined with green leaves.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> Solitary nests are not used regularly and are sometimes taken over by the red-headed vulture and large owls such as ''[[Bubo coromandus]]''. The male initially brings twigs and arranges them to form the nest. During courtship the male bills the female's head, back and neck. The female invites copulation, and the male mounts and hold the head of the female in his bill.<ref name=Sharma /> Usually, the female lays a single egg, which is white with a tinge of bluish-green. Female birds destroy the nest on loss of an egg. They are usually silent but make hissing and roaring sounds at the nest or when jostling for food.<ref name=\"Hume1896\" /> The eggs hatch after about 30 to 35 days of incubation. The young chick is covered with grey down. The parents feed them with bits of meat from a carcass. The young birds remain for about three months in the nest.<ref name=Sharma>{{cite journal|first=I.

Because Rhinebeck, as well other towns, had populations over 5,000 residents, the state legislature authorized the separation of these two precincts on June 12 to accommodate and encourage public attendance at town meetings via horseback or carriage. The first documented Town of Red Hook meeting was on April 6, 1813, in a local inn and held yearly afterwards as required by law. Wealthy landowning farmers oversaw the maintenance of their assigned roads with the help of their farm workers and neighbors.

Because Rhinebeck, as well other towns, had populations over 5,000 residents, the state legislature authorized the separation of these two precincts on June 12 to accommodate and encourage public attendance at town meetings via horseback or carriage. The first documented Town of Red Hook meeting was on April 6, 1813, in a local inn and held yearly afterwards as required by law. Wealthy landowning farmers oversaw the maintenance of their assigned roads with the help of their farm workers and neighbors.
