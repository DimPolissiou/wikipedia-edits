She was originally worshiped in [[Sumer]] and was later worshipped by the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylonians]], and [[Assyria]]ns under the name '''Ishtar'''.{{efn|{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|\u0283|t|\u0251\u02d0r|}}; {{transl|sux|<sup>[[Dingir|D]]</sup>i\u0161tar}}{{sfn|Heffron|2016}}}} She was known as the \"[[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]\" and was the patron goddess of the [[Eanna]] temple at the city of [[Uruk]], which was her main [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] center. She was associated with the planet [[Venus]] and her most prominent symbols included the [[Lion of Babylon|lion]] and the [[Star of Ishtar|eight-pointed star]]. Her husband was the god [[Dumuzid]] (later known as Tammuz) and her ''sukkal'', or personal attendant, was the goddess [[Ninshubur]] (who later became the male deity [[Papsukkal]]).\n\nInanna was worshiped in [[Sumer]] at least as early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 BC \u2013 {{circa}} 3100 BC), but she had little cult prior to the conquest of [[Sargon of Akkad]]. During the post-Sargonic era, she became one of the most widely venerated deities in the Sumerian pantheon,{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xviii}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=182}} with temples across [[Mesopotamia]]. The cult of Inanna-Ishtar, which may have been associated with a variety of [[Sexual ritual|sexual rites]], was continued by the [[East Semitic]]-speaking people ([[Akkadians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]) who succeeded and absorbed the Sumerians in the region. She was especially beloved by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], who elevated her to become the highest deity in their pantheon, ranking above their own [[national god]] [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]. Inanna-Ishtar is alluded to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and she greatly influenced the [[Phoenicia]]n goddess [[Astarte|Astoreth]], who later influenced the development of the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Her cult continued to flourish until its gradual decline between the first and sixth centuries AD in the wake of [[Christianity]], though it survived in parts of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] among [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] communities as late as the eighteenth century.\n \nInanna appears in more myths than any other Sumerian deity.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xv}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=42\u201343}}{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}} Many of her myths involve her taking over the domains of other deities. She was believed to have stolen the ''[[Me (mythology)|mes]]'', which represented all positive and negative aspects of civilization, from [[Enki]], the god of wisdom. She was also believed to have taken over the Eanna temple from [[Anu|An]], the god of the sky. Alongside her twin brother [[Utu]] (later known as Shamash), Inanna was the enforcer of [[Divine judgment|divine justice]]; she destroyed Mount Ebih for having challenged her authority, unleashed her fury upon the gardener [[Shukaletuda]] after he [[rape]]d her in her sleep, and tracked down the bandit woman Bilulu and killed her in [[divine retribution]] for having murdered Dumuzid. In the standard [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian]] version of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Ishtar asks [[Gilgamesh]] to become her consort. When he refuses, she unleashes the [[Bull of Heaven]], resulting in the death of [[Enkidu]] and Gilgamesh's subsequent grapple with his mortality.\n\nInanna-Ishtar's most famous myth is the story of her descent into and return from ''[[Kur]]'', the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|ancient Sumerian Underworld]], a myth in which she attempts to conquer the domain of her older sister [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the Underworld, but is instead deemed guilty of [[hubris]] by the [[Anunnaki|seven judges of the Underworld]] and struck dead. Three days later, Ninshubur pleads with all the gods to bring Inanna back, but all of them refuse her except Enki, who sends two sexless beings to rescue Inanna. They escort Inanna out of the Underworld, but the ''[[gallu|galla]]'', the guardians of the Underworld, drag her husband Dumuzid down to the Underworld as her replacement. Dumuzid is eventually permitted to return to heaven for half the year while his sister [[Geshtinanna]] remains in the Underworld for the other half, resulting in the cycle of the seasons.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:VAM Nisaba Lagasch.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a stone plaque from the temple of Inanna at [[Nippur]] showing a Sumerian goddess, possibly Inanna ({{circa|2500}} BC){{snf|Collins|1994|pages=114\u2013115}}]]\n[[File:Anubanini relief constituents Ishtar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ishtar on the [[Anubanini rock relief]], circa 2300-2000 BC.]]\nInanna and Ishtar were originally separate, unrelated deities,{{sfn|Mark|2011}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} but they were equated with each other during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] and came to be regarded as effectively the same goddess under two different names.{{sfn|Mark|2011}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} Inanna's name may derive from the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] phrase ''nin-an-ak'', meaning \"Lady of Heaven\",{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=86}}{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}} but the cuneiform sign for ''Inanna'' ({{cuneiform|\ud808\ude39}}) is not a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] of the signs ''lady'' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[ERE\u0160|nin]]; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|\ud808\udea9\ud808\udf06}} SAL.TUG<sub>2</sub>) and ''sky'' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: [[DINGIR|an]]; Cuneiform: {{cuneiform|\ud808\udc2d}} AN).{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}}{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=86}}{{snf|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xiii\u2013xix}} These difficulties led some early [[Assyriologists]] to suggest that Inanna may have originally been a [[Proto-Euphratean]] goddess, possibly related to the [[Hurrian]] mother goddess [[Hannahannah]], who was only later accepted into the [[Sumerian pantheon]]. This idea was supported by Inanna's youthfulness, and as well as the fact that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she seems to have initially lacked a distinct sphere of responsibilities.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}} The view that there was a Proto-Euphratean substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists.{{snf|Rubio|1999|pages=1\u201316}}\n\nThe name ''Ishtar'' occurs as an element in personal names from both the pre-[[Sargon of Akkad|Sargonic]] and post-Sargonic eras in Akkad, Assyria, and Babylonia.{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} It is of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] derivation{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=96}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} and is probably etymologically related to the name of the [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] god [[Attar (god)|Attar]], who is mentioned in later inscriptions from [[Ugarit]] and southern Arabia.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=96}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} The morning star may have been conceived as a male deity who presided over the arts of war and the evening star may have been conceived as a female deity who presided over the arts of love.{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=110}} Among the Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, the name of the male god eventually supplanted the name of his female counterpart,{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} but, due to extensive syncretism with Inanna, the deity remained as female, despite the fact that her name was in the masculine form.{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}}\n\n==Origins and development==\n[[File:Warka_vase_(background_retouched).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Uruk Vase]].{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=51}}]]\n\nInanna has posed a problem for many scholars of ancient Sumer due to the fact that her sphere of power contained more distinct and contradictory aspects than that of any other deity.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225\u2013228}} Two major theories regarding her origins have been proposed.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The first explanation holds that Inanna is the result of a [[syncretism]] between several previously unrelated Sumerian deities with totally different domains.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The second explanation holds that Inanna was originally a [[Semitic deity]] who entered the Sumerian pantheon after it was already fully structured, and who took on all the roles that had not yet been assigned to other deities.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=228\u2013229}}\n\nAs early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 \u2013 {{circa}} 3100 BC), Inanna was already associated with the city of [[Uruk]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} During this period, the symbol of a ring-headed doorpost was closely associated with Inanna.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} The famous [[Uruk Vase]] (found in a deposit of cult objects of the Uruk III period) depicts a row of naked men carrying various objects, including bowls, vessels, and baskets of farm products,{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=551}} and bringing sheep and goats to a [[female figure]] facing the ruler.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550\u2013552}} The female stands in front of Inanna's symbol of the two twisted reeds of the doorpost,{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550\u2013552}} while the male figure holds a box and stack of bowls, the later [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sign signifying the [[EN (cuneiform)|''En'']], or high priest of the temple.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=552\u2013554}}\n\nSeal impressions from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] ({{circa}} 3100 \u2013 {{circa}} 2900 BC) show a fixed sequence of symbols representing various cities, including those of [[Ur]], [[Larsa]], [[Zabalam]], [[Urum (Babylonia)|Urum]], [[Arina]], and probably [[Kesh (Sumer)|Kesh]].{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} This list probably reflects the report of contributions to Inanna at Uruk from cities supporting her cult.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} A large number of similar seals have been discovered from phase I of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic period]] ({{circa}} 2900 \u2013 {{circa}} 2350 BC) at [[Ur]], in a slightly different order, combined with the rosette symbol of Inanna.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}} These seals were used to lock storerooms to preserve materials set aside for her cult.{{sfn|Van der Mierop|2007|page=55}}\n\nDuring the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian period]] ({{circa}}\u20092334 \u2013 2154 BC), following the conquests of [[Sargon of Akkad]], Inanna and Ishtar became so extensively syncretized that they became regarded as effectively the same.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} The Akkadian poet [[Enheduanna]], the daughter of Sargon, wrote numerous hymns to Inanna, identifying her with Ishtar.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=111}} Sargon himself proclaimed Inanna and An as the sources of his authority.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} As a result of this,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}} the popularity of Inanna-Ishtar's cult skyrocketed.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|pages=xviii, xv}}\n\n==Worship==\n[[File:Part of front of

seems to have housed priestesses of the goddess.{{sfn|Harris|1991|pages=261\u2013278}} During later times, while her cult in Uruk continued to flourish,{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=99}} Ishtar also became particularly worshipped in the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n kingdom of [[Assyria]] (modern northern [[Iraq]], northeast [[Syria]] and southeast [[Turkey]]), especially in the cities of [[Nineveh]], [[Assur|A\u0161\u0161ur]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]] (modern Erbil).{{sfn|Guirand|1968|page=58}} During the reign of the Assyrian king [[Assurbanipal]], Ishtar rose to become the most important and widely venerated deity in the Assyrian pantheon, surpassing even the Assyrian national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]].{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=99}}\n\nAs Ishtar became more prominent, several lesser or regional deities were assimilated into her,{{snf|Monaghan|2014|page=39}} including [[Aya (goddess)|Aya]] (the wife of Utu), Anatu ([[Antu]], a consort of Anu), Anunitu (an Akkadian light goddess), Agasayam (a warrior goddess), Irnini (the goddess of cedar forests in the Lebanese mountains), [[Burney Relief#Ishtar|Kilili]] or Kulili (the symbol of desirable women), Sahirtu (the messenger of lovers), Kir-gu-lu (the bringer of rain), and Sarbanda (the personification of sovereignty).{{snf|Monaghan|2014|page=39}}\n\n[[Androgynous]] and [[hermaphroditism|hermaphroditic]] men were heavily involved in the cult of Inanna-Ishtar.{{sfn|Leick|1994|pages=157\u2013158}} During Sumerian times, a set of priests known as ''[[gala (priests)|gala]]'' worked in Inanna's temples, where they performed elegies and lamentations.{{sfn|Leick|1994|page=285}} ''Gala'' took female names, spoke in the ''[[Sumerian language#Dialects|eme-sal]]'' dialect, which was traditionally reserved for women, and appear to have engaged in [[Gay sexual practices|homosexual intercourse]].{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|page=65}} During the Akkadian Period, ''kurgarr\u016b'' and ''assinnu'' were servants of Ishtar who [[cross-dressing|dressed in female clothing]] and performed war dances in Ishtar's temples.{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|pages=65\u201366}} Several Akkadian [[proverb]]s seem to suggest that they may have also had homosexual proclivities.{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|pages=65\u201366}} Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian ''[[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]]''.{{sfn|Leick|1994|pages=158\u2013163}} In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women.{{sfn|Roscoe|Murray|1997|page=66}}\n\nAccording to the early scholar [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], towards the end of the third millennium BC, kings of Uruk may have established their legitimacy by taking on the role of the shepherd [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], Inanna's consort.{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}} This ritual lasted for one night on the tenth day of the [[Akitu]],{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=196}} the Sumerian new year festival,{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=196}} which was celebrated annually at the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]].{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}} The king would then partake in a \"[[hieros gamos|sacred marriage]]\" ceremony,{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}} during which he engaged in ritual sexual intercourse with the high priestess of Inanna, who took on the role of the goddess.{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=196}} In the late twentieth century, the historicity of the sacred marriage ritual was treated by scholars as more-or-less an established fact,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=128}} but, largely due to the writings of Pirjo Lapinkivi, many have begun to regard the sacred marriage as a literary invention rather than an actual ritual.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=128}}\n\nThe cult of Ishtar was long thought to have involved [[sacred

with the planet [[Venus]], with which Ishtar was identified.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=169\u2013170}} Starting during this same period, the star of Ishtar was normally enclosed within a circular disc.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=170}} During later Babylonian times, slaves who worked in Ishtar's temples were sometimes branded with the seal of the eight-pointed

leading Izdubar to reject her advances.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=22}} Several \"columns\" of the book are devoted to an account of Ishtar's descent into the Underworld.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|pages=22\u201323}} At the conclusion of the book, Izdubar, now a god, is reconciled with Ishtar in Heaven.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2012|page=23}} In 1887, the composer [[Vincent d'Indy]] wrote ''Symphony Ishtar, variations symphonique, Op. 42'', a symphony inspired by the Assyrian monuments in the [[British Museum]].{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}}\n\nInanna has become an important figure in modern [[feminist theory]] because she appears in the [[patriarchy|male-dominated]] [[Sumerian pantheon]],{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=196\u2013197}} but is equally as powerful, if not more powerful than, the male deities she appears alongside.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=196\u2013197}} [[Simone de Beauvoir]], in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), argues that Inanna, along with other powerful female deities from antiquity, have been marginalized by modern culture in favor of male deities.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} [[Tikva Frymer-Kensky]] has argued that Inanna was a \"marginal figure\" in Sumerian religion who embodies the \"socially unacceptable\" [[archetype]] of the \"undomesticated, unattached woman\".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} Johanna Stuckey has argued against this idea, pointing out Inanna's centrality in Sumerian religion and her broad diversity of powers, neither of which seem to fit the idea that she was in any way regarded as \"marginal\".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}}\n\n[[File:Myths and legends of Babylonia and Assyria (1916) (14801964123).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A modern illustration depicting Inanna-Ishtar's descent into the [[Kur|Underworld]] taken from [[Lewis Spence]]'s ''Myths and Legends of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]]'' (1916)]]\n\nWhile classical deities such as [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]] frequently appear in modern popular culture,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} Mesopotamian deities have, by contrast, fallen into almost complete obscurity.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} Inanna-Ishtar has somewhat resisted this tendency, but has not been immune to it.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} She usually only appears in works with strong mythological input,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} and most modern portrayals of Inanna-Ishtar have virtually nothing in common with the ancient goddess except for her name.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} The 1963 [[splatter film]] ''[[Blood Feast]]'' concerns a serial killer who sacrifices his victims to Ishtar, who is incorrectly identified as an \"Egyptian goddess\".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=203}} Ishtar also gave her name to the 1987 [[box office bomb]] ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'', in which the character Shirra was loosely modeled on her.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=196\u2013197}} According to Louise Pryke, the character [[Buffy Summers]] in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' bears remarkably strong similarities to Ishtar,{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=202\u2013203}} but these may be coincidental.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=202}} ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'', following the portrayal in ''Blood Feast'', portrays Ishtar as a soul-eating Egyptian mummy.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=203}} One of the two highlands of the planet Venus is named \"Ishtar Terra\".{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=203}} [[John Craton]] composed a full-length opera about Ishtar{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=196}} and she has also been referenced in numerous [[Rock music|rock]] and [[death metal]] songs.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=197}}\n\nThe Argentinian-born Jewish feminist artist Liliana Kleiner created an exhibition of paintings depicting her interpretations of Inanna's myths,{{sfn|Kleiner|2016}} which was first displayed in Mexico in 2008.{{sfn|Kleiner|2016}} The exhibition was later shown in [[Jerusalem]] in 2011 and in [[Berlin]] in 2015.{{sfn|Kleiner|2016}} Inanna is one of the names on the Heritage Floor of ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' by American [[feminist art]]ist [[Judy Chicago]] as a related woman to [[Ishtar]], who has a seat at the table.{{sfn|Chicago|2007|page=}} Inanna is worshipped as a form of the [[Goddess movement|Goddess]] in modern [[Neopaganism]] and [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Rountree|2017|page=167}} Her name occurs in the

[[Gardnerian Wicca]].{{sfn|Buckland|2001|pages=74\u201375}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2005|page=358}}\n\nInanna is also an important figure in modern [[BDSM]] culture.{{sfn|Nomis|2013|pages=59\u201360}} Author and historian Anne O. Nomis has cited the portrayal of Inanna in the myth of ''Inanna and Ebih'' as an early example of the [[dominatrix]] archetype,{{sfn|Nomis|2013|page=53}} characterizing her as a powerful female who forces gods and men into submission to her.{{sfn|Nomis|2013|page=53}} Scholar Paul Thomas has criticized the modern portrayal of Inanna, accusing it of anachronistically imposing modern gender conventions on the ancient Sumerian story, portraying Inanna as a wife and mother,{{sfn|Thomas|2007|page=1}} two roles the ancient Sumerians never ascribed to her,{{sfn|Thomas|2007|page=1}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} while ignoring the more masculine elements of Inanna's cult, particularly her associations with warfare and violence.{{sfn|Thomas|2007|page=1}} Douglas E.

She was originally worshiped in [[Sumer]] and was later worshipped by the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylonians]], and [[Assyria]]ns under the name '''Ishtar'''.{{efn|{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|\u0283|t|\u0251\u02d0r|}}; {{transl|sux|<sup>[[Dingir|D]]</sup>i\u0161tar}}{{sfn|Heffron|2016}}}} She was known as the \"[[Queen of heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]\" and was the patron goddess of the [[Eanna]] temple at the city of [[Uruk]], which was her main [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] center. She was associated with the planet [[Venus]] and her most prominent symbols included the [[Lion of Babylon|lion]] and the [[Star of Ishtar|eight-pointed star]]. Her husband was the god [[Dumuzid]] (later known as Tammuz) and her ''sukkal'', or personal attendant, was the goddess [[Ninshubur]] (who later became the male deity [[Papsukkal]]).\n\nInanna was worshiped in [[Sumer]] at least as early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 BC \u2013 {{circa}} 3100 BC), but she had little cult prior to the conquest of [[Sargon of Akkad]]. During the post-Sargonic era, she became one of the most widely venerated deities in the Sumerian pantheon,{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xviii}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=182}} with temples across [[Mesopotamia]]. The cult of Inanna-Ishtar, which may have been associated with a variety of [[Sexual ritual|sexual rites]], was continued by the [[East Semitic]]-speaking people ([[Akkadians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]) who succeeded and absorbed the Sumerians in the region. She was especially beloved by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], who elevated her to become the highest deity in their pantheon, ranking above their own [[national god]] [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]]. Inanna-Ishtar is alluded to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and she greatly influenced the [[Phoenicia]]n goddess [[Astarte|Astoreth]], who later influenced the development of the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. Her cult continued to flourish until its gradual decline between the first and sixth centuries AD in the wake of [[Christianity]], though it survived in parts of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] among [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] communities as late as the eighteenth century.\n \nInanna appears in more myths than any other Sumerian deity.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=xv}}{{sfn|Penglase|1994|pages=42\u201343}}{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}} Many of her myths involve her taking over the domains of other deities. She was believed to have stolen the ''[[Me (mythology)|mes]]'', which represented all positive and negative aspects of civilization, from [[Enki]], the god of wisdom. She was also believed to have taken over the Eanna temple from [[Anu|An]], the god of the sky. Alongside her twin brother [[Utu]] (later known as Shamash), Inanna was the enforcer of [[Divine judgment|divine justice]]; she destroyed Mount Ebih for having challenged her authority, unleashed her fury upon the gardener [[Shukaletuda]] after he [[rape]]d her in her sleep, and tracked down the bandit woman Bilulu and killed her in [[divine retribution]] for having murdered Dumuzid. In the standard [[Akkadian literature|Akkadian]] version of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Ishtar asks [[Gilgamesh]] to become her consort. When he refuses, she unleashes the [[Bull of Heaven]], resulting in the death of [[Enkidu]] and Gilgamesh's subsequent grapple with his mortality.\n\nInanna-Ishtar's most famous myth is the story of her descent into and return from ''[[Kur]]'', the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|ancient Sumerian Underworld]], a myth in which she attempts to conquer the domain of her older sister [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the Underworld, but is instead deemed guilty of [[hubris]] by the [[Anunnaki|seven judges of the Underworld]] and struck dead. Three days later, Ninshubur pleads with all the gods to bring Inanna back, but all of them refuse her except Enki, who sends two sexless beings to rescue Inanna. They escort Inanna out of the Underworld, but the ''[[gallu|galla]]'', the guardians of the Underworld, drag her husband Dumuzid down to the Underworld as her replacement.

This idea was supported by Inanna's youthfulness, and as well as the fact that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she seems to have initially lacked a distinct sphere of responsibilities.{{snf|Harris|1991|pages= 261\u2013278}} The view that there was a Proto-Euphratean substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern

posed a problem for many scholars of ancient Sumer due to the fact that her sphere of power contained more distinct and contradictory aspects than that of any other deity.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=225\u2013228}} Two major theories regarding her origins have been proposed.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The first explanation holds that Inanna is the result of a [[syncretism]] between several previously unrelated Sumerian deities with totally different domains.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|page=228}} The second explanation holds that Inanna was originally a [[Semitic deity]] who entered the Sumerian pantheon after it was already fully structured, and who took on all the roles that had not yet been assigned to other deities.{{sfn|Vanstiphout|1984|pages=228\u2013229}}\n\nAs early as the [[Uruk period]] ({{circa}} 4000 \u2013 {{circa}} 3100 BC), Inanna was already associated with the city of [[Uruk]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} During this period, the symbol of a ring-headed doorpost was closely associated with Inanna.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=108}} The famous [[Uruk Vase]] (found in a deposit of cult objects of the Uruk III period) depicts a row of naked men carrying various objects, including bowls, vessels, and baskets of farm products,{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=551}} and bringing sheep and goats to a [[female figure]] facing the ruler.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550\u2013552}} The female stands in front of Inanna's symbol of the two twisted reeds of the doorpost,{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=550\u2013552}} while the male figure holds a box and stack of bowls, the later [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] sign signifying the [[EN (cuneiform)|''En'']], or high priest of the temple.{{sfn|Suter|2014|pages=552\u2013554}}\n\nSeal impressions from the [[Jemdet Nasr period]] ({{circa}} 3100 \u2013 {{circa}} 2900 BC) show a fixed sequence of symbols representing

({{circa}}\u20092334 \u2013 2154 BC), following the conquests of [[Sargon of Akkad]], Inanna and Ishtar became so extensively syncretized that they became regarded as effectively the same.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|pages=110\u2013111}} The Akkadian poet [[Enheduanna]], the daughter of Sargon, wrote numerous hymns to Inanna, identifying her with

taking on the role of the shepherd [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]], Inanna's consort.{{sfn|Kramer|1970|page=}} This ritual lasted for one night on the tenth day of the

Cowan has also criticized the portrayal of Inanna in modern Neopaganism, remarking that it \"reduces [her] to little more than a patron goddess of parking lots and crawlspaces\".{{sfn|Cowan|2005|page=49}}\n\n==Dates (approximate)==\n\n{| class=\"navbox collapsible nowraplinks\" style=\"background-color:#fff;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; background-color:#aaf\" |<span style=\"font-size:110%;\">'''Historical sources'''</span>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:right; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Time'''\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Period'''\n| style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa\" | '''Source'''\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|5300\u20134100}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Ubaid period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|4100\u20132900}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Uruk period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Warka Vase|Uruk vase]]{{sfn|Suter|2014|page=551}}\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2900\u20132334}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | Early Dynastic period\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2334\u20132218}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Akkadian Empire]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | writings by [[Enheduanna]]:{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=87}}{{sfn|Collins|1994|page=111}}<br />\n''Nin-me-\u0161ara'', \"The Exaltation of Inanna\"<br />\n''In-nin \u0161a-gur-ra'', \"A Hymn to Inanna (Inana C)\"<br />\n''In-nin me-hu\u0161-a'', \"Inanna and Ebih\"<br />\n''The Temple Hymns''<br />\n''Hymn to Nanna'', \"The Exaltation of Inanna\"<br />\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2218\u20132047}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Gutian Period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"white-space:nowrap; background:#ddf; text-align:right;\" | {{circa|2047\u20131940}} BC\n| style=\"background:#eef; text-align:left;\" | [[Ur III|Ur III Period]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]''<br />\n''[[Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld]]''<br />\n''Inanna and Enki''{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=90}}<br />\n''Inanna's Descent into the Underworld''<br />\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n*[[Anat]]\n*[[Asherah]]\n*[[Holy Spirit]]\n*[[Isis]]\n*[[Mary, mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Nana (Kushan goddess)]]\n*[[Nanaya]]\n*[[Sophia (Gnosticism)]]\n*[[Star of Ishtar]]\n*[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{citation|last=Ackerman|first=Susan|date=2006|orig-year=1989|title=Gender and Difference in Ancient Israel|editor-last=Day|editor-first=Peggy Lynne|url=https://books.google.com/?id=38aX_-PqViIC&pg=PA116&dq=mourning+over+the+death+of+Tammuz#v=onepage&q=mourning%20over%20the%20death%20of%20Tammuz&f=false|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-2393-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{citation|last=Assante|first=Julia|date=2003|article=From Whores to Hierodules: The Historiographic Invention of Mesopotamian Female Sex Professionals|title=Ancient Art and Its Historiography|editor1-last=Donahue|editor1-first=A.
