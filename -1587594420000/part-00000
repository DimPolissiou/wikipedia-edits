The St. Elizabeth Central name allows the community &ndash; including hospital employees, volunteers, physicians and physician office staff members &ndash; an opportunity to better identify each hospital campus location.\n\nAs part of St. Elizabeth Regional Health's ongoing maintenance and continuous improvement of its medical facilities, St. Elizabeth Central has made $11 million worth of enhancements from 2004 to 2009. In total, almost $5 million has been spent on maintenance and repair to existing buildings on the St. Elizabeth Central campus, and more than $6 million for renovations and upgrades to St. Elizabeth Central including:\n* Pharmacy,\n* Physical therapy and outpatient therapy facilities,\n* Seton Specialty Hospital renovations,\n* Hospice relocation within the Bill Long Building,\n* Chapel renovations, and\n* Relocations, upgrades, demolitions, replacement of carpet and furnishings and remodels.\n\nIn September 2016, Franciscan Alliance adopted the new name Franciscan Health and renamed the hospital to Franciscan Health Lafayette Central.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.franciscanhealth.org/news-and-events/news/franciscan-health-new-name-leading-hospital-system\n | title = Franciscan Health is New Name for Leading Hospital System\n | date = 2016-09-06\n | website = Franciscan Health\n | access-date = 2016-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://wlfi.com/2016/09/06/franciscan-alliance-changes-name-to-franciscan-health/\n | title = New name for local hospitals\n | last = Kruczek\n | first = Alexandra\n | date = 2016-09-06\n | website = Journal & Courier Online\n | publisher = \n | access-date = 2016-09-11}}</ref>\n\n==Chapel==\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] chapel at St. Elizabeth's has [[Eucharistic Adoration]], 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The St. Elizabeth Central name allows the community &ndash; including hospital employees, volunteers, physicians and physician office staff members &ndash; an opportunity to better identify each hospital campus location.\n\nAs part of St. Elizabeth Regional Health's ongoing maintenance and continuous improvement of its medical facilities, St. Elizabeth Central has made $11 million worth of enhancements from 2004 to 2009. In total, almost $5 million has been spent on maintenance and repair to existing buildings on the St. Elizabeth Central campus, and more than $6 million for renovations and upgrades to St. Elizabeth Central including:\n* Pharmacy,\n* Physical therapy and outpatient therapy facilities,\n* Seton Specialty Hospital renovations,\n* Hospice relocation within the Bill Long Building,\n* Chapel renovations, and\n* Relocations, upgrades, demolitions, replacement of carpet and furnishings and remodels.\n\nIn September 2016, Franciscan Alliance adopted the new name Franciscan Health and renamed the hospital to Franciscan Health Lafayette Central.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.franciscanhealth.org/news-and-events/news/franciscan-health-new-name-leading-hospital-system\n | title = Franciscan Health is New Name for Leading Hospital System\n | date = 2016-09-06\n | website = Franciscan Health\n | access-date = 2016-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://wlfi.com/2016/09/06/franciscan-alliance-changes-name-to-franciscan-health/\n | title = New name for local hospitals\n | last = Kruczek\n | first = Alexandra\n | date = 2016-09-06\n | website = Journal & Courier Online\n | publisher = \n | access-date = 2016-09-11}}</ref>\n\n==Chapel==\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] chapel at St. Elizabeth's has [[Eucharistic Adoration]], 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

After {{convert|5|acre}} of land was purchased for one thousand dollars at the corner of Albany Street and 17th Avenue, two Sisters arrived to supervise the construction of the new hospital.\n\nIn 1913, the cornerstone of '''St. Francis Hospital''' was laid. The new hospital was built facing what is 17th Avenue, at a cost of $75,000. St. Francis Hospital was dedicated to care for the sick on July 5, 1914. In the hospital\u2019s first year, it treated 63 patients. The original hospital building had 75 beds and housed medical and surgical services, operating room, [[x-ray]] and laboratory facilities, pharmacy and [[emergency department]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]] a second wing was added to the south of the original hospital structure. This South Wing was dedicated on January 18, 1931. Housing the new obstetrical department, the wing doubled the capacity of the hospital. The admissions per year more than doubled from 1,805 in 1931 to 4,096 in 1940. The hospital staff in 1940 included over 70 staff doctors and 73 employees.\n\nIn 1957, the five-story North building was constructed, increasing bed capacity to 300, and the staff increased to 700 employees.  The building housed Indiana\u2019s first cobalt treatment for tumors. The North Wing also included a medical library, chapel, maternity department, and surgery department.\n\nIn August 1970, the Sisters of St. Francis began the construction of a new eight-story building to be the core of the new St. Francis Hospital Center. Encompassing more than {{convert|320000|sqft}}, the capacity of the hospital was increased to 500 beds. The total cost was in excess of 14 million dollars. The new complex consisted of twin patient towers and a base unit to provide the necessary support services. The Bonzel Towers, named for [[Maria Theresia Bonzel|the founder]] of the Order of the Sisters of St. Francis, provided 200 patient beds. The building to the rear of the patient towers housed the various special ancillary services, including a new 15-bed cardiac care unit and a 12-bed intensive care unit. An emergency department was added. The North Building, constructed in 1957, was incorporated into the Center through the use of enclosed cross-overs.\n\nCompleting the plans for the new hospital campus was the Medical Arts Building, located to the southeast of the hospital. The three-million dollar project featured a 400-car self-park garage and five floors of office spaces for physicians. An enclosed ground level passage connected the building to the hospital\u2019s Tower Building.\n\nThe creation of a special care nursery in 1975 led to the development of what is now a  Level III [[neonatal intensive care unit]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franciscanalliance.org/hospitals/indianapolis/services/women/pregnancy/Pages/NICU.aspx|title=Neonatal Intensive Care Unit - Franciscan Health|website=www.franciscanalliance.org}}</ref> for the close observation and care of newborns.\n\nIn 1975, the Radiology Department introduced Ultrasound Laminography to the facility.\n\nIn 1991, St. Francis purchased {{convert|106|acre}} of land at the southeast corner of Emerson Avenue and Stop 11 Road for the expansion of the hospital at a new South Campus, which would feature a specialty medical office building, a primary care/family practice physician office complex and the St. Francis Ambulatory Services and Diagnostics Center. The Ambulatory Services and Diagnostics Center would also house an ambulatory surgical center, an outpatient cancer treatment center, an education center, a women\u2019s health services center, radiology (x-ray) and laboratory services, as well as several support services. The hospital broke ground in 1992 and the facility opened in 1995. The St. Francis Heart Center opened in 2005. The first phase of a patient bed tower opened in 2011.\n\nIn January 2000, the Sisters of St. Francis acquired Kendrick Memorial Hospital in [[Mooresville, Indiana]], now known as Franciscan Health Mooresville.

Despite her lack of acting experience, she arranged a meeting following persistent callbacks.<ref name=blackbook2/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early work===\nWasikowska landed her first acting role in 2004, with a two-episode stint on the Australian soap ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]''. She had just turned fifteen when she was cast in her Australian film debut,  ''[[Suburban Mayhem]]'' (2006),<ref name=dailytelegraph/><ref name=smh130810/> for which she received a nomination for a Young Actor's [[Australian Film Institute|AFI]] Award.<ref name=telegraph/> That same year, she also appeared in her first short film, ''Lens Love Story'', in which she had no dialogue.\n\nIn 2007, Wasikowska appeared in the crocodile horror film ''[[Rogue (2007 film)|Rogue]],'' alongside [[Radha Mitchell]] and [[Sam Worthington]]. She observed quietly on the set; fellow actor [[Stephen Curry (comedian)|Stephen Curry]] noted, \"We didn't hear a peep out of her for three weeks, which earned her the nickname of 'Rowdy'\".<ref name=smh130810/> She beat nearly 200 other actresses for a part in the drama ''[[September (2007 film)|September]]'' (2007), being cast on the spot by director Peter Carstairs following her audition.<ref name=dailytelegraph/> She starred in [[Spencer Susser]]'s acclaimed short film ''[[I Love Sarah Jane]],'' which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.<ref name=sundance/><ref name=SotW/>\n\n===2008\u20132009===\nAt the age of seventeen, Wasikowska received her first big break role in the United States when she was cast as Sophie, a suicidal gymnast, in HBO's acclaimed weekly drama ''[[In Treatment (U.S. TV series)|In Treatment]]''; she had auditioned for the role by videotape.<ref name=hbovid/><ref name=screenwize/> The part required her to leave school in Canberra and move to Los Angeles for three months, while enrolling in [[Distance education|correspondence courses]].<ref name=screenwize/> She earned critical acclaim for her performance as the troubled teenager treated by psychotherapist Paul Weston ([[Gabriel Byrne]]),<ref name=nyt080608/><ref name=timejan2808/><ref name=feb2008/> which included praise for her excellent American accent.<ref name=bostonglobe1/> Wasikowska revealed in an October 2008 interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that she was something of a mimic as a child, and that the widely available American films and TV shows in Australia made it easier for Australians to pick up the accent.<ref name=10actors/>\n\nThis show enabled Wasikowska to gain roles in American films. She played the role of Chaya, the young wife of [[Asael Bielski]] ([[Jamie Bell]]), in ''[[Defiance (2008 film)|Defiance]]'' (2008).<ref name=defiance/> Director [[Edward Zwick]] cast her, explaining to the Australian edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', \"Her inner life is so vivid that it comes across even when she's being still.\"<ref name=voguetalks/> Her next role was as aviation pioneer [[Elinor Smith]] in [[Mira Nair]]'s 2009 biopic ''[[Amelia (film)|Amelia]]''.<ref name=amelia/> In June 2008, due to her work on ''In Treatment'', she received an Australians in Film Breakthrough Award.<ref name=aifbreakthrough/>\n\nWasikowska played the supporting role of Pamela Choat in the 2009 [[Southern Gothic]] independent film ''[[That Evening Sun (film)|That Evening Sun]]'', opposite [[Hal Holbrook]]. Director Scott Teems, seeking a young actress who bore a resemblance to [[Sissy Spacek]], initially balked at the casting director's first suggestion of Wasikowska for the role. He had wanted to cast all native [[Southern United States|Southerners]] for the sake of authenticity.<ref name=hammer/><ref name=tes/> However, after auditions with other actresses were unsuccessful, Teems relented and summoned Wasikowska for as audition. During the two hours she had to prepare, she watched ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' online in order to quickly learn a Southern accent, and impressed Teems enough to be the only non-American actor cast in the film.<ref name=tes/> She was nominated for a 2009 [[Independent Spirit Award]] for Best Supporting Female,<ref name=ifc/> and the film received a South by Southwest award for Best Ensemble Cast.\n\n===2010\u20132011===\nIn July 2008, Wasikowska was cast as the eponymous heroine in [[Tim Burton]]'s version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', alongside [[Johnny Depp]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]] and [[Anne Hathaway]].<ref name=caa/> She sent a videotaped audition to casting directors in London, and her first live reading in Los Angeles occurred on the same day as her ''Evening Sun'' audition.<ref name=hammer/> After three more auditions in London, she was awarded the role.<ref name=bazaar/> Burton cited Wasikowska's \"old-soul quality\" as a catalyst in casting her: \"Because you\u2019re witnessing this whole thing through her eyes, it needed somebody who can subtly portray that.\"<ref name=screenwize/>\n[[File:Mia Wasikowska 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wasikowska at the [[Independent Spirit Awards]] on 5 March 2010]]\n\nWasikowska portrayed a nineteen-year-old Alice returning to Wonderland for the first time in over a decade after fleeing from an unwanted marriage proposal. Her affinity for the character played a part in her desire for the role, as she had read the [[Lewis Carroll]] books as a child and was a fan of [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s 1988 stop-motion film ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]''.<ref name=thetimes/> She considered Burton's film as a chance to explore a deeper characterisation of Alice, to whom she felt young women her age could relate, saying: \"Alice has a certain discomfort within herself, within society and among her peers; I [...] have definitely felt similarly about all of those things, so I could really understand her not fitting in. Alice also [is] an observer who is thinking a lot, and that's similar to how I am.\"<ref name=bazaar/>\n\nFor [[Lisa Cholodenko]]'s indie comedy ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]'', Wasikowska was cast as Joni, the bookish daughter of a lesbian couple ([[Annette Bening]] and [[Julianne Moore]]) who was conceived via [[artificial insemination]].

She first became known to a wider audience following her critically acclaimed work on the [[HBO]] television series ''[[In Treatment (U.S. TV series)|In Treatment]]''. She was nominated for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female]] for ''[[That Evening Sun (film)|That Evening Sun]]'' (2009).\n\nWasikowska gained worldwide recognition in 2010 after starring as [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and appearing in the comedy-drama film ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]'', a role for which she received the [[Hollywood Film Festival|Hollywood Awards Breakthrough Actress Award]]. She starred in the film ''[[Crimson Peak]]'' (2015), directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]]. The following year, she reprised her role as Alice in the fantasy film ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'', and has since appeared in a number of independent films.\n\n==Early life==\nWasikowska was born and raised in [[Canberra]], Australia.<!-- names of parents? more about family? --><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/culture/film/2015/10/31/crimson-peaks-mia-wasikowska-sharp-focus/14462100002562 | title=Crimson Peak's Mia Wasikowska in sharp focus | first=Steve | last=Dow | date=31 October 2015 | newspaper=The Saturday Paper | accessdate=1 May 2016 }}</ref> She attended Cook Primary School, Ainslie Primary School and [[Canberra High School]],<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.education.act.gov.au/canberra-public-school-alumni/alumni-list?result_658003_result_page=W |publisher=ACT Government |title=Celebrating the Achievements of our Past Students |archivedate=31 January 2017 |url-status=dead |accessdate=31 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131094746/http://www.education.act.gov.au/canberra-public-school-alumni/alumni-list?result_658003_result_page=W }}</ref> and [[Karabar High School]] in [[Queanbeyan]], which neighbours Canberra.<ref name=telegraph/> She has an older brother Dan, an older sister, Jess, and a younger brother, Kai.<ref name=sundaylife/><ref name=familyaffair/> Her mother, Marzena Wasikowska, is a Polish-born photographer, while her father, John Reid, is an Australian photographer and [[Collage|collagist]].<ref name=fishman/><ref name=fieldstudies/><ref name=hbarlow/> In 1998, when she was eight years old, Wasikowska and her family moved to [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]], for a year, after her mother had received a grant to produce a collection of work based on her own experience of having emigrated from Poland to Australia in 1974, at the age of eleven.<ref name=mac/><ref name=anca/> Wasikowska and her siblings took part in the production as subjects; she explained to [[Johanna Schneller]] of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' in July 2010, \"We never had to smile or perform.

However, she credits ballet with improving her ability to handle her nerves in auditions.<ref name=dailytelegraph/>\n\nAt the same time, she had been exposed to European and Australian cinema at an early age, and was moved particularly by [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]'s [[Three Colors trilogy|''Three Colours'' trilogy]] and [[Gillian Armstrong]]'s ''[[My Brilliant Career (film)|My Brilliant Career]]''.<ref name=globeandmail/> Although shy and averse to performing during her school years,<ref name=globeandmail/><ref name=usatoday/> Wasikowska was inspired to try to break into acting after watching [[Holly Hunter]] in ''[[The Piano]]'' and [[Gena Rowlands]] in ''[[A Woman Under the Influence]]''.<ref name=blackbook2/> She felt acting in film was a way to explore human imperfections.<ref name=wmagprint/> Wasikowska looked up twelve Australian talent agencies on the Internet and contacted them all, receiving only one response. Despite her lack of acting experience, she arranged a meeting following persistent callbacks.<ref name=blackbook2/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early work===\nWasikowska landed her first acting role in 2004, with a two-episode stint on the Australian soap ''[[All Saints (TV series)|All Saints]]''.

She observed quietly on the set; fellow actor [[Stephen Curry (comedian)|Stephen Curry]] noted, \"We didn't hear a peep out of her for three weeks, which earned her the nickname of 'Rowdy'\".<ref name=smh130810/> She beat nearly 200 other actresses for a part in the drama ''[[September (2007 film)|September]]'' (2007), being cast on the spot by director Peter Carstairs following her audition.<ref name=dailytelegraph/> She starred in [[Spencer Susser]]'s acclaimed short film ''[[I Love Sarah Jane]],'' which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.<ref name=sundance/><ref name=SotW/>\n\n===2008\u20132009===\nAt the age of seventeen, Wasikowska received her first big break role in the United States when she was cast as Sophie, a suicidal gymnast, in HBO's acclaimed weekly drama ''[[In Treatment (U.S. TV series)|In Treatment]]''; she had auditioned for the role by videotape.<ref name=hbovid/><ref name=screenwize/> The part required her to leave school in Canberra and move to Los Angeles for three months, while enrolling in [[Distance education|correspondence courses]].<ref name=screenwize/> She earned critical acclaim for her performance as the troubled teenager treated by psychotherapist Paul Weston ([[Gabriel Byrne]]),<ref name=nyt080608/><ref name=timejan2808/><ref name=feb2008/> which included praise for her excellent American accent.<ref name=bostonglobe1/> Wasikowska revealed in an October 2008 interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that she was something of a mimic as a child, and that the widely available American films and TV shows in Australia made it easier for Australians to pick up the accent.<ref name=10actors/>\n\nThis show enabled Wasikowska to gain roles in American films. She played the role of Chaya, the young wife of [[Asael Bielski]] ([[Jamie Bell]]), in ''[[Defiance (2008 film)|Defiance]]'' (2008).<ref name=defiance/> Director [[Edward Zwick]] cast her, explaining to the Australian edition of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', \"Her inner life is so vivid that it comes across even when she's being still.\"<ref name=voguetalks/> Her next role was as aviation pioneer [[Elinor Smith]] in [[Mira Nair]]'s 2009 biopic ''[[Amelia (film)|Amelia]]''.<ref name=amelia/> In June 2008, due to her work on ''In Treatment'', she received an Australians in Film Breakthrough Award.<ref name=aifbreakthrough/>\n\nWasikowska played the supporting role of Pamela Choat in the 2009 [[Southern Gothic]] independent film ''[[That Evening Sun (film)|That Evening Sun]]'', opposite [[Hal Holbrook]]. Director Scott Teems, seeking a young actress who bore a resemblance to [[Sissy Spacek]], initially balked at the casting director's first suggestion of Wasikowska for the role. He had wanted to cast all native [[Southern United States|Southerners]] for the sake of authenticity.<ref name=hammer/><ref name=tes/> However, after auditions with other actresses were unsuccessful, Teems relented and summoned Wasikowska for as audition. During the two hours she had to prepare, she watched ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' online in order to quickly learn a Southern accent, and impressed Teems enough to be the only non-American actor cast in the film.<ref name=tes/> She was nominated for a 2009 [[Independent Spirit Award]] for Best Supporting Female,<ref name=ifc/> and the film received a South by Southwest award for Best Ensemble Cast.\n\n===2010\u20132011===\nIn July 2008, Wasikowska was cast as the eponymous heroine in [[Tim Burton]]'s version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', alongside [[Johnny Depp]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]] and [[Anne Hathaway]].<ref name=caa/> She sent a videotaped audition to casting directors in London, and her first live reading in Los Angeles occurred on the same day as her ''Evening Sun'' audition.<ref name=hammer/> After three more auditions in London, she was awarded the role.<ref name=bazaar/> Burton cited Wasikowska's \"old-soul quality\" as a catalyst in casting her: \"Because you\u2019re witnessing this whole thing through her eyes, it needed somebody who can subtly portray that.\"<ref name=screenwize/>\n[[File:Mia Wasikowska 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wasikowska at the [[Independent Spirit Awards]] on 5 March 2010]]\n\nWasikowska portrayed a nineteen-year-old Alice returning to Wonderland for the first time in over a decade after fleeing from an unwanted marriage proposal. Her affinity for the character played a part in her desire for the role, as she had read the [[Lewis Carroll]] books as a child and was a fan of [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]]'s 1988 stop-motion film ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]''.<ref name=thetimes/> She considered Burton's film as a chance to explore a deeper characterisation of Alice, to whom she felt young women her age could relate, saying: \"Alice has a certain discomfort within herself, within society and among her peers; I [...] have definitely felt similarly about all of those things, so I could really understand her not fitting in. Alice also [is] an observer who is thinking a lot, and that's similar to how I am.\"<ref name=bazaar/>\n\nFor [[Lisa Cholodenko]]'s indie comedy ''[[The Kids Are All Right (film)|The Kids Are All Right]]'', Wasikowska was cast as Joni, the bookish daughter of a lesbian couple ([[Annette Bening]] and [[Julianne Moore]]) who was conceived via [[artificial insemination]].

Two months later, she received a script and was asked to meet with Fukunaga.<ref name=popeater/> Fukunaga was unfamiliar with her work and was undecided about casting her, so he sought the opinion of director [[Gus Van Sant]], who had worked with Wasikowska on his 2011 film ''[[Restless (2011 film)|Restless]].''<ref name=gvsproject/> Fukunga told ''BlackBook'' magazine in February 2011, \"Gus wrote back: 'Cast her.'\"<ref name=blackbook2/> Due to a scheduling conflict, she had to withdraw from the lead in [[Julia Leigh]]'s 2011 Australian independent film ''[[Sleeping Beauty (2011 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', and she was replaced by [[Emily Browning]].<ref name=smh/><ref name=firstshowing/>\n\nWasikowska appeared in ''[[Restless (2011 film)|Restless]]'' (2011), which was filmed from November to December 2009.

Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/> Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form ''extend'', a bonus life is earned and both players immediately advance to the next level.\n\nA player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles).  Enemies turn \"angry\"\u2014turning pink in color and moving faster\u2014if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.\n\nIn the 100th and final level, players face a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/><ref name = \"rgamer95\"/><ref name=\"rgamer28\">{{citation|last=Campbell|first=Stuart|title=The Definitive - Bubble Bobble|date=July 2006|url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_028#page/n55/mode/2up|journal=Retro Gamer|volume=|issue=28|pages=58\u201368|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref> This is one of the first games to feature multiple endings. Completing Level 100 in single-player mode reveals a message stating that the game has not truly ended and a hint to the player: \"Come here with your friend.\" If two players complete the game, they see a \"happy end\", in which the brothers are transformed to their human selves and reunited with their girlfriends. This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult \"super\" mode. If this mode is completed with two players, a second \"happy end\" is displayed in which Super Drunk (the defeated boss) is revealed to be the brothers' parents under the control of some outside influence.

Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/> Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form ''extend'', a bonus life is earned and both players immediately advance to the next level.\n\nA player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles).  Enemies turn \"angry\"\u2014turning pink in color and moving faster\u2014if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.\n\nIn the 100th and final level, players face a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/><ref name = \"rgamer95\"/><ref name=\"rgamer28\">{{citation|last=Campbell|first=Stuart|title=The Definitive - Bubble Bobble|date=July 2006|url=https://archive.org/stream/retro_gamer/RetroGamer_028#page/n55/mode/2up|journal=Retro Gamer|volume=|issue=28|pages=58\u201368|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]}}</ref> This is one of the first games to feature multiple endings.

This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult \"super\" mode.
