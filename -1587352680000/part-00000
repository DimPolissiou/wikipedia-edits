The anterior segment is made up of the cornea, iris and lens. The cornea is transparent and more curved, and is linked to the larger posterior segment, composed of the vitreous, retina, choroid and the outer white shell called the sclera. The cornea is typically about 11.5&nbsp;mm (0.3&nbsp;in) in diameter, and 0.5&nbsp;mm (500&nbsp;\u03bcm) in thickness near its center. The posterior chamber constitutes the remaining five-sixths; its diameter is typically about 24&nbsp;mm. The cornea and sclera are connected by an area termed the limbus. The iris is the pigmented circular structure concentrically surrounding the center of the eye, the pupil, which appears to be black. The size of the pupil, which controls the amount of light entering the eye, is adjusted by the iris' [[iris dilator muscle|dilator]] and [[iris sphincter muscle|sphincter muscles]].\n\nLight energy enters the eye through the cornea, through the pupil and then through the lens. The lens shape is changed for near focus (accommodation) and is controlled by the ciliary muscle. Photons of light falling on the light-sensitive cells of the retina ([[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor cones and rods]]) are converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve and interpreted as sight and vision.\n\n=== Size ===\n{{See also|Mammalian eye}}\nThe size of the eye differs among adults by only one or two millimetres. The eyeball is generally less tall than it is wide. The sagittal vertical (height) of a human adult eye is approximately 23.7&nbsp;mm, the transverse horizontal diameter (width) is 24.2&nbsp;mm and the axial anteroposterior size (depth) averages 22.0\u201324.8&nbsp;mm with no significant difference between sexes and age groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/25431659/Variations-in-eyeball-diameters-of-the-healthy-adults |title=Variations in eyeball diameters of the healthy adults}}</ref> Strong correlation has been found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit (r = 0.88).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/25431659/Variations-in-eyeball-diameters-of-the-healthy-adults |title=Variations in eyeball diameters of the healthy adults}}</ref> The typical adult eye has an anterior to posterior diameter of 24 millimetres, and a volume of six cubic centimetres (0.4 cu. in.).<ref name=GeneralOphthal>{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=edited by Paul Riordan-Eva, Emmett T.|title=Vaughan & Asbury's General Ophthalmology|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-163420-5|url=http://accessmedicine.com/resourceTOC.aspx?resourceID=720|edition=18th|date=2011-05-17}}</ref>\n\nThe eyeball grows rapidly, increasing from about 16\u201317 millimetres (about 0.65&nbsp;inch) at birth to 22.5\u201323&nbsp;mm (approx. 0.89 in) by three years of age. By age 12, the eye attains its full size.\n\n=== Components ===\n[[File:Schematic diagram of the human eye en.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic diagram of the human eye. It shows a horizontal section through the right eye.]]\nThe eye is made up of three coats, or layers, enclosing various anatomical structures. The outermost layer, known as the [[Fibrous tunic of eyeball|fibrous tunic]], is composed of the [[cornea]] and [[sclera]] , which provide shape to the eye and support the deeper structures. The middle layer, known as the [[Uvea|vascular tunic or uvea]], consists of the [[choroid]], [[ciliary body]], pigmented epithelium and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The innermost is the [[retina]], which gets its oxygenation from the blood vessels of the choroid (posteriorly) as well as the retinal vessels (anteriorly).\n\nThe spaces of the eye are filled with the [[aqueous humour]] anteriorly, between the cornea and lens, and the [[vitreous body]], a jelly-like substance, behind the lens, filling the entire posterior cavity. The aqueous humour is a clear watery fluid that is contained in two areas:  the [[Anterior chamber of eyeball|anterior chamber]] between the cornea and the iris, and the [[Posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]] between the iris and the lens. The lens is suspended to the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament ([[Zonule of Zinn]]), made up of hundreds of fine transparent fibers which transmit muscular forces to change the shape of the lens for accommodation (focusing). The vitreous body is a clear substance composed of water and proteins, which give it a jelly-like and sticky composition.<ref>\"eye, human.\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica from [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]] 2009</ref>\n\n== Vision ==\n{{See also|Visual acuity|Eye#Visual acuity|Fovea centralis#Angular size of foveal cones|Color vision#Physiology of color perception}}\n\n=== Field of view ===\n[[File:Mairead cropped.png|thumb|Side-view of the human eye, viewed approximately 90\u00b0 temporal, illustrating how the iris and pupil appear rotated towards the viewer due to the optical properties of the cornea and the aqueous humor.]]\nThe approximate [[field of view]] of an individual human eye (measured from the fixation point, i.e., the point at which one's gaze is directed) varies by facial anatomy, but is typically 30\u00b0 superior (up, limited by the brow), 45\u00b0 nasal (limited by the nose), 70\u00b0 inferior (down), and 100\u00b0 temporal (towards the temple).<ref name=\"SavinoDanesh-Meyer2012\">{{cite book|last1=Savino|first1=Peter J.|last2=Danesh-Meyer|first2=Helen V.|title=Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Ophthalmology \u2013 Wills Eye Institute \u2013 Neuro-Ophthalmology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RgSZGWQZGIC&pg=PA12|date=2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-1-60913-266-8|page=12}}</ref><ref name=\"RyanSchachat2012\">{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Schachat|first2=Andrew P.|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Charles P. |author4=David R.

As soon as the eye moves rapidly to acquire a target ([[saccade]]s), it re-adjusts its exposure by adjusting the iris, which adjusts the size of the pupil. Initial dark adaptation takes place in approximately four seconds of profound, uninterrupted darkness; full adaptation through adjustments in retinal rod photoreceptors is 80% complete in thirty minutes. The process is nonlinear and multifaceted, so an interruption by light exposure requires restarting the dark adaptation process over again. Full adaptation is dependent on good blood flow; thus dark adaptation may be hampered by retinal disease, poor vascular circulation and high altitude exposure. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe human eye can detect a luminance range of 10<sup>14</sup>, or one hundred trillion (100,000,000,000,000) (about 46.5 f-stops), from 10<sup>\u22126</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup>, or one millionth (0.000001) of a candela per square meter to 10<sup>8</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup> or one hundred million (100,000,000) candelas per square meter.<ref name=\"IvergardHunt2008\">{{cite book|last1=Ivergard|first1=Toni|last2=Hunt|first2=Brian|title=Handbook of Control Room Design and Ergonomics: A Perspective for the Future, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DR9UyqLkgH8C&pg=PT108|date=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-6434-6|page=90}}</ref><ref name=\"KaschkeDonnerhacke2013\">{{Cite book|last1=Kaschke|first1=Michael|last2=Donnerhacke|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Rill|first3=Michael Stefan|title=Optical Devices in Ophthalmology and Optometry: Technology, Design Principles and Clinical Applications|journal=Journal of Biomedical Optics|volume=19|issue=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPw8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|date=2013|isbn=978-3-527-64899-3|page=26|bibcode=2014JBO....19g9901M|doi=10.1117/1.JBO.19.7.079901}}</ref><ref name=\"BanterleArtusi2011\">{{cite book|last1=Banterle|first1=Francesco|last2=Artusi|first2=Alessandro|last3=Debattista|first3=Kurt|author4=Alan Chalmers|title=Advanced High Dynamic Range Imaging: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LL5orppYlJsC&pg=PA7|date=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-56881-719-4|page=7}}</ref> This range does not include looking at the midday sun (10<sup>9</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup>)<ref name=\"PodeDiouf2011\">{{cite book|last1=Pode|first1=Ramchandra|last2=Diouf|first2=Boucar|title=Solar Lighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqKUqfvDq_MC&pg=PA62|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2134-3|page=62}}</ref> or lightning discharge.\n\nAt the low end of the range is the [[absolute threshold]] of vision for a steady light across a wide field of view, about 10<sup>\u22126</sup> cd/m2 (0.000001 candela per square meter).<ref name=\"Davson2012\">{{cite book|last=Davson|first=Hugh|authorlink=Hugh Davson|title=The Physiology of The Eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q216982BQboC&pg=PA213|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-323-14394-3|page=213}}</ref><ref name=\"name\">{{Citation |last=Denton|first=E.

The [[pupil]] of the human [[eye]] is its [[aperture]]; the iris is the diaphragm that serves as the aperture stop. Refraction in the [[cornea]] causes the effective aperture (the [[entrance pupil]]) to differ slightly from the physical pupil diameter. The entrance pupil is typically about 4&nbsp;mm in diameter, although it can range from 2&nbsp;mm ({{f/|8.3|}}) in a brightly lit place to 8&nbsp;mm ({{f/|2.1}}) in the dark.

Frontal-eyed animals have a small area of the retina with very high visual acuity, the [[fovea centralis]]. It covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Any failure to make eye movements correctly can lead to serious visual degradation.\n\nHaving two eyes allows the brain to determine the depth and distance of an object, called stereovision, and gives the sense of three-dimensionality to the vision. Both eyes must point accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas to stimulate stereovision; otherwise, double vision might occur. Some persons with congenitally crossed eyes tend to ignore one eye's vision, thus do not suffer double vision, and do not have stereovision. The movements of the eye are controlled by six muscles attached to each eye, and allow the eye to elevate, depress, converge, diverge and roll. These muscles are both controlled voluntarily and involuntarily to track objects and correct for simultaneous head movements.\n\n=== Extraocular muscles ===\n{{Main|Extraocular muscles}}\nEach eye has six [[muscle]]s that control its movements: the [[Lateral rectus muscle|lateral rectus]], the [[Medial rectus muscle|medial rectus]], the [[Inferior rectus muscle|inferior rectus]], the [[Superior rectus muscle|superior rectus]], the [[Inferior oblique muscle|inferior oblique]], and the [[Superior oblique muscle|superior oblique]]. When the muscles exert different tensions, a torque is exerted on the globe that causes it to turn, in almost pure rotation, with only about one millimeter of translation.<ref>Carpenter, Roger H.S. (1988). ''Movements of the eyes (2nd ed.)''. London: Pion, Ltd {{ISBN|0-85086-109-8}}.</ref> Thus, the eye can be considered as undergoing rotations about a single point in the center of the eye.\n\n=== Rapid eye movement ===\n{{Main|Rapid eye movement sleep}}\nRapid eye movement, REM, typically refers to the [[sleep]] stage during  which the most vivid dreams occur. During this stage, the eyes move rapidly.\n\n=== Saccades ===\n{{Main|Saccade}}\nSaccades are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction controlled by the frontal lobe of the brain.\n\n=== Fixational Eye Movements ===\n{{Main|Fixation (visual)}}\nEven when looking intently at a single spot, the eyes drift around. This ensures that individual photosensitive cells are continually stimulated in different degrees. Without changing input, these cells would otherwise stop generating output.\n\nA 2019 study<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Casile |display-authors=et al. |first1=Antonino |title=Contrast sensitivity reveals an oculomotor strategy for temporally encoding space. |journal=eLife |date=2019 |volume=8 |doi=10.7554/eLife.40924|pmid=30620333 |pmc=6324884 }}</ref> showed that small continuous and unconscious eye movements are needed to enable the detection of contrast, and for vision in general. Eye movements include drift, [[ocular tremor]], and microsaccades. Some irregular drifts, movements smaller than a saccade and larger than a microsaccade, subtend up to one tenth of a degree. Researchers vary in their definition of [[Microsaccade]]s by amplitude, Martin Rolfs<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2009.08.010 |pmid=19683016 |title=Microsaccades: Small steps on a long way |year=2009 |last1=Rolfs |first1=Martin |journal=[[Vision Research]] |volume=49 |issue=20 |pages=2415\u20132441|doi-access=free }}</ref> states that 'the majority of microsaccades observed in a variety of tasks have amplitudes smaller than 30 min-arc'.\n\n=== Vestibulo-ocular reflexes ===\n{{Main|Vestibulo-ocular reflex}}\nThe [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] is a [[reflex]] eye movement that stabilizes images on the [[retina]] during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement in response to neural input from the vestibular system of the inner ear, thus maintaining the image in the center of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left.  This applies for head movements up and down, left and right, and tilt to the right and left, all of which give input to the ocular muscles to maintain visual stability.\n\n=== Smooth pursuit movement ===\n{{Main|Pursuit movement}}\nEyes can also follow a moving object around. This tracking is less accurate than the vestibulo-ocular reflex, as it requires the brain to process incoming visual information and supply [[feedback]]. Following an object moving at constant speed is relatively easy, though the eyes will often make saccadic jerks to keep up. The smooth pursuit movement can move the eye at up to 100\u00b0/s in adult humans.\n\nIt is more difficult to visually estimate speed in low light conditions or while moving, unless there is another point of reference for determining speed.\n\n=== Optokinetic reflex ===\n{{Main |Optokinetic response}}\n\nThe Optokinetic reflex (or optokinetic nystagmus) stabilizes the image on the retina through visual feedback. It is induced when the entire visual scene drifts across the retina, eliciting eye rotation in the same direction and at a velocity that minimizes the motion of the image on the retina. When the gaze direction deviates too far from the forward heading, a compensatory saccade is induced to reset the gaze to the centre of the visual field.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0002055 |pmid=18446207|pmc=2323102|year=2008|last1=Cahill|first1=H|title=The Optokinetic Reflex as a Tool for Quantitative Analyses of Nervous System Function in Mice: Application to Genetic and Drug-Induced Variation|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=3|issue=4|page=e2055|last2=Nathans|first2=J|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2055C}}</ref>\n\nFor example, when looking out of the window at a moving train, the eyes can focus on a moving train for a short moment (by stabilizing it on the retina), until the train moves out of the field of vision. At this point, the eye is moved back to the point where it first saw the train (through a saccade).\n\n== Near response ==\nThe adjustment to close-range vision involves three processes to focus an image on the retina.\n\n=== Vergence movement ===\n{{Main|Vergence}}\n[[File:Stereogram Tut Eye Convergence.png|thumb|The two eyes converge to point to the same object.]]\nWhen a creature with binocular vision looks at an object, the eyes must rotate around a vertical axis so that the projection of the image is in the centre of the retina in both eyes. To look at a nearby object, the eyes rotate 'towards each other' ([[convergence (eye)|convergence]]), while for an object farther away they rotate 'away from each other' ([[divergence (eye)|divergence]]).\n\n=== Pupil constriction ===\nLenses cannot refract light rays at their edges as well as they can closer to the center. The image produced by any lens is therefore somewhat blurry around the edges ([[spherical aberration]]). It can be minimized by screening out peripheral light rays and looking only at the better-focused center. In the eye, the pupil serves this purpose by constricting while the eye is focused on nearby objects. Small apertures also give an increase in [[depth of field]], allowing a broader range of \"in focus\" vision. In this way the pupil has a dual purpose for near vision: to reduce spherical aberration and increase depth of field.<ref name=Saladin_A&Punity>{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth S.|title=Anatomy & physiology : the unity of form and function|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337825-1|pages=620\u2013622|edition=6th|date=2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Accommodation of the lens ===\nChanging the curvature of the lens is carried out by the [[ciliary muscle]]s surrounding the lens; this process is known as \"accommodation\". Accommodation narrows the inner diameter of the ciliary body, which actually relaxes the fibers of the suspensory ligament attached to the periphery of the lens, and also allows the lens to relax into a more convex, or globular, shape. A more convex lens refracts light more strongly and focuses divergent light rays from near objects onto the retina, allowing closer objects to be brought into better focus.<ref name=Saladin_A&Punity /><ref>{{cite web|title=Human eye|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1688997/human-eye|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Eye care professionals ===\nThe human eye contains enough complexity to warrant specialized attention and care beyond the duties of a [[general practitioner]]. These specialists, or [[eye care professional]]s, serve different functions in different countries. Eye care professionals can have overlap in their patient care privileges.  For example, both an [[ophthalmologist]] (M.D.) and [[optometrist]] (O.D.) are professionals who diagnoses eye disease and can prescribe lenses to correct vision.  However, typically only ophthalmologists are licensed to perform surgical procedures.  Ophthalmologists may also specialize within a surgical area, such as [[Corneal transplantation|cornea]], [[Cataract surgery|cataracts]], [[Refractive surgery|laser]], [[Retinal detachment|retina]], or [[oculoplastics]].\n\nEye care professionals include:\n* [[Ocularist]]s\n* [[Ophthalmology|Ophthalmologists]]\n* [[Opticianry|Opticians]]\n* [[Optometry|Optometrists]]\n* [[Orthoptics|Orthoptists]] and [[Vision therapy|Vision Therapists]]\n\n=== Eye irritation ===\n[[File:Bloodshot.jpg|thumb|Conjunctival injection, or redness of the sclera surrounding the iris and pupil]]\nEye irritation has been defined as \"the magnitude of any stinging, scratching, burning, or other irritating sensation from the eye\".<ref name=Mendell_OfficeWorkers>{{cite journal|last=Mendell|first=Mark J.|title=Non-Specific Symptoms In Office Workers: A Review And Summary Of The Epidemiologic Literature|journal=Indoor Air|date=22 April 2004|volume=3|issue=4|pages=227\u2013236|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.1993.00003.x}}</ref>  It is a common problem experienced by people of all ages.

Personal factors (e.g. use of contact lenses, eye make-up, and certain medications) may also affect destabilization of the tear film and possibly result in more eye symptoms.<ref name=Wolkoff /> Nevertheless, if airborne particles alone should destabilize the tear film and cause eye irritation, their content of surface-active compounds must be high.<ref name=Wolkoff /> An integrated physiological risk model with [[blink]] frequency, destabilization, and break-up of the eye tear film as inseparable phenomena may explain eye irritation among office workers in terms of occupational, climate, and eye-related physiological risk factors.<ref name=Wolkoff />\n\nThere are two major measures of eye irritation. One is blink frequency which can be observed by human behavior. The other measures are break up time, tear flow, hyperemia (redness, swelling), tear fluid cytology, and epithelial damage (vital stains) etc., which are human beings' physiological reactions. Blink frequency is defined as the number of blinks per minute and it is associated with eye irritation. Blink frequencies are individual with mean frequencies of < 2\u20133 to 20\u201330 blinks/minute, and they depend on environmental factors including the use of [[contact lens]]es. Dehydration, mental activities, work conditions, room temperature, relative humidity, and illumination all influence blink frequency. Break-up time (BUT) is another major measure of eye irritation and tear film stability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kjaergaard|first=SK|title=Indoor air quality handbook: Chapter 17, the Irritated Eye in the Indoor Environment|year=2001|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-445549-4|edition=}}</ref>  It is defined as the time interval (in seconds) between blinking and rupture. BUT is considered to reflect the stability of the tear film as well. In normal persons, the break-up time exceeds the interval between blinks, and, therefore, the tear film is maintained.<ref name=Wolkoff /> Studies have shown that blink frequency is correlated negatively with break-up time. This phenomenon indicates that perceived eye irritation is associated with an increase in blink frequency since the cornea and conjunctiva both have sensitive nerve endings that belong to the first trigeminal branch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norn|first=Mogens S.|title=External eye : methods of examination|year=1974|publisher=Scriptor|location=Copenhagen|isbn=978-8787473033}}</ref><ref name=\"Sibony PA. et al. 1998, pp. 1509-1592\">Sibony PA, Evinger C. \"Anatomy and physiology of normal and abnormal eyelid position and movement\".

Most of these anatomic and physiologic processes follow a gradual decline. With aging, the quality of vision worsens due to reasons independent of diseases of the aging eye. While there are many changes of significance in the non-diseased eye, the most functionally important changes seem to be a reduction in pupil size and the loss of accommodation or focusing capability ([[presbyopia]]). The area of the pupil governs the amount of light that can reach the retina. The extent to which the pupil dilates decreases with age, leading to a substantial decrease in light received at the retina. In comparison to younger people, it is as though older persons are constantly wearing medium-density sunglasses. Therefore, for any detailed visually guided tasks on which performance varies with illumination, older persons require extra lighting. Certain ocular diseases can come from sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and genital warts. If contact between the eye and area of infection occurs, the STD can be transmitted to the eye.<ref>[http://www.agingeye.net/ AgingEye Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913224350/http://www.agingeye.net/ |date=2008-09-13 }}</ref>\n\nWith aging, a prominent white ring develops in the periphery of the cornea called [[arcus senilis]]. Aging causes laxity, downward shift of eyelid tissues and atrophy of the orbital fat. These changes contribute to the etiology of several eyelid disorders such as [[ectropion]], [[entropion]], [[dermatochalasis]], and [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]. The vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction ([[posterior vitreous detachment]] or PVD) and its opacities \u2014 visible as [[floater]]s \u2014 gradually increase in number.\n\nVarious [[eye care professional]]s, including [[ophthalmologist]]s (eye doctors/surgeons), [[optometrist]]s, and [[optician]]s, are involved in the treatment and management of ocular and vision disorders. A [[Snellen chart]] is one type of [[eye chart]] used to measure [[visual acuity]]. At the conclusion of a complete [[eye examination]], the eye doctor might provide the patient with an [[eyeglass prescription]] for [[corrective lens]]es. Some disorders of the eyes for which corrective lenses are prescribed include myopia ([[near-sightedness]]) which affects about one-third{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} of the human population, [[hyperopia]] (far-sightedness) which affects about one quarter of the population, [[astigmatism]], and [[presbyopia]] (the loss of focusing range during aging).\n\n=== Macular degeneration ===\n{{Main|Macular degeneration}}\nMacular degeneration is especially prevalent in the U.S. and affects roughly 1.75 million Americans each year.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/archopht.122.4.564|pmid=15078675|title=Prevalence of Age-Related Macular Degeneration in the United States|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|volume=122|issue=4|pages=564\u2013572|year=2004|last1=Friedman|first1=D.

The anterior segment is made up of the cornea, iris and lens. The cornea is transparent and more curved, and is linked to the larger posterior segment, composed of the vitreous, retina, choroid and the outer white shell called the sclera. The cornea is typically about 11.5&nbsp;mm (0.3&nbsp;in) in diameter, and 0.5&nbsp;mm (500&nbsp;\u03bcm) in thickness near its center. The posterior chamber constitutes the remaining five-sixths; its diameter is typically about 24&nbsp;mm. The cornea and sclera are connected by an area termed the limbus. The iris is the pigmented circular structure concentrically surrounding the center of the eye, the pupil, which appears to be black. The size of the pupil, which controls the amount of light entering the eye, is adjusted by the iris' [[iris dilator muscle|dilator]] and [[iris sphincter muscle|sphincter muscles]].\n\nLight energy enters the eye through the cornea, through the pupil and then through the lens. The lens shape is changed for near focus (accommodation) and is controlled by the ciliary muscle. Photons of light falling on the light-sensitive cells of the retina ([[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor cones and rods]]) are converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain by the optic nerve and interpreted as sight and vision.\n\n=== Size ===\n{{See also|Mammalian eye}}\nThe size of the eye differs among adults by only one or two millimetres. The eyeball is generally less tall than it is wide. The sagittal vertical (height) of a human adult eye is approximately 23.7&nbsp;mm, the transverse horizontal diameter (width) is 24.2&nbsp;mm and the axial anteroposterior size (depth) averages 22.0\u201324.8&nbsp;mm with no significant difference between sexes and age groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/25431659/Variations-in-eyeball-diameters-of-the-healthy-adults |title=Variations in eyeball diameters of the healthy adults}}</ref> Strong correlation has been found between the transverse diameter and the width of the orbit (r = 0.88).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pubfacts.com/detail/25431659/Variations-in-eyeball-diameters-of-the-healthy-adults |title=Variations in eyeball diameters of the healthy adults}}</ref> The typical adult eye has an anterior to posterior diameter of 24 millimetres, and a volume of six cubic centimetres (0.4 cu. in.).<ref name=GeneralOphthal>{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=edited by Paul Riordan-Eva, Emmett T.|title=Vaughan & Asbury's General Ophthalmology|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-163420-5|url=http://accessmedicine.com/resourceTOC.aspx?resourceID=720|edition=18th|date=2011-05-17}}</ref>\n\nThe eyeball grows rapidly, increasing from about 16\u201317 millimetres (about 0.65&nbsp;inch) at birth to 22.5\u201323&nbsp;mm (approx. 0.89 in) by three years of age. By age 12, the eye attains its full size.\n\n=== Components ===\n[[File:Schematic diagram of the human eye en.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic diagram of the human eye. It shows a horizontal section through the right eye.]]\nThe eye is made up of three coats, or layers, enclosing various anatomical structures. The outermost layer, known as the [[Fibrous tunic of eyeball|fibrous tunic]], is composed of the [[cornea]] and [[sclera]] , which provide shape to the eye and support the deeper structures. The middle layer, known as the [[Uvea|vascular tunic or uvea]], consists of the [[choroid]], [[ciliary body]], pigmented epithelium and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The innermost is the [[retina]], which gets its oxygenation from the blood vessels of the choroid (posteriorly) as well as the retinal vessels (anteriorly).\n\nThe spaces of the eye are filled with the [[aqueous humour]] anteriorly, between the cornea and lens, and the [[vitreous body]], a jelly-like substance, behind the lens, filling the entire posterior cavity. The aqueous humour is a clear watery fluid that is contained in two areas:  the [[Anterior chamber of eyeball|anterior chamber]] between the cornea and the iris, and the [[Posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]] between the iris and the lens. The lens is suspended to the ciliary body by the suspensory ligament ([[Zonule of Zinn]]), made up of hundreds of fine transparent fibers which transmit muscular forces to change the shape of the lens for accommodation (focusing). The vitreous body is a clear substance composed of water and proteins, which give it a jelly-like and sticky composition.<ref>\"eye, human.\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica from [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]] 2009</ref>\n\n== Vision ==\n{{See also|Visual acuity|Eye#Visual acuity|Fovea centralis#Angular size of foveal cones|Color vision#Physiology of color perception}}\n\n=== Field of view ===\n[[File:Mairead cropped.png|thumb|Side-view of the human eye, viewed approximately 90\u00b0 temporal, illustrating how the iris and pupil appear rotated towards the viewer due to the optical properties of the cornea and the aqueous humor.]]\nThe approximate [[field of view]] of an individual human eye (measured from the fixation point, i.e., the point at which one's gaze is directed) varies by facial anatomy, but is typically 30\u00b0 superior (up, limited by the brow), 45\u00b0 nasal (limited by the nose), 70\u00b0 inferior (down), and 100\u00b0 temporal (towards the temple).<ref name=\"SavinoDanesh-Meyer2012\">{{cite book|last1=Savino|first1=Peter J.|last2=Danesh-Meyer|first2=Helen V.|title=Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Ophthalmology \u2013 Wills Eye Institute \u2013 Neuro-Ophthalmology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RgSZGWQZGIC&pg=PA12|date=2012|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|isbn=978-1-60913-266-8|page=12}}</ref><ref name=\"RyanSchachat2012\">{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Schachat|first2=Andrew P.|last3=Wilkinson|first3=Charles P. |author4=David R.

As soon as the eye moves rapidly to acquire a target ([[saccade]]s), it re-adjusts its exposure by adjusting the iris, which adjusts the size of the pupil. Initial dark adaptation takes place in approximately four seconds of profound, uninterrupted darkness; full adaptation through adjustments in retinal rod photoreceptors is 80% complete in thirty minutes. The process is nonlinear and multifaceted, so an interruption by light exposure requires restarting the dark adaptation process over again. Full adaptation is dependent on good blood flow; thus dark adaptation may be hampered by retinal disease, poor vascular circulation and high altitude exposure. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe human eye can detect a luminance range of 10<sup>14</sup>, or one hundred trillion (100,000,000,000,000) (about 46.5 f-stops), from 10<sup>\u22126</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup>, or one millionth (0.000001) of a candela per square meter to 10<sup>8</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup> or one hundred million (100,000,000) candelas per square meter.<ref name=\"IvergardHunt2008\">{{cite book|last1=Ivergard|first1=Toni|last2=Hunt|first2=Brian|title=Handbook of Control Room Design and Ergonomics: A Perspective for the Future, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DR9UyqLkgH8C&pg=PT108|date=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-6434-6|page=90}}</ref><ref name=\"KaschkeDonnerhacke2013\">{{Cite book|last1=Kaschke|first1=Michael|last2=Donnerhacke|first2=Karl-Heinz|last3=Rill|first3=Michael Stefan|title=Optical Devices in Ophthalmology and Optometry: Technology, Design Principles and Clinical Applications|journal=Journal of Biomedical Optics|volume=19|issue=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPw8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|date=2013|isbn=978-3-527-64899-3|page=26|bibcode=2014JBO....19g9901M|doi=10.1117/1.JBO.19.7.079901}}</ref><ref name=\"BanterleArtusi2011\">{{cite book|last1=Banterle|first1=Francesco|last2=Artusi|first2=Alessandro|last3=Debattista|first3=Kurt|author4=Alan Chalmers|title=Advanced High Dynamic Range Imaging: Theory and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LL5orppYlJsC&pg=PA7|date=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-56881-719-4|page=7}}</ref> This range does not include looking at the midday sun (10<sup>9</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup>)<ref name=\"PodeDiouf2011\">{{cite book|last1=Pode|first1=Ramchandra|last2=Diouf|first2=Boucar|title=Solar Lighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqKUqfvDq_MC&pg=PA62|date=2011|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4471-2134-3|page=62}}</ref> or lightning discharge.\n\nAt the low end of the range is the [[absolute threshold]] of vision for a steady light across a wide field of view, about 10<sup>\u22126</sup> cd/m2 (0.000001 candela per square meter).<ref name=\"Davson2012\">{{cite book|last=Davson|first=Hugh|authorlink=Hugh Davson|title=The Physiology of The Eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q216982BQboC&pg=PA213|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-323-14394-3|page=213}}</ref><ref name=\"name\">{{Citation |last=Denton|first=E.

Frontal-eyed animals have a small area of the retina with very high visual acuity, the [[fovea centralis]]. It covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Any failure to make eye movements correctly can lead to serious visual degradation.\n\nHaving two eyes allows the brain to determine the depth and distance of an object, called stereovision, and gives the sense of three-dimensionality to the vision. Both eyes must point accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas to stimulate stereovision; otherwise, double vision might occur. Some persons with congenitally crossed eyes tend to ignore one eye's vision, thus do not suffer double vision, and do not have stereovision. The movements of the eye are controlled by six muscles attached to each eye, and allow the eye to elevate, depress, converge, diverge and roll. These muscles are both controlled voluntarily and involuntarily to track objects and correct for simultaneous head movements.\n\n=== Extraocular muscles ===\n{{Main|Extraocular muscles}}\nEach eye has six [[muscle]]s that control its movements: the [[Lateral rectus muscle|lateral rectus]], the [[Medial rectus muscle|medial rectus]], the [[Inferior rectus muscle|inferior rectus]], the [[Superior rectus muscle|superior rectus]], the [[Inferior oblique muscle|inferior oblique]], and the [[Superior oblique muscle|superior oblique]]. When the muscles exert different tensions, a torque is exerted on the globe that causes it to turn, in almost pure rotation, with only about one millimeter of translation.<ref>Carpenter, Roger H.S. (1988). ''Movements of the eyes (2nd ed.)''. London: Pion, Ltd {{ISBN|0-85086-109-8}}.</ref> Thus, the eye can be considered as undergoing rotations about a single point in the center of the eye.\n\n=== Rapid eye movement ===\n{{Main|Rapid eye movement sleep}}\nRapid eye movement, REM, typically refers to the [[sleep]] stage during  which the most vivid dreams occur. During this stage, the eyes move rapidly.\n\n=== Saccades ===\n{{Main|Saccade}}\nSaccades are quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction controlled by the frontal lobe of the brain.\n\n=== Fixational Eye Movements ===\n{{Main|Fixation (visual)}}\nEven when looking intently at a single spot, the eyes drift around. This ensures that individual photosensitive cells are continually stimulated in different degrees. Without changing input, these cells would otherwise stop generating output.\n\nA 2019 study<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Casile |display-authors=et al. |first1=Antonino |title=Contrast sensitivity reveals an oculomotor strategy for temporally encoding space. |journal=eLife |date=2019 |volume=8 |doi=10.7554/eLife.40924|pmid=30620333 |pmc=6324884 }}</ref> showed that small continuous and unconscious eye movements are needed to enable the detection of contrast, and for vision in general. Eye movements include drift, [[ocular tremor]], and microsaccades. Some irregular drifts, movements smaller than a saccade and larger than a microsaccade, subtend up to one tenth of a degree. Researchers vary in their definition of [[Microsaccade]]s by amplitude, Martin Rolfs<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2009.08.010 |pmid=19683016 |title=Microsaccades: Small steps on a long way |year=2009 |last1=Rolfs |first1=Martin |journal=[[Vision Research]] |volume=49 |issue=20 |pages=2415\u20132441|doi-access=free }}</ref> states that 'the majority of microsaccades observed in a variety of tasks have amplitudes smaller than 30 min-arc'.\n\n=== Vestibulo-ocular reflexes ===\n{{Main|Vestibulo-ocular reflex}}\nThe [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] is a [[reflex]] eye movement that stabilizes images on the [[retina]] during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement in response to neural input from the vestibular system of the inner ear, thus maintaining the image in the center of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left.  This applies for head movements up and down, left and right, and tilt to the right and left, all of which give input to the ocular muscles to maintain visual stability.\n\n=== Smooth pursuit movement ===\n{{Main|Pursuit movement}}\nEyes can also follow a moving object around. This tracking is less accurate than the vestibulo-ocular reflex, as it requires the brain to process incoming visual information and supply [[feedback]]. Following an object moving at constant speed is relatively easy, though the eyes will often make saccadic jerks to keep up. The smooth pursuit movement can move the eye at up to 100\u00b0/s in adult humans.\n\nIt is more difficult to visually estimate speed in low light conditions or while moving, unless there is another point of reference for determining speed.\n\n=== Optokinetic reflex ===\n{{Main |Optokinetic response}}\n\nThe Optokinetic reflex (or optokinetic nystagmus) stabilizes the image on the retina through visual feedback. It is induced when the entire visual scene drifts across the retina, eliciting eye rotation in the same direction and at a velocity that minimizes the motion of the image on the retina. When the gaze direction deviates too far from the forward heading, a compensatory saccade is induced to reset the gaze to the centre of the visual field.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0002055 |pmid=18446207|pmc=2323102|year=2008|last1=Cahill|first1=H|title=The Optokinetic Reflex as a Tool for Quantitative Analyses of Nervous System Function in Mice: Application to Genetic and Drug-Induced Variation|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=3|issue=4|page=e2055|last2=Nathans|first2=J|bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2055C}}</ref>\n\nFor example, when looking out of the window at a moving train, the eyes can focus on a moving train for a short moment (by stabilizing it on the retina), until the train moves out of the field of vision. At this point, the eye is moved back to the point where it first saw the train (through a saccade).\n\n== Near response ==\nThe adjustment to close-range vision involves three processes to focus an image on the retina.\n\n=== Vergence movement ===\n{{Main|Vergence}}\n[[File:Stereogram Tut Eye Convergence.png|thumb|The two eyes converge to point to the same object.]]\nWhen a creature with binocular vision looks at an object, the eyes must rotate around a vertical axis so that the projection of the image is in the centre of the retina in both eyes. To look at a nearby object, the eyes rotate 'towards each other' ([[convergence (eye)|convergence]]), while for an object farther away they rotate 'away from each other' ([[divergence (eye)|divergence]]).\n\n=== Pupil constriction ===\nLenses cannot refract light rays at their edges as well as they can closer to the center. The image produced by any lens is therefore somewhat blurry around the edges ([[spherical aberration]]). It can be minimized by screening out peripheral light rays and looking only at the better-focused center. In the eye, the pupil serves this purpose by constricting while the eye is focused on nearby objects. Small apertures also give an increase in [[depth of field]], allowing a broader range of \"in focus\" vision. In this way the pupil has a dual purpose for near vision: to reduce spherical aberration and increase depth of field.<ref name=Saladin_A&Punity>{{cite book|last=Saladin|first=Kenneth S.|title=Anatomy & physiology : the unity of form and function|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337825-1|pages=620\u2013622|edition=6th|date=2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Accommodation of the lens ===\nChanging the curvature of the lens is carried out by the [[ciliary muscle]]s surrounding the lens; this process is known as \"accommodation\". Accommodation narrows the inner diameter of the ciliary body, which actually relaxes the fibers of the suspensory ligament attached to the periphery of the lens, and also allows the lens to relax into a more convex, or globular, shape. A more convex lens refracts light more strongly and focuses divergent light rays from near objects onto the retina, allowing closer objects to be brought into better focus.<ref name=Saladin_A&Punity /><ref>{{cite web|title=Human eye|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1688997/human-eye|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Eye care professionals ===\nThe human eye contains enough complexity to warrant specialized attention and care beyond the duties of a [[general practitioner]]. These specialists, or [[eye care professional]]s, serve different functions in different countries. Eye care professionals can have overlap in their patient care privileges.

Personal factors (e.g. use of contact lenses, eye make-up, and certain medications) may also affect destabilization of the tear film and possibly result in more eye symptoms.<ref name=Wolkoff /> Nevertheless, if airborne particles alone should destabilize the tear film and cause eye irritation, their content of surface-active compounds must be high.<ref name=Wolkoff /> An integrated physiological risk model with [[blink]] frequency, destabilization, and break-up of the eye tear film as inseparable phenomena may explain eye irritation among office workers in terms of occupational, climate, and eye-related physiological risk factors.<ref name=Wolkoff />\n\nThere are two major measures of eye irritation. One is blink frequency which can be observed by human behavior. The other measures are break up time, tear flow, hyperemia (redness, swelling), tear fluid cytology, and epithelial damage (vital stains) etc., which are human beings' physiological reactions. Blink frequency is defined as the number of blinks per minute and it is associated with eye irritation. Blink frequencies are individual with mean frequencies of < 2\u20133 to 20\u201330 blinks/minute, and they depend on environmental factors including the use of [[contact lens]]es. Dehydration, mental activities, work conditions, room temperature, relative humidity, and illumination all influence blink frequency. Break-up time (BUT) is another major measure of eye irritation and tear film stability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kjaergaard|first=SK|title=Indoor air quality handbook: Chapter 17, the Irritated Eye in the Indoor Environment|year=2001|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-445549-4|edition=}}</ref>  It is defined as the time interval (in seconds) between blinking and rupture. BUT is considered to reflect the stability of the tear film as well. In normal persons, the break-up time exceeds the interval between blinks, and, therefore, the tear film is maintained.<ref name=Wolkoff /> Studies have shown that blink frequency is correlated negatively with break-up time. This phenomenon indicates that perceived eye irritation is associated with an increase in blink frequency since the cornea and conjunctiva both have sensitive nerve endings that belong to the first trigeminal branch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norn|first=Mogens S.|title=External eye : methods of examination|year=1974|publisher=Scriptor|location=Copenhagen|isbn=978-8787473033}}</ref><ref name=\"Sibony PA. et al. 1998, pp. 1509-1592\">Sibony PA, Evinger C. \"Anatomy and physiology of normal and abnormal eyelid position and movement\".

Most of these anatomic and physiologic processes follow a gradual decline. With aging, the quality of vision worsens due to reasons independent of diseases of the aging eye. While there are many changes of significance in the non-diseased eye, the most functionally important changes seem to be a reduction in pupil size and the loss of accommodation or focusing capability ([[presbyopia]]). The area of the pupil governs the amount of light that can reach the retina. The extent to which the pupil dilates decreases with age, leading to a substantial decrease in light received at the retina. In comparison to younger people, it is as though older persons are constantly wearing medium-density sunglasses. Therefore, for any detailed visually guided tasks on which performance varies with illumination, older persons require extra lighting. Certain ocular diseases can come from sexually transmitted diseases such as herpes and genital warts. If contact between the eye and area of infection occurs, the STD can be transmitted to the eye.<ref>[http://www.agingeye.net/ AgingEye Times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913224350/http://www.agingeye.net/ |date=2008-09-13 }}</ref>\n\nWith aging, a prominent white ring develops in the periphery of the cornea called [[arcus senilis]]. Aging causes laxity, downward shift of eyelid tissues and atrophy of the orbital fat. These changes contribute to the etiology of several eyelid disorders such as [[ectropion]], [[entropion]], [[dermatochalasis]], and [[ptosis (eyelid)|ptosis]]. The vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction ([[posterior vitreous detachment]] or PVD) and its opacities \u2014 visible as [[floater]]s \u2014 gradually increase in number.\n\nVarious [[eye care professional]]s, including [[ophthalmologist]]s (eye doctors/surgeons), [[optometrist]]s, and [[optician]]s, are involved in the treatment and management of ocular and vision disorders. A [[Snellen chart]] is one type of [[eye chart]] used to measure [[visual acuity]]. At the conclusion of a complete [[eye examination]], the eye doctor might provide the patient with an [[eyeglass prescription]] for [[corrective lens]]es. Some disorders of the eyes for which corrective lenses are prescribed include myopia ([[near-sightedness]]) which affects about one-third{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} of the human population, [[hyperopia]] (far-sightedness) which affects about one quarter of the population, [[astigmatism]], and [[presbyopia]] (the loss of focusing range during aging).\n\n=== Macular degeneration ===\n{{Main|Macular degeneration}}\nMacular degeneration is especially prevalent in the U.S. and affects roughly 1.75 million Americans each year.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1001/archopht.122.4.564|pmid=15078675|title=Prevalence of Age-Related Macular Degeneration in the United States|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|volume=122|issue=4|pages=564\u2013572|year=2004|last1=Friedman|first1=D.

Lutein and zeaxanthin bind to the electron free radical and are reduced rendering the electron safe. There are many ways to ensure a diet rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, the best of which is to eat dark green vegetables including kale, spinach, broccoli and turnip greens. Nutrition is an important aspect of the ability to achieve and maintain proper eye health. [[Lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]] are two major carotenoids, found in the macula of the eye, that are being researched to identify their role in the pathogenesis of eye disorders such as age-related [[macular degeneration]] and [[cataracts]].<ref>American Optometric Association (2013).
