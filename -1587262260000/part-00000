The nineteenth-century qa\u00eatvadatha style (with q instead of Avesta x) and similar writings reappear in modern literature.\n\nThe first part of the compound seems to be a \"family\" (or similar) of Khito (x\u1d5ba\u0113tu), which is generally thought to derive from the \"self\" (x\u1d5ba\u0113-) with the suffix -you (-tu-), although this is not entirely straightforward . The second part, vada\u03b8a, is nowadays generally regarded as a derivative of the verb (From * Wad-) 'resulting in marriage', related to other Iranian and Hindu European languages which refer to marriage or marriage partner (compare with ancient Indik). \"Wife\" Av. Va\u03b4\u016b; Pahlavi way\u016bg (Pers. Bayu) \"bride\"; Avestan va\u03b4ut \"one who has reached the age of marriage\"; Pahlavi way\u016bdag \"bride's room\"; \n\nThis etymology was suggested by Carl Goldner, and accepted by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and Christian Bartholomae, and became a popular opinion among Western scholars. However, there is no * vadha- to Vedic or * vada- root in the Avesta of the vadh root; in Avesta the v\u0101\u03b4aya and upa.v\u0101\u03b4aiia- 'lead (to marry)' and uzuu\u0101\u03b4aiia are 'leaving the father's house'. vadh-Vedic, vad-Avestan should not be confused with vah-Avestan \"to take\", vaz-Avestan with the uhy\u00e1-unknown form.\n\n== Zoroastrian religious views ==\nMost of Pahlavi's texts are self-contained by [[Edward William West]]'s comments.

The nineteenth-century qa\u00eatvadatha style (with q instead of Avesta x) and similar writings reappear in modern literature.\n\nThe first part of the compound seems to be a \"family\" (or similar) of Khito (x\u1d5ba\u0113tu), which is generally thought to derive from the \"self\" (x\u1d5ba\u0113-) with the suffix -you (-tu-), although this is not entirely straightforward . The second part, vada\u03b8a, is nowadays generally regarded as a derivative of the verb (From * Wad-) 'resulting in marriage', related to other Iranian and Hindu European languages which refer to marriage or marriage partner (compare with ancient Indik). \"Wife\" Av. Va\u03b4\u016b; Pahlavi way\u016bg (Pers. Bayu) \"bride\"; Avestan va\u03b4ut \"one who has reached the age of marriage\"; Pahlavi way\u016bdag \"bride's room\"; \n\nThis etymology was suggested by Carl Goldner, and accepted by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and Christian Bartholomae, and became a popular opinion among Western scholars. However, there is no * vadha- to Vedic or * vada- root in the Avesta of the vadh root; in Avesta the v\u0101\u03b4aya and upa.v\u0101\u03b4aiia- 'lead (to marry)' and uzuu\u0101\u03b4aiia are 'leaving the father's house'. vadh-Vedic, vad-Avestan should not be confused with vah-Avestan \"to take\", vaz-Avestan with the uhy\u00e1-unknown form.\n\n== Zoroastrian religious views ==\nMost of Pahlavi's texts are self-contained by [[Edward William West]]'s comments.

He is described as being a Greek (Pali: ''[[Yona]]'', lit. \"[[Ionia]]n\") in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', and his activities are indicative of some [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greek]] following during the early centuries of Buddhism.\n\nGreek communities had been present in neighbouring [[Bactria]] and in northwestern India since the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] around 323 BCE, and developed into the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] and the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] until the end of the 1st century BCE. Greeks were generally described in ancient times throughout the Classical world as \"[[Yona]]\", \"Yonaka\", \"Yojanas\" or \"Yavanas\", lit. \u201c[[Ionia]]ns\". They were ardent recipients of Buddhism and the example of Dharmarak\u1e63ita indicates that they even took an active role in spreading Buddhism as leading missionaries.\n\n==A Greek Buddhist missionary==\nThe efforts of Emperor Ashoka to spread the Buddhist faith are described in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] carved during his reign on stone pillars and cave walls:\n: \"Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in Dhamma.\" Rock Edict Nb13 (S. Dhammika)\n\nAshoka also claimed to have sent emissaries beyond his borders, as far as the Greek kings of the [[Mediterranean]]:\n:\"Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest. And it (conquest by Dhamma) has been won here, on the borders, even six hundred yojanas away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni.\" Rock Edict Nb13 (S. Dhammika)\n\n'''Dharmaraksita''' is then described in important Buddhist [[P\u0101li|Pali]] historical texts, the Dipavamsa and the [[Mahavamsa]], as being a Greek Buddhist missionary, in charge of propagating the faith to the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.\n\n:\"When the thera Moggaliputta, the illuminator of the religion of the Conqueror, had brought the (third) council to an end (\u2026) he sent forth theras, one here and one there:\n:* The thera Mahyantika he sent to Kasmira and Gandhara,\n:* The thera, [[Mahadeva (Buddhism)|Mahadeva]] he sent to Mahisamandala.\n:* To Vanavasa be sent the thera named Rakkhita,\n:* and '''to Aparantaka (he sent) the [[Yona]] named Dhammarakkhita''';\n:* to Maharattha (he sent) the thera named Mahadhammarakkhita,\n:* but the thera Maharakkhita he sent into the country of the [[Yona]].\n:* He sent the thera Majjhima to the Himalaya country,\n:* and to Suvambhurni he sent the two theras Sona and Uttara.\n:* The great thera Mahinda, the theras Utthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala his disciples, these five theras he sent forth with the charge: `Ye shall found in the lovely island of Lanka the lovely religion of the Conqueror.'\" ([[Mahavamsa]], XII)\n\nThe country of '''Aparantaka''' has been identified as the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, and comprises Northern [[Gujarat]], [[Kathiawar]], [[Kachch]], and [[Sindh]], the area where Greek communities were probably concentrated.\n\nDharmarashita is said to have preached the Aggikkhandopama Sutra, so that 37,000 people were converted in Aparantaka  and that thousands of men and women entered the Order (\"pabbajja\"):\n\n:\"The thera Dhammarakkhita the Yona, being gone to Aparantaka and having preached in the midst of the people the Aggikkhandhopama-sutta gave to drink of the nectar of truth to thirty-seven thousand living beings who had come together there, lie who perfectly understood truth and untruth. A thousand men and yet more women went forth from noble families and received the pabbajja\" ([[Mahavamsa]] XII, Dipavamsa. VIII.7)\n\n==Dharmaraksita and Punabbasukutumbikaputta Tissa Thera==\nIn another [[P\u0101li|Pali]] reference, a Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka  named Punabbasukutumbikaputta Tissa Thera is said to have been to India in order to study with '''\"the Yonaka Dhammarakkhita\"''', whereupon he attained the \"patisambhida\" (analytical knowledge). (VibhA.389, Sammoha-Vinodan\u00ed, Vibhanga Commentary).\n\nThe place where Dharmaraksita resides is also said to be around 100 leagues (around 700 miles) from Sri Lanka, putting it somewhere in northern India. (See: [http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/pu/punabbasukutumbikaputta.htm])\n\n==Dharmaraksita and the Milinda Panha==\nThe [[Milinda Panha]] is another famous non-canonical [[P\u0101li|Pali]] Buddhist text that describes the religious dialogues between the famous [[Indo-Greek]] king [[Menander I|Menander]], whose kingdom was in [[Sagala]] in today's [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], and a Buddhist monk called [[Nagasena]], around 160 BCE. It is today one of the texts of reference of [[Theravada]] Buddhism.\n\nAccording to the [[Milinda Panha]] (I 32-35), the monk [[Nagasena]], before his encounter with [[Menander I|Menander]], was once a student of '''Dharmaraksita''' and learnt Buddhism and reached [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] as an [[arhat]] under his guidance in [[Pataliputra]].\n{{quote|And Assagutta said to him: \"Do thou now go, N\u00e2gasena, to P\u00e2taliputta. There, in the Ashoka Park, dwells the venerable Dhammarakkhita. Under him you should learn the words of the Buddha.\" (''Milinda Panha'', I, 32)\n\nN\u00e2gasena went on to the Ashoka Park to Dhammarakkhita. And after saluting him, and telling him on what errand he had come, he learnt by heart, from the mouth of the venerable Dhammarakkhita, the whole of the three baskets of the Buddha's word in three months, and after a single recital, so far as the letter (that is, knowing the words by heart) was concerned. And in three months more he mastered the spirit (that is, the deeper meaning of the sense of the words).\n\nBut at the end of that time the venerable Dhammarakkhita addressed him, and said: \"N\u00e2gasena, as a herdsman tends the cows, but others enjoy their produce, so thou too carriest in thy head the whole three baskets of the Buddha's word, and still art not yet a partaker of the fruit of [[\u015brama\u1e47a|Samanaship]].\"\n\n\"Though that be so, holy one, say no more,\" was the reply. And on that very day, at night, he attained to [[arhat|Arahatship]] and with it to the fourfold power of that Wisdom possessed by all Arahats (that is to say: the realisation of the sense, and the appreciation of the deep religious teaching contained in the word, the power of intuitive judgment, and the power of correct and ready exposition). (''Milinda Panha'', I, 35)}}\n\nThis event took place roughly a hundred years after the missionary efforts of Ashoka, and it would suggest that Dharmaraksita was a young man under Ashoka, became a respected elder settled in the Ashokan capital of [[Pataliputra]], and then trained a young [[Nagasena]] in the [[Tripi\u1e6daka]] and towards enlightenment, before Nagasena himself met Menander at a venerable age.\n\nThe Milinda Panha therefore seems to relate the dialogue between a great Greek king, [[Menander I]], with a monk trained in Buddhism by the great Greek Buddhist elder Dharmaraksita, tending to suggest the importance of Greeks during the first formative centuries of Buddhism.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Greco-Buddhism]]\n*[[Greco-Buddhist monasticism]]\n\n==References==\n*\"The Edicts of King Asoka: An English Rendering\" by Ven.

(''Milinda Panha'', I, 35)}}\n\nThis event took place roughly a hundred years after the missionary efforts of Ashoka, and it would suggest that Dharmaraksita was a young man under Ashoka, became a respected elder settled in the Ashokan capital of [[Pataliputra]], and then trained a young [[Nagasena]] in the [[Tripi\u1e6daka]] and towards enlightenment, before Nagasena himself met Menander at a venerable age.\n\nThe Milinda Panha therefore seems to relate the dialogue between a great Greek king, [[Menander I]], with a monk trained in Buddhism by the great Greek Buddhist elder Dharmaraksita, tending to suggest the importance of Greeks during the first formative centuries of Buddhism.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Greco-Buddhism]]\n*[[Greco-Buddhist monasticism]]\n\n==References==\n*\"The Edicts of King Asoka: An English Rendering\" by Ven.

It is the sixth high school in [[Pitt County, North Carolina|Pitt County]]'s school system.\n\n==History==\nThe school was built on June 30, 2002 to ease the student load of [[Junius H. Rose High School|J.H. Rose]] and [[D. H. Conley High School|D.H. Conley]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. The entire project cost approximately $28 million. The school first Principal was Mr. Art Rouse and Assistant Principal was Mrs. Singleton. The rival high schools D.H. Conley and J.H. Rose and the feeder middle schools A.G. Cox and CM Eppes helped with the naming of the school. Many subdivisions in [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]] and Winterville fall in the districts for South Central High School, including: Westhaven, Cedar Ridge, Irish Creek, Starhill Farms, Signature Place, Ashley Meadows, Augusta Trails, Barefoot Landing, Barrington Fields, Baywood, Brook Hollow, Brighton Place and Canterbury.\n\n==Academics==\nSouth Central offers many classes that other schools do not, such as Japanese and Digital Photography.\n\n==Athletics and other extracurricular activities==\nSouth Central has a strong 4A athletic department, and are rivals with D.H. Conley. The sports department includes: Junior Varsity and [[Varsity team|Varsity]] teams of men's and women's basketball, soccer, tennis, swimming, cross country, track and field in addition to volleyball, wrestling, baseball, softball and cheerleading.
