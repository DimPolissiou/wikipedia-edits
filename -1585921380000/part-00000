His video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].\n\nIn 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for \"Best Long Form Music Video\" for another work with Madonna \u2013 directing \"The Confessions Tour\" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite

A [[Pro Bowl]] invitee in each of his ten NFL seasons and two-time [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year]], Sanders led the league in rushing yards four times and established himself as one of the most elusive runners in pro football with his quickness and agility.

He was awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]] as the most outstanding college player in the nation and was [[List of unanimous All-Americans in college football|unanimously recognized]] as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]]. Sanders was first inducted into the [[Kansas Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1998. He then was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2003 and in that same year inducted into the [[Michigan Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\nSanders joined the Lions in 1989 and had an immediate impact, winning the NFL's [[NFL Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award. Through ten seasons in Detroit, he averaged over 1,500 rushing yards per season and just under 100 rushing yards per game. In 1997, he became the third player to rush for over [[2,000-yard club|2,000 yards in a season]] and was named the [[NFL Most Valuable Player]]. Still seemingly in his prime, Sanders unexpectedly retired from football after the 1998 season, 1,457 yards short of breaking the then NFL's [[List of National Football League rushing yards leaders|all-time rushing record]]. His number 20 jersey was [[Retired number|retired]] by the Lions, and he was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2004. A year later Sanders was also inducted into the [[Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame]] along with fellow pro and college football hall of famer [[Thurman Thomas]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], Kansas, Sanders attended [[Wichita North High School]].<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sporthaven.com/players/barry-sanders/ |title=Barry Sanders Career Biography and Statistics |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2009 |website=SportHaven.com |publisher=Demand Media, Inc |accessdate=September 9, 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091208015848/http://www.sporthaven.com/players/barry-sanders| archivedate= December 8, 2009|url-status= dead}}</ref> Sanders started at tailback his sophomore year, but his brother Byron started before him in that position the following year. Sanders did not become the starting running back until the fourth game of his senior year. He rushed for 1,417 yards in the final seven games of the season, which earned him all-state honors. During that seven-game span, Sanders averaged 10.2 yards per carry, but he was overlooked by most college recruiters. Although he was a stellar athlete, Sanders received scholarship offers from only [[Emporia State University]], [[Iowa State University]], [[University of Tulsa]], and [[Oklahoma State University-Stillwater]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sanders |first1=Barry |last2=McCormick |first2=Mark E |others=Introduction by [[John Madden]] |title=Now you see him... his story in his own words |year=2003 |publisher=B.

During his first two years, he backed up [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] [[Thurman Thomas]]. In 1987, he led the nation in yards per kickoff return (31.6), while also rushing for over 600 yards and scoring 8 touchdowns. Thomas moved on to the NFL, and Sanders became the starter for his junior year.\n\nIn 1988, in what is considered one of the greatest individual seasons in college football history,<ref name=\"ESPN Page2\">{{cite news | first=Jeff | last=Merron | title=Best individual college football seasons | date= |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/collegefootball/seasons.html | work =ESPN.com | accessdate = July 14, 2017 | quote=The only serious question when composing this list was 'Who's No. 2?'}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Maisel|first1=Ivan|title=Great seasons are not created equal|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/theseason0804maisel/the-greatest-individual-seasons-college-football-history-not-created-equal|accessdate=July 14, 2017|work=ESPN.com|date=August 3, 2014}}</ref> Sanders led the nation by averaging 7.6 yards per carry and over 200 yards per game, including rushing for over 300 yards in four games. Despite his massive workload of 344 carries, Sanders was still used as the team's punt and kickoff returner, adding another 516 yards on special teams. He set college football season records with 2,628 yards rushing, 3,248 total yards, 234 points, 39 touchdowns, 37 rushing touchdowns, 5 consecutive 200 yard games, scored at least 2 touchdowns in 11 consecutive games, and 9 times he scored at least 3 touchdowns.

The Lions' management considered drafting another Sanders, cornerback [[Deion Sanders]], but Fontes convinced them to draft Barry instead. He was offered No. 20, which had been worn by former Lions greats [[Lem Barney]] and [[Billy Sims]]; Sims was one of the league's best running backs in the early 1980s, and Fontes had requested Sanders to wear the number in tribute to Sims.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rank|first=Adam|url=http://www.nfl.com/photoessays/0ap2000000325351/Throwback-Thursday---Wish-you-couldve-stayed|title=Throwback Thursday - Wish you could've stayed|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThough there were concerns about his size, it turned out these concerns were unfounded. Sanders was far too quick for defenders to hit solidly on a consistent basis, and too strong to bring down with arm tackles. Though short at 5'8\", his playing weight was 203&nbsp;lb (91&nbsp;kg) \u2013 the same as [[Walter Payton]], and only slightly under the NFL average for a running back. Furthermore, Sanders had unusual explosiveness, demonstrated by his ability to be competitive in the 1991 Footlocker slam dunk contest despite his short stature.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPu1OTwawDA| website= YouTube | title= Barry Sanders vs. Mike Powell dunk contest Foot Locker 1991 dunking slam fest| accessdate= July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Sanders missed his rookie year training camp due to a contract dispute. He ran for eighteen yards his first carry during the regular season,<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\"/> and scored a touchdown on his fourth. He finished the season second in the NFL in rushing yards and touchdowns after declining to go back into the regular season finale just 10 yards shy of the rushing title (later won by [[Christian Okoye]]), and won the [[National Football League Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref name='ESPN best rookies'>{{cite news| first=Jeff|last=Merron | title= LT best NFL rookie of all time |date= September 2003|publisher=ESPN |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/nflrookies.html | accessdate = August 12, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070816144913/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/nflrookies.html| archivedate= August 16, 2007| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSanders was the featured running back on the Lion teams that made the playoffs five times during the 1990s (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1997). He was a member of the 1991 and 1993 squads that won the [[NFC Central]] division title; the 1991 team won 12 regular season games (a franchise record).\n\nIn 1994, Sanders rushed for 1,883&nbsp;yards, on a 5.7 yards per carry average. He was also known as one of the most electrifying runners of all time. He also totaled 283 receiving yards, which gave him a combined 2,166&nbsp;yards from scrimmage for the season. In Week 11, a 14\u20139 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he broke the NFL record for most rushing yards in a single game without scoring a touchdown with 237.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199411130det.htm |title=Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Detroit Lions - November 13th, 1994 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=game&year_min=1950&year_max=2017&season_start=1&season_end=-1&pos=0&game_type=R&career_game_num_min=1&career_game_num_max=400&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&week_num_min=0&week_num_max=99&c1stat=rush_yds&c1comp=gt&c1val=200&c2stat=rush_td&c2comp=eq&c2val=0&c5val=1.0&order_by=rush_yds |title=Player Game Finder Query Results |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref> He was named the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year. In 1995, Sanders posted 1,500&nbsp;yards rushing with 398 receiving yards, beating his rushing total alone of the '94 season. In 1996, Sanders rushed for 1,553&nbsp;yards with a career-low 147 receiving yards.\n\nSanders' greatest season came in [[1997 NFL season|1997]] when he became a member of the [[2,000-yard club|2,000 rushing yards club]]. After a start in which he gained 53&nbsp;yards on 25 carries in the first two games of the season (though he passed [[Eric Dickerson]] as the active leader in career rushing yards), Sanders ran for an NFL record 14 consecutive 100 yard games, including two 200 yard performances, en route to rushing for 2,053&nbsp;yards. In reaching the 2,000&nbsp;yard plateau, he became only the third player to do so in a single season and the first since [[O. J. Simpson]] to rush for 2,000 yards in a span of 14 consecutive games. He was the first running back to rush for 1,500&nbsp;yards in five seasons and the only one to do it four consecutive years. At the end of the season, Sanders shared the Associated Press [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] with [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]].\n\nIn Sanders' last season in the NFL, 1998, he rushed for 1,491&nbsp;yards, ending his four-year streak of rushing for over 1,500&nbsp;yards in a season.\n\nDespite his individual success, the Lions never reached the [[Super Bowl]] while Sanders was with the team.<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\"/> The closest they came was in the [[1991 NFL season|1991 season]].<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\"/> Aided by Sanders' 1,855 combined rushing/receiving yards and 17 touchdowns during the season, they had a 12\u20134 record and went on to defeat the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u20136 in the [[1991\u201392 NFL playoffs#NFC: Detroit Lions 38, Dallas Cowboys 6|divisional playoffs]], which still stands as Detroit's only playoff victory since defeating the [[Cleveland Browns]] to win the [[1957 NFL Championship Game|1957 NFL Championship]]. The Lions lost to the [[Washington Redskins]] 41\u201310 in the [[1991\u201392 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Washington Redskins 41, Detroit Lions 10|NFC Championship Game]], and Sanders was held to 59 total yards in the game. (Like the Lions themselves, Sanders was often a disappointment at playoff time; in six post-season games, he rushed for only 386 yards\u2014and that included the 169 yards he rolled up against the Packers in the 1993 divisional playoff in which the Lions still lost. Against the same team the following year, Green Bay keyed on Sanders and held him to minus-1 yards rushing on thirteen carries; it was his worst game in a Lions uniform.)\n\nIn Sanders' career, he achieved Pro Bowl status in all ten of his NFL seasons.<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\"/> Sanders was named first team All-Pro six times from 1989\u20131991 and 1993, 1994 and 1997. He was also named second team All-Pro four times in 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1998. Sanders was also named All-[[National Football Conference|NFC]] from 1989\u201392 and 1994\u201397. Sanders was named Offensive Player of the Year in '94 and '97, NFL MVP in '97, and was named to the 1990s NFL All-Decade team.\n\nIn contrast to many of the star players of his era, Sanders was also noted<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20091208015848/http://www.sporthaven.com/players/barry-sanders</ref> for his on-field humility. Despite his flashy playing style, Sanders was rarely seen celebrating after the whistle was blown. Instead, he handed the ball to a referee or congratulated his teammates.\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:Barry Sanders 2019.jpg|thumb|Barry Sanders in 2019.]]\nOn July 27, 1999, Sanders announced he was retiring from pro football. His retirement was made public by faxing a letter to the ''[[Wichita Eagle]]'', his hometown newspaper.<ref>[ \"The Cheap Seats: Finally, Sanders Speaks\"] {{cite web |url=http://www.bleacherguy.com/2003/12/sanders_speaks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016112951/http://www.bleacherguy.com/2003/12/sanders_speaks.html |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}, December 3, 2003</ref> In the letter, Sanders wrote:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2019/07/22/barry-sanders-retirement-detroit-lions/1780256001/|title=20 years later, Barry Sanders 'not sure' he'd change 'clumsy' retirement|last=Monarrez|first=Carlos|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> <blockquote> \"Shortly after the end of last season, I felt that I probably would not return for the 1999\u20132000 season. I also felt that I should take as much time as possible to sort through my feelings and make sure that my feelings were back with conviction. Today, I officially declare my departure from the NFL.\"</blockquote>\n\nHe left football healthy, having gained 15,269 rushing yards (the highest total rushing yards ever by any NFL player in a 10-year span), 2,921 receiving yards, and 109 touchdowns (99 rushing and 10 receiving). He retired within striking distance of [[Walter Payton]]'s career rushing mark of 16,726 yards.\n\nSanders' retirement came somewhat unexpectedly and was a matter of controversy. Two years earlier, Sanders had renewed his contract with the Lions for $34.56 million over six years with an $11 million signing bonus. The Lions demanded that he return $5.5 million of the bonus. Sanders refused, and the Lions sued. On February 15, 2000, an arbitrator ruled that Sanders had to immediately repay $1,833,333.33 (a sixth of the bonus), with the remaining bonus to be repaid over each of the three years Sanders had left on the contract provided he stayed retired. Before the ruling, Sanders offered to pay back the entire $5.5 million in return for his release from the team. The Lions refused, stating they would welcome Sanders back to the team; otherwise, they would honor his announced retirement. Sanders' agent Lamont Smith lobbied the team to trade his client.\n\nIt was thought by some that Lions' head coach [[Bobby Ross]] himself may have actually been the reason for Sanders' early retirement, but in his autobiography ''Barry Sanders: Now You See Him'', Sanders praised Ross as a head coach who had nothing directly to do with his retirement. It was more his frustration with the management and direction of the Lions, and the resulting lack of success that likely contributed to the retirement, as Sanders revealed in his autobiography, \"My retirement letter didn't even hint at my frustration, because I didn't want to take shots at people as I left....Management had let quality players slip away. We'd been losing for years. Now we were right back where we were when I arrived.'\" He also wrote, \"A goal that I still hadn't realized was playing in the Super Bowl, and all of the statistical achievements didn't put the team any closer to playing in the big game.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSanders has since patched things up with the Lions and appeared, in an unofficial capacity, at Lions events. In 2017, he rejoined the Lions in a paid role as the team's ambassador.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2017/07/21/detroit-lions-barry-sanders-team-ambassador/500177001/|title=Barry Sanders returns to Lions as an ambassador|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>\n\n==NFL career statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\"|<center>Legend</center>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#cfecec; width:3em;\"| \n|Led the league\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFF00; width:3em;\"|\n| [[NFL MVP]] and [[Offensive Player of the Year]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFD700; width:3em;\"|\n| [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year]]\n|-\n| '''Bold'''\n|Career high\n|}\n{| class= \"wikitable\" float=\"left\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; width:45%;\"\n|-\n|! colspan=\"25\" style=\"background: #006DB0; border: 2px solid #C5C7CF; color: #FFFFFF;\" |<center>'''NFL statistics'''</center>\n|-\n! colspan=3|Season !! colspan=6|Rushing !! colspan=6|Receiving !! colspan=2|Fumbles\n|-\n!

He was awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]] as the most outstanding college player in the nation and was [[List of unanimous All-Americans in college football|unanimously recognized]] as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]]. Sanders was first inducted into the [[Kansas Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1998. He then was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2003 and in that same year inducted into the [[Michigan Sports Hall of Fame]].\n\nSanders joined the Lions in 1989 and had an immediate impact, winning the NFL's [[NFL Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award. Through ten seasons in Detroit, he averaged over 1,500 rushing yards per season and just under 100 rushing yards per game. In 1997, he became the third player to rush for over [[2,000-yard club|2,000 yards in a season]] and was named the [[NFL Most Valuable Player]]. Still seemingly in his prime, Sanders unexpectedly retired from football after the 1998 season, 1,457 yards short of breaking the then NFL's [[List of National Football League rushing yards leaders|all-time rushing record]]. His number 20 jersey was [[Retired number|retired]] by the Lions, and he was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2004. A year later Sanders was also inducted into the [[Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame]] along with fellow pro and college football hall of famer [[Thurman Thomas]].\n\n==Early years==\nBorn in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], Kansas, Sanders attended [[Wichita North High School]].<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sporthaven.com/players/barry-sanders/ |title=Barry Sanders Career Biography and Statistics |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2009 |website=SportHaven.com |publisher=Demand Media, Inc |accessdate=September 9, 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091208015848/http://www.sporthaven.com/players/barry-sanders| archivedate= December 8, 2009|url-status= dead}}</ref> Sanders started at tailback his sophomore year, but his brother Byron started before him in that position the following year.

During that seven-game span, Sanders averaged 10.2 yards per carry, but he was overlooked by most college recruiters.

In 1987, he led the nation in yards per kickoff return (31.6), while also rushing for over 600 yards and scoring 8 touchdowns.

He finished the season second in the NFL in rushing yards and touchdowns after declining to go back into the regular season finale just 10 yards shy of the rushing title (later won by [[Christian Okoye]]), and won the [[National Football League Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]].<ref name='ESPN best rookies'>{{cite news| first=Jeff|last=Merron | title= LT best NFL rookie of all time |date= September 2003|publisher=ESPN |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/nflrookies.html | accessdate = August 12, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070816144913/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/nflrookies.html| archivedate= August 16, 2007| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSanders was the featured running back on the Lion teams that made the playoffs five times during the 1990s (1991, 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1997). He was a member of the 1991 and 1993 squads that won the [[NFC Central]] division title; the 1991 team won 12 regular season games (a franchise record).\n\nIn 1994, Sanders rushed for 1,883&nbsp;yards, on a 5.7 yards per carry average. He was also known as one of the most electrifying runners of all time. He also totaled 283 receiving yards, which gave him a combined 2,166&nbsp;yards from scrimmage for the season. In Week 11, a 14\u20139 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he broke the NFL record for most rushing yards in a single game without scoring a touchdown with 237.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199411130det.htm |title=Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Detroit Lions - November 13th, 1994 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=game&year_min=1950&year_max=2017&season_start=1&season_end=-1&pos=0&game_type=R&career_game_num_min=1&career_game_num_max=400&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&week_num_min=0&week_num_max=99&c1stat=rush_yds&c1comp=gt&c1val=200&c2stat=rush_td&c2comp=eq&c2val=0&c5val=1.0&order_by=rush_yds |title=Player Game Finder Query Results |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=February 25, 2018}}</ref> He was named the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year. In 1995, Sanders posted 1,500&nbsp;yards rushing with 398 receiving yards, beating his rushing total alone of the '94 season. In 1996, Sanders rushed for 1,553&nbsp;yards with a career-low 147 receiving yards.\n\nSanders' greatest season came in [[1997 NFL season|1997]] when he became a member of the [[2,000-yard club|2,000 rushing yards club]]. After a start in which he gained 53&nbsp;yards on 25 carries in the first two games of the season (though he passed [[Eric Dickerson]] as the active leader in career rushing yards), Sanders ran for an NFL record 14 consecutive 100 yard games, including two 200 yard performances, en route to rushing for 2,053&nbsp;yards. In reaching the 2,000&nbsp;yard plateau, he became only the third player to do so in a single season and the first since [[O. J. Simpson]] to rush for 2,000 yards in a span of 14 consecutive games. He was the first running back to rush for 1,500&nbsp;yards in five seasons and the only one to do it four consecutive years. At the end of the season, Sanders shared the Associated Press [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|NFL Most Valuable Player Award]] with [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]].\n\nIn Sanders' last season in the NFL, 1998, he rushed for 1,491&nbsp;yards, ending his four-year streak of rushing for over 1,500&nbsp;yards in a season.\n\nDespite his individual success, the Lions never reached the [[Super Bowl]] while Sanders was with the team.<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\"/> The closest they came was in the [[1991 NFL season|1991 season]].<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\"/> Aided by Sanders' 1,855 combined rushing/receiving yards and 17 touchdowns during the season, they had a 12\u20134 record and went on to defeat the [[Dallas Cowboys]] 38\u20136 in the [[1991\u201392 NFL playoffs#NFC: Detroit Lions 38, Dallas Cowboys 6|divisional playoffs]], which still stands as Detroit's only playoff victory since defeating the [[Cleveland Browns]] to win the [[1957 NFL Championship Game|1957 NFL Championship]]. The Lions lost to the [[Washington Redskins]] 41\u201310 in the [[1991\u201392 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship: Washington Redskins 41, Detroit Lions 10|NFC Championship Game]], and Sanders was held to 59 total yards in the game. (Like the Lions themselves, Sanders was often a disappointment at playoff time; in six post-season games, he rushed for only 386 yards\u2014and that included the 169 yards he rolled up against the Packers in the 1993 divisional playoff in which the Lions still lost. Against the same team the following year, Green Bay keyed on Sanders and held him to minus-1 yards rushing on thirteen carries; it was his worst game in a Lions uniform.)\n\nIn Sanders' career, he achieved Pro Bowl status in all ten of his NFL seasons.<ref name=\"sporthaven.com\"/> Sanders was named first team All-Pro six times from 1989\u20131991 and 1993, 1994 and 1997. He was also named second team All-Pro four times in 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1998. Sanders was also named All-[[National Football Conference|NFC]] from 1989\u201392 and 1994\u201397. Sanders was named Offensive Player of the Year in '94 and '97, NFL MVP in '97, and was named to the 1990s NFL All-Decade team.\n\nIn contrast to many of the star players of his era, Sanders was also noted<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20091208015848/http://www.sporthaven.com/players/barry-sanders</ref> for his on-field humility. Despite his flashy playing style, Sanders was rarely seen celebrating after the whistle was blown. Instead, he handed the ball to a referee or congratulated his teammates.\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:Barry Sanders 2019.jpg|thumb|Barry Sanders in 2019.]]\nOn July 27, 1999, Sanders announced he was retiring from pro football. His retirement was made public by faxing a letter to the ''[[Wichita Eagle]]'', his hometown newspaper.<ref>[ \"The Cheap Seats: Finally, Sanders Speaks\"] {{cite web |url=http://www.bleacherguy.com/2003/12/sanders_speaks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016112951/http://www.bleacherguy.com/2003/12/sanders_speaks.html |archivedate=October 16, 2007 }}, December 3, 2003</ref> In the letter, Sanders wrote:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2019/07/22/barry-sanders-retirement-detroit-lions/1780256001/|title=20 years later, Barry Sanders 'not sure' he'd change 'clumsy' retirement|last=Monarrez|first=Carlos|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> <blockquote> \"Shortly after the end of last season, I felt that I probably would not return for the 1999\u20132000 season. I also felt that I should take as much time as possible to sort through my feelings and make sure that my feelings were back with conviction. Today, I officially declare my departure from the NFL.\"</blockquote>\n\nHe left football healthy, having gained 15,269 rushing yards (the highest total rushing yards ever by any NFL player in a 10-year span), 2,921 receiving yards, and 109 touchdowns (99 rushing and 10 receiving). He retired within striking distance of [[Walter Payton]]'s career rushing mark of 16,726 yards.\n\nSanders' retirement came somewhat unexpectedly and was a matter of controversy. Two years earlier, Sanders had renewed his contract with the Lions for $34.56 million over six years with an $11 million signing bonus. The Lions demanded that he return $5.5 million of the bonus. Sanders refused, and the Lions sued. On February 15, 2000, an arbitrator ruled that Sanders had to immediately repay $1,833,333.33 (a sixth of the bonus), with the remaining bonus to be repaid over each of the three years Sanders had left on the contract provided he stayed retired. Before the ruling, Sanders offered to pay back the entire $5.5 million in return for his release from the team. The Lions refused, stating they would welcome Sanders back to the team; otherwise, they would honor his announced retirement. Sanders' agent Lamont Smith lobbied the team to trade his client.\n\nIt was thought by some that Lions' head coach [[Bobby Ross]] himself may have actually been the reason for Sanders' early retirement, but in his autobiography ''Barry Sanders: Now You See Him'', Sanders praised Ross as a head coach who had nothing directly to do with his retirement. It was more his frustration with the management and direction of the Lions, and the resulting lack of success that likely contributed to the retirement, as Sanders revealed in his autobiography, \"My retirement letter didn't even hint at my frustration, because I didn't want to take shots at people as I left....Management had let quality players slip away. We'd been losing for years. Now we were right back where we were when I arrived.'\" He also wrote, \"A goal that I still hadn't realized was playing in the Super Bowl, and all of the statistical achievements didn't put the team any closer to playing in the big game.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSanders has since patched things up with the Lions and appeared, in an unofficial capacity, at Lions events. In 2017, he rejoined the Lions in a paid role as the team's ambassador.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2017/07/21/detroit-lions-barry-sanders-team-ambassador/500177001/|title=Barry Sanders returns to Lions as an ambassador|website=Detroit Free Press|language=en|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>\n\n==NFL career statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\"|<center>Legend</center>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#cfecec; width:3em;\"| \n|Led the league\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFFF00; width:3em;\"|\n| [[NFL MVP]] and [[Offensive Player of the Year]]\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FFD700; width:3em;\"|\n| [[NFL Offensive Player of the Year]]\n|-\n| '''Bold'''\n|Career high\n|}\n{| class= \"wikitable\" float=\"left\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center; width:45%;\"\n|-\n|! colspan=\"25\" style=\"background: #006DB0; border: 2px solid #C5C7CF; color: #FFFFFF;\" |<center>'''NFL statistics'''</center>\n|-\n! colspan=3|Season !! colspan=6|Rushing !! colspan=6|Receiving !! colspan=2|Fumbles\n|-\n!

The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows.

The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \"backdoors\" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]].

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J.

In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.
