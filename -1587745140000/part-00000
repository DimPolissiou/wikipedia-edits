According to the 2011 National Population Census, 67.5% of the population that lives in the Maleku official territory declared that they speak the language; however, the state of vitality varies from one village to another and even among families (S\u00e1nchez 2011). In any case, following the parameters of UNESCO, the language can be classified as definitively endangered (S\u00e1nchez 2013).\n\n==History==\nThe malekus (usually called \"Guatusos\" in historical documents, travel chronicles of the 19th and 20th centuries, and in multiple academic studies) constitute one of the original peoples of the Costa Rican territory. While their contact with the Hispanic language and culture was extremely sporadic and limited at least until the second mid-nineteenth century (Constenla, 1988; Castillo,2004), it can be assumed that this contact was intensified in the middle of the twentieth century. \n\n==Geographic distribution==\n\n'''Official status'''\nThe Maleku is an indigenous language of north-central [[Costa Rica]], in the area of Guatuso, in the province of Alajuela, Costa Rica. It is spoken by around 300 to 460 indigenous [[Mal\u00e9ku people]] in an area of 2994 hectares. The aboriginal group that speaks Mal\u00e9ku is also known as the ''Guatusos''. They live in three communities called Palenques in the northern area of Costa Rica: Margarita, Tonjibe and El Sol. According to Constenla (1998), the Guatuso is in a state of decline in Margarita (the largest village) and in a state of resistance in Tonjibe and El Sol. At the 2000 census, 71.1% of the members of the ethnic group declared themselves to speak the language, but only 49% considered it as the mother tongue.  The 2011 National Census of Population reported that 67.5% of the population in these communities speaks this language (Avenda\u00f1o 2018). The Ministry of Education (MEP, Minienciclopedia de los Territorios Ind\u00edgenas de Costa Rica 2017) reported a Mal\u00e9ku population of 498 inhabitants. According to this institution, children attending schools in the region of Guatuso receive bilingual instruction in Mal\u00e9ku and Spanish.  According to Espinoza Romero, Mej\u00eda Mar\u00edn & Ovares Barquero 2011, the school, traditionally an acculturation mechanism, has not contributed to strengthening the Mal\u00e9Ku identity. For instance, students receive instruction of core subjects in Spanish. They have to learn how to read and write in Spanish first. When they already read and write in the mainstream language, they can learn their language. The authors claim that the norm has been the teaching of the official language: Spanish and that despite the existence of educational policies that contemplate the revitalization of the use of indigenous languages in the region, there is an absence of strategies for teaching aboriginal languages.  \n\n'''Dialects/Varieties'''\n\nThe speakers of these three communities have declared that there are differences between the variety spoken by the communities of Margarita and El Sol and the one that is spoken by the people of Tonjibe (Avenda\u00f1o 2018). [[Corobic\u00ed language|Corobic\u00ed]] is possibly a dialect. \n\n=Phonology=\n\n'''Vowels''' \n\nMaleku has five vowels. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Vowels\n! colspan=\"2\" |front\n! colspan=\"2\" |central\n! colspan=\"2\" |back\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |unrounded\n! colspan=\"2\" |unrounded\n! colspan=\"2\" |rounded\n|-\n!\n!long\n!\n!long\n!\n!long\n|-\n|high\n|i\n|i\u02d0\n|\n|\n|u\n|u\u02d0\n|-\n|higher mid\n|e\n|e\u02d0\n|\n|\n|o\n|o\u02d0\n|-\n|low\n|\n|\n|a\n|a\u02d0\n|\n|\n|}\nSource: http://www.lapsyd.ddl.cnrs.fr/lapsyd/index.php?data=view&code=758\n\n'''Vowel notes:'''\n\nS\u00e1nchez (1984) affirms that the vowel system of the Maleku is similar to Spanish (apart from length contrast); he cites some words with unlike VV sequences but is unclear if these are single nuclei or V.V. \n\nSmith Sharp (1979) argues for V.V with an optional desyllabification of high vowels to approximants [w, j], in agreement with Costenla Uma\u00f1a (1983).\n\n'''Stress'''\n\nS\u00e1nchez (1984) argues that stress is contrastive.  The examples given suggest there may be role for morphological structure and vowel length in predicting stress placement. Smith Sharp (1979: 42) states \"En maleku, hay una sola oposici\u00f3n de acento. Cada palabra tiene por los menos un acento primario que no es predecible en palabras de dos o m\u00e1s s\u00edlabas.\"\n\n'''Consonants''' \n\nThe traditional consonant system of the Maleku includes fifteen phonemes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"5\" |Consonants \n! rowspan=\"2\" |bilabial\n! rowspan=\"2\" |dental\n! rowspan=\"2\" |alv\n! rowspan=\"2\" |pal-al\n! rowspan=\"2\" |velar\n|-\n!Airstream\n!Manners\n!ERA features\n!Secondary source\n!Voicing properties\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |pulm\n|stop\n|\n|\n| -vless\n|p\n|t\u032a\n|\n|\n|k\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |aff\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |sib\n| -vless\n|\n|\n|\n|\u1e6f\u0283\n|\n|-\n| -ved\n|\n|\n|\n|\u1e0f\u0292\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |fric\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n<br />\n\n|\n| -vless\n|\u0278\n|\n|\n|\n|x\n|-\n|sib\n| -vless\n|\n|\n|s\n|\n|\n|-\n|lat\n|\n| -vless\n|\n|\n|\u026c\n|\n|\n|-\n|nasal\n|\n|\n| -ved\n|\n|\n|n\n|\n|\n|-\n|trill\n|\n|\n| -ved\n|m\n|\n|r\n|\n|\u014b\n|-\n|tap/flat\n|\n<br />\n|\n|'''-ved'''\n|\n|\n|\u027e\n|\n|\n|-\n|appr\n|lat\n|\n|'''-ved'''\n|\n|\n|l\n|\n|\n|}\n\nSource: http://www.lapsyd.ddl.cnrs.fr/lapsyd/index.php?data=view&code=758\n\n\nConsonant notes:\n\nS\u00e1nchez (1984) reports /t/ as 'dental-alveolar' and other coronals as 'alveolar'.  Contrast between /\u026c, x/ appears to be in process of being lost in favor of /x/ (Costenla Uma\u00f1a 1983). Influence from Spanish has added voiced stops and /\u0272/ to the modern colloquial language; these are not included in the inventories of S\u00e1nchez (1984), Smith Sharp (1983) or in the text counts of Krohn (2017). Costenla Uma\u00f1a (1983) excludes them from his 'heritage inventory'.\n\nSyllabic notes:\n\n(C)V(\u02d0)(C) seems to be the basic pattern, with no clusters, as suggested by Smith Sharp (1983: 44).  Any C can occur in onset (except rhotics word-initially); any C except affricates, fricatives and /\u027e/ in coda.  S\u00e1nchez (1984) gives 2 examples of word-internal CC codas /r\u0278, rp/ in /irp-t\u0283ia, ir\u0278-la\u014b/ \"drink it, eat it\" and suggests CVCC as max syllable, but such examples are described as the result of an optional loss of a vowel in the 2nd person ergative prefix /ri\u0278a/ by Costenla Uma\u00f1a (1983: 18)\n\nCanonical Form:\n(C)V(\u02d0)(C)\n\t\nSyllabic Restriction:\n(C)V(\u02d0)(C)\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n=== Word order ===\nThe basic order of the elements is variable in transitive and in intransitive clauses. In intransitive clauses the common order is SV, but it is also possible to find VS order.\n\nFor example:  T\u00f3   na- t\u00f3ye\n\nYo  1E    ir  \n\nI      go \n\n=== Subjects and objects ===\nMaleku possesses an ergative\u2013absolutive actancial system. \n\n==== Subject of an intransitive verb ====\nIn intransitive clauses the subject is expressed in absolutive case. The affixes that  appear in the verb establish a concordance of the person with the subject. These are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+intransitive clauses \n!1 person \n!2 person\n!3 person\n|-\n|na\n| -mi, -ma\n| -i, -a\n|}\n\n==== Subject of a transitive verb ====\nIn transitive clauses Maleku distinguishes between complete  and incomplete  transitive clauses. The affixes that  appear in the verb are common in both constructions.

According to the 2011 National Population Census, 67.5% of the population that lives in the Maleku official territory declared that they speak the language; however, the state of vitality varies from one village to another and even among families (S\u00e1nchez 2011). In any case, following the parameters of UNESCO, the language can be classified as definitively endangered (S\u00e1nchez 2013).\n\n==History==\nThe malekus (usually called \"Guatusos\" in historical documents, travel chronicles of the 19th and 20th centuries, and in multiple academic studies) constitute one of the original peoples of the Costa Rican territory. While their contact with the Hispanic language and culture was extremely sporadic and limited at least until the second mid-nineteenth century (Constenla, 1988; Castillo,2004), it can be assumed that this contact was intensified in the middle of the twentieth century. \n\n==Geographic distribution==\n\n'''Official status'''\nThe Maleku is an indigenous language of north-central [[Costa Rica]], in the area of Guatuso, in the province of Alajuela, Costa Rica. It is spoken by around 300 to 460 indigenous [[Mal\u00e9ku people]] in an area of 2994 hectares. The aboriginal group that speaks Mal\u00e9ku is also known as the ''Guatusos''. They live in three communities called Palenques in the northern area of Costa Rica: Margarita, Tonjibe and El Sol. According to Constenla (1998), the Guatuso is in a state of decline in Margarita (the largest village) and in a state of resistance in Tonjibe and El Sol. At the 2000 census, 71.1% of the members of the ethnic group declared themselves to speak the language, but only 49% considered it as the mother tongue.  The 2011 National Census of Population reported that 67.5% of the population in these communities speaks this language (Avenda\u00f1o 2018). The Ministry of Education (MEP, Minienciclopedia de los Territorios Ind\u00edgenas de Costa Rica 2017) reported a Mal\u00e9ku population of 498 inhabitants. According to this institution, children attending schools in the region of Guatuso receive bilingual instruction in Mal\u00e9ku and Spanish.  According to Espinoza Romero, Mej\u00eda Mar\u00edn & Ovares Barquero 2011, the school, traditionally an acculturation mechanism, has not contributed to strengthening the Mal\u00e9Ku identity. For instance, students receive instruction of core subjects in Spanish. They have to learn how to read and write in Spanish first. When they already read and write in the mainstream language, they can learn their language. The authors claim that the norm has been the teaching of the official language: Spanish and that despite the existence of educational policies that contemplate the revitalization of the use of indigenous languages in the region, there is an absence of strategies for teaching aboriginal languages.  \n\n'''Dialects/Varieties'''\n\nThe speakers of these three communities have declared that there are differences between the variety spoken by the communities of Margarita and El Sol and the one that is spoken by the people of Tonjibe (Avenda\u00f1o 2018). [[Corobic\u00ed language|Corobic\u00ed]] is possibly a dialect. \n\n=Phonology=\n\n'''Vowels''' \n\nMaleku has five vowels. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Vowels\n! colspan=\"2\" |front\n! colspan=\"2\" |central\n! colspan=\"2\" |back\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |unrounded\n! colspan=\"2\" |unrounded\n! colspan=\"2\" |rounded\n|-\n!\n!long\n!\n!long\n!\n!long\n|-\n|high\n|i\n|i\u02d0\n|\n|\n|u\n|u\u02d0\n|-\n|higher mid\n|e\n|e\u02d0\n|\n|\n|o\n|o\u02d0\n|-\n|low\n|\n|\n|a\n|a\u02d0\n|\n|\n|}\nSource: http://www.lapsyd.ddl.cnrs.fr/lapsyd/index.php?data=view&code=758\n\n'''Vowel notes:'''\n\nS\u00e1nchez (1984) affirms that the vowel system of the Maleku is similar to Spanish (apart from length contrast); he cites some words with unlike VV sequences but is unclear if these are single nuclei or V.V. \n\nSmith Sharp (1979) argues for V.V with an optional desyllabification of high vowels to approximants [w, j], in agreement with Costenla Uma\u00f1a (1983).\n\n'''Stress'''\n\nS\u00e1nchez (1984) argues that stress is contrastive.  The examples given suggest there may be role for morphological structure and vowel length in predicting stress placement. Smith Sharp (1979: 42) states \"En maleku, hay una sola oposici\u00f3n de acento. Cada palabra tiene por los menos un acento primario que no es predecible en palabras de dos o m\u00e1s s\u00edlabas.\"\n\n'''Consonants''' \n\nThe traditional consonant system of the Maleku includes fifteen phonemes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"5\" |Consonants \n! rowspan=\"2\" |bilabial\n! rowspan=\"2\" |dental\n! rowspan=\"2\" |alv\n! rowspan=\"2\" |pal-al\n! rowspan=\"2\" |velar\n|-\n!Airstream\n!Manners\n!ERA features\n!Secondary source\n!Voicing properties\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |pulm\n|stop\n|\n|\n| -vless\n|p\n|t\u032a\n|\n|\n|k\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |aff\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" |sib\n| -vless\n|\n|\n|\n|\u1e6f\u0283\n|\n|-\n| -ved\n|\n|\n|\n|\u1e0f\u0292\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |fric\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n<br />\n\n|\n| -vless\n|\u0278\n|\n|\n|\n|x\n|-\n|sib\n| -vless\n|\n|\n|s\n|\n|\n|-\n|lat\n|\n| -vless\n|\n|\n|\u026c\n|\n|\n|-\n|nasal\n|\n|\n| -ved\n|\n|\n|n\n|\n|\n|-\n|trill\n|\n|\n| -ved\n|m\n|\n|r\n|\n|\u014b\n|-\n|tap/flat\n|\n<br />\n|\n|'''-ved'''\n|\n|\n|\u027e\n|\n|\n|-\n|appr\n|lat\n|\n|'''-ved'''\n|\n|\n|l\n|\n|\n|}\n\nSource: http://www.lapsyd.ddl.cnrs.fr/lapsyd/index.php?data=view&code=758\n\n\nConsonant notes:\n\nS\u00e1nchez (1984) reports /t/ as 'dental-alveolar' and other coronals as 'alveolar'.  Contrast between /\u026c, x/ appears to be in process of being lost in favor of /x/ (Costenla Uma\u00f1a 1983). Influence from Spanish has added voiced stops and /\u0272/ to the modern colloquial language; these are not included in the inventories of S\u00e1nchez (1984), Smith Sharp (1983) or in the text counts of Krohn (2017). Costenla Uma\u00f1a (1983) excludes them from his 'heritage inventory'.\n\nSyllabic notes:\n\n(C)V(\u02d0)(C) seems to be the basic pattern, with no clusters, as suggested by Smith Sharp (1983: 44).  Any C can occur in onset (except rhotics word-initially); any C except affricates, fricatives and /\u027e/ in coda.  S\u00e1nchez (1984) gives 2 examples of word-internal CC codas /r\u0278, rp/ in /irp-t\u0283ia, ir\u0278-la\u014b/ \"drink it, eat it\" and suggests CVCC as max syllable, but such examples are described as the result of an optional loss of a vowel in the 2nd person ergative prefix /ri\u0278a/ by Costenla Uma\u00f1a (1983: 18)\n\nCanonical Form:\n(C)V(\u02d0)(C)\n\t\nSyllabic Restriction:\n(C)V(\u02d0)(C)\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n=== Word order ===\nThe basic order of the elements is variable in transitive and in intransitive clauses. In intransitive clauses the common order is SV, but it is also possible to find VS order.\n\nFor example:  T\u00f3   na- t\u00f3ye\n\nYo  1E    ir  \n\nI      go \n\n=== Subjects and objects ===\nMaleku posses an ergative\u2013absolutive actancial system. \n\n==== Subject of an intransitive verb ====\nIn intransitive clauses the subject is expressed in absolutive case. The affixes that  appear in the verb establish a concordance of the person with the subject. These are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+intransitive clauses \n!1 person \n!2 person\n!3 person\n|-\n|na\n| -mi, -ma\n| -i, -a\n|}\n\n==== Subject of a transitive verb ====\nIn transitive clauses Maleku distinguishes between complete  and incomplete  transitive clauses. The affixes that  appear in the verb are common in both constructions. These are \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+transitive clauses \n!1 person \n!2 person\n!3 person\n|-\n| -rra\n| -rrifa\n-rrif\n\n-rrf\n\n-rrip\n\n-rrfa\n\n-rrp\n<br />\n| -rri\n|}\n\n==== Number ====\nMaleku distinguishes between singular and plural in common nouns. The plural is expressed in two ways.\n{|\n!\n!Example                          \n!Translation\n|-\n|'''duplicate noun'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |toc\u00f3            \u2192car\u00fa                 ear\ntoc\u00f3toc\u00f3     \u2192 car\u00facar\u00fa         ears\n\n\n\n<br />\n|-\n|'''plural modifier \"mar\u00e1ma\"'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |yuqu\u00ed                        \u2192     bowie knife           \nyuqu\u00ed   mar\u00e1ma        \u2192     bowie knives      \n\nnalhac\u00e1                    \u2192      brother\n\nnalhac\u00e1    mar\u00e1ma  \u2192       brothers\n<br />\n|}\n<br />\n\n=== Personal pronouns ===\nThere are four personal pronouns in Maleku.

He began his career as a stand-up comedian, first entering the national spotlight when he was featured on [[Billy Crystal]]'s first cable TV special. He went on to become a series regular on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]''. He made numerous guest appearances on a variety of television shows, such as ''[[Cheers]]''. His film credits include ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'', ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]'', ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]'', ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'', ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', and ''[[Trial and Error (1997 film)|Trial and Error]]'', one of his few starring roles.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1998, he played [[Cosmo Kramer]] on the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', receiving the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] three times. During the run of ''Seinfeld'', he made a guest appearance in ''[[Mad About You]]''. After ''Seinfeld'', Richards starred in his own sitcom, ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', which lasted less than one full season.\n\nWhen ''Seinfeld'' ended in 1998, Richards returned to stand-up comedy. He incited media furor while performing at the [[Laugh Factory]] comedy club in late 2006 after a cell phone video was published of him launching into an expletive-laced racist tirade after earlier interruptions from a group of late-arriving audience members.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/20/kramers-racist-tirade-caught-on-tape|title=\"Kramer's\" Racist Tirade \u2013 Caught on Tape|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=TMZ.com|year=2006|author=TMZ Staff|work=In The Zone}}</ref> Subsequently, due to significant media coverage of the event, Richards announced his retirement from stand-up early in 2007. He appeared as himself in the [[Curb Your Enthusiasm Season 7|seventh season]] of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'' in 2009, acting alongside his fellow cast members for the first time since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|finale]], as well as lampooning his incident at the Laugh Factory.

In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' television show, where [[Larry David]] was a writer. This included a famous instance in which guest [[Andy Kaufman]] refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the [[cue card]]s on screen to Kaufman, causing him to throw his drink into Richards's face before a small riot ensued (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke).<ref name=\"fac\">[http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript] via [[First Amendment Center]], Recorded February 28, 2002, in Aspen, Colorado {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331131924/http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref> The film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' featured a re-enactment of the [[Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident|Andy Kaufman incident]] in which Richards was portrayed by actor [[Norm Macdonald]] (although he is never referred to by name so he could be seen as a composite character taking the place of Richards).<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|title=Michael Richards \u2013 First Amendment Center \u2013 news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition|publisher=|access-date=August 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808113050/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Richards had a supporting role in [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s comedy film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, Richards also appeared in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (as an unscrupulous [[bookie]]), ''[[Cheers]]'' (as a character trying to collect on an old bet with [[Sam Malone]]), and made several guest appearances with [[Jay Leno]] as an accident-prone fitness expert.\n\nAccording to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' as a procedural police comedy with an [[Inspector Clouseau]]-like character suffering from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. Hoberman said ABC wanted Richards to play [[Adrian Monk]], but he turned it down.<ref>from \"Mr Monk and His Origins,\" a special feature packaged with the Season One DVDs.</ref>\n\n=== ''Seinfeld'' ===\n[[File:Michael Richards Jerry Seinfeld.jpg|thumb|Richards with [[Jerry Seinfeld]] at the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 1989, he was cast as [[Cosmo Kramer]] in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which was created by fellow ''Fridays'' cast member [[Larry David]] and comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s, the show had become one of the most popular [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] in television history. The series ended its nine-year run in 1998 at #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. In the setting of ''Seinfeld'', Kramer is usually referred to by his last name only and is the neighbor of the show's [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|eponymous character]]. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode \"[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]\".\n\nRichards won more Emmys than any other cast member on ''Seinfeld''. He took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994 and 1997.\n\nStarting in 2004, he and his fellow ''Seinfeld'' cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the ''Seinfeld'' DVDs, but Richards stopped providing audio commentary after Season{{nbsp}}5 though he continued to provide interviews.\n\n=== ''The Michael Richards Show'' ===\nIn 2000, after the end of ''Seinfeld'', Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s finale. ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', for which the actor received co-writer and co-[[Television producer|executive producer]] credits, was originally conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. However, after the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was cancelled.\n\n===2006 Laugh Factory incident ===\nDuring a performance on November 17, 2006, at the [[Laugh Factory]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Richards launched into a [[racism|racist]] rant in response to reported heckling and interruptions from a small group of black audience members. Richards was recorded shouting \"He's a [[nigger]]!\" several times and making references to [[lynching]] and the [[Jim Crow]] era.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\"/><ref name=\"Vibe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231201005/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archivedate=December 31, 2006|title=Comedian Michael \"Kramer\" Richards Goes into Racial Tirade, Banned From Laugh Factory|accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=[[VIBE]].com|year=2006|author=Mariel Concepci\u00f3n|work=News wire}}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100242.html |title=\"Seinfeld\" Comic Richards Apologizes for Racial Rant |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= November 21, 2006|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref><ref name=\"Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/richards-deeply-deeply-sorry-for-racial-slurs-1.618610|title=Richards 'deeply, deeply sorry' for racial slurs|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=CBC arts | date=November 20, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters-2006\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2006/11/20/us-richards-idUSN2041340020061120|title=\"Seinfeld\" Star Richards Under Fire For Racial Outburst|accessdate=2013-06-28|publisher=Reuters|work=News wire|date=November 20, 2006}}</ref> <!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: SEE REMARKS ABOVE THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ABOUT CONSENSUS ON THE LAUGH FACTORY INCIDENT, AS IN TALK ARCHIVE 2.

He incited media furor while performing at the [[Laugh Factory]] comedy club in late 2006 after a cell phone video was published of him launching into an expletive-laced racist tirade after earlier interruptions from a group of late-arriving audience members.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/20/kramers-racist-tirade-caught-on-tape|title=\"Kramer's\" Racist Tirade \u2013 Caught on Tape|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=TMZ.com|year=2006|author=TMZ Staff|work=In The Zone}}</ref> Subsequently, due to significant media coverage of the event he announced his retirement from stand-up early in 2007.

In 1980, he began as one of the cast members on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' television show, where [[Larry David]] was a writer. This included a famous instance in which guest [[Andy Kaufman]] refused to deliver his scripted lines, leading Richards to bring the [[cue card]]s on screen to Kaufman, causing him to throw his drink into Richards's face before a small riot ensued (Richards later claimed he was in on the joke).<ref name=\"fac\">[http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 Michael Richards 'Speaking Freely' transcript] via [[First Amendment Center]], Recorded February 28, 2002, in Aspen, Colorado {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331131924/http://archive.firstamendmentcenter.org/about.aspx?id=12083 |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref> The film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' featured a re-enactment of the [[Fridays (TV series)#Andy Kaufman incident|Andy Kaufman incident]] in which Richards was portrayed by actor [[Norm Macdonald]] (although he is never referred to by name so he could be seen as a composite character taking the place of Richards).<ref>{{cite video|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/544255131b|title=Andy Kaufman on Fridays from FridaysFan|publisher=Funnyordie.com|date=February 11, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|title=Michael Richards \u2013 First Amendment Center \u2013 news, commentary, analysis on free speech, press, religion, assembly, petition|publisher=|access-date=August 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808113050/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/michael-richards-2|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Richards had a supporting role in [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s comedy film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' as janitor Stanley Spadowski. On television, Richards also appeared in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (as an unscrupulous [[bookie]]), ''[[Cheers]]'' (as a character trying to collect on an old bet with [[Sam Malone]]), and made several guest appearances with [[Jay Leno]] as an accident-prone fitness expert.\n\nAccording to an interview with executive producer David Hoberman, ABC first conceived the series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' as a procedural police comedy with an [[Inspector Clouseau]]-like character suffering from [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder]]. Hoberman said ABC wanted Richards to play [[Adrian Monk]], but he turned it down.<ref>from \"Mr Monk and His Origins,\" a special feature packaged with the Season One DVDs.</ref>\n\n=== ''Seinfeld'' ===\n[[File:Michael Richards Jerry Seinfeld.jpg|thumb|Richards with [[Jerry Seinfeld]] at the [[44th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 1992]]\n\nIn 1989, he was cast as [[Cosmo Kramer]] in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which was created by fellow ''Fridays'' cast member [[Larry David]] and comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. Although it got off to a slow start, by the mid-1990s, the show had become one of the most popular [[Situation comedy|sitcoms]] in television history. The series ended its nine-year run in 1998 at #1 in the [[Nielsen ratings]]. In the setting of ''Seinfeld'', Kramer is usually referred to by his last name only and is the neighbor of the show's [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|eponymous character]]. Kramer's first name, Cosmo, was revealed in the sixth-season episode \"[[The Switch (Seinfeld)|The Switch]]\".\n\nRichards won more Emmys than any other cast member on ''Seinfeld''. He took home the award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1993, 1994 and 1997.\n\nStarting in 2004, he and his fellow ''Seinfeld'' cast members provided interviews and audio commentaries for the ''Seinfeld'' DVDs, but Richards stopped providing audio commentary after Season{{nbsp}}5 though he continued to provide interviews.\n\n=== ''The Michael Richards Show'' ===\nIn 2000, after the end of ''Seinfeld'', Richards began work on a new series for NBC, his first major project since ''Seinfeld''{{'}}s finale. ''[[The Michael Richards Show]]'', for which the actor received co-writer and co-[[Television producer|executive producer]] credits, was originally conceived as a comedy/mystery starring Richards as a bumbling private investigator. However, after the first pilot failed with test audiences, NBC ordered that the show be retooled into a more conventional, office-based sitcom before its premiere. After a few weeks of poor ratings and negative reviews, it was cancelled.\n\n===2006 Laugh Factory incident ===\nDuring a performance on November 17, 2006, at the [[Laugh Factory]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], Richards launched into a [[racism|racist]] rant in response to reported heckling and interruptions from a small group of black audience members. Richards was recorded shouting \"He's a [[nigger]]!\" several times and making references to [[lynching]] and the [[Jim Crow]] era.<ref name=\"TMZ-2006\"/><ref name=\"Vibe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231201005/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/11/comedian_michael_kramer_richards_goes_into_racial_tirade/|archivedate=December 31, 2006|title=Comedian Michael \"Kramer\" Richards Goes into Racial Tirade, Banned From Laugh Factory|accessdate=2006-11-21|publisher=[[VIBE]].com|year=2006|author=Mariel Concepci\u00f3n|work=News wire}}</ref><ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112100242.html |title=\"Seinfeld\" Comic Richards Apologizes for Racial Rant |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= November 21, 2006|accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref><ref name=\"Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/richards-deeply-deeply-sorry-for-racial-slurs-1.618610|title=Richards 'deeply, deeply sorry' for racial slurs|accessdate=2006-11-20|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=CBC arts | date=November 20, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Reuters-2006\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2006/11/20/us-richards-idUSN2041340020061120|title=\"Seinfeld\" Star Richards Under Fire For Racial Outburst|accessdate=2013-06-28|publisher=Reuters|work=News wire|date=November 20, 2006}}</ref> <!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: SEE REMARKS ABOVE THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH ABOUT CONSENSUS ON THE LAUGH FACTORY INCIDENT, AS IN TALK ARCHIVE 2.

The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not under Protection of Public Health Act by the Ministry of Health alone. Both the curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March respectively, however then they were replaced by Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards.

As such, ZiffNet was an expansion on an earlier online service called PCMagNet for readers of [[PC Magazine]].

There are two commonly used methods of using ellipses: one uses three dots for any omission, while the second one makes a distinction between omissions within a sentence (using three dots:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) and omissions between sentences (using a period and a space followed by three dots:&nbsp;.&nbsp;...).\n\nThe [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) used to indicate that an ellipsis must include spaces before and after each dot in all uses. If an ellipsis is meant to represent an omission, [[square bracket]]s must surround the ellipsis to make it clear that there was no pause in the original quote: [&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;]. Currently, the MLA has removed the requirement of brackets in its style handbooks. However, some maintain that the use of brackets is still correct because it clears confusion.<ref>, Fowler, H. Ramsey, Jane E. Aaron, Murray McArthur. ''The Little, Brown Handbook''. Fourth Canadian Edition. [[Toronto]]: [[Longman|Pearson Longman]]. 2005. p. 440.</ref>\n\nThe MLA now indicates that a three-dot, spaced ellipsis (&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) should be used for removing material from within one sentence within a quote. When crossing sentences (when the omitted text contains a period, so that omitting the end of a sentence counts), a four-dot, spaced (except for before the first dot) ellipsis (.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) should be used. When ellipsis points are used in the original text, ellipsis points that are not in the original text should be distinguished by enclosing them in square brackets (e.g. \"text [\u2026] text\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uhv.edu/student-success-center/resources/e-p/ellipsis-use-in-mla-style/|last=Jones|first=Karalyn|title=Using Ellipsis in MLA Style|institution=[[University of Houston\u2013Victoria]]|year=2009|access-date=2018-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140911/https://www.uhv.edu/student-success-center/resources/e-p/ellipsis-use-in-mla-style/|archive-date=2018-06-12|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://naropa.edu/documents/programs/jks/naropa-writing-center/citation-comparison.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804045039/http://naropa.edu/documents/programs/jks/naropa-writing-center/citation-comparison.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the ellipsis should be used to condense quotations. It is less commonly used to indicate a pause in speech or an unfinished thought or to separate items in material such as show business gossip. The stylebook indicates that if the shortened sentence before the mark can stand as a sentence, it should do so, with an ellipsis placed after the period or other ending punctuation. When the material is omitted at the end of a paragraph and also immediately following it, an ellipsis goes both at the end of that paragraph and at the beginning of the next, according to this style.<ref>Goldstein, Norm, editor. \"Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law\". 2005. pp.328\u2013329.</ref>\n\nAccording to Robert Bringhurst's ''[[Elements of Typographic Style]]'', the details of typesetting ellipses depend on the character and size of the font being set and the typographer's preference. Bringhurst writes that a full space between each dot is \"another Victorian eccentricity. In most contexts, the Chicago ellipsis is much too wide\"\u2014he recommends using flush dots (with a normal word space before and after), or [[thin space|''thin''-spaced]] dots (up to one-fifth of an [[em (typography)|em]]), or the prefabricated ellipsis character {{unichar|2026|HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS|html=}}. Bringhurst suggests that normally an ellipsis should be spaced fore-and-aft to separate it from the text, but when it combines with other punctuation, the leading space disappears and the other punctuation follows. This is the usual practice in typesetting. He provides the following examples:\n\n{| summary=\"six examples of setting ellipsis\" style=\"margin-left:3em;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | i&nbsp;... j\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | k....\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | l..., l\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | l,&nbsp;... l\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | m...?\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | n...!\n|}\n\nIn legal writing in the United States, Rule 5.3 in the ''[[Bluebook]]'' citation guide governs the use of ellipses and requires a space before the first dot and between the two subsequent dots. If an ellipsis ends the sentence, then there are three dots, each separated by a space, followed by the final punctuation (e.g. Hah . . . ?). In some legal writing, an ellipsis is written as three [[asterisk]]s (*** or *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*) to make it obvious that text has been omitted.\n(...) is also used for awkward silence.\n\n===In British English===\n\n''The [[Hart's Rules|Oxford Style Guide]]'' recommends setting the ellipsis as a single character (\u2026) or as a series of three (narrow) spaced dots (.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.), and surrounding it by spaces. If there is an ellipsis at the end of an incomplete sentence, the final full stop is omitted. However, it is retained if the following ellipsis represents an omission between two complete sentences.<ref>''New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide''. 2nd ed.

The word ''wielokropek'' distinguishes the ellipsis of Polish syntax from that of [[mathematical notation]], in which it is known as an {{lang|pl|elipsa}}.\n\nWhen an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech.\n\nThe syntactical rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska Norma document [[PN-83/P-55366]], {{lang|pl|Zasady sk\u0142adania tekst\u00f3w w j\u0119zyku polskim}} (\"Rules for setting texts in the Polish Language\").\n\n===In Russian===\nThe combination \"ellipsis+period\" is replaced by the ellipsis. The combinations \"ellipsis+exclamation mark\" and \"ellipsis+question mark\" are written in this way: !.. ?...\n\n===In Japanese===\nThe most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 (\"''3''-dot leaders\", {{lang|ja|\u2026}}). 2-ten r\u012bd\u0101 exists as a character, but it is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six dots (two ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 characters, {{lang|ja|\u2026\u2026}}). Three dots (one ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header. However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text height (between the [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the ascent line), as in the standard Japanese [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced \"{{lang|ja-Latn|ten}}\", the dots are colloquially called \"{{lang|ja-Latn|ten-ten-ten}}\" ({{lang|ja|\u3066\u3093\u3066\u3093\u3066\u3093}}, akin to the English \"dot dot dot\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/20170605/geo17060514190023-n1.html |title=\u79cb\u5143\u9806\u5b50\u3001\u53e4\u5e0c\u306b\u5f97\u610f\u306e\u30c0\u30b8\u30e3\u30ec\u3000\u300c\u3042\u307e\u308a\"\u30b3\u30ad\"\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u300d |date=2017-06-05 |website=SANSPO.COM |publisher=SANKEI DIGITAL Inc. |access-date=2018-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190309024932/https://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/20170605/geo17060514190023-n1.html |archive-date=2019-03-09 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn-text in Japanese media, such as in [[manga]] or video games, ellipses are much more frequent than in English and are often changed to another punctuation sign in translation. The ellipsis by itself represents speechlessness, or a \"[[pregnant pause]]\". Depending on the context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an expression of being dumbfounded at another person's words or actions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mandelin |first1=Clyde |title=Legends of Localization: How Japanese Ellipsis Usage Compares with English |url=https://legendsoflocalization.com/qa-japanese-ellipsis-usage-and-english-translation/ |website=Legends of Localization |accessdate=14 December 2018 |language=en |date=8 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164227/https://legendsoflocalization.com/qa-japanese-ellipsis-usage-and-english-translation/ |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As a device, the ''ten-ten-ten'' is intended to focus the reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative \"camera\" on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects \"speaking\" the ellipsis.\n\n===In Chinese===\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters) (i.e. <span lang=\"zh\">......</span>).<ref>[[:zh-tw:\u7701\u7565\u53f7|\u7701\u7565\u53f7]]</ref>\n\n===In Spanish===\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute for ''[[et cetera]]'' at the end of unfinished lists. So it means \"and so forth\" or \"and other things\".\n\nAnother use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the complete use of expletives.\n\nWhen the ellipsis is placed alone into a [[Bracket|parenthesis]] (...) or\u2014less often\u2014between [[bracket]]s [...], which is what happens usually within a text [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], it means the original text had more contents on the same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription. When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text, the ellipsis does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.\n\nThe number of dots is three and only three.<ref>{{cite web |title=Puntos suspensivos |url=http://lema.rae.es/dpd?id=c5GublcDAD6kWvCUUy |website=RAE |access-date=2019-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122094659/http://lema.rae.es/dpd/?id=c5GublcDAD6kWvCUUy |archive-date=2019-01-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===In French===\nIn [[French language|French]], the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to represent ''et cetera''. In French typography, the ellipsis is written close up to the preceding word but has space after it, for example: ''come \u00e7a\u2026 pas comme Ceci''. If, exceptionally, it begins a sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: ''Lui ? \u2026 vaut rien, Je crois\u2026 ''.\n\nHowever, any omitted word, phrase, or line at the end of a quoted passage would be indicated like this: [...] (space before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example: '' \u2026 \u00e0 Paris, Nice, Nantes, Toulouse [\u2026] ''.\n\n===In German===\nIn [[German language|German]], the ellipsis, in general, is surrounded by spaces, if it stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side, there is no space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the written letter or letters.\n\nExample for both cases, using German-style: ''The first el\u2026is stands for omitted letters, the second \u2026 for an omitted word.''\n\nIf the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is omitted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rechtschreibrat.com/DOX/rfdr_regeln_inkl_Nachtraegen.pdf |title=Deutsche Rechtschreibung.

This usage may alternatively be described as a \"More button\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://medium.com/@jsaito/the-mighty-ellipsis-6c2c00ddc864 |title=The Mighty Ellipsis - How 3 little dots can say so much|access-date=2019-11-06 |url-status=live |date=2016-09-06}}</ref> (see also [[hamburger button]] signifying completely hidden options).\n\nIn mobile, web, and general application design, the vertical ellipses \u22ee are sometimes used as an interface element, where it is sometimes called a kebab icon. The element typically indicates that a navigation menu can be accessed when the element is activated.\n\n==In mathematical notation==\nAn ellipsis is also often used in [[mathematics]] to mean \"and so forth\". In a list, between commas, or following a comma, a normal ellipsis is used, as in:\n\n: <math>1,2,3,\\ldots,100</math>\n\nor to mean an infinite list, as:\n\n: <math>1,2,3,\\ldots</math>\n\nTo indicate the omission of values in a repeated operation, an ellipsis raised to the center of the line is used between two operation symbols or following the last operation symbol, as in:\n\n: <math>1+2+3+\\cdots+100</math>\n\nSometimes, e.g. in Russian mathematical texts, normal, non-raised, ellipses are used even in repeated summations.<ref>\u041c\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u042d.

In a type constraint expression like <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511)</code> an ellipsis is used to separate the extension root from extension additions. The definition of type A in version 1 system of the form <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ...)</code> and the definition of type A in version 2 system of the form <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511)</code> constitute an extension series of the same type A in different versions of the same specification. The ellipsis can also be used in compound type definitions to separate the set of fields belonging to the extension root from the set of fields constituting extension additions. Here is an example: <code>B ::= SEQUENCE { {{not a typo|a}} INTEGER, b INTEGER, ..., c INTEGER }</code> <!-- Is the s.n. ellipsis defined as a \"...\" trigraph or something else?

There are two commonly used methods of using ellipses: one uses three dots for any omission, while the second one makes a distinction between omissions within a sentence (using three dots:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) and omissions between sentences (using a period and a space followed by three dots:&nbsp;.&nbsp;...).\n\nThe [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) used to indicate that an ellipsis must include spaces before and after each dot in all uses. If an ellipsis is meant to represent an omission, [[square bracket]]s must surround the ellipsis to make it clear that there was no pause in the original quote: [&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;]. Currently, the MLA has removed the requirement of brackets in its style handbooks. However, some maintain that the use of brackets is still correct because it clears confusion.<ref>Fowler, H.

When crossing sentences (when the omitted text contains a period, so that omitting the end of a sentence counts), a four-dot, spaced (except for before the first dot) ellipsis (.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) should be used. When ellipsis points are used in the original text, ellipsis points that are not in the original text should be distinguished by enclosing them in square brackets (e.g. \"text [\u2026] text\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uhv.edu/student-success-center/resources/e-p/ellipsis-use-in-mla-style/|last=Jones|first=Karalyn|title=Using Ellipsis in MLA Style|institution=[[University of Houston\u2013Victoria]]|year=2009|access-date=2018-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140911/https://www.uhv.edu/student-success-center/resources/e-p/ellipsis-use-in-mla-style/|archive-date=2018-06-12|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://naropa.edu/documents/programs/jks/naropa-writing-center/citation-comparison.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-06-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804045039/http://naropa.edu/documents/programs/jks/naropa-writing-center/citation-comparison.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the ellipsis should be used to condense quotations. It is less commonly used to indicate a pause in speech or an unfinished thought or to separate items in material such as show business gossip. The stylebook indicates that if the shortened sentence before the mark can stand as a sentence, it should do so, with an ellipsis placed after the period or other ending punctuation. When material is omitted at the end of a paragraph and also immediately following it, an ellipsis goes both at the end of that paragraph and at the beginning of the next, according to this style.<ref>Goldstein, Norm, editor. \"Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law\". 2005. pp.328\u2013329.</ref>\n\nAccording to Robert Bringhurst's ''[[Elements of Typographic Style]]'', the details of typesetting ellipses depend on the character and size of the font being set and the typographer's preference. Bringhurst writes that a full space between each dot is \"another Victorian eccentricity. In most contexts, the Chicago ellipsis is much too wide\"\u2014he recommends using flush dots (with a normal word space before and after), or [[thin space|''thin''-spaced]] dots (up to one-fifth of an [[em (typography)|em]]), or the prefabricated ellipsis character {{unichar|2026|HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS|html=}}. Bringhurst suggests that normally an ellipsis should be spaced fore-and-aft to separate it from the text, but when it combines with other punctuation, the leading space disappears and the other punctuation follows. This is the usual practice in typesetting. He provides the following examples:\n\n{| summary=\"six examples of setting ellipsis\" style=\"margin-left:3em;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | i&nbsp;... j\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | k....\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | l..., l\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | l,&nbsp;... l\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | m...?\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | n...!\n|}\n\nIn legal writing in the United States, Rule 5.3 in the ''[[Bluebook]]'' citation guide governs the use of ellipses and requires a space before the first dot and between the two subsequent dots. If an ellipsis ends the sentence, then there are three dots, each separated by a space, followed by the final punctuation (e.g. Hah . . . ?). In some legal writing, an ellipsis is written as three [[asterisk]]s (*** or *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*) to make it obvious that text has been omitted.\n(...) is also used for awkward silence.\n\n===In British English===\n\n''The [[Hart's Rules|Oxford Style Guide]]'' recommends setting the ellipsis as a single character (\u2026) or as a series of three (narrow) spaced dots (.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.), and surrounding it by spaces. If there is an ellipsis at the end of an incomplete sentence, the final full stop is omitted. However, it is retained if the following ellipsis represents an omission between two complete sentences.<ref>''New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide''. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014.</ref>\n\n: ''The \u2026 fox jumps \u2026''\n: ''The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u2026 And if they have not died, they are still alive today.''\n\nContrary to ''The Oxford Style Guide'', the ''University of Oxford Style Guide'' demands an ellipsis not to be surrounded by spaces, except when it stands for a pause; then, a space has to be set after the ellipsis (but not before). An ellipsis is never preceded or followed by a full stop.<ref>''[https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide%20%28updated%20Hilary%20term%202016%29.pdf University of Oxford Style Guide: Hilary term 2016] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202030344/https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide%20%28updated%20Hilary%20term%202016%29.pdf |date=2017-02-02 }}'' (PDF).

The word ''wielokropek'' distinguishes the ellipsis of Polish syntax from that of [[mathematical notation]], in which it is known as an {{lang|pl|elipsa}}.\n\nWhen an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech.\n\nThe syntactical rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska Norma document [[PN-83/P-55366]], {{lang|pl|Zasady sk\u0142adania tekst\u00f3w w j\u0119zyku polskim}} (\"Rules for setting texts in the Polish Language\").\n\n===In Russian===\nThe combination \"ellipsis+period\" is replaced by the ellipsis. The combinations \"ellipsis+exclamation mark\" and \"ellipsis+question mark\" are written in this way: !.. ?..\n\n===In Japanese===\nThe most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 (\"''3''-dot leaders\", {{lang|ja|\u2026}}). 2-ten r\u012bd\u0101 exists as a character, but it is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six dots (two ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 characters, {{lang|ja|\u2026\u2026}}). Three dots (one ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header. However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text height (between the [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the ascent line), as in the standard Japanese [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced \"{{lang|ja-Latn|ten}}\", the dots are colloquially called \"{{lang|ja-Latn|ten-ten-ten}}\" ({{lang|ja|\u3066\u3093\u3066\u3093\u3066\u3093}}, akin to the English \"dot dot dot\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/20170605/geo17060514190023-n1.html |title=\u79cb\u5143\u9806\u5b50\u3001\u53e4\u5e0c\u306b\u5f97\u610f\u306e\u30c0\u30b8\u30e3\u30ec\u3000\u300c\u3042\u307e\u308a\"\u30b3\u30ad\"\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u300d |date=2017-06-05 |website=SANSPO.COM |publisher=SANKEI DIGITAL Inc. |access-date=2018-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190309024932/https://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/20170605/geo17060514190023-n1.html |archive-date=2019-03-09 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn text in Japanese media, such as in [[manga]] or video games, ellipses are much more frequent than in English, and are often changed to another punctuation sign in translation. The ellipsis by itself represents speechlessness, or a \"[[pregnant pause]]\". Depending on the context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an expression of being dumbfounded at another person's words or actions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mandelin |first1=Clyde |title=Legends of Localization: How Japanese Ellipsis Usage Compares with English |url=https://legendsoflocalization.com/qa-japanese-ellipsis-usage-and-english-translation/ |website=Legends of Localization |accessdate=14 December 2018 |language=en |date=8 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164227/https://legendsoflocalization.com/qa-japanese-ellipsis-usage-and-english-translation/ |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As a device, the ''ten-ten-ten'' is intended to focus the reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative \"camera\" on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects \"speaking\" the ellipsis.\n\n===In Chinese===\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters) (i.e. <span lang=\"zh\">......</span>).<ref>[[:zh-tw:\u7701\u7565\u53f7|\u7701\u7565\u53f7]]</ref>\n\n===In Spanish===\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute of ''[[et cetera]]'' at the end of unfinished lists. So it means \"and so forth\" or \"and other things\".\n\nOther use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the complete use of expletives.\n\nWhen the ellipsis is placed alone into a [[Bracket|parenthesis]] (...) or\u2014less often\u2014between [[bracket]]s [...], which is what happens usually within a text [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], it means the original text had more contents on the same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription. When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text, the ellipsis does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.\n\nThe number of dots is three and only three.<ref>{{cite web |title=Puntos suspensivos |url=http://lema.rae.es/dpd?id=c5GublcDAD6kWvCUUy |website=RAE |access-date=2019-01-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122094659/http://lema.rae.es/dpd/?id=c5GublcDAD6kWvCUUy |archive-date=2019-01-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===In French===\nIn [[French language|French]], the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to represent ''et cetera''. In French typography, the ellipsis is written close up to the preceding word but has a space after it, for example: ''comme \u00e7a\u2026 pas comme ceci''. If, exceptionally, it begins a sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: ''Lui ? \u2026 vaut rien, je crois\u2026 ''.\n\nHowever, any omitted word, phrase or line at the end of a quoted passage would be indicated like this: [...] (space before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example: '' \u2026 \u00e0 Paris, Nice, Nantes, Toulouse [\u2026] ''.\n\n===In German===\nIn [[German language|German]], the ellipsis in general is surrounded by spaces, if it stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side there is no space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the written letter or letters.\n\nExample for both cases, using German style: ''The first el\u2026is stands for omitted letters, the second \u2026 for an omitted word.''\n\nIf the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is omitted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rechtschreibrat.com/DOX/rfdr_regeln_inkl_Nachtraegen.pdf |title=Deutsche Rechtschreibung.

In a type constraint expression like <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511)</code> an ellipsis is used to separate the extension root from extension additions. The definition of type A in version 1 system of the form <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ...)</code> and the definition of type A in version 2 system of the form <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511)</code> constitute an extension series of the same type A in different versions of the same specification. The ellipsis can also be used in compound type definitions to separate the set of fields belonging to the extension root from the set of fields constituting extension additions. Here is an example: <code>B ::= SEQUENCE { {{not a typo|a}} INTEGER, b INTEGER, ..., c INTEGER }</code> <!-- Is the s.n. ellipsis defined as a \"...\" trigraph or something else? This paragraph is a matter of syntax, not text *representation*, and therefore is misplaced. --Incnis Mrsi -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Caesura]]\n* [[Cohesion (linguistics)]]\n* [[Elision]] \u2013 Omission or deletion of a sound or syllable\n* [[Leader (typography)]] \u2013 A row of characters (usually dots or dashes) to connect items across a page (as in a table of contents)\n* [[Leiden Conventions]]\n* [[Line break (poetry)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Ellipses (punctuation)}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Elements of Typographic Style |last=Bringhurst |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Bringhurst |edition=Version 2.5 |year=2002 |publisher=Hartley & Marks |location=[[Point Roberts, Washington]] |isbn=978-0-88179-132-7 |oclc=50848361 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780881791327/page/82 82\u201383] |title-link=The Elements of Typographic Style }}\n* Halliday, M.A.K, and Ruqayia, H.
