He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967's ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]],'' which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.\n\nIn Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]], as well as [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]],'' directed by Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''Garden District'', featuring [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Diana Barrymore]]. Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties.

The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Award]]s and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Film, in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced a musical version of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.

Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

October 10, 1987, until June 3, 1999. It is a [[home video game console]] created by [[NEC]] and released in North America in 1989 as a localized version of the [[PC Engine]], released in Japan in 1987.\n\n==Classification==\nListed here are {{table row counter|tableno=2|ignore=2}} games released commercially for the console between its launch on October 10, 1987, until June 3, 1999. This includes the TurboGrafx-16 in North America<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcengine.co.uk/index.htm|title=PC Engine Bible|access-date=2018-09-30}}</ref> and the PC Engine in Japan. About 121 of those games are localized from the PC Engine library, 18 of those games are exclusive to the U.S. market, and the remainder are exclusive to Japan.\n\nTurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine games were released in two types of storage formats, [[HuCard]]s (also known as TurboChips) and [[CD-ROM]]s, with varying level of compatibility depending on the hardware configurations and options available. Specifically, there are two types of HuCard formats (the standard HuCards that comprised the majority of the PC Engine's library and a few games that are playable only on the [[PC Engine SuperGrafx]]) and three types of CD-ROM formats (CD-ROM\u00b2, Super CD-ROM\u00b2, and Arcade CD-ROM\u00b2, each requiring the console to be equipped with a CD drive and the corresponding System Card if needed). There were also dual-compatible games that were designed to run in an older hardware specifications, but are programmed to take advantage of a newer one (such as reduced loading times).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|+PC Engine format guide\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Format\n!scope=\"col\"|Description\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background: blue; color: white;\"|HuCard\n|Standard HuCards designed to run on any PC Engine console.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background: brown; color: white;\"|SuperGrafx\n|HuCard games designed solely for the PC Engine SuperGrafx\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background: green; color: white;\"|CD-ROM\u00b2\n|Discs designed for any version of the CD-ROM\u00b2 System add-on.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background: purple; color: white;\"|Super CD-ROM\u00b2\n|Discs designed for the Super CD-ROM\u00b2 System or CD-ROM\u00b2 System with Super System Card.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"background: orange; color: white;\"|Arcade CD-ROM\u00b2\n|Discs designed for the Super CD-ROM\u00b2 System with Arcade Card Duo or CD-ROM\u00b2 System with Arcade Card Pro.\n|}\n\n==List of games==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" id=\"softwarelist\" style=\"width: 75%;\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=\"25%\" align=\"left\" | Main Title\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" align=\"left\" | Distributor\n!colspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" align=\"left\" | Release Date\n!rowspan=\"2\" width=\"10%\" align=\"left\" | Format\n|-\n!style=\"width:12%;\"|North America\n!style=\"width:12%;\"|Japan\n|-\n|''[[1552: Tenka Tairan]]''\n|[[ASK Group|ASK Kodansha]]\n|{{Unreleased}}\n|{{dts|1993|7|16}}\n|Super CD-ROM\u00b2\n|-\n|''[[1941: Counter Attack]]''\n|[[Hudson Soft]]\n|{{Unreleased}}\n|{{dts|1991|8|22}}\n|HuCard (SuperGrafx)\n|-\n|''[[1943 Kai]]''\n|[[Naxat Soft]]\n|{{Unreleased}}\n|{{dts|1991|3|22}}\n|HuCard\n|-\n|''[[21 Emon|21 Emon: Mezase!

Today they are used chiefly for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency.\n\nThe [[Conn\u00e9table (Jersey and Guernsey)|Conn\u00e9table]] is the head of each parish, elected at a public election for a four-year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]]. The [[Procureur du Bien Public]] (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish (elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the ''Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003''; formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the ''Loi (1804) au sujet des assembl\u00e9es paroissiales''). A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for three years as a public trustee for the funds and property of the parish and may contract when authorised by a Parish Assembly. The [[Parish Assembly (Jersey)|Parish Assembly]] is the decision-making body of local government in each parish; it consists of all entitled voters of the parish.\n\nEach parish elects its own force of [[Honorary Police]] consisting of ''[[Centenier]]s'', ''[[Vingtenier]]s'' and [[Constable's Officer]]s. Centeniers are elected at a public election within each parish for a term of three years to undertake policing within the parish. The Centenier is the only officer authorised to charge and bail offenders. Formerly, the senior Centenier of each parish (entitled the ''Chef de Police'') deputised for the Conn\u00e9table in the States of Jersey when the Conn\u00e9table was unable to attend a sitting of the States.

It did, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972.<ref>[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Article 355(5)(c) TFEU states \"the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972\".</ref> However, Jersey did not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like [[Gibraltar]], being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that was limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder Protocol 3, Jersey was part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] of the [[European Community]]. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is [[Internal Market (European Union)#Free movement of goods|free movement of goods]] and trade between the island and [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]. EU rules on [[freedom of movement for workers]] do not apply in Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0171:EN:HTML |title='&#39;Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey'&#39;, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> However, Article 4 of the Protocol required the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island was therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister had attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The German blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey was not part of the single market in [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|financial services]]. It was not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as the movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135&nbsp;km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'') labelling the island a [[tax haven]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sesit |first=M |title=Offshore Hazard: Isle of Jersey Proves Less Than a Haven to Currency Investors |date=17 September 1996 |agency=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\nBritish citizens who have only a connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another member state of the European Union, were not considered by the Jersey States to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyReports/2008/45051-30164-1222008.pdf |title=Status of Channel Islands in the European Union |last=States of Jersey |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=20 December 2011}}</ref> They have 'Islander status' and their Jersey-issued [[Jersey passport|British passports]] are endorsed with the words ''the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |title=Islander status |last=States of Jersey |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107062741/http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |archive-date=7 November 2011 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> This will continue until the end of the Brexit transition period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je:80/Travel/Passports/GetAPassport/Pages/ApplyForYourFirstAdultPassport.aspx |title=Government of Jersey |last=Jersey |first=States of |website=gov.je |language=en |access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms did not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC r\u00e9gime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents did not have a right to vote in elections for the [[European Parliament]]. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in [[Brussels]] in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.<ref>{{Citation |title=Channel Islands appoint representative in Brussels |date=25 January 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-12276525 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe effect of the UK leaving the European Union is uncertain.

The levying of ''imp\u00f4ts'' (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.\n\nBecause [[value added tax]] (VAT) has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the Government of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. [[Low-value consignment relief]] provided the mechanism for [[VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands]] to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.\n\nAlthough Jersey does not have VAT, the Government of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.\n\nJersey is not subject to European Union fiscal legislation, and its \"Zero/Ten\" corporate tax legislation will be compliant with the Code of Conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti-avoidance legislation {{as of|2011|December|31|lc=y}}, which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the Code of Conduct Group, a subsidiary body of [[ECOFIN]]. The Code of Conduct Group,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/company_tax/harmful_tax_practices/index_en.htm |title=Harmful tax competition \u2013 Taxation and Customs Union \u2013 European Commission |website=Taxation and Customs Union}}</ref> at least in theory, keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential. The [[European Commission]] has confirmed that the Code is not a legal instrument, and therefore is not legally binding, only becoming of limited \"political\" authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the Group at the end of the Presidency concerned.\n\nJersey is considered to be a [[tax haven]] by some organisations - for example the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] ranks Jersey as 18th {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2018-results |title=View 2018 Results |website=www.financialsecrecyindex.com |access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref> Jersey does not feature, however, in the March 2019 revised EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?qid=1553511630251&uri=CELEX:52019XG0326(01) |title=EUR-Lex - 52019XG0326(01) - EN - EUR-Lex |website=eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Currency===\n[[File:Dual currency cash machines in Jersey.jpg|thumb|Twin [[Automatic teller machine|cash machines]] at a bank that dispensed a choice of [[Bank of England]] or Jersey banknotes.

Following [[Napol\u00e9on III|Louis Napol\u00e9on]]'s coup of 1851, more French ''[[exile|proscrit]]s'' arrived. By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.\n\nSeasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on [[Breton people|Bretons]] and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom \u2013 the demands of reconstruction in mainland [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] employed domestic labour.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population, which is, by 2013, about 100,000. From the 1960s [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.\n\nImmigration has helped give aspects of Jersey a distinct urban character, particularly in and around the parish of St Helier, which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island.<ref>Johnson, Henry (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306058256_Encountering_Urbanization_on_Jersey_Development_Sustainability_and_Spatiality_in_a_Small_Island_Setting Encountering Urbanization on Jersey: Development, Sustainability, and Spatiality in a Small Island Setting].

Jersey [[fudge]], mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.\n\n[[Jersey Royal potatoes]] are the local variety of [[new potato]], and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing c\u00f4tils (steeply sloping fields). They were originally grown using [[Seaweed fertiliser|vraic]] as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.\n\nApples historically were an important crop. ''Bourd\u00e9lots'' are apple dumplings, but the most typical speciality is black butter (''[[Ni\u00e8r beurre|l\u00e9 ni\u00e8r beurre]]''), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices. [[Cider]] used to be an important export. After decline and near-disappearance in the late 20th century, apple production is being increased and promoted. Besides cider, [[apple brandy]] is produced.

It did, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972.<ref>[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Article 355(5)(c) TFEU states \"the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972\".</ref> However, Jersey did not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like [[Gibraltar]], being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that was limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder Protocol 3, Jersey was part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] of the [[European Community]]. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is [[Internal Market (European Union)#Free movement of goods|free movement of goods]] and trade between the island and [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]. EU rules on [[freedom of movement for workers]] do not apply in Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0171:EN:HTML |title='&#39;Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey'&#39;, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> However, Article 4 of the Protocol required the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island was therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister had attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The German blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey was not part of the single market in [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|financial services]]. It was not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as the movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135&nbsp;km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'') labelling the island a [[tax haven]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sesit |first=M |title=Offshore Hazard: Isle of Jersey Proves Less Than a Haven to Currency Investors |date=17 September 1996 |agency=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\nBritish citizens who have only a connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another member state of the European Union, were not considered by the Jersey States to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyReports/2008/45051-30164-1222008.pdf |title=Status of Channel Islands in the European Union |last=States of Jersey |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=20 December 2011}}</ref> They have 'Islander status' and their Jersey-issued [[Jersey passport|British passports]] are endorsed with the words ''the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |title=Islander status |last=States of Jersey |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107062741/http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |archive-date=7 November 2011 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> This will continue until the end of the Brexit transition period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je:80/Travel/Passports/GetAPassport/Pages/ApplyForYourFirstAdultPassport.aspx |title=Government of Jersey |last=Jersey |first=States of |website=gov.je |language=en |access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms did not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC r\u00e9gime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol.

The levying of ''imp\u00f4ts'' (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.\n\nBecause [[value added tax]] (VAT) has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the Government of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. [[Low-value consignment relief]] provided the mechanism for [[VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands]] to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.\n\nAlthough Jersey does not have VAT, the Government of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK.

By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.\n\nSeasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on [[Breton people|Bretons]] and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom \u2013 the demands of reconstruction in mainland [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] employed domestic labour.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population, which is, by 2013, about 100,000. From the 1960s [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.\n\nImmigration has helped give aspects of Jersey a distinct urban character, particularly in and around the parish of St Helier, which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island.<ref>Johnson, Henry (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306058256_Encountering_Urbanization_on_Jersey_Development_Sustainability_and_Spatiality_in_a_Small_Island_Setting Encountering Urbanization on Jersey: Development, Sustainability, and Spatiality in a Small Island Setting].

''(See [[Channel Island milk]])'' However, there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey [[fudge]], mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.\n\n[[Jersey Royal potatoes]] are the local variety of [[new potato]], and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing c\u00f4tils (steeply sloping fields). They were originally grown using [[Seaweed fertiliser|vraic]] as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.\n\nApples historically were an important crop.

The first J\u00e8rriais book to be published was ''Rimes et Po\u00e9sies Jersiaises de divers auteurs r\u00e9unies et mises en ordre'', edited by Abraham Mourant in 1865.

The '''steelhead''' (sometimes called \"steelhead trout\") is an [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] (sea-run) form of the '''coastal rainbow trout''' {{nowrap|(''O. m. irideus'')}} or [[Columbia River redband trout]] {{nowrap|(''O. m. gairdneri'')}} that usually returns to fresh water to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] after living two to three years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] into the [[Great Lakes]] and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead.\n\nAdult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between {{convert|1|and|5|lb|1|abbr=on}}, while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach {{convert|20|lbs|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Coloration varies widely based on [[subspecies]], forms and [[habitat]]. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the [[lateral line]], from [[gill]]s to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.\n\nWild-caught and [[Fish hatchery|hatchery]]-reared forms of this species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), [[Southern Europe]], Australia, New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as [[whirling disease]]), or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. The rainbow trout is included in the [[List of globally invasive species|list of the top 100 globally invasive species]]. Nonetheless, other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created [[Recreational fishing|sport fisheries]] such as the Great Lakes and [[Wyoming]]'s [[Firehole River]].\n\nSome local populations of specific subspecies, or in the case of steelhead, [[distinct population segment]]s, are listed as either [[threatened species|threatened]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The steelhead is the official [[state fish]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/symbols/pages/default.aspx |title=Symbols of Washington State |publisher=Washington State Legislature |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref><!-- note web site specifies Salmo gairdnerii, just to further confuse matters -->\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] of the rainbow trout is {{nowrap|''Oncorhynchus mykiss''}}.<ref name=Behnke2002-67>{{cite book |last=Behnke |first=Robert J. |others=Tomelleri, Joseph R.

Stock rainbow trout of ages 1, 2, and 4 years had their heart and brain mitochondria isolated and analyzed for fatty acid composition. The tissues showed an overall similar percentage of total phospholipids but differed in the types and proportions of phospholipids. With age, the heart showed more unsaturated phospholipids, which are more susceptible to peroxidation, and thus, damage. The brain mitochondria of rainbow trout show decreased levels of [[docosahexaenoic acid]] and a lower peroxidation index, suggesting a lower susceptibility of damage by oxidative stress and a different reaction to growth compared to heart mitochondria. During the trout development into an adult, a time of intense growth, the mitochondrial membranes composition and fluidity changes, which can cause defects in the [[electron transport chain]]. These defects combined with altered machinery repair and reactive oxygen species may cause more detrimental effects to the mitochondria in the fish as it matures. {{clear}}\n\n==Feeding==\nRainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture. They are not as [[Piscivore|piscivorous]] or aggressive as brown trout or [[Salvelinus|chars]]. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on [[larva]]l, [[pupa]]l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically [[Caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[Plecoptera|stoneflies]], [[mayflies]] and aquatic [[fly|diptera]]). They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, [[crayfish]], shrimp, and other [[crustacean]]s. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become [[plankton]]ic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, [[mountain whitefish]] and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish. Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, [[squid]] and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |title=BC Fish Facts-Steelhead |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Fisheries |accessdate=2013-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718071122/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Range==\n[[File:Steelhead Global Range Map.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Map of native range of anadromous form-steelhead|Native range of steelhead, the anadromous form of ''O. mykiss'']]\nThe native range of {{nowrap|''Oncorhynchus mykiss''}} is in the coastal waters and tributary streams of the Pacific basin, from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, east along the [[Aleutian Islands]], throughout southwest Alaska, the Pacific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska, and south along the west coast of the U.S. to northern Mexico.

Once the chemicals have dissipated, native trout are released into the river. Another method is to use [[electrofishing]] which enable the fish to be caught alive and harvested or re-located. This technique has been used in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park to rid it of rainbow trout that were introduced in the 1930s and have thrived ever since. They are hoping to re-establish native brook trout in at least some of the 2100-mile river system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/native-trout-are-returning-to-americas-rivers-160317057/?no-ist|title=Native Trout Are Returning to America's Rivers|website=Smithsonian|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref> Neither method of control is 100% effective and are best regarded as methods to change the relative population sizes of fish species.\n\n===Steelhead declines===\n[[File:Zymoetz (Copper) River Steelhead.jpg|thumb|A large Steelhead caught on the [[Zymoetz River|Zymoetz (Copper) River]] in British Columbia]]\n{{see also|Steelhead and salmon distinct population segments|Conservation status of British Columbia salmonids}}\nSteelhead populations in parts of its native range have declined due to a variety of human and natural causes.

The '''steelhead''' (sometimes called \"steelhead trout\") is an [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] (sea-run) form of the '''coastal rainbow trout''' {{nowrap|(''O. m. irideus'')}} or [[Columbia River redband trout]] {{nowrap|(''O. m. gairdneri'')}} that usually returns to fresh water to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] after living two to three years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] into the [[Great Lakes]] and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead.\n\nAdult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between {{convert|1|and|5|lb|1|abbr=on}}, while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach {{convert|20|lbs|kg|0|abbr=on}}. Coloration varies widely based on [[subspecies]], forms and [[habitat]]. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the [[lateral line]], from [[gill]]s to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.\n\nWild-caught and [[Fish hatchery|hatchery]]-reared forms of this species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), [[Southern Europe]], Australia, New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as [[whirling disease]]), or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. The rainbow trout is included in the [[List of globally invasive species|list of the top 100 globally invasive species]]. Nonetheless, other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created [[Recreational fishing|sport fisheries]] such as the Great Lakes and [[Wyoming]]'s [[Firehole River]].\n\nSome local populations of specific subspecies, or in the case of steelhead, [[distinct population segment]]s, are listed as either [[threatened species|threatened]] or [[endangered species|endangered]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The steelhead is the official [[state fish]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/symbols/pages/default.aspx |title=Symbols of Washington State |publisher=Washington State Legislature |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref><!-- note web site specifies Salmo gairdnerii, just to further confuse matters -->\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]] of the rainbow trout is {{nowrap|''Oncorhynchus mykiss''}}.<ref name=Behnke2002-67>{{cite book |last=Behnke |first=Robert J. |others=Tomelleri, Joseph R.

Stock rainbow trout of ages 1, 2, and 4 years had their heart and brain mitochondria isolated and analyzed for fatty acid composition. The tissues showed an overall similar percentage of total phospholipids but differed in the types and proportions of phospholipids. With age, the heart showed more unsaturated phospholipids, which are more susceptible to peroxidation, and thus, damage. The brain mitochondria of rainbow trout show decreased levels of [[docosahexaenoic acid]] and a lower peroxidation index, suggesting a lower susceptibility of damage by oxidative stress and a different reaction to growth compared to heart mitochondria. During the trout development into an adult, a time of intense growth, the mitochondrial membranes composition and fluidity changes, which can cause defects in the [[electron transport chain]]. These defects combined with altered machinery repair and reactive oxygen species may cause more detrimental effects to the mitochondria in the fish as it matures. {{clear}}\n\n==Feeding==\nRainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture. They are not as [[Piscivore|piscivorous]] or aggressive as brown trout or [[Salvelinus|chars]]. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on [[larva]]l, [[pupa]]l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically [[Caddisfly|caddisflies]], [[Plecoptera|stoneflies]], [[mayflies]] and aquatic [[fly|diptera]]). They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, [[crayfish]], shrimp, and other [[crustacean]]s. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become [[plankton]]ic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, [[mountain whitefish]] and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish. Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, [[squid]] and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |title=BC Fish Facts-Steelhead |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Fisheries |accessdate=2013-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718071122/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/fishfacts/steelheadtrout.pdf |archive-date=2013-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Range==\n[[File:Steelhead Global Range Map.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Map of native range of anadromous form-steelhead|Native range of steelhead, the anadromous form of ''O. mykiss'']]\nThe native range of {{nowrap|''Oncorhynchus mykiss''}} is in the coastal waters and tributary streams of the Pacific basin, from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, east along the [[Aleutian Islands]], throughout southwest Alaska, the Pacific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska, and south along the west coast of the U.S. to northern Mexico.

This forced West Ham to play its matches at other grounds while repairs were undertaken, but it did not affect performances as West Ham managed nine consecutive victories. Upon their return to the ground in December 1944, they lost 1\u20130 to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\nBy 1990, West Ham were required to convert Upton Park into an all-seater stadium for the [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95 season]] in order to comply with the requirements of the [[Taylor Report]]. The first stage of the redevelopment came in 1993, when the South Bank was replaced by a 9,000 seat, two-tier stand named in honour of former captain [[Bobby Moore]], who had died earlier that year. The stand incorporated executive boxes as well as a digital clock. The North Bank was demolished in 1994 and a new 6,000 seat, two-tier stand named the \"Centenary Stand\" was opened on its site the following year; this was later renamed the \"Sir Trevor Brooking Stand\". The East Stand Lower was also converted into an all-seater stand.\n\nThe final change came in 2000, when the West Stand was replaced by a 15,000 seat, two-tier stand named the \"[[Dr. Martens]] Stand\". The stand incorporated executive boxes on two levels as well as the West Ham United Hotel. This gave the stadium a 35,000 all-seater capacity.\n\nThere were plans to increase the capacity to approximately 40,500 through the building of a new larger East Stand, that would have used the spare space created when the Doctor Martens stand was built further West than the old West Stand. However, these plans never came to fruition.\n\n===Decision to demolish===\nThrough 2006, talk was rife of West Ham moving to the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] after the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], with speculation increasing after new club chairman [[Eggert Magnusson]] confirmed he was interested in a move there.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/west-ham-want-olympic-stadium-425709.html |title=West Ham want Olympic stadium |last1=Collomosse |first1=Tom |date=25 November 2006 |work=The Independent |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> However, talks broke down between the club and the Olympic Committee after it was announced the Stadium would be reduced to a 25,000 capacity all-seater after the Olympic Games, which was 10,000 less than the Boleyn Ground's capacity, and the stadium would be keeping its running track, leaving supporters further from the pitch and affecting the atmosphere within the stadium. Rumours suggested West Ham might move to a new stadium at the Parcelforce depot near to West Ham Underground/mainline station instead.

Hence the ground became known as the Boleyn Ground. The ground was also often referred to as Upton Park, after the [[Upton Park, London]] area where it is located.\n\nIn August 1944, a [[V-1 flying bomb]] fell on the south-west corner of the pitch. This forced West Ham to play its matches at other grounds while repairs were undertaken, but it did not affect performances as West Ham managed nine consecutive victories. Upon their return to the ground in December 1944, they lost 1\u20130 to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].\n\nBy 1990, West Ham were required to convert Upton Park into an all-seater stadium for the [[1994-95 in English football|1994-95 season]] in order to comply with the requirements of the [[Taylor Report]]. The first stage of the redevelopment came in 1993, when the South Bank was replaced by a 9,000 seat, two-tier stand named in honour of former captain [[Bobby Moore]], who had died earlier that year. The stand incorporated executive boxes as well as a digital clock. The North Bank was demolished in 1994 and a new 6,000 seat, two-tier stand named the \"Centenary Stand\" was opened on its site the following year; this was later renamed the \"Sir Trevor Brooking Stand\". The East Stand Lower was also converted into an all-seater stand.\n\nThe final change came in 2000, when the West Stand was replaced by a 15,000 seat, two-tier stand named the \"[[Dr. Martens]] Stand\". The stand incorporated executive boxes on two levels as well as the West Ham United Hotel. This gave the stadium a 35,000 all-seater capacity.\n\nThere were plans to increase the capacity to approximately 40,500 through the building of a new larger East Stand, that would have used the spare space created when the Doctor Martens stand was built further West than the old West Stand. However, these plans never came to fruition.\n\n===Decision to demolish===\nThrough 2006, talk was rife of West Ham moving to the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] after the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], with speculation increasing after new club chairman [[Eggert Magnusson]] confirmed he was interested in a move there.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/west-ham-want-olympic-stadium-425709.html |title=West Ham want Olympic stadium |last1=Collomosse |first1=Tom |date=25 November 2006 |work=The Independent |accessdate=10 July 2015}}</ref> However, talks broke down between the club and the Olympic Committee after it was announced the Stadium would be reduced to a 25,000 capacity all-seater after the Olympic Games, which was 10,000 less than the Boleyn Ground's capacity, and the stadium would be keeping its running track, leaving supporters further from the pitch and affecting the atmosphere within the stadium.
