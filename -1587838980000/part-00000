It is an adaption by [[Ni Zhen]] of the 1990 novel ''[[Wives and Concubines]]'' by [[Su Tong]]. The film was later adapted into an acclaimed [[ballet]] of the same title by the [[National Ballet of China]], also directed by Zhang.\n\nSet in the 1920s, the film tells the story of a young woman who becomes one of the concubines of a wealthy man during the [[Warlord Era]]. It is noted for its opulent visuals and sumptuous use of colours.  The film was shot in the [[Qiao Family Compound]] near the ancient city of [[Pingyao]], in [[Shanxi Province]]. Although the [[screenplay]] was approved by Chinese [[Censorship|censor]]s,<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine = TV Guide | title = Raise the Red Lantern Review | url = http://www.tvguide.com/movies/raise-red-lantern/review/128900 | accessdate = 6 August 2007 | quote = Though Zhang's screenplay for RAISE THE RED LANTERN ... got a stamp of approval from the Chinese censors, the finished production was banned at home while playing to great praise abroad.}}</ref> the final version of the film was banned in China for a period.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.filmforum.org/films/redlantern.html| title=Zhang Yimou's RAISE THE RED LANTERN| quote=Originally banned in China| accessdate=6 August 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012323/http://www.filmforum.org/films/redlantern.html| archivedate=27 September 2007}}.</ref><ref>''Zhang Yimou''. Frances K. Gateward, Yimou Zhang, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2001, p. 64.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in 1920s [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] during the [[Warlord Era]] (1916\u20131928), years before the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Nineteen-year-old Songlian (S\u00f2ngli\u00e1n, played by Gong Li), an educated woman whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, is forced by her stepmother to marry into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth wife or rather the third concubine or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress (S\u00ec T\u00e0itai) of the household. Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen (Ma Jingwu), the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown.\n\nSonglian soon discovers, however, that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. In fact, the master decides on a daily basis the concubine with whom he will spend the night; whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Pitted in constant competition against each other, the three concubines are continually vying for their husband's attention and affections. It is this hierarchical competition, and the artificiality of human relations within the compound, that projects the film's strongest critique.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zhang Yimou: Globalization and the Subject of Culture|last=Larson|first=Wendy|publisher=Cambria Press|year=2017|isbn=9781604979756|location=Amherst, New York|pages=105\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nThe First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger concubines. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun (Zhu\u00f3y\u00fan, Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift; she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan (M\u00e9ishan, He Saifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master's playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted; she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpion.\n\nSonglian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the master's time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant. Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Songlian's personal maid, Yan'er (Y\u00e0n'\u00e9r, played by Kong Lin) who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud.\n\nZhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian's \"pregnancy\". Doctor Gao (Gao-yisheng, Cui Zhigang), who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian's lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming the sequence of events on Yan'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan'er dreams of becoming a mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan'er is in love with the master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress' bed.\n\nYan'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder. In an act of defiance, Yan'er refuses to humble herself or apologize, and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses. Yan'er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress's name on her lips. Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude; she eventually sees the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a \"robe\" that the master may wear and discard at his discretion.\n\nAs Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide; she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a concubine in the Chen household. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun, who later catches the adulterous couple together. Following the old customs and traditions, Meishan is dragged to a lone room (also known as the room of death earlier on) on the roof of the estate and is hanged to death by the master's servants.\n\nSonglian, already in agony due to the fruitlessness of her life, witnesses the entire episode and is emotionally traumatized. The following summer, after the Master's marriage to yet another concubine, Songlian is shown wandering the compound in her old schoolgirl clothes, appearing to have gone completely insane.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Gong Li]] as Songlian (S:\u9882\u83b2, T:\u980c\u84ee, P: ''S\u00f2ngli\u00e1n''), the fourth mistress (\u56db\u592a\u592a ''S\u00ec t\u00e0itai'')\n*[[He Saifei]] as Meishan (C:\u6885\u73ca, P: ''M\u00e9ish\u0101n''), the third mistress (\u4e09\u592a\u592a ''S\u0101n t\u00e0itai'')\n*[[Cao Cuifen]] as Zhuoyun (S:\u5353\u4e91, T:\u5353\u96f2, P: ''Zhu\u00f3y\u00fan''), the second mistress  (\u4e8c\u592a\u592a ''\u00c8r t\u00e0itai'')\n*[[Kong Lin (actress)|Kong Lin]] as Yan'er (S: \u96c1\u513f, T: \u96c1\u5152, P: ''Y\u00e0n'\u00e9r''), Songlian's young servant\n*Zhou Qi as housekeeper Chen Baishun (S: \u9648\u767e\u987a, T: \u9673\u767e\u9806, P: ''Ch\u00e9n B\u01ceish\u00f9n'')\n*[[Jin Shuyuan]] as Yuru (C: \u6bd3\u5982, P: ''Y\u00f9r\u00fa''), the first wife (\u5927\u592a\u592a ''d\u00e0 t\u00e0itai'')\n*[[Ma Jingwu]] as Chen Zuoqian (S:\u9648\u4f50\u5343, T: \u9673\u4f50\u97c6, ''Ch\u00e9n Zu\u01d2qi\u0101n'') or Master Chen\n*[[Cui Zhihgang]] as Doctor Gao (S:\u9ad8\u533b\u751f, T: \u9ad8\u91ab\u751f, P: ''G\u0101o-y\u012bsh\u0113ng'')\n*[[Xiao Chu]] as Feipu (S:\u98de\u6d66, T: \u98db\u6d66, P: ''F\u0113ip\u01d4''), the master's eldest son\n*[[Cao Zhengyin]] as Songlian's old servant\n*[[Ding Weimin]] as Songlian's mother\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Raise the Red Lantern\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Zhao Jiping]]\n| cover      =\n| caption    ={{deletable image-caption|Friday, 20 September 2019|PROD}}\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1994\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Milan Records]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n''All songs composed by [[Zhao Jiping]].''\n# \"Opening Credits/Prologue/Zhouyun/Lanterns\"\n# \"First Night With Master/Alone on First Night Second Night Third Night\"\n# \"Summer\"\n# \"Flute Solo\"\n# \"Record\"\n# \"Autumn\"\n# \"Births/The Peking Theme\"\n# \"Pregnancy/Yan'er's Punishment\"\n# \"Meishan Sings\"\n# \"Young Master Returns Meishan's Punishment\"\n# \"Realization\"\n# \"Winter\"\n# \"Ghost\"\n# \"Seasons\"\n# \"Next Summer\"\n# \"House of Death\"\n# \"Fifth Mistress\"\n# \"Songlian's Madness/End Credits\"\n\n==Distribution==\n''Raise the Red Lantern'' has been distributed on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]] and [[DVD]] by numerous different distributors, with many coming under criticism for their poor quality.\n\nThe Razor Digital Entertainment DVD release has been widely criticised.

It is an adaption by [[Ni Zhen]] of the 1990 novel ''[[Wives and Concubines]]'' by [[Su Tong]]. The film was later adapted into an acclaimed [[ballet]] of the same title by the [[National Ballet of China]], also directed by Zhang.\n\nSet in the 1920s, the film tells the story of a young woman who becomes one of the concubines of a wealthy man during the [[Warlord Era]]. It is noted for its opulent visuals and sumptuous use of colours.  The film was shot in the [[Qiao Family Compound]] near the ancient city of [[Pingyao]], in [[Shanxi Province]].

Frances K. Gateward, Yimou Zhang, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2001, p. 64.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is set in 1920s [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] during the [[Warlord Era]] (1916\u20131928), years before the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Nineteen-year-old Songlian (S\u00f2ngli\u00e1n, played by Gong Li), an educated woman whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, is forced by her stepmother to marry into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth wife or rather the third concubine or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress (S\u00ec T\u00e0itai) of the household. Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen (Ma Jingwu), the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown.\n\nSonglian soon discovers, however, that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. In fact, the master decides on a daily basis the concubine with whom he will spend the night; whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Pitted in constant competition against each other, the three concubines are continually vying for their husband's attention and affections. It is this hierarchical competition, and the artificiality of human relations within the compound, that projects the film's strongest critique.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zhang Yimou: Globalization and the Subject of Culture|last=Larson|first=Wendy|publisher=Cambria Press|year=2017|isbn=9781604979756|location=Amherst, New York|pages=105\u2013132}}</ref>\n\nThe First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger concubines. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun (Zhu\u00f3y\u00fan, Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift; she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan (M\u00e9ishan, He Saifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master's playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted; she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpion.\n\nSonglian feigns pregnancy, attempting to garner the majority of the master's time and, at the same time, attempting to become actually pregnant. Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Songlian's personal maid, Yan'er (Y\u00e0n'\u00e9r, played by Kong Lin) who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud.\n\nZhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian's \"pregnancy\". Doctor Gao (Gao-yisheng, Cui Zhigang), who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian's lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming the sequence of events on Yan'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan'er dreams of becoming a mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan'er is in love with the master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress' bed.\n\nYan'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder. In an act of defiance, Yan'er refuses to humble herself or apologize, and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses. Yan'er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress's name on her lips. Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude; she eventually sees the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a \"robe\" that the master may wear and discard at his discretion.\n\nAs Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide; she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a concubine in the Chen household. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun, who later catches the adulterous couple together.

It is the seventeenth season in the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' franchise, featuring the fifteenth generation of Cures. It is directed by Yoko Ikeda and written by Junko Komura. The series began airing on all [[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] stations in Japan on February 2, 2020, succeeding ''[[Star Twinkle PreCure]]'' in its initial time slot. It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic after ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.

It is the seventeenth season in the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' franchise, featuring the fifteenth generation of Cures. It is directed by Yoko Ikeda and written by Junko Komura. The series began airing on all [[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] stations in Japan on February 2, 2020, succeeding ''[[Star Twinkle PreCure]]'' in its initial time slot. It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic after ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.

It is the view that there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul or essence in phenomena.<ref>Gombrich,  Richard (2006). ''\"Theravada Buddhism,\"'' p. 47.  Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1-134-90352-8}}</ref> The Buddha and Buddhist philosophers who follow him such as Vasubandhu and Buddhaghosa, generally argue for this view through by analyzing the person through the schema of the [[five aggregates]], and then attempting to show that none of these five components of personality can be permanent or absolute.<ref>Siderits, Mark (2007). ''\"Buddhism as philosophy,\"'' p. 39</ref> This can be seen in Buddhist discourses such as the ''[[Anattalakkhana Sutta]].''\n\n\"Emptiness\" or \"voidness\" (Skt'': \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101'', Pali: ''Su\u00f1\u00f1at\u0101)'', is a related concept with many different interpretations throughout the various Buddhisms. In early Buddhism, it was commonly stated that all five aggregates are void (''rittaka''), hollow (''tucchaka''), coreless (''as\u0101raka''), for example as in the ''Phe\u1e47api\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bpama Sutta'' (SN 22:95).<ref>Shi Huifeng, ''Is \"Illusion\" a Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Creation?

In Madhyamaka philosophy, emptiness is the view which holds that all phenomena ([[dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|''dharmas'']]) are without any [[svabhava|''svabhava'']] (literally \"own-nature\" or \"self-nature\"), and are thus without any underlying essence, and so are \"empty\" of being independent.

Whatever that may be, \"Buddha\" is still central to all forms of Buddhism.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, a Buddha is someone who has become awake through their own efforts and insight. They have put an end to their cycle of rebirths and have ended all unwholesome mental states which lead to bad action and thus are morally perfected.<ref>Crosby, Kate (2013). ''\"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\"'' p. 16. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> While subject to the limitations of the human body in certain ways (for example, in the early texts, the Buddha suffers from backaches), a Buddha is said to be \"deep, immeasurable, hard-to-fathom as is the great ocean,\" and also has immense psychic powers ([[abhij\u00f1\u0101]]).<ref>Harvey (2013). pp. 27-28.</ref> \n\nTheravada generally sees Gautama Buddha (the historical Buddha Sakyamuni) as the only Buddha of the current era. While he is no longer in this world, he has left us the Dharma (Teaching), the Vinaya (Discipline) and the Sangha (Community).<ref>Crosby, Kate (2013). ''\"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\"'' p. 21. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> There are also said to be two types of Buddhas, a ''sammasambuddha ''is also said to teach the Dharma to others, while a ''[[paccekabuddha]]'' (solitary buddha) does not teach.<ref>Crosby, Kate (2013). ''\"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\"'' p. 16. John Wiley & Sons.</ref>\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism meanwhile, has a vastly expanded [[Buddhist cosmology|cosmology]], with various [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and other holy beings (''aryas'') residing in different realms. Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts not only revere numerous [[Buddhist deities#Buddhas|Buddhas]] besides [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]], such as [[Amit\u0101bha|Amitabha]] and [[Vairochana|Vairocana]], but also see them as transcendental or supramundane (''lokuttara'') beings.<ref>Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, p. 21.</ref> Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism holds that these other Buddhas in other realms can be contacted and are able to benefit beings in this world.<ref>Harvey (2013). p. 162.</ref> In Mah\u0101y\u0101na, a Buddha is a kind of \"spiritual king\", a \"protector of all creatures\" with a lifetime that is countless of eons long, rather than just a human teacher who has transcended the world after death.<ref name=\":8\">Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, p. 27.</ref> [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha Sakyamuni]]'s life and death on earth is then usually understood as a \"mere appearance\" or \"a manifestation skilfully projected into earthly life by a long-enlightened transcendent being, who is still available to teach the faithful through visionary experiences.\"<ref name=\":8\" /><ref>Harvey (2013). p. 164.</ref>\n\n==== Dharma ====\n{{Main|Dharma}}\n\"Dharma\" (Pali: Dhamma) in Buddhism refers to the Buddha's teaching, which includes all of the main ideas outlined above. While this teaching reflects the true nature of reality, it is not a belief to be clung to, but a pragmatic teaching to be put into practice. It is likened to a raft which is \"for crossing over\" (to nirvana) not for holding on to.<ref>Harvey (2013). p. 31.</ref>\n\nIt also refers to the universal law and cosmic order which that teaching both reveals and relies upon.<ref>\"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/dharma.aspx#1 Dharma]\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''.</ref> It is an everlasting principle which applies to all beings and worlds. In that sense it is also the ultimate truth and reality about the universe, it is thus \"the way that things really are.\"\n\nThe Dharma is the second of the three jewels which all Buddhists take refuge in. All Buddhas in all worlds, in the past, present and in the future, are believed by Buddhists to understand and teach the Dharma. Indeed, it is part of what makes them a Buddha that they do so. \n\n==== Sangha ====\n{{Main|Sangha|Bodhisattva|Arhat}}\n[[File:Praying monks and nuns in the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple of Singapore.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks and nuns praying in the [[Buddha Tooth Relic Temple]] of Singapore]] \nThe third \"jewel\" which Buddhists take refuge in is the \"Sangha\", which refers to the monastic community of monks and nuns who follow Gautama Buddha's monastic discipline which was \"designed to shape the Sangha as an ideal community, with the optimum conditions for spiritual growth.\"<ref>Harvey (2013). p. 88.</ref> The Sangha consists of those who have chosen to follow the Buddha's ideal way of life, which is one of celibate monastic renunciation with minimal material possessions (such as an alms bowl and robes).<ref>Gethin (1998) pp. 85 - 88.</ref>  \n\nThe Sangha is seen as important because they preserve and pass down Buddha Dharma. As Gethin states \"the Sangha lives the teaching, preserves the teaching as Scriptures and teaches the wider commmunity. Without the Sangha there is no Buddhism.\"<ref>Gethin (1998) p. 92</ref> \n\nThe Sangha also act as a \"field of merit\" for laypersons, allowing them to make spiritual merit or goodness by donating to the Sangha and supporting them. In return, they keep their duty to preserve and spread the Dharma everywhere for the good of the world.<ref>Gethin (1998) p. 86</ref>  \n\nThe Sangha are also supposed to follow the Vinaya (monastic rule) of the Buddha, thereby serving as an spiritual example for the world and future generations. The Vinaya rules also force the Sangha to live in dependence on the rest of the lay community (they must beg for food etc) and thus draw the Sangha into a relationship with the lay community.<ref>Gethin (1998) p. 93</ref>\n[[File:Ascetic Sumedha and Dipankara Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|A depiction of Siddhartha Gautama in a previous life prostrating before the past Buddha [[Dipankara]].

This sangha is called the [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#The community of disciples|''\u0101ryasa\u1e45gha'']] \"noble Sangha\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/triplegem.html|title=What is the Triple Gem?|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}</ref> All forms of Buddhism generally reveres these ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|\u0101ryas]]'' (Pali: ''ariya'', \"noble ones\" or \"holy ones\") who are spiritually attained beings.

The ''\u0101ryasa\u1e45gha'' includes holy beings such as [[Bodhisattva|bodhisattvas]], [[Arhat|arhats]] and stream-enterers. \n[[File:Bodhisattva Maitreya (Metropolitan Museum of Art).jpg|thumb|Bodhisattva Maitreya, Pakistan (3rd century), Metropolitan Museum of Art.]]\nIn early Buddhism and in Theravada Buddhism, an arhat (literally meaning \"worthy\") is someone who reached the same awakening (''bodhi'') of a Buddha by following the teaching of a Buddha.<ref>Snelling, John (1987), The Buddhist handbook. A Complete Guide to Buddhist Teaching and Practice. London: Century Paperbacks. p. 81</ref> They are seen as having ended rebirth and all the mental defilements. A bodhisattva (\"a being bound for awakening\") meanwhile, is simply a name for someone who is working towards awakening (''bodhi'') as a Buddha. According to all the early buddhist schools as well as Theravada, to be considered a bodhisattva one has to have made a vow in front of a living Buddha and also has to have received a confirmation of one's future Buddhahood.<ref>Drewes, David, ''Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras and Opening of the Bodhisattva Path'', Paper presented at the XVIII the IABS Congress, Toronto 2017, Updated 2019.</ref> In Theravada, the future Buddha is called Metteya (Maitreya) and he is revered as a bodhisatta currently working for future Buddhahood.<ref>Drewes, David, ''Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras and Opening of the Bodhisattva Path'', Paper presented at the XVIII the IABS Congress, Toronto 2017, Updated 2019.</ref> \n \nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism generally sees the attainment of the arhat as an inferior one, since it is seen as being done only for the sake of individual liberation. It thus promotes the bodhisattva path as the highest and most worthwhile.<ref>Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,''Routledge, 2008, p. 60.</ref> While in Mah\u0101y\u0101na, anyone who has given rise to [[bodhicitta]] (the wish to become a Buddha that arises from a sense of compassion for all beings) is considered a bodhisattva,<ref>Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref> some of these holy beings (such as [[Maitreya]] and [[Avalokiteshvara]]) have reached very high levels of spiritual attainment and are seen as being very powerful supramundane beings who provide aid to countless beings through their advanced powers.<ref>Harvey (2013). pp. 175-76</ref>\n\n===Other key Mah\u0101y\u0101na views===\n{{Main|Yogachara|Buddha-nature}}\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism also differs from Theravada and the other schools of early Buddhism in promoting several unique doctrines which are contained in Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras and philosophical treatises.\n\nOne of these is the unique interpretation of emptiness and dependent origination found in the Madhyamaka school. Another very influential doctrine for Mah\u0101y\u0101na is the main philosophical view of the [[Yogachara|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]] school variously, termed ''Vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101-v\u0101da'' (\"the doctrine that there are only ideas\" or \"mental impressions\") or ''Vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da'' (\"the doctrine of consciousness\"). According to Mark Siderits, what classical Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thinkers like Vasubandhu had in mind is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions, which may appear as external objects, but \"there is actually no such thing outside the mind.\"<ref>Siderits, Mark, ''Buddhism as philosophy'', 2017, p. 149.</ref> There are several interpretations of this main theory, many scholars see it as a type of Idealism, others as a kind of phenomenology.<ref>Gold, Jonathan C., \"Vasubandhu\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/vasubandhu/</ref>\n\nAnother very influential concept unique to Mah\u0101y\u0101na is that of \"Buddha-nature\" (''buddhadh\u0101tu'') or \"Tathagata-womb\" (''tath\u0101gatagarbha''). Buddha-nature is a concept found in some 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts, such as the ''[[Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras]]''. According to Paul Williams these [[Sutra]]s suggest that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core inner nature, Self'.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|p=104}}{{refn|group=note|Wayman and Wayman have disagreed with this view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|p=107}}}} According to Karl Brunnholzl \"the earliest mahayana sutras that are based on and discuss the notion of tath\u0101gatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century.\"<ref>Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston & London, 2014, page 3.</ref> For some, the doctrine seems to conflict with the Buddhist anatta doctrine (non-Self), leading scholars to posit that the ''Tath\u0101gatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|pp=104\u2013105, 108\u2013109; Quote: \"...&nbsp;[The ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra''] refers to the Buddha using the term \"Self\" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics.\"}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101\u2013102}}, Quote: \"Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous.\"</ref> This can be seen in texts like the ''[[La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra]]'', which state that Buddha-nature is taught to help those who have fear when they listen to the teaching of anatta.<ref>Suzuki, D.T. (1956), ''The Lankavatara Sutra. A Mahayana Text.'' London: Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. p.69</ref> Buddhist texts like the ''[[Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga]]'' clarify that the \"Self\" implied in ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine is actually \"not-Self\".{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|p=112}}{{Sfn|Hookham|1991|p=96}} Various interpretations of the concept have been advanced by Buddhist thinkers throughout the history of Buddhist thought and most attempt to avoid anything like the [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Hindu Atman]] doctrine.\n\nThese Indian Buddhist ideas, in various synthetic ways, form the basis of subsequent Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism.\n\n==Paths to Liberation==\n{{Main|Buddhist Paths to liberation}}\nWhile the Noble Eightfold Path is best-known in the West, a wide variety of paths and models of progress have been used and described in the different Buddhist traditions. However, they generally share basic practices such as ''sila'' (ethics), ''samadhi'' (meditation, ''dhyana'') and ''praj\u00f1a'' (wisdom), which are known as the three trainings. An important additional practice is a kind and compassionate attitude toward every living being and the world. [[Buddhist devotion|Devotion]] is also important in some Buddhist traditions, and in the Tibetan traditions visualisations of deities and mandalas are important. The value of textual study is regarded differently in the various Buddhist traditions. It is central to Theravada and highly important to Tibetan Buddhism, while the Zen tradition takes an ambiguous stance.\n\nAn important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the [[Middle Way]] (''madhyamapratipad''). It was a part of Buddha's first sermon, where he presented the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] that was a 'middle way' between the extremes of asceticism and hedonistic sense pleasures.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=23, 81}}{{Sfn|Keown|1996|pp=24, 59}} In Buddhism, states Harvey, the doctrine of \"dependent arising\" (conditioned arising, ''prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da'') to explain rebirth is viewed as the 'middle way' between the doctrines that a being has a \"permanent soul\" involved in rebirth (eternalism) and \"death is final and there is no rebirth\" (annihilationism).{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=72}}{{Sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=49, ''antagrahadrsti''}}\n\n=== Paths to liberation in the early texts ===\nA common presentation style of the path (''m\u0101rga'') to liberation in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] is the \"graduated talk\", in which the Buddha lays out a step by step training.<ref>Carole Anderson (2013), ''Pain and its Ending'', p.143</ref>\n\nIn the early texts, numerous different sequences of the gradual path can be found.<ref name=\":0\">Bucknell, Rod, \"The Buddhist Path to Liberation: An Analysis of the Listing of Stages\", ''The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' Volume 7, Number 2, 1984</ref> One of the most important and widely used presentations among the various Buddhist schools is The [[Noble Eightfold Path]], or \"Eightfold Path of the Noble Ones\" (Skt. ''<nowiki/>'\u0101ry\u0101\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45gam\u0101rga'''). This can be found in various discourses, most famously in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' (The discourse on the turning of the [[Dharma Wheel|Dharma wheel]]).\n\nOther suttas such as the ''Tevijja Sutta'', and the ''Cula-Hatthipadopama-sutta'' give a different outline of the path, though with many similar elements such as ethics and meditation.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nAccording to Rupert Gethin, the path to awakening is also frequently summarized by another a short formula: \"abandoning the hindrances, practice of the four establishings of mindfulness, and development of the awakening factors.\"<ref>Gethin, R.M.L.

All the various Tibetan schools have their own Lamrim presentations. This genre can be traced to [[Atisha|Ati\u015ba]]'s 11th-century ''[[Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa|A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment]]'' (''Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa'').<ref name=\"thubten\">[http://www.thubtenchodron.org/GradualPathToEnlightenment/index.html Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment]</ref>\n\n==Common Buddhist Practices==\n=== Hearing and Learning the Dharma ===\n[[File:Sermon in the Deer Park depicted at Wat Chedi Liem-KayEss-1.jpeg|thumb|Sermon in the Deer Park depicted at Wat Chedi Liem-Kay]]\nIn various suttas which present the graduated path taught by the Buddha, such as the ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'' and the ''Cula-Hatthipadopama Sutta,'' the first step on the path is hearing the Buddha teach the Dharma.<ref name=\":0\">Bucknell, Rod, \"The Buddhist Path to Liberation: An Analysis of the Listing of Stages\", ''The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' Volume 7, Number 2, 1984</ref> This then said to lead to the acquiring of confidence or faith in the Buddha's teachings.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nMahayana Buddhist teachers such as [[Yin Shun]] also state that hearing the Dharma and study of the Buddhist discourses is necessary \"if one wants to learn and practice the Buddha Dharma.\"<ref>Yin-shun (2012). \"The Way to Buddhahood: Instructions from a Modern Chinese Master,\" p. 29.

The three refuges are believed by Buddhists to be protective and a form of reverence.{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=249}}\n\nThe ancient formula which is repeated for taking refuge affirms that \"I go to the Buddha as refuge, I go to the Dhamma as refuge, I go to the Sangha as refuge.\"<ref>Harvey (2013). p. 244</ref>  Reciting the three refuges, according to Harvey, is considered not as a place to hide, rather a thought that \"purifies, uplifts and strengthens the heart\".{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\n===''\u015a\u012bla'' \u2013 Buddhist ethics===\n{{Main|Buddhist ethics}}\n[[File:Buddhist_alms_in_Si_Phan_Don.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks collect alsm in Si Phan Don, [[Laos]].

Killing in Buddhist belief leads to rebirth in the hell realms, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Adultery, similarly, invites a rebirth as prostitute or in hell, depending on whether the partner was unmarried or married.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187\u2013191}} Within the Buddhist doctrine, the precepts are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}\n\nThe monastic life in Buddhism has additional precepts as part of ''patimokkha'', and unlike lay people, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions.

Lopez Jr. (2013) \"The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism,\" p. 18. Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\nAnother related practice to renunciation and sense restraint taught by the Buddha is \"restraint in eating\" or moderation with food, which for monks generally means not eating after noon. Devout laypersons also follow this rule during special days of religious observance (''[[uposatha]]'').<ref>Johnston, William M. (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism'', Routledge, 2013, p. 467-468.</ref> Observing the Uposatha also includes other practices dealing with renunciation, mainly the [[eight precepts]]. \n\nFor Buddhist monastics, renunciation can also be trained through several optional ascetic practices called ''[[Dhutanga|dhuta\u1e45ga]]''.  \n\nIn different Buddhist traditions, other related [[Fasting in Buddhism|practices which focus on fasting]] are followed.\n\n=== Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension ===\nThe training of the faculty called [[Sati (Buddhism)|\"mindfulness\"]] (Pali: ''sati'', Sanskrit: ''sm\u1e5bti,'' literally meaning \"recollection, remembering\") is central in Buddhism. According to Analayo, mindfulness is a full awareness of the present moment which enhances and strengthens memory.<ref>Analayo (2018) ''\"Satipatthana Meditation, A Practice Guide,\"'' chapter 1.

Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating.

In addition to the Abhidharma project, some of the schools also began accumulating a literary tradition of scriptural commentary on their respective Tripitakas. These commentaries were particularly important in the [[Theravada|Therav\u0101da]] school, and the Pali commentaries (''[[Atthakatha|A\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101]]'') remain influential today. Both Abhidhamma and the Pali Commentaries influenced the ''[[Visuddhimagga]],'' an important 5th-century text by the Theravada scholar [[Buddhaghosa]], who also translated and compiled many of the ''A\u1e6d\u1e6dhakath\u0101s'' from older Sinhalese sources.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Visuddhimagga Visuddhimagga], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2015)</ref>{{Sfn|Gethin|1998|p=55}}\n\nThe [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] school was one of the most influential Abhidharma traditions in North India.<ref>Wataru S.

Under the Guptas and Palas, Tantric Buddhism or Vajrayana developed and rose to prominence. It promoted new practices such as the use of [[Mantra|mantras]], [[Dharani|dharanis]], [[Mudra|mudras]], [[Mandala|mandalas]] and the visualization of deities and Buddhas and developed a new class of literature, the [[Tantras (Buddhism)|Buddhist Tantras]]. This new esoteric form of Buddhism can be traced back to groups of wandering yogi magicians called [[Mahasiddha|mahasiddhas]].<ref>Ray, Reginald A (2000) ''Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism''.</ref><ref>Davidson, Ronald M.,(2002). ''Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement'', Columbia University Press, p. 228, 234.</ref>\n\nThe question of the origins of early Vajrayana has been taken up by various scholars. [[David Seyfort Ruegg]] has suggested that Buddhist tantra employed various elements of a \u201cpan-Indian religious substrate\u201d which is not specifically Buddhist, Shaiva or Vaishnava.<ref>Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 171.</ref>\n\nAccording to Indologist [[Alexis Sanderson]], various classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and [[Shaivism|Saivism]]. Sanderson has argued that Buddhist tantras can be shown to have borrowed practices, terms, rituals and more form Shaiva tantras. He argues that Buddhist texts even directly copied various Shaiva tantras, especially the Bhairava Vidyapitha tantras.<ref>Sanderson, Alexis. \"The \u015aaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of \u015aaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo.

Davidson meanwhile, argues that Sanderson's claims for direct influence from Shaiva ''Vidyapitha'' texts are problematic because \"the chronology of the ''Vidyapitha'' tantras is by no means so well established\"<ref>Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 204.</ref> and that the Shaiva tradition also appropriated non-Hindu deities, texts and traditions. Thus while \"there can be no question that the Buddhist tantras were heavily influenced by [[Kapalika]] and other Saiva movements\" argues Davidson, \"the influence was apparently mutual.\"<ref>Davidson, Ronald M. Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 217.</ref>\n\nAlready during this later era, Buddhism was losing state support in other regions of India, including the lands of the [[Karkota Empire|Karkotas]], the [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Pratiharas]], the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]], the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyas]] and the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]].

There originally seems to have been two main types of monasteries, monastic settlements (''sangharamas'') were built and supported by donors, and woodland camps  (''avasas'') were set up by monks. Whatever structures were built in these locales were made out of wood and were sometimes temporary structures built for the rainy season.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira (1993).

Classic Indian Buddhist institutions mainly made use of the following structures: monasteries, rock-hewn cave complexes such as the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[stupa]]s (funerary mounds which contained relics), and temples such as the [[Mahabodhi Temple]].<ref>Huu Phuoc Le (2010). ''Buddhist Architecture.'' Grafikol.</ref>\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the most widespread institutions are centered on [[wat]]s, which refers to an establishment with various buildings such as an ordination hall, a library, monks' quarters and stupas. East Asian Buddhist institutions also use various structures including monastic halls, temples, lecture halls, bell towers and [[pagoda]]s. In [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Japanese Buddhist temples]], these different structures are usually grouped together in an area termed the ''[[Shichid\u014d garan|Garan]]''. In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist institutions are generally housed in [[Gompa|Gompas]]. They include monastic quarters, stupas and prayer halls with Buddha images. \n\nThe complexity of Buddhist institutions varies, ranging from minimalist and rustic forest monasteries to large monastic centers like [[Tawang Monastery]]. The core of traditional Buddhist institutions is the monastic community (''Sangha)'' who manage and lead religious services. They are supported by the lay community who visit temples and monasteries for religious services and holidays.\n\nIn the modern era, the Buddhist \"meditation centre\", which is mostly used by laypersons and often also staffed by them, has also become widespread.<ref>Schedneck, Brooke (2015).

Like other religions, the findings of modern science has challenged its basic premises. One response to some of these challenges has come to be called [[Buddhist modernism]]. Early Buddhist modernist figures such as the American convert [[Henry Steel Olcott|Henry Olcott]] (1832\u2013 1907) and [[Anagarika Dharmapala]]  (1864\u20131933) reinterpreted and promoted Buddhism as a scientific and rational religion which they saw as compatible with modern science.<ref>Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 378.</ref>\n\n[[East Asian Buddhism]] meanwhile suffered under various wars which ravaged China during the modern era, such as the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping rebellion]] and [[World War II]] (which also affected [[Korean Buddhism]]). During the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republican period]] (1912\u201349), a new movement called [[Humanistic Buddhism]] was developed by figures such as [[Taixu]] (1899\u20131947), and though Buddhist institutions were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u201376), there has been a revival of the religion in China after 1977.<ref>Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, pp. 409\u2013410</ref> [[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] also went through a period of modernisation during the [[Meiji period]].<ref>Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 403.</ref> In [[Central Asia]] meanwhile, the arrival of [[Communism|Communist]] repression to [[Tibet]] (1966\u20131980) and [[Mongolia]]  (between 1924\u20131990) had a strong negative impact on Buddhist institutions, though the situation has improved somewhat since the 80s and 90s.<ref>Harvey, Peter, An Introduction to Buddhism, Teachings, History and Practices, 3rd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2012, pp. 414\u2013417.</ref>\n\n===Buddhism in the West===\n[[File:1893parliament.jpg|right|thumb|1893 [[World Parliament of Religions]] in [[Chicago]]]]\nWhile there were some encounters of Western travellers or missionaries such as St. [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Ippolito Desideri]] with Buddhist cultures, it was not until the 19th century that Buddhism began to be studied by Western scholars. It was the work of pioneering scholars such as [[Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf]], [[Max M\u00fcller]], [[Hermann Oldenberg]] and [[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] that paved the way for modern [[Buddhist studies]] in the West.

The publication and translations of Buddhist literature in Western languages thereafter accelerated. After the [[World War II|second world war]], further immigration from Asia, globalisation, the [[secularisation]] on Western culture as well a renewed interest in Buddhism among the 60s [[counterculture]] led to further growth in Buddhist institutions.<ref>Coleman, James William, ''The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition'', Oxford University Press, pp. 203\u2013204.</ref> Influential figures on post-war [[Buddhism in the West|Western Buddhism]] include [[Shunryu Suzuki]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh]], and the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

[[Buddhist philosophy]], [[Buddhist art]], [[Buddhist architecture]], [[Buddhist cuisine]] and [[Buddhist festivals]] continue to be influential elements of the modern [[Culture of Asia]], especially in East Asia and the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]] as well as in [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Indosphere]]. According to  Litian Fang, Buddhism has \"permeated a wide range of fields, such as politics, ethics, philosophy, literature, art and customs,\" in these Asian regions.<ref>Fang, Litian (2018). ''\"Chinese Buddhism and Traditional Culture,\"'' p. 212. Routledge.</ref>\n\nBuddhist teachings influenced the development of modern [[Hinduism]] as well as other [[Religion in Asia|Asian religions]] like [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. For example, various scholars have argued that key Hindu thinkers such as [[Adi Shankara]] and [[Patanjali]], author of the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]], were influenced by Buddhist ideas.<ref>Nina Mirnig, Peter-Daniel Szanto, Michael Williams (2013).

''Roots of Yoga'' Penguin UK</ref> \n\nBuddhist philosophers like [[Dign\u0101ga|Dignaga]] were very influential in the development of [[Indian logic]] and [[Pramana|epistemology]].<ref>Dreyfus, George (1997). ''Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti\u2019s Philosophy and its Tibetan Interpretations'', Suny, pages 15-16.</ref> Buddhist educational institutions like [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]] preserved various disciplines of classical Indian knowledge such as Grammar and Medicine and received foreign students from China.<ref>Dutt, Sukumar (1962).

This led to high levels of literacy among some traditional Buddhist societies such as Burma. According to David Steinberg, \"Early British observers claimed that Burma was the most literate state between Suez and Japan, and one British traveler in the early nineteenth century believed that Burmese women had a higher percentage of literacy than British women.\"<ref>David Steinberg, David (2013). ''Burma/Myanmar: What Everyone Needs to Know'' p. 26. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nBuddhist institutions were also at the forefront of the adoption of Chinese technologies related to [[bookmaking]], including [[paper]], and [[Woodblock printing|block printing]] which Buddhists sometimes deployed on a large scale. The first surviving example of a printed text is a Buddhist charm, the first full printed book is the Buddhist [[Diamond Sutra]] (c. 868) and the first hand colored print is an illustration of Guanyin dated to 947.<ref>Kieschnick, John (2003) \"The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture\" pp. 177-181. Princeton University Press</ref>\n\nBuddhists were also influential in the study and practice of traditional forms of [[Ayurveda|Indian medicine]]. Buddhists spread these traditional approaches to health, sometimes called \"Buddhist medicine\", throughout East and Southeast Asia, where they remain influential today in Buddhist regions like Sri Lanka, Burma, Tibet and Thailand.<ref>Salguero, C. Pierce (2017) ''\"Buddhism and Medicine: An Anthology of Premodern Sources.\"'' Introduction. Columbia University Press.</ref>\n\nIn the Western world, Buddhism has had a strong influence on modern [[New Age]] spirituality and other alternative spiritualities. This began with its influence on 20th century [[Theosophists]] such as [[Helena Blavatsky]], which were some of the first Westerners to take Buddhism seriously as a spiritual tradition.<ref>Cush, Denise. ''British Buddhism and the New Age'' in The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of New Age Religions edited by James R.

Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1-134-90352-8}}</ref> The Buddha and Buddhist philosophers who follow him such as Vasubandhu and Buddhaghosa, generally argue for this view through by analyzing the person through the schema of the [[five aggregates]], and then attempting to show that none of these five components of personality can be permanent or absolute.<ref>Siderits, Mark (2007). ''\"Buddhism as philosophy,\"'' p. 39</ref> This can be seen in Buddhist discourses such as the ''[[Anattalakkhana Sutta]].''\n\n\"Emptiness\" or \"voidness\" (Skt'': \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101'', Pali: ''Su\u00f1\u00f1at\u0101)'', is a related concept with many different interpretations throughout the various Buddhisms. In early Buddhism, it was commonly stated that all five aggregates are void (''rittaka''), hollow (''tucchaka''), coreless (''as\u0101raka''), for example as in the ''Phe\u1e47api\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bpama Sutta'' (SN 22:95).<ref>Shi Huifeng, ''Is \"Illusion\" a Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Creation?

In Madhyamaka philosophy, emptiness is the view which holds that all phenomena ([[dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|''dharmas'']]) are without any [[svabhava|''svabhava'']] (literally \"own-nature\" or \"self-nature\"), and are thus without any underlying essence, and so are \"empty\" of being independent.

Whatever that may be, \"Buddha\" is still central to all forms of Buddhism.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, a Buddha is someone who has become awake through their own efforts and insight. They have put an end to their cycle of rebirths and have ended all unwholesome mental states which lead to bad action and thus are morally perfected.<ref>Crosby, Kate (2013). ''\"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\"'' p. 16. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> While subject to the limitations of the human body in certain ways (for example, in the early texts, the Buddha suffers from backaches), a Buddha is said to be \"deep, immeasurable, hard-to-fathom as is the great ocean,\" and also has immense psychic powers ([[abhij\u00f1\u0101]]).<ref>Harvey (2013). pp. 27-28.</ref> \n\nTheravada generally sees Gautama Buddha (the historical Buddha Sakyamuni) as the only Buddha of the current era. While he is no longer in this world, he has left us the Dharma (Teaching), the Vinaya (Discipline) and the Sangha (Community).<ref>Crosby, Kate (2013). ''\"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\"'' p. 21. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> There are also said to be two types of Buddhas, a ''sammasambuddha ''is also said to teach the Dharma to others, while a ''[[paccekabuddha]]'' (solitary buddha) does not teach.<ref>Crosby, Kate (2013). ''\"Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity,\"'' p. 16. John Wiley & Sons.</ref>\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism meanwhile, has a vastly expanded [[Buddhist cosmology|cosmology]], with various [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and other holy beings (''aryas'') residing in different realms. Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts not only revere numerous [[Buddhist deities#Buddhas|Buddhas]] besides [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]], such as [[Amit\u0101bha|Amitabha]] and [[Vairochana|Vairocana]], but also see them as transcendental or supramundane (''lokuttara'') beings.<ref>Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, p. 21.</ref> Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism holds that these other Buddhas in other realms can be contacted and are able to benefit beings in this world.<ref>Harvey (2013). p. 162.</ref> In Mah\u0101y\u0101na, a Buddha is a kind of \"spiritual king\", a \"protector of all creatures\" with a lifetime that is countless of eons long, rather than just a human teacher who has transcended the world after death.<ref name=\":8\">Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, p. 27.</ref> [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha Sakyamuni]]'s life and death on earth is then usually understood as a \"mere appearance\" or \"a manifestation skilfully projected into earthly life by a long-enlightened transcendent being, who is still available to teach the faithful through visionary experiences.\"<ref name=\":8\" /><ref>Harvey (2013). p. 164.</ref>\n\n==== Dharma ====\n{{Main|Dharma}}\n\"Dharma\" (Pali: Dhamma) in Buddhism refers to the Buddha's teaching, which includes all of the main ideas outlined above. While this teaching reflects the true nature of reality, it is not a belief to be clung to, but a pragmatic teaching to be put into practice. It is likened to a raft which is \"for crossing over\" (to nirvana) not for holding on to.<ref>Harvey (2013). p. 31.</ref>\n\nIt also refers to the universal law and cosmic order which that teaching both reveals and relies upon.<ref>\"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/dharma.aspx#1 Dharma]\", ''The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions''.</ref> It is an everlasting principle which applies to all beings and worlds. In that sense it is also the ultimate truth and reality about the universe, it is thus \"the way that things really are.\"\n\nThe Dharma is the second of the three jewels which all Buddhists take refuge in. All Buddhas in all worlds, in the past, present and in the future, are believed by Buddhists to understand and teach the Dharma. Indeed, it is part of what makes them a Buddha that they do so. \n\n==== Sangha ====\n{{Main|Sangha|Bodhisattva|Arhat}}\n[[File:Praying monks and nuns in the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple of Singapore.jpg|thumb|Buddhist monks and nuns praying in the [[Buddha Tooth Relic Temple]] of Singapore]] \nThe third \"jewel\" which Buddhists take refuge in is the \"Sangha\", which refers to the monastic community of monks and nuns who follow Gautama Buddha's monastic discipline which was \"designed to shape the Sangha as an ideal community, with the optimum conditions for spiritual growth.\"<ref>Harvey (2013). p. 88.</ref> The Sangha consists of those who have chosen to follow the Buddha's ideal way of life, which is one of celibate monastic renunciation with minimal material possessions (such as an alms bowl and robes).<ref>Gethin (1998) pp. 85 - 88.</ref>  \n\nThe Sangha is seen as important because they preserve and pass down Buddha Dharma. As Gethin states \"the Sangha lives the teaching, preserves the teaching as Scriptures and teaches the wider commmunity. Without the Sangha there is no Buddhism.\"<ref>Gethin (1998) p. 92</ref> \n\nThe Sangha also act as a \"field of merit\" for laypersons, allowing them to make spiritual merit or goodness by donating to the Sangha and supporting them. In return, they keep their duty to preserve and spread the Dharma everywhere for the good of the world.<ref>Gethin (1998) p. 86</ref>  \n\nThe Sangha are also supposed to follow the Vinaya (monastic rule) of the Buddha, thereby serving as an spiritual example for the world and future generations. The Vinaya rules also force the Sangha to live in dependence on the rest of the lay community (they must beg for food etc) and thus draw the Sangha into a relationship with the lay community.<ref>Gethin (1998) p. 93</ref>\n[[File:Ascetic Sumedha and Dipankara Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|A depiction of Siddhartha Gautama in a previous life prostrating before the past Buddha [[Dipankara]].

A Complete Guide to Buddhist Teaching and Practice. London: Century Paperbacks. p. 81</ref> They are seen as having ended rebirth and all the mental defilements. A bodhisattva (\"a being bound for awakening\") meanwhile, is simply a name for someone who is working towards awakening (''bodhi'') as a Buddha. According to all the early buddhist schools as well as Theravada, to be considered a bodhisattva one has to have made a vow in front of a living Buddha and also has to have received a confirmation of one's future Buddhahood.<ref>Drewes, David, ''Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras and Opening of the Bodhisattva Path'', Paper presented at the XVIII the IABS Congress, Toronto 2017, Updated 2019.</ref> In Theravada, the future Buddha is called Metteya (Maitreya) and he is revered as a bodhisatta currently working for future Buddhahood.<ref>Drewes, David, ''Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btras and Opening of the Bodhisattva Path'', Paper presented at the XVIII the IABS Congress, Toronto 2017, Updated 2019.</ref> \n \nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism generally sees the attainment of the arhat as an inferior one, since it is seen as being done only for the sake of individual liberation. It thus promotes the bodhisattva path as the highest and most worthwhile.<ref>Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,''Routledge, 2008, p. 60.</ref> While in Mah\u0101y\u0101na, anyone who has given rise to [[bodhicitta]] (the wish to become a Buddha that arises from a sense of compassion for all beings) is considered a bodhisattva,<ref>Williams, Paul, ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations,'' Routledge, 2008, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref> some of these holy beings (such as [[Maitreya]] and [[Avalokiteshvara]]) have reached very high levels of spiritual attainment and are seen as being very powerful supramundane beings who provide aid to countless beings through their advanced powers.<ref>Harvey (2013). pp. 175-76</ref>\n\n===Other key Mah\u0101y\u0101na views===\n{{Main|Yogachara|Buddha-nature}}\n\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism also differs from Theravada and the other schools of early Buddhism in promoting several unique doctrines which are contained in Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras and philosophical treatises.\n\nOne of these is the unique interpretation of emptiness and dependent origination found in the Madhyamaka school. Another very influential doctrine for Mah\u0101y\u0101na is the main philosophical view of the [[Yogachara|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]] school variously, termed ''Vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101-v\u0101da'' (\"the doctrine that there are only ideas\" or \"mental impressions\") or ''Vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da'' (\"the doctrine of consciousness\"). According to Mark Siderits, what classical Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thinkers like Vasubandhu had in mind is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions, which may appear as external objects, but \"there is actually no such thing outside the mind.\"<ref>Siderits, Mark, ''Buddhism as philosophy'', 2017, p. 149.</ref> There are several interpretations of this main theory, many scholars see it as a type of Idealism, others as a kind of phenomenology.<ref>Gold, Jonathan C., \"Vasubandhu\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2018 Edition), Edward N.

Buddha-nature is a concept found in some 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts, such as the ''[[Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras]]''. According to Paul Williams these [[Sutra]]s suggest that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core inner nature, Self'.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|p=104}}{{refn|group=note|Wayman and Wayman have disagreed with this view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|p=107}}}} According to Karl Brunnholzl \"the earliest mahayana sutras that are based on and discuss the notion of tath\u0101gatagarbha as the buddha potential that is innate in all sentient beings began to appear in written form in the late second and early third century.\"<ref>Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston & London, 2014, page 3.</ref> For some, the doctrine seems to conflict with the Buddhist anatta doctrine (non-Self), leading scholars to posit that the ''Tath\u0101gatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.{{Sfn|Paul Williams|2008|pp=104\u2013105, 108\u2013109; Quote: \"...&nbsp;[The ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra''] refers to the Buddha using the term \"Self\" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics.\"}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101\u2013102}}, Quote: \"Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term.

However, they generally share basic practices such as ''sila'' (ethics), ''samadhi'' (meditation, ''dhyana'') and ''praj\u00f1a'' (wisdom), which are known as the three trainings. An important additional practice is a kind and compassionate attitude toward every living being and the world. [[Buddhist devotion|Devotion]] is also important in some Buddhist traditions, and in the Tibetan traditions visualisations of deities and mandalas are important. The value of textual study is regarded differently in the various Buddhist traditions. It is central to Theravada and highly important to Tibetan Buddhism, while the Zen tradition takes an ambiguous stance.\n\nAn important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the [[Middle Way]] (''madhyamapratipad''). It was a part of Buddha's first sermon, where he presented the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] that was a 'middle way' between the extremes of asceticism and hedonistic sense pleasures.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=23, 81}}{{Sfn|Keown|1996|pp=24, 59}} In Buddhism, states Harvey, the doctrine of \"dependent arising\" (conditioned arising, ''prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da'') to explain rebirth is viewed as the 'middle way' between the doctrines that a being has a \"permanent soul\" involved in rebirth (eternalism) and \"death is final and there is no rebirth\" (annihilationism).{{Sfn|Harvey|2013|p=72}}{{Sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=49, ''antagrahadrsti''}}\n\n=== Paths to liberation in the early texts ===\nA common presentation style of the path (''m\u0101rga'') to liberation in the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] is the \"graduated talk\", in which the Buddha lays out a step by step training.<ref>Carole Anderson (2013), ''Pain and its Ending'', p.143</ref>\n\nIn the early texts, numerous different sequences of the gradual path can be found.<ref name=\":0\">Bucknell, Rod, \"The Buddhist Path to Liberation: An Analysis of the Listing of Stages\", ''The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' Volume 7, Number 2, 1984</ref> One of the most important and widely used presentations among the various Buddhist schools is The [[Noble Eightfold Path]], or \"Eightfold Path of the Noble Ones\" (Skt. ''<nowiki/>'\u0101ry\u0101\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45gam\u0101rga''').

The practice of giving for example, is one form of cultivating renunciation. Another one is the giving up of lay life and becoming a monastic (''bhiksu'' o ''bhiksuni'').<ref>Harvey, Peter (1990). ''\"An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices,''\" p. 199.

Lopez Jr. (2013) \"The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism,\" p. 18.

Devout laypersons also follow this rule during special days of religious observance (''[[uposatha]]'').<ref>Johnston, William M. (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism'', Routledge, 2013, p. 467-468.</ref> Observing the Uposatha also includes other practices dealing with renunciation, mainly the [[eight precepts]]. \n\nFor Buddhist monastics, renunciation can also be trained through several optional ascetic practices called ''[[Dhutanga|dhuta\u1e45ga]]''.  \n\nIn different Buddhist traditions, other related [[Fasting in Buddhism|practices which focus on fasting]] are followed.\n\n=== Mindfulness and Clear Comprehension ===\nThe training of the faculty called [[Sati (Buddhism)|\"mindfulness\"]] (Pali: ''sati'', Sanskrit: ''sm\u1e5bti,'' literally meaning \"recollection, remembering\") is central in Buddhism. According to Analayo, mindfulness is a full awareness of the present moment which enhances and strengthens memory.<ref>Analayo (2018) ''\"Satipatthana Meditation, A Practice Guide,\"'' chapter 1.

Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions.

He argues that Buddhist texts even directly copied various Shaiva tantras, especially the Bhairava Vidyapitha tantras.<ref>Sanderson, Alexis. \"The \u015aaiva Age: The Rise and Dominance of \u015aaivism during the Early Medieval Period.\" In: Genesis and Development of Tantrism, edited by Shingo Einoo.

Indian Esoteric Buddhism: A Social History of the Tantric Movement, p. 204.</ref> and that the Shaiva tradition also appropriated non-Hindu deities, texts and traditions. Thus while \"there can be no question that the Buddhist tantras were heavily influenced by [[Kapalika]] and other Saiva movements\" argues Davidson, \"the influence was apparently mutual.\"<ref>Davidson, Ronald M.

There originally seems to have been two main types of monasteries, monastic settlements (''sangharamas'') were built and supported by donors, and woodland camps  (''avasas'') were set up by monks.

Classic Indian Buddhist institutions mainly made use of the following structures: monasteries, rock-hewn cave complexes such as the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[stupa]]s (funerary mounds which contained relics), and temples such as the [[Mahabodhi Temple]].<ref>Huu Phuoc Le (2010).

Grafikol.</ref>\n\nIn Southeast Asia, the most widespread institutions are centered on [[wat]]s, which refers to an establishment with various buildings such as an ordination hall, a library, monks' quarters and stupas. East Asian Buddhist institutions also use various structures including monastic halls, temples, lecture halls, bell towers and [[pagoda]]s. In [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Japanese Buddhist temples]], these different structures are usually grouped together in an area termed the ''[[Shichid\u014d garan|Garan]]''. In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist institutions are generally housed in [[Gompa|Gompas]].

The core of traditional Buddhist institutions is the monastic community (''Sangha)'' who manage and lead religious services. They are supported by the lay community who visit temples and monasteries for religious services and holidays.\n\nIn the modern era, the Buddhist \"meditation centre\", which is mostly used by laypersons and often also staffed by them, has also become widespread.<ref>Schedneck, Brooke (2015).

Like other religions, the findings of modern science has challenged its basic premises. One response to some of these challenges has come to be called [[Buddhist modernism]].

The publication and translations of Buddhist literature in Western languages thereafter accelerated.

[[Buddhist philosophy]], [[Buddhist art]], [[Buddhist architecture]], [[Buddhist cuisine]] and [[Buddhist festivals]] continue to be influential elements of the modern [[Culture of Asia]], especially in East Asia and the [[East Asian cultural sphere|Sinosphere]] as well as in [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Indosphere]]. According to  Litian Fang, Buddhism has \"permeated a wide range of fields, such as politics, ethics, philosophy, literature, art and customs,\" in these Asian regions.<ref>Fang, Litian (2018). ''\"Chinese Buddhism and Traditional Culture,\"'' p. 212. Routledge.</ref>\n\nBuddhist teachings influenced the development of modern [[Hinduism]] as well as other [[Religion in Asia|Asian religions]] like [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. For example, various scholars have argued that key Hindu thinkers such as [[Adi Shankara]] and [[Patanjali]], author of the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga sutras]], were influenced by Buddhist ideas.<ref>Nina Mirnig, Peter-Daniel Szanto, Michael Williams (2013).

This led to high levels of literacy among some traditional Buddhist societies such as Burma. According to David Steinberg, \"Early British observers claimed that Burma was the most literate state between Suez and Japan, and one British traveler in the early nineteenth century believed that Burmese women had a higher percentage of literacy than British women.\"<ref>David Steinberg, David (2013). ''Burma/Myanmar: What Everyone Needs to Know'' p. 26. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nBuddhist institutions were also at the forefront of the adoption of Chinese technologies related to [[bookmaking]], including [[paper]], and [[Woodblock printing|block printing]] which Buddhists sometimes deployed on a large scale. The first surviving example of a printed text is a Buddhist charm, the first full printed book is the Buddhist [[Diamond Sutra]] (c. 868) and the first hand colored print is an illustration of Guanyin dated to 947.<ref>Kieschnick, John (2003) \"The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture\" pp. 177-181. Princeton University Press</ref>\n\nBuddhists were also influential in the study and practice of traditional forms of [[Ayurveda|Indian medicine]]. Buddhists spread these traditional approaches to health, sometimes called \"Buddhist medicine\", throughout East and Southeast Asia, where they remain influential today in Buddhist regions like Sri Lanka, Burma, Tibet and Thailand.<ref>Salguero, C. Pierce (2017) ''\"Buddhism and Medicine: An Anthology of Premodern Sources.\"'' Introduction. Columbia University Press.</ref>\n\nIn the Western world, Buddhism has had a strong influence on modern [[New Age]] spirituality and other alternative spiritualities. This began with its influence on 20th century [[Theosophists]] such as [[Helena Blavatsky]], which were some of the first Westerners to take Buddhism seriously as a spiritual tradition.<ref>Cush, Denise. ''British Buddhism and the New Age'' in The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of New Age Religions edited by James R.

Formerly Associate Professor in Social Ecology at the University of Western Sydney, she has lectured in New York, Manila, Toronto and, most recently, was a Visiting Professor at Lund University (Sweden).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wikipeacewomen.org/wpworg/en/?page_id=5720|title=Wiki Peace Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to [[idealism|idealist]] ecofeminisms coming from [[philosophy]] and [[cultural studies]], Salleh's analysis is close to that of fellow sociologists [[Maria Mies]] in [[Germany]] and Mary Mellor in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Reproductive labor]] and use value are central themes here. Her own \"embodied materialism\" addresses resistance to [[globalisation]] through the movement of movements, introducing the term \"meta-industrial labour\" to integrate indigenous, peasant, women's, and worker politics under the banner of ecology.\n\nHer book ''Ecofeminism as Politics: nature, Marx and the postmodern'' outlines the scope of a materialist ecofeminism, proposing a transdisciplinary analysis of the embodied roots of capitalist patriarchal globalisation. The book is one of the earliest [[eco-socialist]] statements. Salleh traces the effects of what she sees as the \"originary contradiction\": economic resourcing of labour (women's bodies in the first instance) \"as nature\" and the [[eurocentric]] ideology of \"humanity v nature\" used to justify that systemic exploitation.\n\nSalleh exemplifies the marxist argument that hands-on praxis is essential to grounded political theory. She was a convener of the [[Movement Against Uranium Mining]] in Sydney, 1976, and helped found [[Greens New South Wales|The Greens]] in 1985. She worked on the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] with [[Women's Environment & Development Organization]]; on local catchment struggles in the mid 90s; and from 2001-04 acted as ecologist/critic on the Australian federal government's Gene Technology Ethics Committee.\n\nAriel Salleh works at en/gendering dialogue between advocates of ecofeminist and eco-socialist politics. Her writing has addressed this terrain since the early 1980s and she was an original signatory to the 2001 ''Eco-socialist Manifesto''. Her critical studies of green thought, environmental ethics, and [[ecopolitics]], run to some 100 articles and chapters. She lectures on ecofeminism internationally.\n\n==Selected works==\n*(2015) with James Goodman and Hamed Hosseini, 'From Sociological Imagination to Ecological Imagination' in Jonathan Marshall and Linda Connor (eds.), ''Environmental Change and the World's Futures: Ecologies, Ontologies, Mythologies''.

Formerly Associate Professor in Social Ecology at the University of Western Sydney, she has lectured in New York, Manila, Toronto and, most recently, was a Visiting Professor at Lund University (Sweden).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wikipeacewomen.org/wpworg/en/?page_id=5720|title=Wiki Peace Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to [[idealism|idealist]] ecofeminisms coming from [[philosophy]] and [[cultural studies]], Salleh's analysis is close to that of fellow sociologists [[Maria Mies]] in [[Germany]] and Mary Mellor in the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Reproductive labour]] and use value are central themes here. Her own \"embodied materialism\" addresses resistance to [[globalisation]] through the movement of movements, introducing the term \"meta-industrial labour\" to integrate indigenous, peasant, women's, and worker politics under the banner of ecology.\n\nHer book ''Ecofeminism as Politics: nature, Marx and the postmodern'' outlines the scope of a materialist ecofeminism, proposing a transdisciplinary analysis of the embodied roots of capitalist patriarchal globalisation. The book is one of the earliest [[eco-socialist]] statements. Salleh traces the effects of what she sees as the \"originary contradiction\": economic resourcing of labour (women's bodies in the first instance) \"as nature\" and the [[eurocentric]] ideology of \"humanity v nature\" used to justify that systemic exploitation.\n\nSalleh exemplifies the marxist argument that hands-on praxis is essential to grounded political theory. She was a convener of the [[Movement Against Uranium Mining]] in Sydney, 1976, and helped found [[Greens New South Wales|The Greens]] in 1985. She worked on the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] with [[Women's Environment & Development Organization]]; on local catchment struggles in the mid 90s; and from 2001-04 acted as ecologist/critic on the Australian federal government's Gene Technology Ethics Committee.\n\nAriel Salleh works at en/gendering dialogue between advocates of ecofeminist and eco-socialist politics. Her writing has addressed this terrain since the early 1980s and she was an original signatory to the 2001 ''Eco-socialist Manifesto''. Her critical studies of green thought, environmental ethics, and [[ecopolitics]], run to some 100 articles and chapters. She lectures on ecofeminism internationally.\n\n==Selected works==\n*(2015) with James Goodman and Hamed Hosseini, 'From Sociological Imagination to Ecological Imagination' in Jonathan Marshall and Linda Connor (eds.), ''Environmental Change and the World's Futures: Ecologies, Ontologies, Mythologies''.
