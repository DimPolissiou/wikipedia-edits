Sony started working on [[Betamax]], while Matsushita started working on [[VX (videocassette format)|VX]]. JVC released the CR-6060 in 1975, based on the U-matic format.

JVC cut its budgets and restructured its video division, shelving the VHS project. However, despite the lack of funding, Takano and Shiraishi continued to work on the project in secret. By 1973, the two engineers had produced a functional prototype.<ref name=\"rickmaybury\" />\n\n=== Competition with Betamax ===\nIn 1974, the Japanese [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] (MITI), desiring to avoid [[consumer confusion]], attempted to force the Japanese video industry to standardize on just one home video recording format.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bylund |first=Anders |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/guides/2010/01/is-the-end-of-the-format-wars-upon-us.ars |title=The format wars: of lasers and (creative) destruction |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> Later, Sony had a functional prototype of the [[Betamax]] format, and was very close to releasing a finished product. With this prototype, Sony persuaded the MITI to adopt Betamax as the standard, and allow it to license the technology to other companies.<ref name=\"rickmaybury\" />\n\nJVC believed that an [[open standard]], with the format shared among competitors without licensing the technology, was better for the consumer. To prevent the MITI from adopting Betamax, JVC worked to convince other companies, in particular [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (Japan's largest electronics manufacturer at the time, marketing its products under the National brand in most territories and the Panasonic brand in North America, and JVC's majority stockholder), to accept VHS, and thereby work against Sony and the MITI.<ref name=\"howells\">John Howells. \"The Management of Innovation and Technology: The Shaping of Technology and Institutions of the Market Economy\" [hardcopy], pg 76-81</ref> Matsushita agreed, primarily out of concern that Sony might become the leader in the field if its proprietary Betamax format was the only one allowed to be manufactured.

However, the collaboration of JVC and its partners was much stronger, and eventually led the MITI to drop its push for an industry standard.

The flip-up cover that protects the tape has a built-in latch with a push-in toggle on the right side (bottom view image). The VHS cassette also includes an anti-despooling mechanism consisting of several plastic parts between the plastic spools, near the front of the tape (white and black in the top view). The spool latches are released by a push-in lever within a 6.35&nbsp;mm (\u00bc inch) hole accessed from the bottom of the cassette, 19&nbsp;mm (\u00be inch) inwards from the edge label.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The tapes are made, duplicated and inserted into the cassettes in [[cleanroom]]s, to ensure quality, and prevent dust from getting embedded into the tape and interfering with the duplication process (both of which could cause signal dropouts)\n\nThere is a clear tape leader at both ends of the tape to provide an optical auto-stop for the VCR transport mechanism. A light source is inserted into the cassette through the circular hole in the center of the underside when loaded in the VCR, and two [[photodiode]]s are located to the left and right sides of where the tape exits the cassette. When the clear tape reaches one of these, enough light will pass through the tape to the photodiode to trigger the stop function; in more sophisticated machines it will start rewinding the cassette when the trailing end is detected. Early VCRs used an [[incandescent bulb]] as the light source, which regularly failed and caused the VCR to erroneously think that a cassette is loaded when empty, or would detect the blown bulb and stop functioning completely.

More frequently however, VHS tapes are thicker than the required minimum to avoid complications such as jams or tears in the tape.<ref name=\"Parekh\" /> Other speeds include \"long play\" (LP), and \"extended play\" (EP) or \"super long play\" (SLP) (standard on NTSC; rarely found on PAL machines). For NTSC, LP and EP/SLP doubles and triples the recording time accordingly, but these speed reductions cause a reduction in video quality \u2013 from the normal 250 lines in SP, to 230 analog lines horizontal in LP and even less in EP/SLP. The slower speeds cause a very noticeable reduction in linear (non-hifi) audio track quality as well, as the linear tape speed becomes much lower than what is commonly considered a satisfactory minimum for audio recording.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Tape lengths ===\nBoth [[Multi-standard television|NTSC and PAL/SECAM]] VHS cassettes are physically identical (although the signals recorded on the tape are incompatible). However, as tape speeds differ between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, the playing time for any given cassette will vary accordingly between the systems. In order to avoid confusion, manufacturers indicate the playing time in minutes that can be expected for the market the tape is sold in. It is perfectly possible to record and play back a blank T-XXX tape in a PAL machine or a blank E-XXX tape in an NTSC machine, but the resulting playing time will be different from that indicated.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nTo calculate the playing time for a T-XXX tape in a PAL machine, use this formula:\n\n: PAL/SECAM Recording Time = T-XXX in minutes * (1.426)\n\nTo calculate the playing time for an E-XXX tape in an NTSC machine, use this formula:\n\n: NTSC Recording Time = E-XXX in minutes * (0.701)\n\n* E-XXX indicates playing time in minutes for PAL or SECAM in SP and LP speeds.\n* T-XXX indicates playing time in minutes for NTSC or PAL-M in SP, LP, and EP/SLP speeds.\n* SP is Standard Play, LP is Long Play ({{frac|1|2}} speed, equal to recording time in DVHS \"HS\" mode), EP/SLP is extended/super long play ({{frac|1|3}} speed) which was primarily released into the NTSC market.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common tape lengths\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Tape label\n(nominal length in minutes)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Tape length\n! colspan=\"3\" | Rec. time (NTSC)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Rec. time (PAL)\n|-\n! m !! ft\n!

Despite the [[generation loss]], this was regarded as a widespread problem, which the members of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) claimed caused them great financial losses. In response, several companies developed technologies to protect copyrighted VHS tapes from casual duplication by home users.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe most popular method was [[Macrovision]], produced by a company of the same name. According to Macrovision: <blockquote>\"The technology is applied to over 550 million videocassettes annually and is used by every [[MPAA]] movie studio on some or all of their videocassette releases. Over 220 commercial duplication facilities around the world are equipped to supply Macrovision videocassette copy protection to rights owners...The study found that over 30% of VCR households admit to having unauthorized copies, and that the total annual revenue loss due to copying is estimated at $370,000,000 annually.\"{{Citation needed|reason=No source for actual study|date=April 2018}}</blockquote>\n\nThe system was first used in copyrighted movies beginning with the 1984 film ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]''.<ref name=\"deatley19850907\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lc8vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1Y0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5630%2C870934 | title=VCRs put entertainment industry into fast-forward frenzy | work=The Free Lance-Star | date=September 7, 1985 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=2015-01-25 | author=De Atley, Richard | pages=12-TV}}</ref>\n\nMacrovision copy protection saw refinement throughout its years, but has always worked by essentially introducing deliberate errors into a protected VHS tape's output video stream. These errors in the output video stream are ignored by most televisions, but will interfere with re-recording of programming by a second VCR. The first version of Macrovision introduces high signal levels during the [[vertical blanking interval]], which occurs between the video fields. These high levels confuse the [[automatic gain control]] circuit in most VHS VCRs, leading to varying brightness levels in an output video, but are ignored by the TV as they are out of the frame-display period.  \"Level II\" Macrovision uses a process called \"colorstriping,\" which inverts the analog signal's colorburst period and causes off-color bands to appear in the picture. Level III protection added additional colorstriping techniques to further degrade the image.<ref name=\"anarchivism-rip-vhs\">{{cite web |url=http://anarchivism.org/w/How_to_Rip_VHS |title=How to Rip VHS |work=Anarchivism |date=December 14, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThese protection methods worked well to defeat analog-to-analog copying by VCRs of the time. Products capable of digital video recording are mandated by law to include features which detect Macrovision encoding of input analog streams, and reject copying of the video.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}  Both intentional and false-positive detection of Macrovision protection has [[Opposition to copyright|frustrated archivists]] who wish to copy now-fragile VHS tapes to a digital format for preservation.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Devices marketed as \"Video Stabilizers\" may be used to attempt removal of the Macrovision copy protection mechanism. <ref>http://www.cornerspeed.co.za/video-stabilizer.htmlhttp://www.cornerspeed.co.za/video-stabilizer.html</ref><ref>http://www.rcdistributing.com/model-dvs-2.html</ref><ref>http://www.qualitekindustries.com/bvistrwi6feg.html</ref>\n\n== Recording process ==\n[[File:Medion MD8910 - Inject and eject of a VHS cassette.webm|thumb|left|A close-up process of how the magnetic tape in a VHS cassette is being pulled from the cassette shell to the head drum of the VCR.]]\n[[File:VHS-diagonal-helical-recording.jpg|right|thumb|300px|This illustration demonstrates the helical wrap of the tape around the head drum, and shows the points where the video, audio and control tracks are recorded.]]\nThe recording process in VHS consists of the following steps, in this order:\n* The tape is pulled from the supply reel by a capstan and pinch roller, similar to those used in audio tape recorders. \n* The tape passes across the erase head, which wipes any existing recording from the tape.\n* The tape is wrapped around the head drum, using a little more than 180 degrees of the drum.\n* One of the heads on the spinning drum records one field of video onto the tape, in one diagonally oriented track. \n* The tape passes across the audio and control head, which records the control track and the linear audio track or tracks. \n* The tape is wound onto the take-up reel due to torque applied to the reel by the machine.\n\n=== Erase head ===\nThe erase head is fed by a high level, high frequency AC signal that overwrites any previous recording on the tape.<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/audio/tape.html Tape Recording], Georgia State University</ref> Without this step, the new recording cannot be guaranteed to completely replace any old recording that might have been on the tape.\n\n=== Video recording ===\n[[File:Kopftrommel 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Panasonic Hi-Fi six-head drum VEH0548 installed on G mechanism as an example, demonstrated a typical VHS head drum containing two tape heads.

The head rotates constantly at <ref>The 1800 rpm tape head speed, and corresponding field period time, etc., quoted in this article for NTSC machines are based on the old black and white RS-170 standard. When this was adapted for color under the NTSC standard the actual field time was altered to 1/59.94 of a second, so the actual VHS head rotation speed is accordingly 1798.2 rpm. The pre-color timings are quoted here for simplicity. The corresponding numbers here for PAL are, on the other hand, exact, as PAL's field rate is exactly 1/50 of a second.</ref> 1798.2 rpm in NTSC machines, exactly 1500 in PAL, each complete rotation corresponding to one frame of video.\n\nTwo [[tape head]]s are mounted on the cylindrical surface of the drum, 180 degrees apart from each other, so that the two heads \"take turns\" in recording. The rotation of the head drum, combined with the relatively slow movement of the tape, results in each head recording a track oriented at a diagonal with respect to the length of the tape. This is referred to as [[helical scan]] recording.\n\nTo maximize the use of the tape, the video tracks are recorded very close together to each other. To reduce [[crosstalk]] between adjacent tracks on playback, an [[azimuth recording]] method is used: The gaps of the two heads are not aligned exactly with the track path. Instead, one head is angled at plus seven degrees from the track, and the other at minus seven degrees. This results, during playback, in destructive interference of the signal from the tracks on either side of the one being played.\n\nEach of the diagonal-angled tracks is a complete TV picture field, lasting 1/60 of a second (1/50 on PAL) on the display. One [[tape head]] records an entire picture field. The adjacent track, recorded by the second tape head, is another 1/60 or 1/50 of a second TV picture field, and so on. Thus one complete head rotation records an entire NTSC or PAL frame of two fields.\n\nThe original VHS specification had only two video heads. Later models implemented at least one more pair of heads, which were used at (and optimized for) the EP tape speed. In machines supporting VHS HiFi (described later), yet another pair of heads was added to handle the VHS HiFi signal. Drums can contain 2, 4, 6 or 8 heads. \n\nThe high tape-to-head speed created by the rotating head results in a far higher bandwidth than could be practically achieved with a stationary head. \nVHS tapes have approximately 3 [[Megahertz|MHz]] of video [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and 400&nbsp;kHz of chroma bandwidth. The [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] (black and white) portion of the video is recorded as a [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]], with a down-converted \n\"[[Heterodyne#Analog videotape recording|color under]]\" [[Chrominance|chroma]] (color) signal recorded directly at the baseband. Each helical track contains a single field ('even' or 'odd' field, equivalent to half a frame) encoded as an analog [[raster scan]], similar to analog TV broadcasts. The horizontal resolution is 240 lines per picture height, or about 320 lines across a scan line, and the vertical resolution (the number of scan lines) is the same as the respective analog TV standard (576 for [[PAL]] or 486 for [[NTSC]]; usually, somewhat fewer scan lines are actually visible due to [[overscan]]). In modern-day digital terminology, NTSC VHS is roughly equivalent to 333\u00d7480 pixels luma and 40\u00d7480 chroma resolutions (333\u00d7480 pixels=159,840 pixels or 0.16 MP (1/6 of a megapixel)),<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor|first=Jim|title=DVD demystified|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2005|isbn=0-07-142396-6|pages=9\u201336|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ikxuL2aX9cAC|accessdate= January 22, 2017}}</ref> while PAL VHS offers the equivalent of about 335\u00d7576 pixels luma and 40\u00d7576 chroma (the vertical chroma resolution of PAL is not limited by any mechanism; SECAM is limited in resolution by a delay line mechanism).\n\nJVC countered 1985's SuperBeta with VHS HQ, or High Quality. The frequency modulation of the VHS luminance signal is limited to 3 megahertz, which makes higher resolutions technically impossible even with the highest-quality recording heads and tape materials, but an HQ branded deck includes luminance noise reduction, chroma noise reduction, white clip extension, and improved sharpness circuitry. The effect was to increase the apparent horizontal resolution of a VHS recording from 240 to 250 analog (equivalent to 333 pixels from left-to-right, in digital terminology). The major VHS [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]]s resisted HQ due to cost concerns, eventually resulting in JVC reducing the requirements for the HQ brand to white clip extension plus one other improvement.\n\nIn 1987, JVC introduced a new format called [[S-VHS|Super VHS]] (often known as S-VHS) which extended the bandwidth to over 5 megahertz, yielding 420 analog horizontal (560 pixels left-to-right). Most Super VHS recorders can play back standard VHS tapes, but not vice versa. S-VHS was designed for higher resolution, but failed to gain popularity outside Japan because of the high costs of the machines and tapes.<ref name=\"Parekh\" /> Because of the limited user base, Super VHS was never picked up to any significant degree by manufacturers of pre-recorded tapes, although it was used extensively in the low-end professional market for filming and editing.\n\n=== Audio recording ===\n\nAfter leaving the head drum, the tape passes over the stationary audio and control head. This records a control track at the bottom edge of the tape, and one or two linear audio tracks along the top edge.\n\n==== Original linear audio system ====\nIn the original VHS specification, audio was recorded as [[baseband]] in a single linear track, at the upper edge of the tape, similar to how an audio [[compact cassette]] operates. The recorded frequency range was dependent on the linear tape speed. For the VHS SP mode, which already uses a lower tape speed than the compact cassette, this resulted in a mediocre frequency response of roughly 100&nbsp;Hz to 10&nbsp;kHz for NTSC,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} frequency response for PAL VHS with its lower standard tape speed was somewhat worse. The [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) was an acceptable 42&nbsp;dB. Both parameters degraded significantly with VHS's longer play modes, with EP/NTSC frequency response peaking at 4&nbsp;kHz. Using S-VHS tapes, however, can yield better audio (and video) quality due to the tapes being designed with almost twice the bandwidth in mind with the same speed.\n\nAudio cannot be recorded on a VHS tape without recording a video signal, even in the audio dubbing mode. If there is no video signal to the VCR input, most VCRs will record black video as well as generate a control track while the audio is being recorded. Some early VCRs would record audio without a control track signal, but this was of little practical use since the absence of a control track signal meant that the linear tape speed was irregular during playback.\n\nMore expensive decks offered stereo audio recording and playback. Linear stereo, as it was called, fit two independent channels in the same space as the original mono audiotrack. While this approach preserved acceptable backward compatibility with monoaural audio heads, the splitting of the audio track degraded the signal's SNR to the point that audible tape hiss was objectionable at normal listening volume. To counteract tape hiss, decks applied [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby B noise reduction]] for recording and playback. Dolby B dynamically boosts the mid-frequency band of the audio program on the recorded medium, improving its signal strength relative to the tape's background noise floor, then attenuates the mid-band during playback. Dolby B is not a transparent process, and Dolby-encoded program material will exhibit an unnatural mid-range emphasis when played on non-Dolby capable VCRs. Another alternative would be using noise reduction systems similar to DBX, that is, by recording audio with high volume but with dynamic range compression. On playback the decompression will yield original audio but since weaker signals get attenuated the hiss can also be significantly attenuated.\n\nHigh-end consumer recorders took advantage of the linear nature of the audio track, as the audio track could be erased and recorded without disturbing the video portion of the recorded signal. Hence, \"audio dubbing\" and \"video dubbing\", where either the audio or video are re-recorded on tape (without disturbing the other), were supported features on [[prosumer]] [[linear video editing]]-decks. Without dubbing capability, an audio or video edit could not be done in-place on master cassette, and requires the editing output be captured to another tape, incurring generational loss.\n\nStudio film releases began to emerge with linear stereo audiotracks in 1982. From that point onward nearly every home video release by Hollywood featured a Dolby-encoded linear stereo audiotrack. However, linear stereo was never popular with equipment makers or consumers.\n\n==== Tracking adjustment and index marking ====\nAnother linear [[control track|''control'' track]], at the tape's lower edge, holds pulses that mark the beginning of every frame of video; these are used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback, so that the high speed rotating heads remained exactly on their helical tracks rather than somewhere between two adjacent tracks (known as \"[[video tape tracking|tracking]]\"). Since good tracking depends on precise distances between the rotating drum and the fixed control/audio head reading the linear tracks, which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, most VCRs offer tracking adjustment, either manual or automatic, to correct such mismatches.\n\nThe control track is also used to hold ''index marks'', which were normally written at the beginning of each recording session, and can be found using the VCR's ''index search'' function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the ''n''th specified index mark, and resume playback from there. At times, higher-end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crutchfield.com/S-PFiOFC1Dt8s/learn/learningcenter/home/vcr_glossary.html|title=VCRs Glossary|author=Loren Barstow|work=Crutchfield}}</ref><ref>[http://www.retrevo.com/support/JVC-HR-S7300U-VCRs-manual/id/318ag718/t/2/ JVC HR-S7300 manual]: features list: ''\"..., Index Search, Manual Index Mark/Erase ...\"''</ref> \u2014 so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the [[television program]] \u2014 but this feature later became hard to find.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nBy the late 1990s, some high-end VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing. For example, Panasonic's Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette, and logged recording information (channel, date, time and optional program title entered by the user) both on the cassette and in the VCR's memory for up to 900 recordings (600 with titles).<ref>[https://archive.is/20120729233622/http://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/instrukcjeobslugi?id=2176 Panasonic Video Cassette Recorder NV-HS960 Series Operating Instructions], VQT8880, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.</ref>\n\n==== Hi-Fi audio system ====\nAround 1984, JVC added ''Hi-Fi'' audio to VHS (model HR-D725U, in response to Betamax's introduction of Beta Hi-Fi.) Both VHS Hi-Fi and Betamax Hi-Fi delivered flat full-range frequency response (20&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz), excellent 70&nbsp;dB [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (in consumer space, second only to the [[compact disc]]), [[dynamic range]] of 90&nbsp;dB, and [[professional audio]]-grade channel separation (more than 70&nbsp;dB). VHS Hi-Fi audio is achieved by using audio frequency modulation (AFM), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and embedding the combined modulated audio signal pair into the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS's implementation of AFM relied on a form of magnetic recording called ''depth [[multiplexing]]''. The modulated [[Sound recording|audio]] carrier pair was placed in the hitherto-unused frequency range between the luminance and the color carrier (below 1.6&nbsp;MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal (combined luminance and color signal) over the same tape surface, but the video signal's higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use this same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head's signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head's signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process was audio of high fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP, LP or SP.) Since JVC had gone through the complexity of ensuring Hi-Fi's backward compatibility with non-Hi-Fi VCRs, virtually all studio home video releases produced after this time contained Hi-Fi audio tracks, in addition to the linear audio track. Under normal circumstances, all Hi-Fi VHS VCRs will record Hi-Fi and linear audio simultaneously to ensure compatibility with VCRs without Hi-Fi playback, though only early high-end Hi-Fi machines provided linear stereo compatibility.\n\nThe sound quality of Hi-Fi VHS stereo is comparable to some extent to the quality of CD audio, particularly when recordings were made on high-end or professional VHS machines that have a manual audio recording level control. This high quality compared to other consumer audio recording formats such as [[compact cassette]] attracted the attention of amateur and hobbyist recording artists. [[Home recording]] enthusiasts occasionally recorded high quality stereo [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixdown]]s and [[master recording]]s from [[multitrack recording|multitrack]] audio tape onto consumer-level Hi-Fi VCRs. However, because the VHS Hi-Fi recording process is intertwined with the VCR's video-recording function, advanced editing functions such as audio-only or video-only dubbing are impossible. A short-lived alternative to the hifi feature for recording mixdowns of hobbyist audio-only projects was a [[PCM adaptor]] so that high-bandwidth digital video could use a grid of black-and-white dots on an analog video carrier to give pro-grade digital sounds though [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] tapes made this obsolete.\n\nSome VHS decks also had a \"simulcast\" switch, allowing users to record an external audio input along with off-air pictures. Some televised concerts offered a stereo simulcast soundtrack on FM radio and as such, events like ''[[Live Aid]]'' were recorded by thousands of people with a full stereo soundtrack despite the fact that stereo TV broadcasts were some years off (especially in regions that adopted [[NICAM]]). Other examples of this included network television shows such as ''[[Friday Night Videos]]'' and [[MTV]] for its first few years in existence. Likewise, some countries, most notably [[South Africa]], provided alternate language audio tracks for TV programming through an FM radio simulcast.\n\nThe considerable complexity and additional hardware limited VHS Hi-Fi to high-end decks for many years. While linear stereo all but disappeared from home VHS decks, it was not until the 1990s that Hi-Fi became a more common feature on VHS decks. Even then, most customers were unaware of its significance and merely enjoyed the better audio performance of the newer decks.\n\n===== Issues with Hi-Fi audio =====\nDue to the path followed by the video and Hi-Fi audio heads being striped and discontinuous\u2014unlike that of the linear audio track\u2014head-switching is required to provide a continuous audio signal. While the video signal can easily hide the head-switching point in the invisible vertical retrace section of the signal, so that the exact switching point is not very important, the same is obviously not possible with a continuous audio signal that has no inaudible sections. Hi-Fi audio is thus dependent on a much more exact alignment of the head switching point than is required for non-HiFi VHS machines. Misalignments may lead to imperfect joining of the signal, resulting in low-pitched buzzing.<ref name=\"stason\">{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/general/14-18-Is-VHS-Hi-Fi-sound-perfect-Is-Beta-Hi-Fi-sound-perfec.html14.18|title=14.18 Is VHS Hi-Fi sound perfect? Is Beta Hi-Fi sound perfect?|work=stason.org | accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> The problem is known as \"head chatter\", and tends to increase as the audio heads wear down.\n\nAnother issue that made VHS Hi-Fi imperfect for music is the inaccurate reproduction of levels (softer and louder) which are not re-created as the original source.<ref name=\"stason\"/>\n\n== Variations ==\n[[File:JVC-VHS Cassette001.JPG|thumb|[[JVC|Victor]] S-VHS (left) and S-VHS-C (right).]]\n\n=== Super-VHS / ADAT / SVHS-ET ===\n{{main|S-VHS|D-VHS}}\nSeveral improved versions of VHS exist, most notably [[S-VHS|Super-VHS (S-VHS)]], an analog video standard with improved video bandwidth. S-VHS improved the horizontal luminance resolution to 400 lines (versus 250 for VHS/Beta and 500 for DVD). The audio system (both linear and AFM) is the same. S-VHS made little impact on the home market, but gained dominance in the camcorder market due to its superior picture quality.\n\nThe [[ADAT]] format provides the ability to record multitrack digital audio using S-VHS media. JVC also developed SVHS-ET technology for its Super-VHS camcorders and VCRs, which simply allows them to record Super VHS signals onto lower-priced VHS tapes, albeit with a slight blurring of the image. Nearly all later Super-VHS camcorders and VCRs have SVHS-ET ability.\n\n=== VHS-C / Super VHS-C ===\n{{main|VHS-C}}\nAnother variant is [[VHS-C|VHS-Compact (VHS-C)]], originally developed for portable VCRs in 1982, but ultimately finding success in palm-sized [[camcorder]]s. The longest tape available for NTSC holds 60 minutes in SP mode and 180 minutes in EP mode. Since VHS-C tapes are based on the same magnetic tape as full-size tapes, they can be played back in standard VHS players using a mechanical adapter, without the need of any kind of signal conversion. The magnetic tape on VHS-C cassettes is wound on one main spool and uses a gear wheel to advance the tape.<ref name=\"Parekh\" />\n\nThe adapter is mechanical, although early examples were motorized, with a battery. It has an internal hub to engage with the VCR mechanism in the location of a normal full-size tape hub, driving the gearing on the VHS-C cassette. Also, when a VHS-C cassette is inserted into the adapter, a small swing-arm pulls the tape out of the miniature cassette to span the standard tape path distance between the guide rollers of a full-size tape. This allows the tape from the miniature cassette to use the same loading mechanism as that from the standard cassette.\n\nSuper VHS-C or [[S-VHS]] Compact was developed by [[JVC]] in 1987. S-VHS provided an improved luminance and chrominance quality, yet S-VHS recorders were compatible with VHS tapes.<ref>{{cite book | last = Damjanovski | first = Vlado\n  | title = CCTV\n  | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann\n  | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7506-7800-3 | page= 238\n  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MQZQIFaOhgoC\n  | accessdate= January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSony was unable to shrink its Betamax form any further, so instead developed Video8/Hi8 which was in direct competition with the VHS-C/S-VHS-C format throughout the 80s, 90s, and 2000s. Ultimately neither format \"won\" and both have been superseded by digital high definition equipment.\n\n=== W-VHS / Digital-VHS (high-definition) ===\n\n{{main|W-VHS|D-VHS}}\n[[W-VHS]] allowed recording of [[Multiple sub-nyquist sampling Encoding system|MUSE]] Hi-Vision ''analog'' high definition television, which was broadcast in Japan from 1989 until 2007. The other improved standard, called [[D-VHS|Digital-VHS (D-VHS)]], records digital high definition video onto a VHS form factor tape. D-VHS can record up to 4 hours of ATSC digital television in 720p or 1080i formats using the fastest record mode (equivalent to VHS-SP), and up to 49 hours of lower-definition video at slower speeds.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Newnes Guide to Television and Video Technology\n|author=Eugene Trundle\n|page=377}}</ref>\n\n=== D9 ===\n{{main|Digital-S}}\nThere is also a JVC-designed component digital professional production format known as [[Digital-S]], or officially under the name D9, that uses a VHS form factor tape and essentially the same mechanical tape handling techniques as an S-VHS recorder. This format is the least expensive format to support a [[Sel-Sync]] pre-read for [[video editing]]. This format competed with Sony's [[Digital Betacam]] in the professional and broadcast market, although in that area Sony's Betacam family ruled supreme, in contrast to the outcome of the VHS/Betamax domestic format war.  It has now been superseded by high definition formats.\n\n=== Accessories ===\n[[File:VHS tape rewinder.jpg|thumb|A tape rewinder.]]\nShortly after the introduction of the VHS format, [[VHS tape rewinder]]s were developed. These devices served the sole purpose of rewinding VHS tapes. Proponents of the rewinders argued that the use of the rewind function on the standard VHS player would lead to wear and tear of the transport mechanism. The rewinder would rewind the tapes smoothly and also normally do so at a faster rate than the standard rewind function on VHS players. However some rewinder brands did have some frequent abrupt stops, which occasionally led to tape damage.\n\nSome devices were marketed which allowed a [[personal computer]] to use a VHS recorder as a [[data backup]] device. The most notable of these was [[ArVid]], widely used in Russia and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states. Similar systems were manufactured in the United States by [[Corvus (company)|Corvus]] and [[Alpha Microsystems]],<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RS8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA56&ots=2DE04Dma4F&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q=&f=false Videotrax: New System To Back Up Hard Disks].'' InfoWorld, May 26, 1986.</ref> and in the UK by ''Backer'' from Danmere Ltd.\n\n== Signal standards ==\nVHS can record and play back all varieties of [[Broadcast television system|analog television signals]] in existence at the time VHS was devised. However, a machine must be designed to record a given standard. Typically, a VHS machine can only handle signals using the same standard as the country it was sold in. This is because some parameters of analog broadcast TV are not applicable to VHS recordings, the number of VHS tape recording format variations is smaller than the number of broadcast TV signal variations\u2014for example, analog TVs and VHS ''machines'' (except multistandard devices) are not interchangeable between the UK and Germany, but VHS ''tapes'' are. The following tape recording formats exist in conventional VHS (listed in the form of standard/lines/frames):\n\n* [[SECAM]]/625/25 (SECAM, French variety)\n* [[SECAM|MESECAM]]/625/25 (most other SECAM countries, notably the former Soviet Union and Middle East)\n* [[NTSC]]/525/30 (Most parts of Americas, Japan, South Korea)\n* [[PAL]]/525/30 (i.e., [[PAL-M]], Brazil)\n* [[PAL]]/625/25 (most of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, many parts of Asia such as China and India, some parts of South America such as Argentina, Uruguay and the Falklands, and Africa)\n\nNote that PAL/625/25 VCRs allow playback of SECAM (and MESECAM) tapes with a [[monochrome]] picture, and vice versa, as the line standard is the same.\nSince the 1990s, dual and multi-standard VHS machines, able to handle a variety of VHS-supported video standards, became more common. For example, VHS machines sold in Australia and Europe could typically handle PAL, MESECAM for record and playback, and NTSC for playback only on suitable TVs. Dedicated multi-standard machines can usually handle all standards listed, and some high-end models could convert the content of a tape from one standard to another [[on the fly]] during playback by using a built-in standards converter.\n\nS-VHS is only implemented as such in PAL/625/25 and NTSC/525/30; S-VHS machines sold in SECAM markets record internally in PAL, and convert between PAL and SECAM during recording and playback. S-VHS machines for the Brazilian market record in NTSC and convert between it and  PAL-M.\n\nA small number of VHS decks are able to decode [[closed captioning|closed captions]] on video cassettes before sending the full signal to the set with the captions. A smaller number still are able, additionally, to record [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] transmitted with world standard [[teletext]] signals (on pre-digital services), simultaneously with the associated program. S-VHS has a sufficient resolution to record teletext signals with relatively few errors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/2016/01/07/teletext-time-travel |title=Teletext time travel |publisher=transdiffusion.org |date=January 7, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Logo==\n[[File:VHS logo.svg|thumb|The first VHS Logo]]\nThe VHS logo was commissioned by JVC and introduced with the JVC HR-3300 in 1976.

However, the sticking point for both consumers and potential licensing partners of Betamax was the total recording time.<ref name=\"howells\" /> To overcome the recording limitation, Beta II speed (two-hour mode, NTSC regions only) was released in order to compete with VHS's two-hour SP mode, thereby reducing Betamax's horizontal resolution to 240 lines (vs 250 lines).<ref>{{cite web |author=Video Interchange |title=Video History |url=http://www.videointerchange.com/video-history.htm#BetaMax |accessdate=August 20, 2007 }}</ref> In turn, the extension of VHS to VHS HQ produced 250 lines (vs 240 lines), so that overall a typical Betamax/VHS user could expect virtually identical resolution. (Very high-end Betamax machines still supported recording in the Beta I mode and some in an even higher resolution Beta Is (Beta I Super HiBand) mode, but at a maximum single-cassette run time of 1:40 [with an L-830 cassette].)\n\nBecause Betamax was released more than a year before VHS, it held an early lead in the format war.

Though occasionally showing [[compression artifact]]s and [[color banding]] that are common discrepancies in digital media, the durability and longevity of a VCD depends on the production quality of the disc, and its handling. The data stored digitally on a VCD theoretically does not degrade (in the analog sense like tape). In the disc player, there is no physical contact made with either the data or label sides. When handled properly, a VCD will last a long time.\n\nSince a VCD can hold only 74 minutes of video, a movie exceeding that mark has to be divided into two or more discs.\n\n=== DVD ===\n{{see also|DVD-Video}}\nThe [[DVD-Video]] format was introduced first on November 1, 1996, in Japan; to the United States on March 26, 1997 (''test marketed''); and mid-to-late 1998 in Europe and Australia.\n\nDespite DVD's better quality (typical horizontal resolution of 480 versus 250 lines per picture height), and the availability of standalone DVD recorders, \nVHS is still used in home recording of video content. <!--This sentence should probably be updated, but when did VHS fall out of use as a home recording method?

These types of systems provide users with a no-maintenance solution for capturing video content. Customers of subscriber-based TV generally receive electronic program guides, enabling one-touch setup of a recording schedule. Hard disk\u2013based systems allow for many hours of recording without user-maintenance.

At that time, the expensive devices were used only in professional environments such as television studios and medical imaging ([[fluoroscopy]]). In the 1970s, videotape entered home use, creating the home video industry and changing the economics of the television and movie businesses.

Sony started working on [[Betamax]], while Matsushita started working on [[VX (videocassette format)|VX]]. JVC released the CR-6060 in 1975, based on the U-matic format. Sony and Matsushita also produced U-matic systems of their own.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== VHS development ===\nIn 1971, JVC engineers Yuma Shiraishi and Shizuo Takano put together a team to develop a consumer-based VTR.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/20/world/shizuo-takano-68-an-engineer-who-developed-vhs-recorders.html |title=Shizuo Takano, 68, an Engineer Who Developed VHS Recorders |work=The New York Times |date=January 20, 1992 |accessdate=2011-07-11 |first=Andrew |last=Pollack}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1971, they created an internal diagram titled \"VHS Development Matrix\", which established twelve objectives for JVC's new VTR:<ref name=\"rickmaybury\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rickmaybury.com/Altarcs/homent/he97/vhstoryhtm.htm |title=VHS STORY \u2013 Home Taping Comes of Age |publisher=Rickmaybury.com |date=September 7, 1976 |accessdate=2011-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719095527/http://www.rickmaybury.com/Altarcs/homent/he97/vhstoryhtm.htm |archive-date=2011-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n* The system must be compatible with any ordinary television set.\n* Picture quality must be similar to a normal air broadcast.\n* The tape must have at least a two-hour recording capacity.\n* Tapes must be interchangeable between machines.\n* The overall system should be versatile, meaning it can be scaled and expanded, such as connecting a video camera, or dub between two recorders.\n* Recorders should be affordable, easy to operate and have low maintenance costs.\n* Recorders must be capable of being produced in high volume, their parts must be interchangeable, and they must be easy to service.\n\nIn early 1972, the commercial video recording industry in Japan took a financial hit. JVC cut its budgets and restructured its video division, shelving the VHS project. However, despite the lack of funding, Takano and Shiraishi continued to work on the project in secret. By 1973, the two engineers had produced a functional prototype.<ref name=\"rickmaybury\" />\n\n=== Competition with Betamax ===\nIn 1974, the Japanese [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] (MITI), desiring to avoid [[consumer confusion]], attempted to force the Japanese video industry to standardize on just one home video recording format.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bylund |first=Anders |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/guides/2010/01/is-the-end-of-the-format-wars-upon-us.ars |title=The format wars: of lasers and (creative) destruction |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref> Later, Sony had a functional prototype of the [[Betamax]] format, and was very close to releasing a finished product. With this prototype, Sony persuaded the MITI to adopt Betamax as the standard, and allow it to license the technology to other companies.<ref name=\"rickmaybury\" />\n\nJVC believed that an [[open standard]], with the format shared among competitors without licensing the technology, was better for the consumer. To prevent the MITI from adopting Betamax, JVC worked to convince other companies, in particular [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (Japan's largest electronics manufacturer at the time, marketing its products under the National brand in most territories and the Panasonic brand in North America, and JVC's majority stockholder), to accept VHS, and thereby work against Sony and the MITI.<ref name=\"howells\">John Howells. \"The Management of Innovation and Technology: The Shaping of Technology and Institutions of the Market Economy\" [hardcopy], pg 76-81</ref> Matsushita agreed, primarily out of concern that Sony might become the leader in the field if its proprietary Betamax format was the only one allowed to be manufactured. Matsushita also regarded Betamax's one-hour recording time limit as a disadvantage.<ref name=\"howells\" />\n\nMatsushita's backing of JVC persuaded [[Hitachi]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]]<ref>[http://www.mediacollege.com/video/format/compare/betamax-vhs.html Media College] \"The Betamax vs VHS Format War\", by Dave Owen, published: May 1, 2005</ref> to back the VHS standard as well.<ref name=\"rickmaybury\" /> Sony's release of its Betamax unit to the Japanese market in 1975 placed further pressure on the MITI to side with the company. However, the collaboration of JVC and its partners was much stronger, and eventually led the MITI to drop its push for an industry standard. JVC released the first VHS machines in Japan in late 1976, and in the United States in mid 1977.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cashmore|first=Ellis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MxfDwAAQBAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PR10&dq=JVC+released+the+first+VHS+machines&hl=en|title=Screen Society|last2=Cleland|first2=Jamie|last3=Dixon|first3=Kevin|date=2018-06-12|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-68164-1|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSony's Betamax competed with VHS throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s (see [[Videotape format war]]).

The flip-up cover that protects the tape has a built-in latch with a push-in toggle on the right side (bottom view image). The VHS cassette also includes an anti-despooling mechanism consisting of several plastic parts between the plastic spools, near the front of the tape (white and black in the top view). The spool latches are released by a push-in lever within a 6.35&nbsp;mm (\u00bc inch) hole accessed from the bottom of the cassette, 19&nbsp;mm (\u00be inch) inwards from the edge label.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The tapes are made, duplicated and inserted into the cassettes in [[cleanroom]]s, to ensure quality, and prevent dust from getting embedded into the tape and interfering with the duplication process (both of which could cause signal dropouts)\n\nThere is a clear tape leader at both ends of the tape to provide an optical auto-stop for the VCR transport mechanism. A light source is inserted into the cassette through the circular hole in the center of the underside when loaded in the VCR, and two [[photodiode]]s are located to the left and right sides of where the tape exits the cassette. When the clear tape reaches one of these, enough light will pass through the tape to the photodiode to trigger the stop function; in more sophisticated machines it will start rewinding the cassette when the trailing end is detected. Early VCRs used an [[incandescent bulb]] as the light source, which regularly failed and caused the VCR to erroneously think that a cassette is loaded when empty, or would detect the blown bulb and stop functioning completely.

More frequently however, VHS tapes are thicker than the required minimum to avoid complications such as jams or tears in the tape.<ref name=\"Parekh\" /> Other speeds include \"long play\" (LP), and \"extended play\" (EP) or \"super long play\" (SLP) (standard on NTSC; rarely found on PAL machines). For NTSC, LP and EP/SLP doubles and triples the recording time accordingly, but these speed reductions cause a reduction in video quality \u2013 from the normal 250 lines in SP, to 230 analog lines horizontal in LP and even less in EP/SLP. The slower speeds cause a very noticeable reduction in linear (non-hifi) audio track quality as well, as the linear tape speed becomes much lower than what is commonly considered a satisfactory minimum for audio recording.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Tape lengths ===\nBoth [[Multi-standard television|NTSC and PAL/SECAM]] VHS cassettes are physically identical (although the signals recorded on the tape are incompatible). However, as tape speeds differ between NTSC and PAL/SECAM, the playing time for any given cassette will vary accordingly between the systems. In order to avoid confusion, manufacturers indicate the playing time in minutes that can be expected for the market the tape is sold in. It is perfectly possible to record and play back a blank T-XXX tape in a PAL machine or a blank E-XXX tape in an NTSC machine, but the resulting playing time will be different from that indicated.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nTo calculate the playing time for a T-XXX tape in a PAL machine, use this formula:\n\n: PAL/SECAM Recording Time = T-XXX in minutes * (1.426)\n\nTo calculate the playing time for an E-XXX tape in an NTSC machine, use this formula:\n\n: NTSC Recording Time = E-XXX in minutes * (0.701)\n\n* E-XXX indicates playing time in minutes for PAL or SECAM in SP and LP speeds.\n* T-XXX indicates playing time in minutes for NTSC or PAL-M in SP, LP, and EP/SLP speeds.\n* SP is Standard Play, LP is Long Play ({{frac|1|2}} speed, equal to recording time in DVHS \"HS\" mode), EP/SLP is extended/super long play ({{frac|1|3}} speed) which was primarily released into the NTSC market.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Common tape lengths\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Tape label\n(nominal length in minutes)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Tape length\n! colspan=\"3\" | Rec. time (NTSC)\n! colspan=\"3\" | Rec. time (PAL)\n|-\n! m !! ft\n!

Despite the [[generation loss]], this was regarded as a widespread problem, which the members of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) claimed caused them great financial losses. In response, several companies developed technologies to protect copyrighted VHS tapes from casual duplication by home users.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe most popular method was [[Macrovision]], produced by a company of the same name. According to Macrovision: <blockquote>\"The technology is applied to over 550 million videocassettes annually and is used by every [[MPAA]] movie studio on some or all of their videocassette releases. Over 220 commercial duplication facilities around the world are equipped to supply Macrovision videocassette copy protection to rights owners...The study found that over 30% of VCR households admit to having unauthorized copies, and that the total annual revenue loss due to copying is estimated at $370,000,000 annually.\"{{Citation needed|reason=No source for actual study|date=April 2018}}</blockquote>\n\nThe system was first used in copyrighted movies beginning with the 1984 film ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]''.<ref name=\"deatley19850907\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lc8vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1Y0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5630%2C870934 | title=VCRs put entertainment industry into fast-forward frenzy | work=The Free Lance-Star | date=September 7, 1985 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=2015-01-25 | author=De Atley, Richard | pages=12-TV}}</ref>\n\nMacrovision copy protection saw refinement throughout its years, but has always worked by essentially introducing deliberate errors into a protected VHS tape's output video stream. These errors in the output video stream are ignored by most televisions, but will interfere with re-recording of programming by a second VCR. The first version of Macrovision introduces high signal levels during the [[vertical blanking interval]], which occurs between the video fields. These high levels confuse the [[automatic gain control]] circuit in most VHS VCRs, leading to varying brightness levels in an output video, but are ignored by the TV as they are out of the frame-display period.  \"Level II\" Macrovision uses a process called \"colorstriping,\" which inverts the analog signal's colorburst period and causes off-color bands to appear in the picture. Level III protection added additional colorstriping techniques to further degrade the image.<ref name=\"anarchivism-rip-vhs\">{{cite web |url=http://anarchivism.org/w/How_to_Rip_VHS |title=How to Rip VHS |work=Anarchivism |date=December 14, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThese protection methods worked well to defeat analog-to-analog copying by VCRs of the time. Products capable of digital video recording are mandated by law to include features which detect Macrovision encoding of input analog streams, and reject copying of the video.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}  Both intentional and false-positive detection of Macrovision protection has [[Opposition to copyright|frustrated archivists]] who wish to copy now-fragile VHS tapes to a digital format for preservation.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Devices marketed as \"Video Stabilizers\" may be used to attempt removal of the Macrovision copy protection mechanism. <ref>http://www.cornerspeed.co.za/video-stabilizer.htmlhttp://www.cornerspeed.co.za/video-stabilizer.html</ref><ref>http://www.rcdistributing.com/model-dvs-2.html</ref><ref>http://www.qualitekindustries.com/bvistrwi6feg.html</ref>\n\n== Recording process ==\n[[File:Medion MD8910 - Inject and eject of a VHS cassette.webm|thumb|left|A close-up process of how the magnetic tape in a VHS cassette is being pulled from the cassette shell to the head drum of the VCR.]]\n[[File:VHS-diagonal-helical-recording.jpg|right|thumb|300px|This illustration demonstrates the helical wrap of the tape around the head drum, and shows the points where the video, audio and control tracks are recorded.]]\nThe recording process in VHS consists of the following steps, in this order:\n* The tape is pulled from the supply reel by a capstan and pinch roller, similar to those used in audio tape recorders. \n* The tape passes across the erase head, which wipes any existing recording from the tape.\n* The tape is wrapped around the head drum, using a little more than 180 degrees of the drum.\n* One of the heads on the spinning drum records one field of video onto the tape, in one diagonally oriented track. \n* The tape passes across the audio and control head, which records the control track and the linear audio track or tracks. \n* The tape is wound onto the take-up reel due to torque applied to the reel by the machine.\n\n=== Erase head ===\nThe erase head is fed by a high level, high frequency AC signal that overwrites any previous recording on the tape.<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/audio/tape.html Tape Recording], Georgia State University</ref> Without this step, the new recording cannot be guaranteed to completely replace any old recording that might have been on the tape.\n\n=== Video recording ===\n[[File:Kopftrommel 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Panasonic Hi-Fi six-head drum VEH0548 installed on G mechanism as an example, demonstrated a typical VHS head drum containing two tape heads.

The head rotates constantly at <ref>The 1800 rpm tape head speed, and corresponding field period time, etc., quoted in this article for NTSC machines are based on the old black and white RS-170 standard. When this was adapted for color under the NTSC standard the actual field time was altered to 1/59.94 of a second, so the actual VHS head rotation speed is accordingly 1798.2 rpm. The pre-color timings are quoted here for simplicity. The corresponding numbers here for PAL are, on the other hand, exact, as PAL's field rate is exactly 1/50 of a second.</ref> 1798.2 rpm in NTSC machines, exactly 1500 in PAL, each complete rotation corresponding to one frame of video.\n\nTwo [[tape head]]s are mounted on the cylindrical surface of the drum, 180 degrees apart from each other, so that the two heads \"take turns\" in recording. The rotation of the head drum, combined with the relatively slow movement of the tape, results in each head recording a track oriented at a diagonal with respect to the length of the tape. This is referred to as [[helical scan]] recording.\n\nTo maximize the use of the tape, the video tracks are recorded very close together to each other. To reduce [[crosstalk]] between adjacent tracks on playback, an [[azimuth recording]] method is used: The gaps of the two heads are not aligned exactly with the track path. Instead, one head is angled at plus seven degrees from the track, and the other at minus seven degrees. This results, during playback, in destructive interference of the signal from the tracks on either side of the one being played.\n\nEach of the diagonal-angled tracks is a complete TV picture field, lasting 1/60 of a second (1/50 on PAL) on the display. One [[tape head]] records an entire picture field. The adjacent track, recorded by the second tape head, is another 1/60 or 1/50 of a second TV picture field, and so on. Thus one complete head rotation records an entire NTSC or PAL frame of two fields.\n\nThe original VHS specification had only two video heads. Later models implemented at least one more pair of heads, which were used at (and optimized for) the EP tape speed. In machines supporting VHS HiFi (described later), yet another pair of heads was added to handle the VHS HiFi signal. Drums can contain 2, 4, 6 or 8 heads. \n\nThe high tape-to-head speed created by the rotating head results in a far higher bandwidth than could be practically achieved with a stationary head. \nVHS tapes have approximately 3 [[Megahertz|MHz]] of video [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and 400&nbsp;kHz of chroma bandwidth. The [[Luminance (video)|luminance]] (black and white) portion of the video is recorded as a [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]], with a down-converted \n\"[[Heterodyne#Analog videotape recording|color under]]\" [[Chrominance|chroma]] (color) signal recorded directly at the baseband. Each helical track contains a single field ('even' or 'odd' field, equivalent to half a frame) encoded as an analog [[raster scan]], similar to analog TV broadcasts. The horizontal resolution is 240 lines per picture height, or about 320 lines across a scan line, and the vertical resolution (the number of scan lines) is the same as the respective analog TV standard (576 for [[PAL]] or 486 for [[NTSC]]; usually, somewhat fewer scan lines are actually visible due to [[overscan]]). In modern-day digital terminology, NTSC VHS is roughly equivalent to 333\u00d7480 pixels luma and 40\u00d7480 chroma resolutions (333\u00d7480 pixels=159,840 pixels or 0.16 MP (1/6 of a megapixel)),<ref>{{cite book |last=Taylor|first=Jim|title=DVD demystified|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=2005|isbn=0-07-142396-6|pages=9\u201336|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ikxuL2aX9cAC|accessdate= January 22, 2017}}</ref> while PAL VHS offers the equivalent of about 335\u00d7576 pixels luma and 40\u00d7576 chroma (the vertical chroma resolution of PAL is not limited by any mechanism; SECAM is limited in resolution by a delay line mechanism).\n\nJVC countered 1985's SuperBeta with VHS HQ, or High Quality. The frequency modulation of the VHS luminance signal is limited to 3 megahertz, which makes higher resolutions technically impossible even with the highest-quality recording heads and tape materials, but an HQ branded deck includes luminance noise reduction, chroma noise reduction, white clip extension, and improved sharpness circuitry. The effect was to increase the apparent horizontal resolution of a VHS recording from 240 to 250 analog (equivalent to 333 pixels from left-to-right, in digital terminology). The major VHS [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]]s resisted HQ due to cost concerns, eventually resulting in JVC reducing the requirements for the HQ brand to white clip extension plus one other improvement.\n\nIn 1987, JVC introduced a new format called [[S-VHS|Super VHS]] (often known as S-VHS) which extended the bandwidth to over 5 megahertz, yielding 420 analog horizontal (560 pixels left-to-right). Most Super VHS recorders can play back standard VHS tapes, but not vice versa. S-VHS was designed for higher resolution, but failed to gain popularity outside Japan because of the high costs of the machines and tapes.<ref name=\"Parekh\" /> Because of the limited user base, Super VHS was never picked up to any significant degree by manufacturers of pre-recorded tapes, although it was used extensively in the low-end professional market for filming and editing.\n\n=== Audio recording ===\n\nAfter leaving the head drum, the tape passes over the stationary audio and control head. This records a control track at the bottom edge of the tape, and one or two linear audio tracks along the top edge.\n\n==== Original linear audio system ====\nIn the original VHS specification, audio was recorded as [[baseband]] in a single linear track, at the upper edge of the tape, similar to how an audio [[compact cassette]] operates. The recorded frequency range was dependent on the linear tape speed. For the VHS SP mode, which already uses a lower tape speed than the compact cassette, this resulted in a mediocre frequency response of roughly 100&nbsp;Hz to 10&nbsp;kHz for NTSC,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} frequency response for PAL VHS with its lower standard tape speed was somewhat worse. The [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) was an acceptable 42&nbsp;dB. Both parameters degraded significantly with VHS's longer play modes, with EP/NTSC frequency response peaking at 4&nbsp;kHz. Using S-VHS tapes, however, can yield better audio (and video) quality due to the tapes being designed with almost twice the bandwidth in mind with the same speed.\n\nAudio cannot be recorded on a VHS tape without recording a video signal, even in the audio dubbing mode. If there is no video signal to the VCR input, most VCRs will record black video as well as generate a control track while the audio is being recorded. Some early VCRs would record audio without a control track signal, but this was of little practical use since the absence of a control track signal meant that the linear tape speed was irregular during playback.\n\nMore expensive decks offered stereo audio recording and playback. Linear stereo, as it was called, fit two independent channels in the same space as the original mono audiotrack. While this approach preserved acceptable backward compatibility with monoaural audio heads, the splitting of the audio track degraded the signal's SNR to the point that audible tape hiss was objectionable at normal listening volume. To counteract tape hiss, decks applied [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby B noise reduction]] for recording and playback. Dolby B dynamically boosts the mid-frequency band of the audio program on the recorded medium, improving its signal strength relative to the tape's background noise floor, then attenuates the mid-band during playback. Dolby B is not a transparent process, and Dolby-encoded program material will exhibit an unnatural mid-range emphasis when played on non-Dolby capable VCRs. Another alternative would be using noise reduction systems similar to DBX, that is, by recording audio with high volume but with dynamic range compression. On playback the decompression will yield original audio but since weaker signals get attenuated the hiss can also be significantly attenuated.\n\nHigh-end consumer recorders took advantage of the linear nature of the audio track, as the audio track could be erased and recorded without disturbing the video portion of the recorded signal. Hence, \"audio dubbing\" and \"video dubbing\", where either the audio or video are re-recorded on tape (without disturbing the other), were supported features on [[prosumer]] [[linear video editing]]-decks. Without dubbing capability, an audio or video edit could not be done in-place on master cassette, and requires the editing output be captured to another tape, incurring generational loss.\n\nStudio film releases began to emerge with linear stereo audiotracks in 1982. From that point onward nearly every home video release by Hollywood featured a Dolby-encoded linear stereo audiotrack. However, linear stereo was never popular with equipment makers or consumers.\n\n==== Tracking adjustment and index marking ====\nAnother linear [[control track|''control'' track]], at the tape's lower edge, holds pulses that mark the beginning of every frame of video; these are used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback, so that the high speed rotating heads remained exactly on their helical tracks rather than somewhere between two adjacent tracks (known as \"[[video tape tracking|tracking]]\"). Since good tracking depends on precise distances between the rotating drum and the fixed control/audio head reading the linear tracks, which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, most VCRs offer tracking adjustment, either manual or automatic, to correct such mismatches.\n\nThe control track is also used to hold ''index marks'', which were normally written at the beginning of each recording session, and can be found using the VCR's ''index search'' function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the ''n''th specified index mark, and resume playback from there. At times, higher-end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crutchfield.com/S-PFiOFC1Dt8s/learn/learningcenter/home/vcr_glossary.html|title=VCRs Glossary|author=Loren Barstow|work=Crutchfield}}</ref><ref>[http://www.retrevo.com/support/JVC-HR-S7300U-VCRs-manual/id/318ag718/t/2/ JVC HR-S7300 manual]: features list: ''\"..., Index Search, Manual Index Mark/Erase ...\"''</ref> \u2014 so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the [[television program]] \u2014 but this feature later became hard to find.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nBy the late 1990s, some high-end VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing. For example, Panasonic's Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette, and logged recording information (channel, date, time and optional program title entered by the user) both on the cassette and in the VCR's memory for up to 900 recordings (600 with titles).<ref>[https://archive.is/20120729233622/http://www.elektroda.pl/rtvforum/instrukcjeobslugi?id=2176 Panasonic Video Cassette Recorder NV-HS960 Series Operating Instructions], VQT8880, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.</ref>\n\n==== Hi-Fi audio system ====\nAround 1984, JVC added ''Hi-Fi'' audio to VHS (model HR-D725U, in response to Betamax's introduction of Beta Hi-Fi.) Both VHS Hi-Fi and Betamax Hi-Fi delivered flat full-range frequency response (20&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz), excellent 70&nbsp;dB [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (in consumer space, second only to the [[compact disc]]), [[dynamic range]] of 90&nbsp;dB, and [[professional audio]]-grade channel separation (more than 70&nbsp;dB). VHS Hi-Fi audio is achieved by using audio frequency modulation (AFM), modulating the two stereo channels (L, R) on two different frequency-modulated carriers and embedding the combined modulated audio signal pair into the video signal. To avoid crosstalk and interference from the primary video carrier, VHS's implementation of AFM relied on a form of magnetic recording called ''depth [[multiplexing]]''. The modulated [[Sound recording|audio]] carrier pair was placed in the hitherto-unused frequency range between the luminance and the color carrier (below 1.6&nbsp;MHz), and recorded first. Subsequently, the video head erases and re-records the video signal (combined luminance and color signal) over the same tape surface, but the video signal's higher center frequency results in a shallower magnetization of the tape, allowing both the video and residual AFM audio signal to coexist on tape. (PAL versions of Beta Hi-Fi use this same technique). During playback, VHS Hi-Fi recovers the depth-recorded AFM signal by subtracting the audio head's signal (which contains the AFM signal contaminated by a weak image of the video signal) from the video head's signal (which contains only the video signal), then demodulates the left and right audio channels from their respective frequency carriers. The end result of the complex process was audio of high fidelity, which was uniformly solid across all tape-speeds (EP, LP or SP.) Since JVC had gone through the complexity of ensuring Hi-Fi's backward compatibility with non-Hi-Fi VCRs, virtually all studio home video releases produced after this time contained Hi-Fi audio tracks, in addition to the linear audio track. Under normal circumstances, all Hi-Fi VHS VCRs will record Hi-Fi and linear audio simultaneously to ensure compatibility with VCRs without Hi-Fi playback, though only early high-end Hi-Fi machines provided linear stereo compatibility.\n\nThe sound quality of Hi-Fi VHS stereo is comparable to some extent to the quality of CD audio, particularly when recordings were made on high-end or professional VHS machines that have a manual audio recording level control. This high quality compared to other consumer audio recording formats such as [[compact cassette]] attracted the attention of amateur and hobbyist recording artists. [[Home recording]] enthusiasts occasionally recorded high quality stereo [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixdown]]s and [[master recording]]s from [[multitrack recording|multitrack]] audio tape onto consumer-level Hi-Fi VCRs. However, because the VHS Hi-Fi recording process is intertwined with the VCR's video-recording function, advanced editing functions such as audio-only or video-only dubbing are impossible. A short-lived alternative to the hifi feature for recording mixdowns of hobbyist audio-only projects was a [[PCM adaptor]] so that high-bandwidth digital video could use a grid of black-and-white dots on an analog video carrier to give pro-grade digital sounds though [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] tapes made this obsolete.\n\nSome VHS decks also had a \"simulcast\" switch, allowing users to record an external audio input along with off-air pictures. Some televised concerts offered a stereo simulcast soundtrack on FM radio and as such, events like ''[[Live Aid]]'' were recorded by thousands of people with a full stereo soundtrack despite the fact that stereo TV broadcasts were some years off (especially in regions that adopted [[NICAM]]). Other examples of this included network television shows such as ''[[Friday Night Videos]]'' and [[MTV]] for its first few years in existence. Likewise, some countries, most notably [[South Africa]], provided alternate language audio tracks for TV programming through an FM radio simulcast.\n\nThe considerable complexity and additional hardware limited VHS Hi-Fi to high-end decks for many years. While linear stereo all but disappeared from home VHS decks, it was not until the 1990s that Hi-Fi became a more common feature on VHS decks. Even then, most customers were unaware of its significance and merely enjoyed the better audio performance of the newer decks.\n\n===== Issues with Hi-Fi audio =====\nDue to the path followed by the video and Hi-Fi audio heads being striped and discontinuous\u2014unlike that of the linear audio track\u2014head-switching is required to provide a continuous audio signal. While the video signal can easily hide the head-switching point in the invisible vertical retrace section of the signal, so that the exact switching point is not very important, the same is obviously not possible with a continuous audio signal that has no inaudible sections. Hi-Fi audio is thus dependent on a much more exact alignment of the head switching point than is required for non-HiFi VHS machines. Misalignments may lead to imperfect joining of the signal, resulting in low-pitched buzzing.<ref name=\"stason\">{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/general/14-18-Is-VHS-Hi-Fi-sound-perfect-Is-Beta-Hi-Fi-sound-perfec.html14.18|title=14.18 Is VHS Hi-Fi sound perfect?

S-VHS improved the horizontal luminance resolution to 400 lines (versus 250 for VHS/Beta and 500 for DVD). The audio system (both linear and AFM) is the same. S-VHS made little impact on the home market, but gained dominance in the camcorder market due to its superior picture quality.\n\nThe [[ADAT]] format provides the ability to record multitrack digital audio using S-VHS media. JVC also developed SVHS-ET technology for its Super-VHS camcorders and VCRs, which simply allows them to record Super VHS signals onto lower-priced VHS tapes, albeit with a slight blurring of the image. Nearly all later Super-VHS camcorders and VCRs have SVHS-ET ability.\n\n=== VHS-C / Super VHS-C ===\n{{main|VHS-C}}\nAnother variant is [[VHS-C|VHS-Compact (VHS-C)]], originally developed for portable VCRs in 1982, but ultimately finding success in palm-sized [[camcorder]]s. The longest tape available for NTSC holds 60 minutes in SP mode and 180 minutes in EP mode. Since VHS-C tapes are based on the same magnetic tape as full-size tapes, they can be played back in standard VHS players using a mechanical adapter, without the need of any kind of signal conversion. The magnetic tape on VHS-C cassettes is wound on one main spool and uses a gear wheel to advance the tape.<ref name=\"Parekh\" />\n\nThe adapter is mechanical, although early examples were motorized, with a battery. It has an internal hub to engage with the VCR mechanism in the location of a normal full-size tape hub, driving the gearing on the VHS-C cassette. Also, when a VHS-C cassette is inserted into the adapter, a small swing-arm pulls the tape out of the miniature cassette to span the standard tape path distance between the guide rollers of a full-size tape. This allows the tape from the miniature cassette to use the same loading mechanism as that from the standard cassette.\n\nSuper VHS-C or [[S-VHS]] Compact was developed by [[JVC]] in 1987. S-VHS provided an improved luminance and chrominance quality, yet S-VHS recorders were compatible with VHS tapes.<ref>{{cite book | last = Damjanovski | first = Vlado\n  | title = CCTV\n  | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann\n  | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7506-7800-3 | page= 238\n  | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MQZQIFaOhgoC\n  | accessdate= January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSony was unable to shrink its Betamax form any further, so instead developed Video8/Hi8 which was in direct competition with the VHS-C/S-VHS-C format throughout the 80s, 90s, and 2000s. Ultimately neither format \"won\" and both have been superseded by digital high definition equipment.\n\n=== W-VHS / Digital-VHS (high-definition) ===\n\n{{main|W-VHS|D-VHS}}\n[[W-VHS]] allowed recording of [[Multiple sub-nyquist sampling Encoding system|MUSE]] Hi-Vision ''analog'' high definition television, which was broadcast in Japan from 1989 until 2007. The other improved standard, called [[D-VHS|Digital-VHS (D-VHS)]], records digital high definition video onto a VHS form factor tape. D-VHS can record up to 4 hours of ATSC digital television in 720p or 1080i formats using the fastest record mode (equivalent to VHS-SP), and up to 49 hours of lower-definition video at slower speeds.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Newnes Guide to Television and Video Technology\n|author=Eugene Trundle\n|page=377}}</ref>\n\n=== D9 ===\n{{main|Digital-S}}\nThere is also a JVC-designed component digital professional production format known as [[Digital-S]], or officially under the name D9, that uses a VHS form factor tape and essentially the same mechanical tape handling techniques as an S-VHS recorder. This format is the least expensive format to support a [[Sel-Sync]] pre-read for [[video editing]]. This format competed with Sony's [[Digital Betacam]] in the professional and broadcast market, although in that area Sony's Betacam family ruled supreme, in contrast to the outcome of the VHS/Betamax domestic format war.  It has now been superseded by high definition formats.\n\n=== Accessories ===\n[[File:VHS tape rewinder.jpg|thumb|A tape rewinder.]]\nShortly after the introduction of the VHS format, [[VHS tape rewinder]]s were developed. These devices served the sole purpose of rewinding VHS tapes. Proponents of the rewinders argued that the use of the rewind function on the standard VHS player would lead to wear and tear of the transport mechanism. The rewinder would rewind the tapes smoothly and also normally do so at a faster rate than the standard rewind function on VHS players. However some rewinder brands did have some frequent abrupt stops, which occasionally led to tape damage.\n\nSome devices were marketed which allowed a [[personal computer]] to use a VHS recorder as a [[data backup]] device. The most notable of these was [[ArVid]], widely used in Russia and [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states. Similar systems were manufactured in the United States by [[Corvus (company)|Corvus]] and [[Alpha Microsystems]],<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RS8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA56&ots=2DE04Dma4F&pg=PA56#v=onepage&q=&f=false Videotrax: New System To Back Up Hard Disks].'' InfoWorld, May 26, 1986.</ref> and in the UK by ''Backer'' from Danmere Ltd.\n\n== Signal standards ==\nVHS can record and play back all varieties of [[Broadcast television system|analog television signals]] in existence at the time VHS was devised. However, a machine must be designed to record a given standard. Typically, a VHS machine can only handle signals using the same standard as the country it was sold in. This is because some parameters of analog broadcast TV are not applicable to VHS recordings, the number of VHS tape recording format variations is smaller than the number of broadcast TV signal variations\u2014for example, analog TVs and VHS ''machines'' (except multistandard devices) are not interchangeable between the UK and Germany, but VHS ''tapes'' are. The following tape recording formats exist in conventional VHS (listed in the form of standard/lines/frames):\n\n* [[SECAM]]/625/25 (SECAM, French variety)\n* [[SECAM|MESECAM]]/625/25 (most other SECAM countries, notably the former Soviet Union and Middle East)\n* [[NTSC]]/525/30 (Most parts of Americas, Japan, South Korea)\n* [[PAL]]/525/30 (i.e., [[PAL-M]], Brazil)\n* [[PAL]]/625/25 (most of Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, many parts of Asia such as China and India, some parts of South America such as Argentina, Uruguay and the Falklands, and Africa)\n\nNote that PAL/625/25 VCRs allow playback of SECAM (and MESECAM) tapes with a [[monochrome]] picture, and vice versa, as the line standard is the same.\nSince the 1990s, dual and multi-standard VHS machines, able to handle a variety of VHS-supported video standards, became more common. For example, VHS machines sold in Australia and Europe could typically handle PAL, MESECAM for record and playback, and NTSC for playback only on suitable TVs. Dedicated multi-standard machines can usually handle all standards listed, and some high-end models could convert the content of a tape from one standard to another [[on the fly]] during playback by using a built-in standards converter.\n\nS-VHS is only implemented as such in PAL/625/25 and NTSC/525/30; S-VHS machines sold in SECAM markets record internally in PAL, and convert between PAL and SECAM during recording and playback. S-VHS machines for the Brazilian market record in NTSC and convert between it and  PAL-M.\n\nA small number of VHS decks are able to decode [[closed captioning|closed captions]] on video cassettes before sending the full signal to the set with the captions. A smaller number still are able, additionally, to record [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] transmitted with world standard [[teletext]] signals (on pre-digital services), simultaneously with the associated program. S-VHS has a sufficient resolution to record teletext signals with relatively few errors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transdiffusion.org/2016/01/07/teletext-time-travel |title=Teletext time travel |publisher=transdiffusion.org |date=January 7, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Logo==\n[[File:VHS logo.svg|thumb|The first VHS Logo]]\nThe VHS logo was commissioned by JVC and introduced with the JVC HR-3300 in 1976.

VHS instruction tapes were sometimes included with various products and services, including exercise equipment, kitchen appliances, and computer software.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}\n\n== VHS vs. Betamax ==\n{{Main|Videotape format war}}\n[[File:Betavhs2.jpg|thumb|Size comparison between Betamax (top) and VHS (bottom) videocassettes.]]\nVHS was the winner of a protracted and somewhat bitter format war during the late 1970s and early 1980s against Sony's Betamax format as well as other formats of the time.<ref name=\"jchyung\" />\n\nBetamax was widely perceived at the time as the better format, as the cassette was smaller in size, and Betamax offered slightly better video quality than VHS \u2013 it had lower video noise, less luma-chroma [[Crosstalk (electronics)|crosstalk]], and was marketed as providing pictures superior to those of VHS. However, the sticking point for both consumers and potential licensing partners of Betamax was the total recording time.<ref name=\"howells\" /> To overcome the recording limitation, Beta II speed (two-hour mode, NTSC regions only) was released in order to compete with VHS's two-hour SP mode, thereby reducing Betamax's horizontal resolution to 240 lines (vs 250 lines).<ref>{{cite web |author=Video Interchange |title=Video History |url=http://www.videointerchange.com/video-history.htm#BetaMax |accessdate=August 20, 2007 }}</ref> In turn, the extension of VHS to VHS HQ produced 250 lines (vs 240 lines), so that overall a typical Betamax/VHS user could expect virtually identical resolution. (Very high-end Betamax machines still supported recording in the Beta I mode and some in an even higher resolution Beta Is (Beta I Super HiBand) mode, but at a maximum single-cassette run time of 1:40 [with an L-830 cassette].)\n\nBecause Betamax was released more than a year before VHS, it held an early lead in the format war.

Though occasionally showing [[compression artifact]]s and [[color banding]] that are common discrepancies in digital media, the durability and longevity of a VCD depends on the production quality of the disc, and its handling. The data stored digitally on a VCD theoretically does not degrade (in the analog sense like tape). In the disc player, there is no physical contact made with either the data or label sides. When handled properly, a VCD will last a long time.\n\nSince a VCD can hold only 74 minutes of video, a movie exceeding that mark has to be divided into two or more discs.\n\n=== DVD ===\n{{see also|DVD-Video}}\nThe [[DVD-Video]] format was introduced first on November 1, 1996, in Japan; to the United States on March 26, 1997 (''test marketed''); and mid-to-late 1998 in Europe and Australia.\n\nDespite DVD's better quality (typical horizontal resolution of 480 versus 250 lines per picture height), and the availability of standalone DVD recorders, \nVHS is still used in home recording of video content. <!--This sentence should probably be updated, but when did VHS fall out of use as a home recording method?

This period can be seen as one of destabilization and dispute over divergent notions of religiosity as properly communalist or autonomous, with the scales tipping towards the communalist since the [[Indonesian Council of Ulama]] pronounced a series of [[fatwa]] against [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]] and [[liberalism]] in religion in 2005.<ref>Howell, Julia D.

Thus, in 1991, at 35, he faced certain death.\n\nAfter months of suffering to find cures for his illness, mysterious meetings with a Tibetan Lama in the [[Himalayas]], and miraculous recovery from his illness, Anand decided to devote his life to sharing his healing, peace, love and joy.\n\nLater, he shared his personal experiences on the basis : \"Be Joyful and Share your Joy to Others\".<ref name=\"Lee\"/>\n[[File:One Earth Retreat Centre.JPG|thumb|One Earth Retreat Centre, Ciawi - Indonesia]]\nIn the last 25 years, Anand has spoken to millions through television shows, radio talks, inhouse trainings, books, newspaper interviews and articles, as well as daily meetings and workshops held at Anand Ashram (affiliated with United Nations), One Earth Retreat Center <ref>http://www.oneearthretreat.com/</ref> Ciawi, Anand Krishna Center and Ashram@Ubud, the four centers of meditation established by him in the Indonesian Capital of Jakarta, the suburban city of Bogor, the palatial ancient city of Yogyakarta, and the beautiful island of Bali.\n[[File:Anand Ashram Jakarta.jpg|thumb|Anand Ashram at Sunter - Jakarta, IndonesiaCentre for Wellbeing and Self-Empowerment]]\n\n==Humanitarian Initiative==\nHe has also inspired several popular movements, and Centers for Self Development, among others:\n#\tInternational Bali Meditators\u2019 Festival (IBMF) <ref>http://www.gaia-oasis.com/event/international-bali-meditators-festival-ibmf/</ref>\n#\tForum for Revival of Human Spirit \u2013 which has given free Self Development Programs to more than 25,000 teachers within last 5 years.\n#\tAnand Krishna Centres in many major cities, and L\u2019Ayurveda Healing Centers in Jakarta and Bali.<ref>http://www.anandashram.asia/</ref>\n#\tAK Global Co-Operation, a national co-operative society with branches in several cities.\n#\tThe National Integration Movement, with almost 30 branches all over Indonesia and overseas representation, including one in the Middle East <ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalintegrationmovement.org/en/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095218/http://nationalintegrationmovement.org/en/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n#\tCalifornia Bali Friendship Association <ref>http://www.californiabali.org/</ref>\n#\tBrazil Indonesia Friendship Association <ref>http://www.brazilindonesia.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=frontpage&Itemid=1</ref>\n#\tSecret Garden of The Mother Divine, Dedicated to Healing Mother Earth and All Her Children, located in Kuta (Bali)\n#\tAK Education Foundation, First Interfaith School in Bali, for which land has been acquired (about 2,500 sq meters in the prime area of Kuta)<ref>http://oneearthschool.org/</ref>\n#\tBali Dvipa Charitable Clinic in Bali\n#\tOne Earth Integral Education Foundation <ref>http://www.oneearthedu.org/</ref>\n#\tRegular Free Medical and Trauma Relief Camps\n#\tGlobal Harmony Monument in Ashram@Ubud \u2013 Bali <ref>http://www.gandhitopia.org/photo/the-charter-of-global-harmony-final-picture?context=popular</ref>\n#\tThe Charter for Global Harmony <ref>http://www.charterforglobalharmony.org/\n</ref>\n\nAnand had been a source on all major National Medias, several Regional Medias \u2013 both Print and Electronic.

His critics wonder, \"What makes him popular? There is nothing extraordinary about him.\" While, His sympathizers appreciate his passion for promoting peace among different sections of society and acclaim: \"He comes from The Source of All Wisdom.\"\n\nHis stand as [[Universalist]], Anand has had many challenges from religion\u2019s radicals<ref>http://www.speakingtree.in/blog/why-anand-krishna-is-considered-dangerous-by-the-radicals</ref>  while working in promoting interfaith harmony in Indonesia.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionreport/indonesia-the-ahmadiyya-and-radical-islam/3258614#anchor3/</ref>\n\nIn 2000, his books were labelled heresy, and the publisher was forced to recall his book from bookstores\u2019 shelves nationwide.<ref>https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/pasarbuku/conversations/messages/1889</ref>\n\nThen, after unsuccessful constantly being persecuted for his works and activities in promoting religious freedom and interfaith harmony in this country, in the early of 2010, a group of former students prosecuted Anand of sexual harassment. This was an old but effective \u2018dirty\u2019 trick used to assassin one\u2019s character, lending the hands of mass media to the downfall of public figures. Strangely, this was confirmed by the accuser\u2019s lawyer Agung Mattauch himself: \"Harassment is just an entry point for a more serious problem, religious [[blasphemy]]\".<ref>Suryakusuma, Julia (2011, April) When Prosecution becomes Persecution.

This period can be seen as one of destabilization and dispute over divergent notions of religiosity as properly communalist or autonomous, with the scales tipping towards the communalist since the [[Indonesian Council of Ulama]] pronounced a series of [[fatwa]] against [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]] and [[liberalism]] in religion in 2005.<ref>Howell, Julia D.
