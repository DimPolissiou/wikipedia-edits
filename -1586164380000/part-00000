Katol is also mentioned in the Ashwamedh canto of the ''[[Mahabharat]] '' as Kuntalapur. Katol is the location of two of the Hemadpanthi temples, Maa Chandika and Maa Saraswati, which are said{{by whom?|date=October 2017}} to date from the days of Rawan and to have been built in one night by his demons.

The combined population of Katol and Peth Budhwar was 7040 in 1891 and 7313 in 1901, but as the town is the trade centre of a wide [[cotton]]-growing tract, it has grown considerably since the last census.

For the first year its income was only Rs. 4761, but it has now risen to about Rs. 7176. Its prosperity depends chiefly on cotton trading, and in recent years most of the municipal income has for that reason been expended on a cotton market.{{cn|date=October 2017}} This is a large enclosure of about {{convert|10|acre|m2}}, securely fenced, and provided with a weighing shed, well, water trough, young shade trees, and an arc light.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Indian hybrid Orange.jpg|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption|Indian hybrid Orange]]\nThe weekly market of Katol has long been important and is now attended by from 6000 to 8000 people. Commodities of all kinds are dealt in but the bazar is more especially important as being the second largest cattle - market in the town. In the month of Ashvin (October) the Saraswati fair (Navaratra) is held and is usually attended by about 20,000 people a day. The orchards of the town are, noted for their growth of fine & world-famous oranges.\n[[File:CottonPlant.JPG|thumb|Cotton ready for harvest]]\n\nBut cotton is the staple of Katol trade. In the year 1905-06 26,723 carts of raw uncleaned cotton were sold in the market, and that number is liable to be exceeded in years of heavy harvest, for the town draws produce from the rich valleys of the Jam and Wardha rivers and from many villages of the [[Amravati]] and [[Wardha]] Districts. There are now four ginning factories at work, and three of these have presses also. They are fitted with 216 gins, which in 1905-06 turned out 32,000 bales (or 512,000 maunds) of cleaned cotton.\n\nThe Katol tahsil has a total area of {{convert|800|sqmi|km2}}, of which 56 are comprised in Government forest.\n\nKatol has, on the whole, the poorest soils of the four tahsils as regards composition, although it has all the kali soils of the first class in the [[District]] . The percentages of the various soils are 2 for kali, 55.9 for morand, 28.5 for khardi and 13.2; for bardi. Nevertheless, from an agricultural point of view Katol is the most advanced of the four tahsils, and its lands produce kharif crops as valuable as the wheat of the other [[tahsils]]. The cultivators are intelligent and enterprising to an unusual degree and spend much time and money on improvements to their fields. Of the {{convert|17000|acre|km2}} of irrigated garden land at settlement {{convert|8000|acre|km2}} were in Katol. Of the total area of {{convert|476000|acre|km2}} at settlement, 358,000 were occupied and 332,000 were in cultivation. The actual area cropped has risen since the thirty years' settlement from {{convert|265000|acre|km2}} to {{convert|337000|acre|km2}} in 1906\u201307, an increase of 29 percent, which is the largest in any tahsil. Of the total area 75 percent is occupied, 8.7 is scrub jungle, 4.2 tree-forest, and 11.8 unculturable.<ref name=\"Central Provinces Gazetteers - Nagpur\"/>\n\nOnce Katol and Kalmeshwar talukas in Nagpur district had enough groundwater to irrigate their orange orchards, but in the past decade or so, the water table has gone down to 700\u2013900 feet in almost the entire belt and digging of bore wells has become uneconomical. Farmers here have now switched to conventional dry-land farming of [[cotton]] and [[soybean]], with the area under orange cultivation reduced almost to half.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-21/nagpur/28072048_1_ngri-water-table-farmers|title=Succour for parched Katol orange fields\n |accessdate=21 December 2009 | work=The Times Of India|date=21 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Temples==\n[[Chandi]]ka Devi Mandir \u2013 The temple is believed to have been built during the reign of one king Chandrahasa, who is supposed to have ruled over this territory in the dim and distant past. The construction of the temple is. in the [[Hemadpanthi]] style. It is situated in the old Basti. The 'Gabhara', which contains the idol of the goddess, measures 9.290 m.2 (10' x 10'). It is beautifully carved out of black rock and is in a standing position. On either side of the entrance to the 'Gabhara' are two images in standing posture which appear to be the bodyguards of the goddess Chandika. Outside is the ' Sabhamandap' having windows on all the four sides which serve as inlets for the sunlight. In the center exactly facing the goddess is a 'Honikunda' housed by a little dome. On the 'Mandap' wall, to the left of the goddess, is engraved the image of Lord Gajanan with exquisite skill. Against the outer side of the Mandap-walls are carved the images of animals, wild as well as domestic, and numerous deities which add a tinge of glory and glamor to the solid and grave structure of the building. The architectural designs speak eloquently of the architects of those times. In [[Navratra]] , Shardotsava is celebrated with great \u00e9clat when thousands of people gather to pay homage to the goddess.\n\nSharada Mandir\u2014 The idol is supposed to be ' Svayambhu'. It is a small building housing two images of the same goddess of unequal size. The images depict a sort of crude and rough architecture. In front of the temple is a tank of water of the size of a square measuring 37.161 m.2 (20' x 20'), whose water, it is said, never dries up. The place is venerated by the Hindus as a ' Tirtha Ksetra'. By the side of the tank is another small temple which houses the images of [[Hanuman|Maruti]], [[Ganapati]] and Shivling. To the left of the Sharada Mandir is housed yet another Shivling by the side of which are three small samadhis of unknown persons. Two fairs, one on the occasion of Shardotsava and the other on Chaitra Shuddha 15th, are held when devotees of the goddess gather in large numbers.\n\nShiv Mandir \u2013 The Mandir is situated on the southern bank of a beautiful tank, now let on lease to the Government for pisciculture, with a lovely hillock at the hack and a giant Pimpal tree in the front. The inner shrine or 'Gabhara' of the temple is 5.945 m.2 (8' x 8') with Ling occupying the central position. The Ling is donned with a brass plaque. On the wall facing the visitor are engraved the images of innumerable deities in beautiful and attractive designs. Outside is the 'Mandap' of the temple enclosed on all the four sides with walls having a single entrance in the front. It is used to deliver Kirtans and hold religious discourses in praise of the God. To the south of the temple of Shiv there is a temple of Maruti whose image is about 3 meters (10&nbsp;ft) tall. The idol of Maruti has become the major attraction to the people. The Pimpal tree protects under its shade one more [[Shivling]] and an image of Nandi both carved out of black stone. The natural surroundings like the tank, the hillock and the Pimpal (tree provide an excellent setting and add charm and beauty to the temple. Especially the evenings, at the time of sunset, are lively and pleasant. It has become a good spot of recreation.\n\n==Education==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:BRHS Katol.jpg|right|thumb|Banarasidas Ruiya High School and Junior College, Katol.]]\nThe educational institutions comprise an English middle school \"Banarasidas Ruiya High School and Junior College\" established in year 1945, with capacity for 250 pupils.

Its prosperity depends chiefly on cotton trading, and in recent years most of the municipal income has for that reason been expended on a cotton market.{{cn|date=October 2017}} This is a large enclosure of about {{convert|10|acre|m2}}, securely fenced, and provided with a weighing shed, well, water trough, young shade trees, and an arc light.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Indian hybrid Orange.jpg|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption|Indian hybrid Orange]]\nThe weekly market of Katol has long been important and is now attended by from 6000 to 8000 people. Commodities of all kinds are dealt in but the bazar is more especially important as being the second largest cattle - market in the town. In the month of Ashvin (October) the Saraswati fair (Navaratra) is held and is usually attended by about 20,000 people a day. The orchards of the town are, noted for their growth of fine & world-famous oranges.\n[[File:CottonPlant.JPG|thumb|Cotton ready for harvest]]\n\nBut cotton is the staple of Katol trade. In the year 1905-06 26,723 carts of raw uncleaned cotton were sold in the market, and that number is liable to be exceeded in years of heavy harvest, for the town draws produce from the rich valleys of the Jam and Wardha rivers and from many villages of the [[Amravati]] and [[Wardha]] Districts. There are now four ginning factories at work, and three of these have presses also. They are fitted with 216 gins, which in 1905-06 turned out 32,000 bales (or 512,000 maunds) of cleaned cotton.\n\nThe Katol tahsil has a total area of {{convert|800|sqmi|km2}}, of which 56 are comprised in Government forest.\n\nKatol has, on the whole, the poorest soils of the four tahsils as regards composition, although it has all the kali soils of the first class in the [[District]] . The percentages of the various soils are 2 for kali, 55.9 for morand, 28.5 for khardi and 13.2; for bardi. Nevertheless, from an agricultural point of view Katol is the most advanced of the four tahsils, and its lands produce kharif crops as valuable as the wheat of the other [[tahsils]]. The cultivators are intelligent and enterprising to an unusual degree and spend much time and money on improvements to their fields. Of the {{convert|17000|acre|km2}} of irrigated garden land at settlement {{convert|8000|acre|km2}} were in Katol. Of the total area of {{convert|476000|acre|km2}} at settlement, 358,000 were occupied and 332,000 were in cultivation. The actual area cropped has risen since the thirty years' settlement from {{convert|265000|acre|km2}} to {{convert|337000|acre|km2}} in 1906\u201307, an increase of 29 percent, which is the largest in any tahsil. Of the total area 75 percent is occupied, 8.7 is scrub jungle, 4.2 tree-forest, and 11.8 unculturable.<ref name=\"Central Provinces Gazetteers - Nagpur\"/>\n\nOnce Katol and Kalmeshwar talukas in Nagpur district had enough groundwater to irrigate their orange orchards, but in the past decade or so, the water table has gone down to 700\u2013900 feet in almost the entire belt and digging of bore wells has become uneconomical. Farmers here have now switched to conventional dry-land farming of [[cotton]] and [[soybean]], with the area under orange cultivation reduced almost to half.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-21/nagpur/28072048_1_ngri-water-table-farmers|title=Succour for parched Katol orange fields\n |accessdate=21 December 2009 | work=The Times Of India|date=21 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Temples==\n[[Chandi]]ka Devi Mandir \u2014 The temple is believed to have been built during the reign of one king Chandrahasa, who is supposed to have ruled over this territory in the dim and distant past. The construction of the temple is. in the [[Hemadpanthi]] style. It is situated in the old Basti. The 'Gabhara', which contains the idol of the goddess, measures 9.290 m.2 (10' x 10'). It is beautifully carved out of black rock and is in a standing position. On either side of the entrance to the 'Gabhara' are two images in standing posture which appear to be the bodyguards of the goddess Chandika. Outside is the ' Sabhamandap' having windows on all the four sides which serve as inlets for the sunlight. In the center exactly facing the goddess is a 'Honikunda' housed by a little dome. On the 'Mandap' wall, to the left of the goddess, is engraved the image of Lord Gajanan with exquisite skill. Against the outer side of the Mandap-walls are carved the images of animals, wild as well as domestic, and numerous deities which add a tinge of glory and glamor to the solid and grave structure of the building. The architectural designs speak eloquently of the architects of those times. In [[Navratra]] , Shardotsava is celebrated with great \u00e9clat when thousands of people gather to pay homage to the goddess.\n\nSharada Mandir\u2014 The idol is supposed to be ' Svayambhu'. It is a small building housing two images of the same goddess of unequal size. The images depict a sort of crude and rough architecture. In front of the temple is a tank of water of the size of a square measuring 37.161 m.2 (20' x 20'), whose water, it is said, never dries up. The place is venerated by the Hindus as a ' Tirtha Ksetra'. By the side of the tank is another small temple which houses the images of [[Hanuman|Maruti]], [[Ganapati]] and Shivling. To the left of the Sharada Mandir is housed yet another Shivling by the side of which are three small samadhis of unknown persons. Two fairs, one on the occasion of Shardotsava and the other on Chaitra Shuddha 15th, are held when devotees of the goddess gather in large numbers.\n\nShiv Mandir \u2014 The Mandir is situated on the southern bank of a beautiful tank, now let on lease to the Government for pisciculture, with a lovely hillock at the hack and a giant Pimpal tree in the front. The inner shrine or 'Gabhara' of the temple is 5.945 m.2 (8' x 8') with Ling occupying the central position. The Ling is donned with a brass plaque. On the wall facing the visitor are engraved the images of innumerable deities in beautiful and attractive designs. Outside is the 'Mandap' of the temple enclosed on all the four sides with walls having a single entrance in the front. It is used to deliver Kirtans and hold religious discourses in praise of the God. To the south of the temple of Shiv there is a temple of Maruti whose image is about 3 meters (10&nbsp;ft) tall. The idol of Maruti has become the major attraction to the people. The Pimpal tree protects under its shade one more [[Shivling]] and an image of Nandi both carved out of black stone. The natural surroundings like the tank, the hillock and the Pimpal (tree provide an excellent setting and add charm and beauty to the temple. Especially the evenings, at the time of sunset, are lively and pleasant. It has become a good spot of recreation.\n\n==Education==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:BRHS Katol.jpg|right|thumb|Banarasidas Ruiya High School and Junior College, Katol.]]\nThe educational institutions comprise an English middle school \"Banarasidas Ruiya High School and Junior College\" established in year 1945, with capacity for 250 pupils.

Javier Rodriguez Iglesias, {{a.k.a.}} DJ Linetech, produced their first few songs before he was replaced by Peter Goos. The repertoire mainly consisted of 1980s covers. Dancers Alex da Luz and Jorg Van der Heyden completed the original band setup. The group briefly changed their name to Basics (B6), with the additions of female singer CJ and dancer Sofie.

It was originally invented for characterizing the seismic [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] resulting from [[earthquake]]s and [[bomb]] explosions. It has also been used to determine the fundamental frequency of human speech and to analyze [[radar]] signal returns. Cepstrum pitch determination is particularly effective because the effects of the vocal excitation (pitch) and [[vocal tract]] (formants) are additive in the logarithm of the power spectrum and thus clearly separate.<ref name=noll67/>\n\nThe autocepstrum is defined as the cepstrum of the [[autocorrelation]]. The autocepstrum is more accurate than the cepstrum in the analysis of data with echoes.\n\nThe cepstrum is a representation used in [[homomorphic filtering|homomorphic signal processing]], to convert signals combined by [[convolution]] (such as a source and filter) into sums of their cepstra, for linear separation. In particular, the power cepstrum is often used as a feature vector for representing the human voice and musical signals. For these applications, the spectrum is usually first transformed using the [[mel scale]]. The result is called the [[mel-frequency cepstrum]] or MFC (its coefficients are called mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, or MFCCs). It is used for voice identification, [[pitch detection algorithm|pitch detection]] and much more. The cepstrum is useful in these applications because the low-frequency periodic excitation from the [[vocal cord]]s and the [[formant]] filtering of the [[vocal tract]], which convolve in the [[time domain]] and multiply in the [[frequency domain]], are additive and in different regions in the quefrency domain.\n\nRecently cepstrum based deconvolution was used to remove the effect of the stochastic impulse trains, which originates an [[Electromyography#Surface_and_intramuscular_EMG_recording_electrodes|sEMG]] signal, from the power spectrum of sEMG signal itself. In this way, only information on motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape and amplitude were maintained, and then, used to estimate the parameters of a time-domain model of the MUAP itself.<ref>G. Biagetti, P. Crippa, S. Orcioni, and C. Turchetti, \u201cHomomorphic deconvolution for muap estimation from surface emg signals,\u201d IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 328\u2013 338, March 2017.</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Quefrency}}Cepstral concepts==\n\nThe [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] of a cepstral graph is called the '''quefrency'''.<ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\">{{cite book |title=Taschenbuch der Informatik - Band III - Anwendungen und spezielle Systeme der Nachrichtenverarbeitung |language=German |editor-first1=Karl W. |editor-last1=Steinbuch |editor-link1=Karl W.

For example, if the sampling rate of an audio signal is 44100&nbsp;Hz and there is a large peak in the cepstrum whose quefrency is 100 samples, the peak indicates the presence of a fundamental frequency that is 44100/100 = 441&nbsp;Hz. This peak occurs in the cepstrum because the harmonics in the spectrum are periodic and the period corresponds to the fundamental frequency, since harmonics are integer multiples of said fundamental frequency. \n\nNote that a pure sine wave can not be used to test the cepstrum for its pitch determination from quefrency as a pure sine wave does not contain any harmonics and does not lead to quefrency peaks. Rather, a test signal containing harmonics should be used (such as the sum of at least two sines where the second sine is some harmonic (multiple) of the first sine, or better, a signal with a square or triangle waveform, as such signals provide many overtones in the spectrum.).\n\n=={{anchor|Filter}}Filtering==\n\nPlaying further on the anagram theme, a filter that operates on a cepstrum might be called a ''lifter''. A low-pass lifter is similar to a low-pass filter in the [[frequency domain]]. It can be implemented by multiplying by a window in the quefrency domain and then converting back to the frequency domain, resulting in a modified signal, i.e. with signal echo beeing reduced.\n\n==Convolution==\n\nA very important property of the cepstral domain is that the [[convolution]] of two signals can be expressed as the addition of their complex cepstra:\n\n: <math>x_1 * x_2 \\mapsto x'_1 + x'_2.</math>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* D.

It was originally invented for characterizing the seismic [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] resulting from [[earthquake]]s and [[bomb]] explosions. It has also been used to determine the fundamental frequency of human speech and to analyze [[radar]] signal returns. Cepstrum pitch determination is particularly effective because the effects of the vocal excitation (pitch) and [[vocal tract]] (formants) are additive in the logarithm of the power spectrum and thus clearly separate.<ref name=noll67/>\n\nThe autocepstrum is defined as the cepstrum of the [[autocorrelation]]. The autocepstrum is more accurate than the cepstrum in the analysis of data with echoes.\n\nThe cepstrum is a representation used in [[homomorphic filtering|homomorphic signal processing]], to convert signals combined by [[convolution]] (such as a source and filter) into sums of their cepstra, for linear separation. In particular, the power cepstrum is often used as a feature vector for representing the human voice and musical signals. For these applications, the spectrum is usually first transformed using the [[mel scale]]. The result is called the [[mel-frequency cepstrum]] or MFC (its coefficients are called mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, or MFCCs). It is used for voice identification, [[pitch detection algorithm|pitch detection]] and much more. The cepstrum is useful in these applications because the low-frequency periodic excitation from the [[vocal cord]]s and the [[formant]] filtering of the [[vocal tract]], which convolve in the [[time domain]] and multiply in the [[frequency domain]], are additive and in different regions in the quefrency domain.\n\nRecently cepstrum based deconvolution was used to remove the effect of the stochastic impulse trains, which originates an [[Electromyography#Surface_and_intramuscular_EMG_recording_electrodes|sEMG]] signal, from the power spectrum of sEMG signal itself. In this way, only information on motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape and amplitude were maintained, and then, used to estimate the parameters of a time-domain model of the MUAP itself.<ref>G. Biagetti, P. Crippa, S. Orcioni, and C. Turchetti, \u201cHomomorphic deconvolution for muap estimation from surface emg signals,\u201d IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 328\u2013 338, March 2017.</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Quefrency}}Cepstral concepts==\n\nThe [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] of a cepstral graph is called the '''quefrency'''.<ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\">{{cite book |title=Taschenbuch der Informatik - Band III - Anwendungen und spezielle Systeme der Nachrichtenverarbeitung |language=German |editor-first1=Karl W. |editor-last1=Steinbuch |editor-link1=Karl W.

For example, if the sampling rate of an audio signal is 44100&nbsp;Hz and there is a large peak in the cepstrum whose quefrency is 100 samples, the peak indicates the presence of a fundamental frequency that is 44100/100 = 441&nbsp;Hz. This peak occurs in the cepstrum because the harmonics in the spectrum are periodic and the period corresponds to the fundamental frequency, since harmonics are integer multiples of said fundamental frequency. \n\nNote that a pure sine wave can not be used to test the cepstrum for its pitch determination from quefrency as a pure sine wave does not contain any harmonics and does not lead to quefrency peaks. Rather, a test signal containing harmonics should be used (such as the sum of at least two sines where the second sine is some harmonic (multiple) of the first sine, or better, a signal with a square or triangle waveform, as such signals provide many overtones in the spectrum.).\n\n=={{anchor|Filter}}Filtering==\n\nPlaying further on the anagram theme, a filter that operates on a cepstrum might be called a ''lifter''. A low-pass lifter is similar to a low-pass filter in the [[frequency domain]]. It can be implemented by multiplying by a window in the quefrency domain and then converting back to the frequency domain, resulting in a modified signal, i.e. with signal echo beeing reduced.\n\n==Convolution==\n\nA very important property of the cepstral domain is that the [[convolution]] of two signals can be expressed as the addition of their complex cepstra:\n\n: <math>x_1 * x_2 \\mapsto x'_1 + x'_2.</math>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* D.

Rebalancing the job market in the private sector will also prove to be a challenge since it is currently majority staffed by expatriates. One of the difficulties is that the private sector has lower paying salaries and expats are easier to hire and fire. Currently twice as many Saudi nationals work in the public sector than in the private sector.

Rebalancing the job market in the private sector will also prove to be a challenge since it is currently majority staffed by expatriates. One of the difficulties is that the private sector has lower paying salaries and expats are easier to hire and fire. Currently twice as many Saudi nationals work in the public sector than in the private sector. The challenge lies in getting a larger portion of the nationals to accept lower paying jobs that could require higher working hours than that of the public sector. Another aspect to be considered is moving the private sector away from the business activities that require very low-cost labor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2017-07-20-vision-2030-saudi-kinninmont.pdf |title=Vision 2030 and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Social Contract Austerity and Transformation |last= |first= |date= |website=Chathamhouse|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hilal Khashan from the American conservative think tank [[Middle East Forum]], to have the 2030 plan succeed ignoring the relationship between economic and political development is no longer a viable option, the developments required to increase the GDP as planned will encourage the breakage of the tribal system taking place.

However, the Union was met with much opposition due to its constitutional framework, which allegedly threatened Malay sovereignty over Malaya. A series of Malay congresses were held, culminating in the formation of the nationalist party, UMNO on 10 May 1946 at the Third Malay Congress in [[Johor Bahru]], with Datuk [[Onn Jaafar]] as its leader. UMNO strongly opposed the Malayan Union, but originally did not seek political power. UMNO had no choice but continue playing a supporting role to the British colonial adminsitration. The British cooperated with UMNO leaders and helped to defeat the communist insurgency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/malaysia/history |title=Malaysia : History &#124; The Commonwealth |format= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, after the Malayan Union had been replaced by the semi-autonomous Federation of Malaya, UMNO shifted its focus to politics and governance. According to at least one official school textbook published during UMNO's time in government, the party fought for other races once they were at the helm of the country.<ref>Adam, Ramlah binti, Samuri, Abdul Hakim bin & Fadzil, Muslimin bin (2004).

After several other successes in local council elections, the coalition was formalised as an \"Alliance\" in 1954.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, p. 124, 135.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, state elections were held. In these elections, the Alliance won 226 of the 268 seats nationwide. In the same year, a Federal Legislative Council was formed, comprising 100 seats. 52 would be elected, and the rest would be appointed by the British High Commissioner. The Alliance demanded that 60 of the seats be elected, but despite the Tunku flying out to London to negotiate, the British held firm. Elections for the council were held in 1955, and the Alliance, which had now expanded to include the [[Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC), issued a manifesto stating its goals of achieving independence by 1959, requiring a minimum of primary school education for all children, protecting the rights of the Malay rulers as constitutional monarchs, ending the Communist emergency, and reforming the civil service through the hiring of more Malayans as opposed to foreigners.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, pp. 137\u2013140.</ref><ref>[http://www.mic.org.my/history.php \"About MIC: History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220052725/http://www.mic.org.my/history.php |date=20 February 2006 }}.

The Tunku became the first Chief Minister of Malaya.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, p. 140.</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, the [[Malayan Emergency]] had been on-going. The [[Malayan Races Liberation Army]] (MRLA), supported by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP), committed acts such as tearing down farms, disrupting transportation and communication networks, attacking police stations, and so forth. Their stated goal was the end of colonialism in Malaya. The British declared the MCP, along with several left-wing political groups, illegal in 1948. In 1955, the Alliance government together with the British High Commissioner declared an amnesty for the communist insurgents who surrendered. Representatives from the Alliance government also met with leaders of the MCP in an attempt to resolve the conflict peacefully, as their manifesto in the election stated. [[Chin Peng]], the MCP Secretary-General, insisted that the MCP be allowed to contest elections and be declared a legal political party as a pre-condition to laying down arms. However, the Tunku rejected this, leading to an impasse.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, p. 103\u2013107.</ref>\n\nIn 1956, the Tunku led a group of negotiators, comprising Alliance politicians and representatives of the Malay rulers, to London. There, they brokered a deal with the British for independence. The date of independence was set as 31 August 1957 on the condition that an independent commission is set up to draft a constitution for the country. The Alliance government was also required to avoid seizing British and other foreign assets in Malaya. A defence treaty would also be signed.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, pp. 148, 151.</ref>\n\nThe [[Reid Commission]], led by [[Lord William Reid]], was formed to draft the constitution. Although enshrining concepts such as [[federalism]] and a constitutional monarchy, the proposed constitution also contained provisions protecting special rights for the Malays, such as [[Racial quota|quotas]] in admission to higher education and the civil service, and making [[Islam]] the official religion of the federation. It also made [[Malay language|Malay]] the official language of the nation, although the right to vernacular education in Chinese and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] would be protected. Although the Tunku and the Malay rulers had asked the Reid Commission to ensure that \"''in an independent Malaya all nationals should be accorded equal rights, privileges and opportunities and there must not be discrimination on grounds of race and creed'',\" the Malay privileges, which many in UMNO backed, were cited as necessary by the Reid Commission as a form of [[affirmative action]] that would eventually be phased out. These measures were included as Articles 3, 152 and [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|153]] of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]].<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, p. 153\u2013155.</ref><ref>Ooi, Jeff (2005).

However, for the Alliance, the election was marred by internal strife when MCA leader [[Lim Chong Eu]] demanded his party be allowed to contest 40 of the 104 seats available. When the Tunku rejected this, many of Lim's supporters resigned, and ran in the election as independents, which cost the Alliance some seats.<ref>Goh, Cheng Teik (1994). Malaysia: Beyond Communal Politics, p. 18. Pelanduk Publications. {{ISBN|967-978-475-4}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the Tunku mooted the idea of forming a federation named \"Malaysia\", which would consist of the British colonies of [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]], [[Sarawak]], and also the British [[Protectorate]] of [[Brunei]]. The reasoning behind this was that this would allow the federal government to control and combat communist activities, especially in Singapore. It was also feared that if Singapore achieved independence, it would become a base for Chinese chauvinists to threaten Malayan sovereignty. To balance out the ethnic composition of the new nation, the other states, whose Malay and indigenous populations would balance out the Singaporean Chinese majority, were also included.<ref>Shuid, Mahdi & Yunus, Mohd. Fauzi (2001). ''Malaysian Studies'', p. 29. Longman. {{ISBN|983-74-2024-3}}.</ref>\n\nAfter much negotiation, a constitution was hammered out with some minor changes. For instance, the Malay privileges were now made available to all \"[[Bumiputra]]\", a group comprising the Malays and other indigenous peoples of Malaysia. However, the new states were also granted some autonomy unavailable to the original nine states of Malaya. After negotiations in July 1963, it was agreed that Malaysia would come into being on 31 August 1963, consisting of Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak. Brunei ultimately decided to opt-out of the federation due in part because of an [[Brunei revolt|armed revolt]] by the People's Party (''Parti Rakyat Brunei'') which objected to the formation of Malaysia,<ref>Shuid & Yunus, p. 31.</ref> and the Sultan of Brunei [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]]'s demand that he be recognised as the most senior Malay ruler\u2014a demand that was rejected.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mathews |first=Philip |title=Chronicle of Malaysia: Fifty Years of Headline News, 1963\u20132013 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=md9UAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9789671061749&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje7pysnorRAhUFWxoKHdQWAPsQ6AEIHDAA |year=February 2014 |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |isbn=978-967-10617-4-9 |pages=29}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]] strenuously objected to this development, with Indonesia claiming Malaysia represented a form of [[neocolonialism]] and the Philippines [[North Borneo dispute|claiming Sabah as its territory]]. The United Nations sent a commission to the region which approved the merger after having delayed the date of Malaysia's formation to investigate. Despite further protests from the Indonesian President, [[Sukarno]], the formation of Malaysia was proclaimed on 16 September 1963. Indonesia then declared a \"[[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]]\" with Malaysia, sending [[commando]]s to perform guerilla attacks in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak). The confrontation was ended when [[Suharto]] [[Transition to the New Order|replaced]] Sukarno as president. The Philippines, which had withdrawn diplomatic recognition from Malaysia, also recognised Malaysia around the same time.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, pp. 214, 217, 220, 222, 223.</ref>\n\nTo reflect the change of name to Malaysia, UMNO's coalition partners promptly altered their names to the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] and the [[Malaysian Indian Congress]]. Several political parties in East Malaysia, especially Sarawak, also joined the Alliance to allow it to contest elections there.\n\nIn the [[1963 Singapore general election|1963 Singapore state elections]], the Alliance decided to challenge [[Lee Kuan Yew]]'s governing [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) through the [[Singapore Alliance Party]]. UMNO politicians actively campaigned in Singapore for the Singapore Alliance, contending that the Singapore Malays were being treated as second-class citizens under the Chinese-dominated PAP government. All of the UMNO-backed Malay candidates lost to PAP candidates. UMNO Secretary-General [[Syed Jaafar Albar]] travelled to Singapore to address the Malay populace. At one rally, he called the PAP Malay politicians un-Islamic and traitors to the Malay race, greatly straining [[PAP-UMNO relations]]. The PAP politicians, who saw this as a betrayal of an earlier agreement with the Alliance not to contest elections in Malaysia and Singapore respectively, decided on running on the mainland in the [[1964 Malaysian general election|1964 general election]]. Although the PAP contested nine Parliamentary seats and attracted large crowds at its rallies, it won only one seat. The strain in race relations caused by the communal lines along which the political factions had been drawn led to the [[1964 Race Riots]] in Singapore.\n\nAlliance leaders also were alarmed at Lee's behaviour, which they considered unseemly for the Chief Minister of a state. They thought he was acting as if he were the Prime Minister of a sovereign nation. Finance Minister [[Tan Siew Sin]] of the MCA labelled Lee as the \"greatest, disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya.\" Lee now seemed determined to press forward politically and continue contesting elections nationwide, with the formation of the [[Malaysian Solidarity Council]]\u2014a coalition of political parties which called for a \"[[Malaysian Malaysia]]\", duplicating the effort introduced earlier by Dato' Onn Ja'afar.\n\nOn 7 August 1965, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia. Despite last-ditch attempts by PAP leaders, including Lee Kuan Yew, to keep Singapore as a state in the union, the Parliament on 9 August 1965 voted 126\u20130 in favour of the expulsion of Singapore.\n\nTunku opened his speech in Parliament with the words, \"In all the 10 years of my leadership of this House I have never had a duty so unpleasant as this to perform. The announcement which I am making concerns the separation of Singapore from the rest of the Federation.\"<ref name=\"tunku_speech\">Rahman, Tunku Abdul (1965).

His speech included this quote: \"For me, it would be a moment of anguish. I mean for me, it is a moment of anguish because all my life...you see the whole of my adult life...I have believed in merger and the unity of the two territories. You know it's a people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship...\" Hence, Singapore became the only country in the history of the modern world to gain independence against its own will. After the separation and independence of Singapore in 1965, the Singapore branch of UMNO was renamed the [[Singapore Malay National Organisation]] (''Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura'').\n\n=== Post-separation ===\nAfter the separation of Singapore from the Federation, the Alliance leaders focused on continuing its policies. One involved the Malay language, which was the official language of Malaysia. UMNO sought to reduce the reliance on English in government affairs. In this, it was aided by PAS, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, which backed special rights for the Bumiputra, and the strengthening of Islam's position in public affairs. However, the PAP's Malaysian branch, which had now become [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP), took a very strong stance against this, and continued the expelled PAP's call for a \"Malaysian Malaysia\". In 1968, the newly formed [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia]] or Gerakan, led by Lim Chong Eu, also adopted the DAP's stance.<ref>Means, Gordon P. (1991). ''Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation'', pp. 3, 5, 29. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-588988-6}}.</ref>\n\nMatters came to a head in the [[1969 Malaysian general election|1969 general election]]. When polling closed on the mainland peninsula (West Malaysia) on 10 May, it emerged the Alliance had won less than half of the popular vote, although it was assured of 66 out of 104 Parliamentary seats available. Much of the losses came from the MCA, thus straining relations between the two parties.{{clarify|date=March 2020}} However, the Alliance was dealt an even larger blow on the state level, losing control of [[Kelantan]], [[Perak]], and [[Penang]].<ref>Means, p. 6, 7.</ref>\n\nThe [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King) declared a national emergency after being advised by the national government to do so. Parliament was suspended, with a [[National Operations Council]] (NOC) led by Deputy Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]] of UMNO, taking over the government. Further polling in East Malaysia as a continuation of the general election was also postponed indefinitely. Although the Cabinet still met under the Tunku as Prime Minister, his role was largely symbolic, with Tun Razak taking over the role of chief executive.<ref>Means, p. 8.</ref>\n\nUMNO backbencher [[Mahathir Mohamad]], who had lost his Parliamentary seat in the election, wrote a letter to the Tunku, commending his leadership. Mahathir organised a campaign with [[University of Malaya]] lecturer [[Raja Muktaruddin Daim]], circulating his letter among the student body of local universities. Mass demonstrations broke out calling for \"Malay sovereignty\" and the Tunku's ouster. After rioting broke out in June, Home Affairs Minister [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]] and Tun Razak agreed to expel Mahathir and former Executive Secretary of UMNO [[Musa Hitam]] from the party for breaching party discipline.\n\nThe suspended elections in East Malaysia were held in 1970, and gave the Alliance government a solid two-thirds majority in Parliament again. On 31 August that year, the Tunku announced the national ideology\u2014[[Rukunegara]]\u2014and his planned retirement as Prime Minister in favour of Tun Razak. He also stated Parliament would be restored the following year.<ref>Means, pp. 11, 12.</ref>\n\n=== The New Economic Policy ===\nAfter Tun Razak succeeded the Tunku in 1970, he began asserting UMNO's leadership in the Alliance more strongly. When the Tunku led the coalition, he had always consulted Alliance leaders regarding policy\u2014if an Alliance leader objected, the policy was not passed. Under Tun Razak, UMNO was the base of the Alliance and thus the government. The NOC which he led until Parliament reconvened consisted of 7 Malays, one Chinese and one Indian.<ref>Means, pp. 20, 21.</ref>\n\nIn Tun Razak's cabinet, the two most powerful men other than him were Ismail Abdul Rahman and [[Ghazali Shafie]], who had declared the Westminster-style Parliamentary system inappropriate for Malaysia. Tun Razak also readmitted to the party \"ultras\" who had been expelled, like Mahathir and Musa Hitam. Mahathir gained notoriety after his expulsion from UMNO by authoring ''[[The Malay Dilemma]]'', a book promptly banned from Malaysia, which posited that the Malays are the definitive people of Malaysia, and thus deserved special rights as the sovereign people of the nation. It also controversially argued that the Malays needed affirmative action to overcome deficiencies in their genetic stock.<ref>Means, pp. 20\u201322.</ref>\n\nHussein Onn, son of UMNO founder Dato' Onn Ja'afar, soon became a rising star in UMNO. After Ismail died suddenly of a heart attack in 1973, Hussein Onn succeeded him as Deputy Prime Minister. In the [[Cabinet shuffle|cabinet reshuffle]] that promoted Hussein Onn, Mahathir was given the key post of Minister for Education.<ref>Means, pp. 22, 23.</ref>\n\nThe Tun Razak government announced the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in 1971. Its stated goal was to \"eventually eradicate poverty... irrespective of race\" through a \"rapidly expanding economy\" which emphasised to increase the Malays' share in the national economy to a reasonable portion between all the races. The NEP targeted a 30 per cent Malay share of the economy by 1990. The government contended that this would lead to a \"just society\" (\"''Masyarakat Adil''\"), the latter slogan being used to promote acceptance of the policy. Quotas in education and the civil service that the Constitution had explicitly provided for were expanded by the NEP, which also mandated government interference in the private sector. For instance, 30% of all shares in [[initial public offering]]s (IPOs) would be disbursed by the government to selective [[Bumiputra]]s. The old civil service hiring quota of 4 Malays for every non-Malay's was effectively disregarded in practice; between 1969 and 1973, 98% of all new government employees were Malay. Five new universities were opened under the NEP, two of which were targeted to focus on the poor Malays and Muslim citizens.<ref>Means, pp. 23\u201327.</ref>\n\nTun Razak also began shoring up the government by bringing in several former opposition parties into the fold of the Alliance. Gerakan, PPP, PAS, and several former opposition parties in East Malaysia joined the coalition, which was renamed as [[Barisan Nasional]]. Barisan was formally registered as an organisation in 1974, the same year in which a general election was held.<ref>Means, pp. 29, 30.</ref>\n\nThere had been much internal conflict in the National Front regarding the election; in 1973, [[Lim Keng Yaik]] and several supporters of his aggressive pro-Chinese stance left the MCA for Gerakan. This contributed to internal strife, as the MCA was no longer the sole representative of Chinese interests in the National Front.<ref>Means, p. 31.</ref>\n\nDiscontent among student organisations in Malaysian universities soon posed a new problem for the UMNO-led government. However, Mahathir in his capacity as Minister for Education issued a stern warning to university students and faculty not to become involved in politics. However, after stories that children of rubber tappers had died after consuming poisonous wild yam due to poverty, university students reacted by staging the 1974 Baling demonstrations. The demonstrations resulted in the arrest of over 1,000 students, including [[Anwar Ibrahim]] who wasdetained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]]. In 1975, parliament passed amendments to the Universities and University Colleges Act (UUCA) which banned students from expressing support of or holding positions in any political party or trade union without written consent from the university's Vice-Chancellor.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://coconuts.co/kl/news/story-behind-some-malaysias-biggest-street-rallies/|title=The story behind some of Malaysia\u2019s biggest street rallies|access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref> The act also banned political demonstrations from being held on university campuses. In 1976, however, mass demonstrations were held at the MARA Institute of Technology, protesting the UUCA. Mahathir then threatened to revoke the scholarships of the students, most of whom relied on public support to pay their way through university.<ref>Means, pp. 36, 37.</ref>\n\nBN was also challenged in Sarawak after the 1974 election, which saw the [[Sarawak National Party]] (SNAP) led by [[James Wong (politician)|James Wong]] become tied with the DAP as the largest opposition party in Parliament, both of them holding nine seats each. SNAP had campaigned against BN on a platform of opposing Chief Minister [[Abdul Rahman Ya'kub]]'s pro-Malay policies, charging them with alienating the rural indigenous natives of Sarawak, such as the [[Iban people|Iban]]. SNAP had been expelled from the Alliance in 1965 for supporting increased autonomy for Sarawak. In the aftermath of the election, Abdul Rahman ordered the detention of James Wong under the Sedition Act. SNAP elected a new leader, [[Leo Moggie]], who secured the release of Wong and the entry of SNAP into BN in 1976.<ref>Means, pp. 39, 40.</ref>\n\nIn Sabah, BN controlled the state government through the [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO), which strongly backed UMNO's pro-Malay and pro-Islam policies. In 1973, Islam was made the official Sabah state religion (the official religion of Sabah was originally Christianity, as permitted by the agreement signed before the merger), and usage of indigenous languages such as those of the [[Kadazan]] people was discontinued in favour of the Malay language. The USNO Chief Minister, [[Mustapha Harun]], was also known for favouring [[political patronage]] as a means of allocating valuable timber contracts, and living an extravagant lifestyle, being ferried to his A$1 million [[Queensland]] home by jets provided with Sabahan public funds.<ref>Means, pp. 41, 42.</ref>\n\n=== UMNO Baru (New UMNO) ===\n[[File:Mahathir Mohamad addressing the United Nations General Assembly (September 25 2003).jpg|thumb|Mahathir Mohamad]]\n{{Further|1987 United Malays National Organisation leadership election|1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis}}\n\nOn 24 April 1987, UMNO held its Annual General Assembly and triennial Party election. The then Prime Minister and party President, [[Mahathir Mohamad]], faced his first party election in 12 years, having been elected unopposed since the 1975 UMNO election.\n\nThe politics of the Malays, particularly UMNO politics, had undergone a sea change in the first few years of the Mahathir stewardship, and the party presidency was challenged for the second time in 41 years. The first challenge was a dull affair in which Hussein Onn was opposed by a minor party official named Sulaiman Palestin. In fact, in the early 1950s, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]'s presidency had also been challenged by [[Chik Mohamad Yusuf|C. M. Yusof]], who later became the [[Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat]], but [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Tunku]] was not properly considered an incumbent then, being only a care-taker president.\n\nThe 1987 contest was a vastly different matter. Mahathir was opposed by his very popular former Finance Minister, [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]]. The press took to referring to Mahathir and his supporters as Team A, and Razaleigh's camp as Team B. Team B included then Deputy Prime Minister Tun [[Musa Hitam]], who was also the incumbent Deputy President of UMNO seeking re-election, as well as Datuk [[Suhaimi Kamaruddin]], the former head of UMNO Youth and president of the Belia 4B youth organisation.<ref>Means, p. 201.</ref>\n\nTeam B was critical of Mahathir's policies, arguing that the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] (NEP) had failed to benefit the poor Malays. It also criticised Mahathir's leadership style, alleging he acted unilaterally without consulting other leaders in UMNO and the Barisan Nasional. Team B was also perceived as less Islamist than Mahathir's faction.<ref name=\"means_202\">Means, p. 202.</ref>\n\nMahathir claimed that the charges against him were groundless, and suggested that his opponents were fracturing Malay unity and were only motivated by greed.<ref name=\"means_202\"/>\n\nEventually, Mahathir was returned to office. However, he was elected with such a small majority of 43 (761 against 718 votes) that questions were immediately raised about his mandate. Team B supporters, many of whom had been anticipating a victory of similar margins, suspected that the election had been fixed. The Team B candidate for Deputy President, Musa Hitam, had also been defeated by [[Ghafar Baba]] of Team A, while two of the three Vice-Presidents were Team A candidates. The Supreme Council comprised 16 Team A candidates and 9 Team B candidates.<ref>Means, p. 204.</ref>\n\nAllegations were made that several delegates who had voted were drawn from UMNO branches not properly registered. There were also several unproved allegations being bandied about that the balloting process had not been above board.<ref name=\"means_206\">Means, p. 206.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Razaleigh pledged to support Mahathir, provided that a \"witch hunt\" was not launched. However, Mahathir promptly purged the government cabinet of all Team B members, and launched similar reshuffles in state and local governments.<ref>Means, p. 205.</ref>\n\nOn 25 June 1987, an appeal was filed by 12 of the UMNO delegates to have the assembly and the election of April 1987 declared null. After one of the delegates, Hussain bin Manap, withdrew unexpectedly in August from filing the appeal, the remaining litigants have since become famous as the \"UMNO 11.\" Although Razaleigh and Musa Hitam were not among the plaintiffs, it was widely believed that Razaleigh was funding the appeal.<ref name=\"means_206\"/>\n\nAfter a series of interlocutory hearings over the discovery of documents that took more than seven months, the matter finally came before Justice Harun Hashim in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 4 February 1988. The judge ruled that under the existing law he had no option but to find the party, UMNO, to be an unlawful society due to the existence of several unregistered branches\u2014an illegal act under the Societies Act of 1966. The question of the Assembly itself being illegal therefore became academic.<ref name=\"means_218\">Means, pp. 218, 219.</ref>\n\n\"'It is a very hard decision to declare UMNO unlawful,' said Justice Datuk Harun Hashim in his February 4 judgement. 'But the law was made by our Parliament and certainly UMNO was aware [of the Societies Act] because they were in the majority [in Parliament] at all times [when the law was made].' Under the 1966 Act, amended five times over the years, and most recently by Mahathir's government, each of the society's branches has to register separately with the Registrar....\"<ref name=\"means_218\"/>\n\nThe Tunku and former UMNO President [[Hussein Onn]] set up a new party called [[Semangat 46|UMNO Malaysia]], which claimed to be the successor to the old UMNO. UMNO Malaysia was supported mainly by members of the Team B faction from UMNO, but Mahathir was also invited to join the party leadership. However, the party collapsed after the Registrar of Societies refused to register it as a society without providing an explanation.<ref>Means, pp. 224, 225.</ref>\n\nMahathir showed no interest in reviving UMNO, and instead he set in motion the machinery to form a new surrogate party, and in due course, registered a party formally called Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Bersatu (Baru) or UMNO (New) a week after UMNO Malaysia's registration was rejected. Eventually the suffix \"(New)\" was dropped, and UMNO (Baru) became both the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' successor of UMNO (with the old UMNO's assets handed over).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Rencana/20121201/re_09/Terus-fokus-menyatukan-Melayu|title=Terus fokus menyatukan Melayu|publisher=Utusan Online|date=1 December 2012}}</ref> Most of its leaders, however, were selected from Team A of the old UMNO, with Team B ignored.<ref>Means, pp. 224, 225, 230......\n</ref>\n\nIn [[1999 Malaysian general election|10th general election]] in 1999, rocked by the arrest and trial of former UMNO deputy [[Anwar Ibrahim]] and the subsequent formation of the [[Barisan Alternatif]] opposition coalition, UMNO's share dipped to 54% of the vote and 102 out of 144 seats.\n\n=== Post-Mahathir ===\n[[File:Abdullah Badawi in April 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An official photo of former prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.|[[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] served as the 5th Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2003-2009.]]\n[[File:Najib Razak 2008-08-21.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An official photo of former prime minister Najib Tun Razak.|[[Najib Tun Razak]] served as the 6th Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2009-2018.]]\nAfter Mahathir stepped down as President of UMNO in 2003, he was replaced by his designated successor, [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], who by virtue of his new position also became [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]]. [[Najib Razak]], the son of [[Tun Abdul Razak]], took over as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia]].\n\nIn the [[Malaysian General Election, 2004|11th general election]] in 2004, Barisan Nasional, under Abdullah's leadership, enjoyed a landslide victory. However, in the [[Malaysian General Election, 2008|12th general election]] in 2008, the coalition for the first time fell short of a two-thirds majority in the Parliament. UMNO Chief Ministers were ousted in the states of [[Selangor]], [[Perak]], [[Penang]] and [[Kedah]]. As a result, Abdullah resigned as President of UMNO and Prime Minister in 2009. He was succeeded by Najib.\n\nUnder Najib's leadership, UMNO gained a total of 9 seats in the [[2013 Malaysian general election|13th general election]] and retook the state of [[Kedah]].\n\nEventually, Najib's rule came to an end on 9 May 2018, when Mahathir, himself a former UMNO president, and the [[Pakatan Harapan]] coalition won the [[2018 Malaysian general election|14th General Election]] by gaining 45 seats, with UMNO losing 54, putting an end to 61 years of UMNO Rule which began since the country's independence in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44036178|title=Malaysia election: Opposition scores historic victory|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2018|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> On 12 May, three days after the election, three UMNO Member of Parliament left and joined Mahathir's [[Malaysian United Indigenous Party|Bersatu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/12/three-johor-umno-reps-jump-to-pribumi/|title=Three Johor Umno reps jump to Pribumi|publisher=The Star|date = 12 May 2018|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> The subsequent day as many as 50 UMNO party members, including Kelantan Wanita UMNO information chief Zarina Md Eusope left and also joined Bersatu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/13/kelantan-wanita-umno-info-chief-50-others-jump-to-pribumi/|title=Kelantan Wanita Umno info chief, 50 others, jump to Pribumi|publisher=The Star|date=13 May 2018|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> Sabah UMNO also saw an exodus of members, with Sabah Wanita UMNO chief alongside 200 other members leaving the party to join the [[Sabah Heritage Party|Parti Warisan Sabah]] in late May. 10 state legislative assemblymen, five Member of Parliaments and two Senators also left in December the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/12/12/sabah-umno-exodus-begins-with-nine-of-10-assemblymen-leaving-party/|title=Sabah Umno exodus sees nine of 10 Aduns, five of six MPs leave|publisher=The Star|date=12 December 2018|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\n{{See also|Malay Islamic identity}}\nUMNO overtly represents the Malays of Malaysia, although any [[Bumiputra]] (indigenous Malaysian, a category which includes people such as the non-Malay and usually non-Muslim [[Kadazan]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], etc. of East Malaysia) may join the party.

Controversies ==\n=== Challenge to UMNO's right to exist ===\nEvery year, UMNO is obliged to hold the General Assembly to extend their rule according to the Clauses set by the Registry of Societies (RoS) Malaysia. And once every five years, UMNO is obliged to appoint their highest bodies. The last time UMNO held the election of the highest division and council level was on 19 October 2013. So the new election was supposed to be held on 19 April 2018. Their application for the postponement of the election until 19 October 2019 has to be approved by RoS in accordance with Clause 10.16. But critics have claimed that this is illegal and supposedly the existence of an UMNO organisation is banned.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/420525|title=Umno - apa selepas hari ini, 19 Apr 2018?|author=Hanipa Maidin|language=Malay|publisher=Malaysiakini|date=19 April 2018|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/bahasa/s/40443/|title=RoS patut isytihar Umno haram 19 April, kata peguam Dr Mahathir|author=Bede Hong|language=Malay|publisher=The Malaysian Insight|date=1 March 2018|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1MDB ===\nMedia reports from June 2018 indicated that the [[Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission|MACC]] froze bank accounts associated with UMNO, purportedly in relation to investigations into the 1MDB controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2018/06/385592/macc-has-frozen-supps-account|title=MACC has frozen SUPP's account|website=www.nst.com.my|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Welsh, B (ed).

However, the Union was met with much opposition due to its constitutional framework, which allegedly threatened Malay sovereignty over Malaya. A series of Malay congresses were held, culminating in the formation of the nationalist party, UMNO on 10 May 1946 at the Third Malay Congress in [[Johor Bahru]], with Datuk [[Onn Jaafar]] as its leader. UMNO strongly opposed the Malayan Union, but originally did not seek political power. UMNO had no choice but continue playing a supporting role to the British colonial adminsitration. The British cooperated with UMNO leaders and helped to defeat the communist insurgency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/malaysia/history |title=Malaysia : History &#124; The Commonwealth |format= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, after the Malayan Union had been replaced by the semi-autonomous Federation of Malaya, UMNO shifted its focus to politics and governance. According to at least one official school textbook published during UMNO's time in government, the party fought for other races once they were at the helm of the country.<ref>Adam, Ramlah binti, Samuri, Abdul Hakim bin & Fadzil, Muslimin bin (2004).

After several other successes in local council elections, the coalition was formalised as an \"Alliance\" in 1954.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, p. 124, 135.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, state elections were held. In these elections, the Alliance won 226 of the 268 seats nationwide. In the same year, a Federal Legislative Council was formed, comprising 100 seats. 52 would be elected, and the rest would be appointed by the British High Commissioner. The Alliance demanded that 60 of the seats be elected, but despite the Tunku flying out to London to negotiate, the British held firm. Elections for the council were held in 1955, and the Alliance, which had now expanded to include the [[Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC), issued a manifesto stating its goals of achieving independence by 1959, requiring a minimum of primary school education for all children, protecting the rights of the Malay rulers as constitutional monarchs, ending the Communist emergency, and reforming the civil service through the hiring of more Malayans as opposed to foreigners.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, pp. 137\u2013140.</ref><ref>[http://www.mic.org.my/history.php \"About MIC: History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220052725/http://www.mic.org.my/history.php |date=20 February 2006 }}. Retrieved 28 January 2006.</ref>\n\nWhen the results were released, it emerged that the Alliance had won 51 of the 52 seats contested, with the other seat going to [[Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS)|PAS]] (the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party, a group of Islamists that split from UMNO). The Tunku became the first Chief Minister of Malaya.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, p. 140.</ref>\n\nThroughout this period, the [[Malayan Emergency]] had been on-going. The [[Malayan Races Liberation Army]] (MRLA), supported by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (MCP), committed acts such as tearing down farms, disrupting transportation and communication networks, attacking police stations, and so forth. Their stated goal was the end of colonialism in Malaya. The British declared the MCP, along with several left-wing political groups, illegal in 1948. In 1955, the Alliance government together with the British High Commissioner declared an amnesty for the communist insurgents who surrendered. Representatives from the Alliance government also met with leaders of the MCP in an attempt to resolve the conflict peacefully, as their manifesto in the election stated. [[Chin Peng]], the MCP Secretary-General, insisted that the MCP be allowed to contest elections and be declared a legal political party as a pre-condition to laying down arms. However, the Tunku rejected this, leading to an impasse.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, p. 103\u2013107.</ref>\n\nIn 1956, the Tunku led a group of negotiators, comprising Alliance politicians and representatives of the Malay rulers, to London. There, they brokered a deal with the British for independence. The date of independence was set as 31 August 1957 on the condition that an independent commission is set up to draft a constitution for the country. The Alliance government was also required to avoid seizing British and other foreign assets in Malaya. A defence treaty would also be signed.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, pp. 148, 151.</ref>\n\nThe [[Reid Commission]], led by [[Lord William Reid]], was formed to draft the constitution. Although enshrining concepts such as [[federalism]] and a constitutional monarchy, the proposed constitution also contained provisions protecting special rights for the Malays, such as [[Racial quota|quotas]] in admission to higher education and the civil service, and making [[Islam]] the official religion of the federation. It also made [[Malay language|Malay]] the official language of the nation, although the right to vernacular education in Chinese and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] would be protected. Although the Tunku and the Malay rulers had asked the Reid Commission to ensure that \"''in an independent Malaya all nationals should be accorded equal rights, privileges and opportunities and there must not be discrimination on grounds of race and creed'',\" the Malay privileges, which many in UMNO backed, were cited as necessary by the Reid Commission as a form of [[affirmative action]] that would eventually be phased out. These measures were included as Articles 3, 152 and [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|153]] of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Constitution]].<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, p. 153\u2013155.</ref><ref>Ooi, Jeff (2005).

However, for the Alliance, the election was marred by internal strife when MCA leader [[Lim Chong Eu]] demanded his party be allowed to contest 40 of the 104 seats available. When the Tunku rejected this, many of Lim's supporters resigned, and ran in the election as independents, which cost the Alliance some seats.<ref>Goh, Cheng Teik (1994). Malaysia: Beyond Communal Politics, p. 18. Pelanduk Publications. {{ISBN|967-978-475-4}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, the Tunku mooted the idea of forming a federation named \"Malaysia\", which would consist of the British colonies of [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]], [[Sarawak]], and also the British [[Protectorate]] of [[Brunei]]. The reasoning behind this was that this would allow the federal government to control and combat communist activities, especially in Singapore. It was also feared that if Singapore achieved independence, it would become a base for Chinese chauvinists to threaten Malayan sovereignty. To balance out the ethnic composition of the new nation, the other states, whose Malay and indigenous populations would balance out the Singaporean Chinese majority, were also included.<ref>Shuid, Mahdi & Yunus, Mohd. Fauzi (2001). ''Malaysian Studies'', p. 29. Longman. {{ISBN|983-74-2024-3}}.</ref>\n\nAfter much negotiation, a constitution was hammered out with some minor changes. For instance, the Malay privileges were now made available to all \"[[Bumiputra]]\", a group comprising the Malays and other indigenous peoples of Malaysia. However, the new states were also granted some autonomy unavailable to the original nine states of Malaya. After negotiations in July 1963, it was agreed that Malaysia would come into being on 31 August 1963, consisting of Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak. Brunei ultimately decided to opt-out of the federation due in part because of an [[Brunei revolt|armed revolt]] by the People's Party (''Parti Rakyat Brunei'') which objected to the formation of Malaysia,<ref>Shuid & Yunus, p. 31.</ref> and the Sultan of Brunei [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]]'s demand that he be recognised as the most senior Malay ruler\u2014a demand that was rejected.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mathews |first=Philip |title=Chronicle of Malaysia: Fifty Years of Headline News, 1963\u20132013 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=md9UAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9789671061749&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje7pysnorRAhUFWxoKHdQWAPsQ6AEIHDAA |year=February 2014 |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |isbn=978-967-10617-4-9 |pages=29}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]] strenuously objected to this development, with Indonesia claiming Malaysia represented a form of [[neocolonialism]] and the Philippines [[North Borneo dispute|claiming Sabah as its territory]]. The United Nations sent a commission to the region which approved the merger after having delayed the date of Malaysia's formation to investigate. Despite further protests from the Indonesian President, [[Sukarno]], the formation of Malaysia was proclaimed on 16 September 1963. Indonesia then declared a \"[[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]]\" with Malaysia, sending [[commando]]s to perform guerilla attacks in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak). The confrontation was ended when [[Suharto]] [[Transition to the New Order|replaced]] Sukarno as president. The Philippines, which had withdrawn diplomatic recognition from Malaysia, also recognised Malaysia around the same time.<ref>Adam, Samuri & Fadzil, pp. 214, 217, 220, 222, 223.</ref>\n\nTo reflect the change of name to Malaysia, UMNO's coalition partners promptly altered their names to the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] and the [[Malaysian Indian Congress]]. Several political parties in East Malaysia, especially Sarawak, also joined the Alliance to allow it to contest elections there.\n\nIn the [[1963 Singapore general election|1963 Singapore state elections]], the Alliance decided to challenge [[Lee Kuan Yew]]'s governing [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) through the [[Singapore Alliance Party]]. UMNO politicians actively campaigned in Singapore for the Singapore Alliance, contending that the Singapore Malays were being treated as second-class citizens under the Chinese-dominated PAP government. All of the UMNO-backed Malay candidates lost to PAP candidates. UMNO Secretary-General [[Syed Jaafar Albar]] travelled to Singapore to address the Malay populace. At one rally, he called the PAP Malay politicians un-Islamic and traitors to the Malay race, greatly straining [[PAP-UMNO relations]]. The PAP politicians, who saw this as a betrayal of an earlier agreement with the Alliance not to contest elections in Malaysia and Singapore respectively, decided on running on the mainland in the [[1964 Malaysian general election|1964 general election]]. Although the PAP contested nine Parliamentary seats and attracted large crowds at its rallies, it won only one seat. The strain in race relations caused by the communal lines along which the political factions had been drawn led to the [[1964 Race Riots]] in Singapore.\n\nAlliance leaders also were alarmed at Lee's behaviour, which they considered unseemly for the Chief Minister of a state. They thought he was acting as if he were the Prime Minister of a sovereign nation. Finance Minister [[Tan Siew Sin]] of the MCA labelled Lee as the \"greatest, disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya.\" Lee now seemed determined to press forward politically and continue contesting elections nationwide, with the formation of the [[Malaysian Solidarity Council]]\u2014a coalition of political parties which called for a \"[[Malaysian Malaysia]]\", duplicating the effort introduced earlier by Dato' Onn Ja'afar.\n\nOn 7 August 1965, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed, advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia. Despite last-ditch attempts by PAP leaders, including Lee Kuan Yew, to keep Singapore as a state in the union, the Parliament on 9 August 1965 voted 126\u20130 in favour of the expulsion of Singapore.\n\nTunku opened his speech in Parliament with the words, \"In all the 10 years of my leadership of this House I have never had a duty so unpleasant as this to perform. The announcement which I am making concerns the separation of Singapore from the rest of the Federation.\"<ref name=\"tunku_speech\">Rahman, Tunku Abdul (1965).

Retrieved 11 November 2005.</ref> On that day, a tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation and assumed the role of prime minister of the new nation. His speech included this quote: \"For me, it would be a moment of anguish. I mean for me, it is a moment of anguish because all my life...you see the whole of my adult life...I have believed in merger and the unity of the two territories. You know it's a people connected by geography, economics, and ties of kinship...\" Hence, Singapore became the only country in the history of the modern world to gain independence against its own will. After the separation and independence of Singapore in 1965, the Singapore branch of UMNO was renamed the [[Singapore Malay National Organisation]] (''Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura'').\n\n=== Post-separation ===\nAfter the separation of Singapore from the Federation, the Alliance leaders focused on continuing its policies. One involved the Malay language, which was the official language of Malaysia. UMNO sought to reduce the reliance on English in government affairs. In this, it was aided by PAS, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, which backed special rights for the Bumiputra, and the strengthening of Islam's position in public affairs. However, the PAP's Malaysian branch, which had now become [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP), took a very strong stance against this, and continued the expelled PAP's call for a \"Malaysian Malaysia\". In 1968, the newly formed [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia]] or Gerakan, led by Lim Chong Eu, also adopted the DAP's stance.<ref>Means, Gordon P. (1991). ''Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation'', pp. 3, 5, 29. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-588988-6}}.</ref>\n\nMatters came to a head in the [[1969 Malaysian general election|1969 general election]]. When polling closed on the mainland peninsula (West Malaysia) on 10 May, it emerged the Alliance had won less than half of the popular vote, although it was assured of 66 out of 104 Parliamentary seats available. Much of the losses came from the MCA, thus straining relations between the two parties.{{clarify|date=March 2020}} However, the Alliance was dealt an even larger blow on the state level, losing control of [[Kelantan]], [[Perak]], and [[Penang]].<ref>Means, p. 6, 7.</ref>\n\nThe [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King) declared a national emergency after being advised by the national government to do so. Parliament was suspended, with a [[National Operations Council]] (NOC) led by Deputy Prime Minister [[Tun Abdul Razak]] of UMNO, taking over the government. Further polling in East Malaysia as a continuation of the general election was also postponed indefinitely. Although the Cabinet still met under the Tunku as Prime Minister, his role was largely symbolic, with Tun Razak taking over the role of chief executive.<ref>Means, p. 8.</ref>\n\nUMNO backbencher [[Mahathir Mohamad]], who had lost his Parliamentary seat in the election, wrote a letter to the Tunku, commending his leadership. Mahathir organised a campaign with [[University of Malaya]] lecturer [[Raja Muktaruddin Daim]], circulating his letter among the student body of local universities. Mass demonstrations broke out calling for \"Malay sovereignty\" and the Tunku's ouster. After rioting broke out in June, Home Affairs Minister [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]] and Tun Razak agreed to expel Mahathir and former Executive Secretary of UMNO [[Musa Hitam]] from the party for breaching party discipline.\n\nThe suspended elections in East Malaysia were held in 1970, and gave the Alliance government a solid two-thirds majority in Parliament again. On 31 August that year, the Tunku announced the national ideology\u2014[[Rukunegara]]\u2014and his planned retirement as Prime Minister in favour of Tun Razak. He also stated Parliament would be restored the following year.<ref>Means, pp. 11, 12.</ref>\n\n=== The New Economic Policy ===\nAfter Tun Razak succeeded the Tunku in 1970, he began asserting UMNO's leadership in the Alliance more strongly. When the Tunku led the coalition, he had always consulted Alliance leaders regarding policy\u2014if an Alliance leader objected, the policy was not passed. Under Tun Razak, UMNO was the base of the Alliance and thus the government. The NOC which he led until Parliament reconvened consisted of 7 Malays, one Chinese and one Indian.<ref>Means, pp. 20, 21.</ref>\n\nIn Tun Razak's cabinet, the two most powerful men other than him were Ismail Abdul Rahman and [[Ghazali Shafie]], who had declared the Westminster-style Parliamentary system inappropriate for Malaysia. Tun Razak also readmitted to the party \"ultras\" who had been expelled, like Mahathir and Musa Hitam. Mahathir gained notoriety after his expulsion from UMNO by authoring ''[[The Malay Dilemma]]'', a book promptly banned from Malaysia, which posited that the Malays are the definitive people of Malaysia, and thus deserved special rights as the sovereign people of the nation. It also controversially argued that the Malays needed affirmative action to overcome deficiencies in their genetic stock.<ref>Means, pp. 20\u201322.</ref>\n\nHussein Onn, son of UMNO founder Dato' Onn Ja'afar, soon became a rising star in UMNO. After Ismail died suddenly of a heart attack in 1973, Hussein Onn succeeded him as Deputy Prime Minister. In the [[Cabinet shuffle|cabinet reshuffle]] that promoted Hussein Onn, Mahathir was given the key post of Minister for Education.<ref>Means, pp. 22, 23.</ref>\n\nThe Tun Razak government announced the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in 1971. Its stated goal was to \"eventually eradicate poverty... irrespective of race\" through a \"rapidly expanding economy\" which emphasised to increase the Malays' share in the national economy to a reasonable portion between all the races. The NEP targeted a 30 per cent Malay share of the economy by 1990. The government contended that this would lead to a \"just society\" (\"''Masyarakat Adil''\"), the latter slogan being used to promote acceptance of the policy. Quotas in education and the civil service that the Constitution had explicitly provided for were expanded by the NEP, which also mandated government interference in the private sector. For instance, 30% of all shares in [[initial public offering]]s (IPOs) would be disbursed by the government to selective [[Bumiputra]]s. The old civil service hiring quota of 4 Malays for every non-Malay's was effectively disregarded in practice; between 1969 and 1973, 98% of all new government employees were Malay. Five new universities were opened under the NEP, two of which were targeted to focus on the poor Malays and Muslim citizens.<ref>Means, pp. 23\u201327.</ref>\n\nTun Razak also began shoring up the government by bringing in several former opposition parties into the fold of the Alliance. Gerakan, PPP, PAS, and several former opposition parties in East Malaysia joined the coalition, which was renamed as [[Barisan Nasional]]. Barisan was formally registered as an organisation in 1974, the same year in which a general election was held.<ref>Means, pp. 29, 30.</ref>\n\nThere had been much internal conflict in the National Front regarding the election; in 1973, [[Lim Keng Yaik]] and several supporters of his aggressive pro-Chinese stance left the MCA for Gerakan. This contributed to internal strife, as the MCA was no longer the sole representative of Chinese interests in the National Front.<ref>Means, p. 31.</ref>\n\nDiscontent among student organisations in Malaysian universities soon posed a new problem for the UMNO-led government. However, Mahathir in his capacity as Minister for Education issued a stern warning to university students and faculty not to become involved in politics. However, after stories that children of rubber tappers had died after consuming poisonous wild yam due to poverty, university students reacted by staging the 1974 Baling demonstrations. The demonstrations resulted in the arrest of over 1,000 students, including [[Anwar Ibrahim]] who wasdetained under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]]. In 1975, parliament passed amendments to the Universities and University Colleges Act (UUCA) which banned students from expressing support of or holding positions in any political party or trade union without written consent from the university's Vice-Chancellor.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://coconuts.co/kl/news/story-behind-some-malaysias-biggest-street-rallies/|title=The story behind some of Malaysia\u2019s biggest street rallies|access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref> The act also banned political demonstrations from being held on university campuses. In 1976, however, mass demonstrations were held at the MARA Institute of Technology, protesting the UUCA. Mahathir then threatened to revoke the scholarships of the students, most of whom relied on public support to pay their way through university.<ref>Means, pp. 36, 37.</ref>\n\nBN was also challenged in Sarawak after the 1974 election, which saw the [[Sarawak National Party]] (SNAP) led by [[James Wong (politician)|James Wong]] become tied with the DAP as the largest opposition party in Parliament, both of them holding nine seats each. SNAP had campaigned against BN on a platform of opposing Chief Minister [[Abdul Rahman Ya'kub]]'s pro-Malay policies, charging them with alienating the rural indigenous natives of Sarawak, such as the [[Iban people|Iban]]. SNAP had been expelled from the Alliance in 1965 for supporting increased autonomy for Sarawak. In the aftermath of the election, Abdul Rahman ordered the detention of James Wong under the Sedition Act. SNAP elected a new leader, [[Leo Moggie]], who secured the release of Wong and the entry of SNAP into BN in 1976.<ref>Means, pp. 39, 40.</ref>\n\nIn Sabah, BN controlled the state government through the [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO), which strongly backed UMNO's pro-Malay and pro-Islam policies. In 1973, Islam was made the official Sabah state religion (the official religion of Sabah was originally Christianity, as permitted by the agreement signed before the merger), and usage of indigenous languages such as those of the [[Kadazan]] people was discontinued in favour of the Malay language. The USNO Chief Minister, [[Mustapha Harun]], was also known for favouring [[political patronage]] as a means of allocating valuable timber contracts, and living an extravagant lifestyle, being ferried to his A$1 million [[Queensland]] home by jets provided with Sabahan public funds.<ref>Means, pp. 41, 42.</ref>\n\n=== UMNO Baru (New UMNO) ===\n[[File:Mahathir Mohamad addressing the United Nations General Assembly (September 25 2003).jpg|thumb|Mahathir Mohamad]]\n{{Further|1987 United Malays National Organisation leadership election|1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis}}\n\nOn 24 April 1987, UMNO held its Annual General Assembly and triennial Party election. The then Prime Minister and party President, [[Mahathir Mohamad]], faced his first party election in 12 years, having been elected unopposed since the 1975 UMNO election.\n\nThe politics of the Malays, particularly UMNO politics, had undergone a sea change in the first few years of the Mahathir stewardship, and the party presidency was challenged for the second time in 41 years. The first challenge was a dull affair in which Hussein Onn was opposed by a minor party official named Sulaiman Palestin. In fact, in the early 1950s, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]]'s presidency had also been challenged by [[Chik Mohamad Yusuf|C. M. Yusof]], who later became the [[Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat]], but [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Tunku]] was not properly considered an incumbent then, being only a care-taker president.\n\nThe 1987 contest was a vastly different matter. Mahathir was opposed by his very popular former Finance Minister, [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]]. The press took to referring to Mahathir and his supporters as Team A, and Razaleigh's camp as Team B. Team B included then Deputy Prime Minister Tun [[Musa Hitam]], who was also the incumbent Deputy President of UMNO seeking re-election, as well as Datuk [[Suhaimi Kamaruddin]], the former head of UMNO Youth and president of the Belia 4B youth organisation.<ref>Means, p. 201.</ref>\n\nTeam B was critical of Mahathir's policies, arguing that the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] (NEP) had failed to benefit the poor Malays. It also criticised Mahathir's leadership style, alleging he acted unilaterally without consulting other leaders in UMNO and the Barisan Nasional. Team B was also perceived as less Islamist than Mahathir's faction.<ref name=\"means_202\">Means, p. 202.</ref>\n\nMahathir claimed that the charges against him were groundless, and suggested that his opponents were fracturing Malay unity and were only motivated by greed.<ref name=\"means_202\"/>\n\nEventually, Mahathir was returned to office. However, he was elected with such a small majority of 43 (761 against 718 votes) that questions were immediately raised about his mandate. Team B supporters, many of whom had been anticipating a victory of similar margins, suspected that the election had been fixed. The Team B candidate for Deputy President, Musa Hitam, had also been defeated by [[Ghafar Baba]] of Team A, while two of the three Vice-Presidents were Team A candidates. The Supreme Council comprised 16 Team A candidates and 9 Team B candidates.<ref>Means, p. 204.</ref>\n\nAllegations were made that several delegates who had voted were drawn from UMNO branches not properly registered. There were also several unproved allegations being bandied about that the balloting process had not been above board.<ref name=\"means_206\">Means, p. 206.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Razaleigh pledged to support Mahathir, provided that a \"witch hunt\" was not launched. However, Mahathir promptly purged the government cabinet of all Team B members, and launched similar reshuffles in state and local governments.<ref>Means, p. 205.</ref>\n\nOn 25 June 1987, an appeal was filed by 12 of the UMNO delegates to have the assembly and the election of April 1987 declared null. After one of the delegates, Hussain bin Manap, withdrew unexpectedly in August from filing the appeal, the remaining litigants have since become famous as the \"UMNO 11.\" Although Razaleigh and Musa Hitam were not among the plaintiffs, it was widely believed that Razaleigh was funding the appeal.<ref name=\"means_206\"/>\n\nAfter a series of interlocutory hearings over the discovery of documents that took more than seven months, the matter finally came before Justice Harun Hashim in the Kuala Lumpur High Court on 4 February 1988. The judge ruled that under the existing law he had no option but to find the party, UMNO, to be an unlawful society due to the existence of several unregistered branches\u2014an illegal act under the Societies Act of 1966. The question of the Assembly itself being illegal therefore became academic.<ref name=\"means_218\">Means, pp. 218, 219.</ref>\n\n\"'It is a very hard decision to declare UMNO unlawful,' said Justice Datuk Harun Hashim in his February 4 judgement. 'But the law was made by our Parliament and certainly UMNO was aware [of the Societies Act] because they were in the majority [in Parliament] at all times [when the law was made].' Under the 1966 Act, amended five times over the years, and most recently by Mahathir's government, each of the society's branches has to register separately with the Registrar....\"<ref name=\"means_218\"/>\n\nThe Tunku and former UMNO President [[Hussein Onn]] set up a new party called [[Semangat 46|UMNO Malaysia]], which claimed to be the successor to the old UMNO. UMNO Malaysia was supported mainly by members of the Team B faction from UMNO, but Mahathir was also invited to join the party leadership. However, the party collapsed after the Registrar of Societies refused to register it as a society without providing an explanation.<ref>Means, pp. 224, 225.</ref>\n\nMahathir showed no interest in reviving UMNO, and instead he set in motion the machinery to form a new surrogate party, and in due course, registered a party formally called Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Bersatu (Baru) or UMNO (New) a week after UMNO Malaysia's registration was rejected. Eventually the suffix \"(New)\" was dropped, and UMNO (Baru) became both the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' successor of UMNO (with the old UMNO's assets handed over).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Rencana/20121201/re_09/Terus-fokus-menyatukan-Melayu|title=Terus fokus menyatukan Melayu|publisher=Utusan Online|date=1 December 2012}}</ref> Most of its leaders, however, were selected from Team A of the old UMNO, with Team B ignored.<ref>Means, pp. 224, 225, 230......\n</ref>\n\nIn [[1999 Malaysian general election|10th general election]] in 1999, rocked by the arrest and trial of former UMNO deputy [[Anwar Ibrahim]] and the subsequent formation of the [[Barisan Alternatif]] opposition coalition, UMNO's share dipped to 54% of the vote and 102 out of 144 seats.\n\n=== Post-Mahathir ===\n[[File:Abdullah Badawi in April 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An official photo of former prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.|[[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] served as the 5th Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2003-2009.]]\n[[File:Najib Razak 2008-08-21.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An official photo of former prime minister Najib Tun Razak.|[[Najib Tun Razak]] served as the 6th Prime Minister of Malaysia from 2009-2018.]]\nAfter Mahathir stepped down as President of UMNO in 2003, he was replaced by his designated successor, [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], who by virtue of his new position also became [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]]. [[Najib Razak]], the son of [[Tun Abdul Razak]], took over as the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia]].\n\nIn the [[Malaysian General Election, 2004|11th general election]] in 2004, Barisan Nasional, under Abdullah's leadership, enjoyed a landslide victory. However, in the [[Malaysian General Election, 2008|12th general election]] in 2008, the coalition for the first time fell short of a two-thirds majority in the Parliament. UMNO Chief Ministers were ousted in the states of [[Selangor]], [[Perak]], [[Penang]] and [[Kedah]]. As a result, Abdullah resigned as President of UMNO and Prime Minister in 2009. He was succeeded by Najib.\n\nUnder Najib's leadership, UMNO gained a total of 9 seats in the [[2013 Malaysian general election|13th general election]] and retook the state of [[Kedah]].\n\nEventually, Najib's rule came to an end on 9 May 2018, when Mahathir, himself a former UMNO president, and the [[Pakatan Harapan]] coalition won the [[2018 Malaysian general election|14th General Election]] by gaining 45 seats, with UMNO losing 54, putting an end to 61 years of UMNO Rule which began since the country's independence in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44036178|title=Malaysia election: Opposition scores historic victory|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2018|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref> On 12 May, three days after the election, three UMNO Member of Parliament left and joined Mahathir's [[Malaysian United Indigenous Party|Bersatu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/12/three-johor-umno-reps-jump-to-pribumi/|title=Three Johor Umno reps jump to Pribumi|publisher=The Star|date = 12 May 2018|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> The subsequent day as many as 50 UMNO party members, including Kelantan Wanita UMNO information chief Zarina Md Eusope left and also joined Bersatu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/05/13/kelantan-wanita-umno-info-chief-50-others-jump-to-pribumi/|title=Kelantan Wanita Umno info chief, 50 others, jump to Pribumi|publisher=The Star|date=13 May 2018|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref> Sabah UMNO also saw an exodus of members, with Sabah Wanita UMNO chief alongside 200 other members leaving the party to join the [[Sabah Heritage Party|Parti Warisan Sabah]] in late May. 10 state legislative assemblymen, five Member of Parliaments and two Senators also left in December the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/12/12/sabah-umno-exodus-begins-with-nine-of-10-assemblymen-leaving-party/|title=Sabah Umno exodus sees nine of 10 Aduns, five of six MPs leave|publisher=The Star|date=12 December 2018|accessdate=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Ideology ==\n{{See also|Malay Islamic identity}}\nUMNO overtly represents the Malays of Malaysia, although any [[Bumiputra]] (indigenous Malaysian, a category which includes people such as the non-Malay and usually non-Muslim [[Kadazan]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Dayak people|Dayak]], etc. of East Malaysia) may join the party.

Controversies ==\n=== Challenge to UMNO's right to exist ===\nEvery year, UMNO is obliged to hold the General Assembly to extend their rule according to the Clauses set by the Registry of Societies (RoS) Malaysia. And once every five years, UMNO is obliged to appoint their highest bodies. The last time UMNO held the election of the highest division and council level was on 19 October 2013. So the new election was supposed to be held on 19 April 2018. Their application for the postponement of the election until 19 October 2019 has to be approved by RoS in accordance with Clause 10.16. But critics have claimed that this is illegal and supposedly the existence of an UMNO organisation is banned.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/420525|title=Umno - apa selepas hari ini, 19 Apr 2018?|author=Hanipa Maidin|language=Malay|publisher=Malaysiakini|date=19 April 2018|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/bahasa/s/40443/|title=RoS patut isytihar Umno haram 19 April, kata peguam Dr Mahathir|author=Bede Hong|language=Malay|publisher=The Malaysian Insight|date=1 March 2018|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1MDB ===\nMedia reports from June 2018 indicated that the [[Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission|MACC]] froze bank accounts associated with UMNO, purportedly in relation to investigations into the 1MDB controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2018/06/385592/macc-has-frozen-supps-account|title=MACC has frozen SUPP's account|website=www.nst.com.my|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Welsh, B (ed).
