The dancer [[Lise Noblet]] played the mute title role, a part later taken by other dancers such as [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Fanny Elssler]] and [[Pauline Leroux]], also the actress [[Harriet Smithson]] (the future wife of [[Hector Berlioz]]). Alphonse was created by [[Alexis Dupont]], who was Lise Noblet's brother-in-law.

First, it marked the introduction into opera of [[mime]] and gesture as an integral part of an opera plot (although these formats were familiar to Parisian audiences from [[ballet]] and [[melodrama|m\u00e9lodrame]]).{{sfn|Hibberd|2003|p=154}} Also, its historic setting, liberal political implications, use of popular melodies, handling of large orchestra and chorus and spectacular stage effects immediately marked it as different from preceding types of opera, in retrospect earning it the title of the first of the genre of [[grand opera]]. The journal ''Pandore'' commented after the premiere \"for a long time, enlightened critics have thought that alongside the old ''trag\u00e9die lyrique'' it was possible to have a more realistic and natural drama which might suit the dignity of this theatre.\"{{sfn|Hibberd|2003|p=150}} The new genre was consolidated by [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]]'' (1829) and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Robert le diable]]'' (1831).\n\n[[Richard Wagner]] remarked, in his 1871 ''Reminiscences of Auber'', that the opera \"whose very representation had brought [revolutions] about, was recognised as an obvious precursor of the [[July Revolution]], and seldom has an artistic product stood in closer connection with a world-event.\"{{sfn|Wagner|1966|p=53}} ''La muette'' was revived in Paris immediately after the French July Revolution of 1830.\n\n===Belgian revolution===\n[[File:Place de la Monnaie (Muntplein), Brussels, Belgium (ca. 1890-1900).jpg|thumb|The [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie]] (Muntschouwburg) where the performance of 25 August 1830 sparked riots leading to the [[Belgian Revolution]] ]]\nThe opera was chosen for a performance at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie]] in [[Brussels]] on 25 August 1830, as part of [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I's]] festival in celebration of the 15th year of his reign. The opera would cap the three-day festival of fireworks, feasts, and processions. William I had been present at the Brussels premiere of the opera in 1829, and it enjoyed several successful performances in the city. Although, when nationalist disturbances occurred during a performance around the time of the July Revolution in Paris, the opera was temporarily banned. The ban was lifted for the 25 August performance.{{sfn|Slatin|1979|p=47}}\n\nThe King's festival announcement were met with open plans for revolt. Posters were put up around Brussels that advertised, \"Monday, the 23rd, fireworks; Tuesday, the 24th, illuminations; Wednesday, the 25th, revolution.\"{{sfn|Mallinson|1970|p=54}} However, the King's only concession to public safety was to cancel the fireworks and procession on the final night, which left Auber's opera as the last public event in the king's honor. Though the subject of the opera is revolution, its role in the riots may have been more a marriage of convenience because the rebels had pre-ordained the final day of the festival as the start of the [[Belgian Revolution]].{{sfn|Slatin|1979|p=60}}\n\nPrior to the performance of Auber's opera, the ''{{ill|Courrier des Pays-Bas|fr}}'' newspaper issued a coded call for attendees to leave prior to the fifth act.{{sfn|Slatin|1979|p=50}} There are some disagreements about when in the opera the exodus actually began, but the most commonly cited moment is the second act duet \"Amour sacr\u00e9 de la patrie\".{{sfn|Slatin|1979|pp=53-54}} One contemporary account describes what happened in the theater during the duet:\n\n<blockquote>When Lafeuillade and Cassel began singing the celebrated duet. \"Amour sacre de la patrie\" enthusiasm exploded irresistibly and [the singers] found it necessary to start afresh in the midst of the cheering. Finally, when Masaniello (Lafeuillade) launched into his entreaty, the invocation ''Aux armes!'', the public could no longer be restrained. They acclaimed aria and actor, they booed the fifth act in order to stop the performance, and the delirious crowd [hurled itself] out of the hall\u2014into history. Welcomed by the other crowd which waited outside, it joined in the demonstrations which loosed the revolution of 1830.<ref>Reniue, 744.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Roles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role<ref>Scribe 1875, [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112079782923?urlappend=%3Bseq=38 p. 26].</ref>\n![[Voice type]]{{sfn|Schneider|1992}}\n!Premiere cast,<ref>Auber 1828 ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52500064m/f7.image.r=.langEN \"Personnages\"]).</ref> 29&nbsp;February&nbsp;1828<br>(Conductor: [[Henri&nbsp;Valentino]])<ref name=Conductor />\n|-\n| Masaniello, ''a [[Naples|Neapolitan]] fisherman''\n| [[tenor]]\n| [[Adolphe Nourrit]]\n|-\n| Alphonse, ''son of the [[Rodrigo Ponce de Le\u00f3n, 4th Duke of Arcos|Count of Arcos, Viceroy of Naples]]''\n| tenor\n |[[Alexis Dupont]]\n|-\n| Elvire, ''fianc\u00e9e of Alphonse''\n| [[soprano]]\n| [[Laure Cinti-Damoreau]]\n|-\n| Fenella, ''sister of Masaniello''\n| dancer\n| [[Lise Noblet]]\n|-\n| Pietro, ''friend of Masaniello''\n| [[bass (vocal range)|bass]]\n| [[Henri-Bernard Dabadie]]\n|-\n| Borella, ''friend of Masaniello''\n| bass\n| [[Alexandre Pr\u00e9vost]]<ref>{{harvnb|Kutsch|Riemens|2002|p=3763}}; {{harvnb|Tamvaco|2000|p=87}}.

The character of Fenella, the opera's eponymous heroine, was borrowed from Walter Scott's ''[[Peveril of the Peak]]'', which features a deaf and dumb dwarf of the same name.<ref>Daniel-Fran\u00e7ois-Esprit Auber: ''La Muette de Portici'', Edited and Introduced by Robert Ignatius Letellier, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle-upon-Tyne (2011).</ref>\n\n===Act 1===\n''The square before a chapel''\n\nWe witness the wedding of Alfonso, son of the [[Viceroy of Naples]], with the Spanish Princess Elvira. Alfonso, who has seduced Fenella, the Neapolitan Masaniello's mute sister and abandoned her, is tormented by doubts and remorse, fearing that she has committed suicide. During the festival Fenella rushes in to seek protection from the Viceroy, who has kept her a prisoner for the past month. She has escaped from her prison and narrates the story of her seduction by gestures, showing a scarf which her lover gave her. Elvira promises to protect her and proceeds to the altar, Fenella vainly trying to follow. In the chapel Fenella recognizes her seducer in the bridegroom of the Princess. When the newly married couple come out of the church, Elvira presents Fenella to her husband and discovers from the mute girl's gestures, that he was her faithless lover. Fenella flees, leaving Alfonso and Elvira in sorrow and despair.\n\n===Act 2===\n''On the beach''\n[[File:Anna Pavlova in The Dumb Girl of Portici.jpg|thumb|[[Anna Pavlova]] in ''La muette de Portici'']]\n\nThe fishermen, who have been brooding in silence over the tyranny of their foes, begin to assemble. Pietro, Masaniello's friend, has sought for Fenella in vain, but at length she appears of her own accord and confesses her wrongs. Masaniello is infuriated and swears to have revenge, but Fenella, who still loves Alfonso, does not mention his name. Then Masaniello calls the fishermen to arms and they swear perdition to the enemy of their country.\n\n===Act 3===\n''The Naples marketplace''\n\nPeople go to and fro, selling and buying, all the while concealing their purpose under a show of merriment and carelessness. Selva, the officer of the Viceroy's body-guard, from whom Fenella has escaped, discovers her and the attempt to rearrest her is the sign for a general revolt, in which the people are victorious.\n\n===Act 4===\n''Masaniello's house''\n\nFenella comes to her brother's dwelling and describes the horrors, which are taking place in the town. The relation fills his noble soul with sorrow and disgust. When Fenella has retired to rest, Pietro enters with comrades and tries to excite Masaniello to further deeds, but he only wants liberty and shrinks from murder and cruelties.\n\nThey tell him that Alfonso has escaped and that they are resolved to overtake and kill him. Fenella, who hears all, decides to save her lover. At this moment Alfonso begs at her door for a hiding-place. He enters with Elvira, and Fenella, though at first disposed to avenge herself on her rival, pardons her for Alfonso's sake. Masaniello, reentering, assures the strangers of his protection and even when Pietro denounces Alfonso as the Viceroy's son, he holds his promise sacred. Pietro with his fellow-conspirators leaves him full of rage and hatred.\n\nMeanwhile, the magistrate of the city presents Masaniello with the Royal crown and he is proclaimed King of Naples.\n\n===Act 5===\n''Before the Viceroy's palace''\n[[File:La Muette de Portici \u00e9ruption volcanique.jpg|thumb|''La muette de Portici'', the eruption of the volcano, 1893 production ]]\n\nIn a gathering of fishermen, Pietro confides to Moreno that he has administered poison to Masaniello, in order to punish him for his treason, and that the King of one day will soon die. While he speaks, Borella rushes in to tell of a fresh troop of soldiers, marching against the people with Alfonso at their head. Knowing that Masaniello alone can save them, the fishermen entreat him to take the command of them once more and Masaniello, though deadly ill and half bereft of his reason, complies with their request. The combat takes place, while an eruption of [[Vesuvius]] is going on. Masaniello falls in the act of saving Elvira's life. On hearing these terrible tidings Fanella rushes to the terrace, from which she leaps into the abyss beneath, while the fugitive noblemen take again possession of the city.<ref>Charles Annesley (1902) ''The Standard Operaglass'', Low, Marston & Co., Ltd., London</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n''La muette de Portici'' played a major role in establishing the genre of [[grand opera]]. Many of its elements \u2013 the five-act structure, the obligatory ballet sequence, the use of spectacular stage effects, the focus on romantic passions against a background of historical troubles \u2013 would become the standard features of the form for the rest of the 19th century. Grand opera would play a far more important role in the subsequent career of the librettist than that of the composer. Auber went on to write three more works in the genre: ''Le Dieu et la bayad\u00e8re'' (1830), ''[[Gustave III (Auber)|Gustave III]]'' (1833) and ''[[Le lac des f\u00e9es]]'' (1839). But their fame would be eclipsed by the grand operas for which Scribe provided the libretti: [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Robert le diable]]'' (1831) and ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (1836) and [[Fromental Hal\u00e9vy|Hal\u00e9vy]]'s ''[[La Juive]]'' (1835). Nevertheless, Auber's pioneering work caught the attention of the young [[Richard Wagner]], who was eager to create a new form of music drama. He noted that in ''La muette'', \"arias and duets in the wonted sense were scarcely to be detected any more, and certainly, with the exception of a single prima-donna aria in the first act, did not strike one at all as such; in each instance it was the ensemble of the whole act that riveted attention and carried one away...\".<ref>Parker, pp. 143\u2013145</ref>\n\nIt also [[#Belgian revolution|played a large role]] in the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium. [[Belgian Revolution|The riots]] that led to the independence started after hearing the opera.\n\nThis opera is the inspiration for [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s poem \"Fenella's Escape\" published in ''[[The Keepsake]], 1836.\n\nThe material has been used for several films: the American silent film ''[[The Dumb Girl of Portici]]'' (1916), the German silent film ''[[The Mute of Portici (1922 film)|Die Stumme von Portici]]'', the Italian film ''[[The Mute of Portici|La muta di Portici]]'' (1952).\n\n==Recordings and performances==\n*{{anchor|Fulton}}''La muette de Portici'': [[June Anderson]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[John Aler]], Ensemble Choral Jean Laforge, [[Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte-Carlo]], conducted by [[Thomas Fulton]], recorded in September 1996 at the [[Salle Garnier]] in Monte Carlo (EMI). {{OCLC|605508655}}. 2 Hours 29 Mins.\n* ''La muette de Portici'' Oscar de la Torre (tenor) \u2013 Alphonse,  Angelina Ruzzafante (soprano) \u2013 Elvire,  Angus Wood (tenor) \u2013 Lorenzo, Ulf Paulsen (baritone) \u2013 Selva, Anne Weinkauf (mezzo) \u2013 Eine Holdame, Diego Torre (tenor) \u2013 Masaniello, Wiard Witholt (bass) \u2013 Pietro, Kostadin Arguirov (baritone) \u2013 Borella,  Stephan Biener (bass) \u2013 Moreno; Opernchor des Anhaltischen Theaters, {{ill|Anhaltische Philharmonie|de}}/Anthony Hermus; recorded 24\u201326 May 2011, Gro\u00dfes Haus des {{ill|Anhaltisches Theater|de|lt=Anhaltischen Theaters}}, Dessau, Germany [[Classic Produktion Osnabr\u00fcck|CPO]] 777 694-2 [65:47 + 69:32]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n* Auber, Daniel (1828).

First, it marked the introduction into opera of [[mime]] and gesture as an integral part of an opera plot (although these formats were familiar to Parisian audiences from [[ballet]] and [[melodrama|m\u00e9lodrame]]).{{sfn|Hibberd|2003|p=154}} Also, its historic setting, liberal political implications, use of popular melodies, handling of large orchestra and chorus and spectacular stage effects immediately marked it as different from preceding types of opera, in retrospect earning it the title of the first of the genre of [[grand opera]]. The journal ''Pandore'' commented after the premiere \"for a long time, enlightened critics have thought that alongside the old ''trag\u00e9die lyrique'' it was possible to have a more realistic and natural drama which might suit the dignity of this theatre.\"{{sfn|Hibberd|2003|p=150}} The new genre was consolidated by [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]]'' (1829) and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Robert le diable]]'' (1831).\n\n[[Richard Wagner]] remarked, in his 1871 ''Reminiscences of Auber'', that the opera \"whose very representation had brought [revolutions] about, was recognised as an obvious precursor of the [[July Revolution]], and seldom has an artistic product stood in closer connection with a world-event.\"{{sfn|Wagner|1966|p=53}} ''La muette'' was revived in Paris immediately after the French July Revolution of 1830.\n\n===Belgian revolution===\n[[File:Place de la Monnaie (Muntplein), Brussels, Belgium (ca. 1890-1900).jpg|thumb|The [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie]] (Muntschouwburg) where the performance of 25 August 1830 sparked riots leading to the [[Belgian Revolution]] ]]\nThe opera was chosen for a performance at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie]] in [[Brussels]] on 25 August 1830, as part of [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I's]] festival in celebration of the 15th year of his reign. The opera would cap the three-day festival of fireworks, feasts, and processions. William I had been present at the Brussels premiere of the opera in 1829, and it enjoyed several successful performances in the city. Although, when nationalist disturbances occurred during a performance around the time of the July Revolution in Paris, the opera was temporarily banned. The ban was lifted for the 25 August performance.{{sfn|Slatin|1979|p=47}}\n\nThe King's festival announcement were met with open plans for revolt. Posters were put up around Brussels that advertised, \"Monday, the 23rd, fireworks; Tuesday, the 24th, illuminations; Wednesday, the 25th, revolution.\"{{sfn|Mallinson|1970|p=54}} However, the King's only concession to public safety was to cancel the fireworks and procession on the final night, which left Auber's opera as the last public event in the king's honor. Though the subject of the opera is revolution, its role in the riots may have been more a marriage of convenience because the rebels had pre-ordained the final day of the festival as the start of the [[Belgian Revolution]].{{sfn|Slatin|1979|p=60}}\n\nPrior to the performance of Auber's opera, the ''{{ill|Courrier des Pays-Bas|fr}}'' newspaper issued a coded call for attendees to leave prior to the fifth act.{{sfn|Slatin|1979|p=50}} There are some disagreements about when in the opera the exodus actually began, but the most commonly cited moment is the second act duet \"Amour sacr\u00e9 de la patrie\".{{sfn|Slatin|1979|pp=53-54}} One contemporary account describes what happened in the theater during the duet:\n\n<blockquote>When Lafeuillade and Cassel began singing the celebrated duet. \"Amour sacre de la patrie\" enthusiasm exploded irresistibly and [the singers] found it necessary to start afresh in the midst of the cheering. Finally, when Masaniello (Lafeuillade) launched into his entreaty, the invocation ''Aux armes!'', the public could no longer be restrained. They acclaimed aria and actor, they booed the fifth act in order to stop the performance, and the delirious crowd [hurled itself] out of the hall\u2014into history. Welcomed by the other crowd which waited outside, it joined in the demonstrations which loosed the revolution of 1830.<ref>Reniue, 744.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Roles==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role<ref>Scribe 1875, [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uiug.30112079782923?urlappend=%3Bseq=38 p. 26].</ref>\n![[Voice type]]{{sfn|Schneider|1992}}\n!Premiere cast,<ref>Auber 1828 ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52500064m/f7.image.r=.langEN \"Personnages\"]).</ref> 29&nbsp;February&nbsp;1828<br>(Conductor: [[Henri&nbsp;Valentino]])<ref name=Conductor />\n|-\n| Masaniello, ''a [[Naples|Neapolitan]] fisherman''\n| [[tenor]]\n| [[Adolphe Nourrit]]\n|-\n| Alphonse, ''son of the [[Rodrigo Ponce de Le\u00f3n, 4th Duke of Arcos|Count of Arcos, Viceroy of Naples]]''\n| tenor\n |[[Alexis Dupont]]\n|-\n| Elvire, ''fianc\u00e9e of Alphonse''\n| [[soprano]]\n| [[Laure Cinti-Damoreau]]\n|-\n| Fenella, ''sister of Masaniello''\n| dancer\n| [[Lise Noblet]]\n|-\n| Pietro, ''friend of Masaniello''\n| [[bass (vocal range)|bass]]\n| [[Henri-Bernard Dabadie]]\n|-\n| Borella, ''friend of Masaniello''\n| bass\n| [[Alexandre Pr\u00e9vost]]<ref>{{harvnb|Kutsch|Riemens|2002|p=3763}}; {{harvnb|Tamvaco|2000|p=87}}.

The character of Fenella, the opera's eponymous heroine, was borrowed from Walter Scott's ''[[Peveril of the Peak]]'', which features a deaf and dumb dwarf of the same name.<ref>Daniel-Fran\u00e7ois-Esprit Auber: ''La Muette de Portici'', Edited and Introduced by Robert Ignatius Letellier, Cambridge Scholars Publishing, Newcastle-upon-Tyne (2011).</ref>\n\n===Act 1===\n''The square before a chapel''\n\nWe witness the wedding of Alfonso, son of the [[Viceroy of Naples]], with the Spanish Princess Elvira. Alfonso, who has seduced Fenella, the Neapolitan Masaniello's mute sister and abandoned her, is tormented by doubts and remorse, fearing that she has committed suicide. During the festival Fenella rushes in to seek protection from the Viceroy, who has kept her a prisoner for the past month. She has escaped from her prison and narrates the story of her seduction by gestures, showing a scarf which her lover gave her. Elvira promises to protect her and proceeds to the altar, Fenella vainly trying to follow. In the chapel Fenella recognizes her seducer in the bridegroom of the Princess. When the newly married couple come out of the church, Elvira presents Fenella to her husband and discovers from the mute girl's gestures, that he was her faithless lover. Fenella flees, leaving Alfonso and Elvira in sorrow and despair.\n\n===Act 2===\n''On the beach''\n[[File:Anna Pavlova in The Dumb Girl of Portici.jpg|thumb|[[Anna Pavlova]] in ''La muette de Portici'']]\n\nThe fishermen, who have been brooding in silence over the tyranny of their foes, begin to assemble. Pietro, Masaniello's friend, has sought for Fenella in vain, but at length she appears of her own accord and confesses her wrongs. Masaniello is infuriated and swears to have revenge, but Fenella, who still loves Alfonso, does not mention his name. Then Masaniello calls the fishermen to arms and they swear perdition to the enemy of their country.\n\n===Act 3===\n''The Naples marketplace''\n\nPeople go to and fro, selling and buying, all the while concealing their purpose under a show of merriment and carelessness. Selva, the officer of the Viceroy's body-guard, from whom Fenella has escaped, discovers her and the attempt to rearrest her is the sign for a general revolt, in which the people are victorious.\n\n===Act 4===\n''Masaniello's house''\n\nFenella comes to her brother's dwelling and describes the horrors, which are taking place in the town. The relation fills his noble soul with sorrow and disgust. When Fenella has retired to rest, Pietro enters with comrades and tries to excite Masaniello to further deeds, but he only wants liberty and shrinks from murder and cruelties.\n\nThey tell him that Alfonso has escaped and that they are resolved to overtake and kill him. Fenella, who hears all, decides to save her lover. At this moment Alfonso begs at her door for a hiding-place. He enters with Elvira, and Fenella, though at first disposed to avenge herself on her rival, pardons her for Alfonso's sake. Masaniello, reentering, assures the strangers of his protection and even when Pietro denounces Alfonso as the Viceroy's son, he holds his promise sacred. Pietro with his fellow-conspirators leaves him full of rage and hatred.\n\nMeanwhile, the magistrate of the city presents Masaniello with the Royal crown and he is proclaimed King of Naples.\n\n===Act 5===\n''Before the Viceroy's palace''\n[[File:La Muette de Portici \u00e9ruption volcanique.jpg|thumb|''La muette de Portici'', the eruption of the volcano, 1893 production ]]\n\nIn a gathering of fishermen, Pietro confides to Moreno that he has administered poison to Masaniello, in order to punish him for his treason, and that the King of one day will soon die. While he speaks, Borella rushes in to tell of a fresh troop of soldiers, marching against the people with Alfonso at their head. Knowing that Masaniello alone can save them, the fishermen entreat him to take the command of them once more and Masaniello, though deadly ill and half bereft of his reason, complies with their request. The combat takes place, while an eruption of [[Vesuvius]] is going on. Masaniello falls in the act of saving Elvira's life. On hearing these terrible tidings Fanella rushes to the terrace, from which she leaps into the abyss beneath, while the fugitive noblemen take again possession of the city.<ref>Charles Annesley (1902) ''The Standard Operaglass'', Low, Marston & Co., Ltd., London</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n''La muette de Portici'' played a major role in establishing the genre of [[grand opera]]. Many of its elements \u2013 the five-act structure, the obligatory ballet sequence, the use of spectacular stage effects, the focus on romantic passions against a background of historical troubles \u2013 would become the standard features of the form for the rest of the 19th century. Grand opera would play a far more important role in the subsequent career of the librettist than that of the composer. Auber went on to write three more works in the genre: ''Le Dieu et la bayad\u00e8re'' (1830), ''[[Gustave III (Auber)|Gustave III]]'' (1833) and ''[[Le lac des f\u00e9es]]'' (1839). But their fame would be eclipsed by the grand operas for which Scribe provided the libretti: [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Robert le diable]]'' (1831) and ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (1836) and [[Fromental Hal\u00e9vy|Hal\u00e9vy]]'s ''[[La Juive]]'' (1835). Nevertheless, Auber's pioneering work caught the attention of the young [[Richard Wagner]], who was eager to create a new form of music drama. He noted that in ''La muette'', \"arias and duets in the wonted sense were scarcely to be detected any more, and certainly, with the exception of a single prima-donna aria in the first act, did not strike one at all as such; in each instance it was the ensemble of the whole act that riveted attention and carried one away...\".<ref>Parker, pp. 143\u2013145</ref>\n\nIt also [[#Belgian revolution|played a large role]] in the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium. [[Belgian Revolution|The riots]] that led to the independence started after hearing the opera.\n\nThis opera is the inspiration for [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s poem \"Fenella's Escape\" published in ''[[The Keepsake]], 1836.\n\nThe material has been used for several films: the American silent film ''[[The Dumb Girl of Portici]]'' (1916), the German silent film ''[[The Mute of Portici (1922 film)|Die Stumme von Portici]]'', the Italian film ''[[The Mute of Portici|La muta di Portici]]'' (1952).\n\n==Recordings and performances==\n*{{anchor|Fulton}}''La muette de Portici'': [[June Anderson]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[John Aler]], Ensemble Choral Jean Laforge, [[Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte-Carlo]], conducted by [[Thomas Fulton]], recorded in September 1996 at the [[Salle Garnier]] in Monte Carlo (EMI). {{OCLC|605508655}}. 2 Hours 29 Mins.\n* ''La muette de Portici'' Oscar de la Torre (tenor) \u2013 Alphonse,  Angelina Ruzzafante (soprano) \u2013 Elvire,  Angus Wood (tenor) \u2013 Lorenzo, Ulf Paulsen (baritone) \u2013 Selva, Anne Weinkauf (mezzo) \u2013 Eine Holdame, Diego Torre (tenor) \u2013 Masaniello, Wiard Witholt (bass) \u2013 Pietro, Kostadin Arguirov (baritone) \u2013 Borella,  Stephan Biener (bass) \u2013 Moreno; Opernchor des Anhaltischen Theaters, {{ill|Anhaltische Philharmonie|de}}/Anthony Hermus; recorded 24\u201326 May 2011, Gro\u00dfes Haus des {{ill|Anhaltisches Theater|de|lt=Anhaltischen Theaters}}, Dessau, Germany [[Classic Produktion Osnabr\u00fcck|CPO]] 777 694-2 [65:47 + 69:32]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n* Auber, Daniel (1828).

Early fundus photos were limited by insufficient light, long exposures, eye movement, and prominent corneal reflexes that reduced the clarity detail. It would be several decades before these problems could be rectified.<ref name=blog-milestone />\n\nThere has been some controversy regarding the first ever successful human fundus photo. Most accounts credit William Thomas Jackman and J.D. Webster, since they published their technique, along with a reproduction of a fundus image, in two photography periodicals in 1886.<ref>{{harvp | Bennett |2013 | loc = The First Human Fundus Photograph  }}</ref>\n\nThree other names played a prominent role in early fundus photography. According to some historical accounts, Elmer Starr and [[Lucien Howe]] may have been first to photograph the human retina. Lucien Howe, a well-known name in [[Ophthalmology]], and his assistant, Elmer Starr, collaborated on the fundus photography project in 1886\u201388. Howe described their results as the first \"recognizable\u201d fundus photograph, apparently a nod to Jackman & Webster being the first to \"publish\u201d a fundus photograph.

Hundreds of specialists worked to overcome the problem, which was finally achieved in the early 20th century by Friedrich Dimmer, who published his photographs in 1921. Dimmer's fundus camera, developed about 1904, was a complicated and sophisticated research tool and it was not until 1926 that Stockholm's Johan Nordenson and the Zeiss Camera Company were able to market a commercial device for use by practitioners, which was the first modern Fundus camera.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Museum of Vision: Exhibitions|url = http://www.museumofvision.org/exhibitions/?key=44&subkey=94&relkey=576|website = www.museumofvision.org|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}</ref>{{Dead link | date = March 2019 | fix-attempted=yes}}\n\nSince then, the features of fundus cameras have improved drastically to include non-[[mydriatic]] imaging, electronic illumination control, automated eye alignment, and high-resolution digital image capture.

As the light paths of the two systems are independent, there are minimal reflections of the light source captured in the formed image. The image forming rays continue towards the low powered telescopic eyepiece. When the button is pressed to take a picture, a mirror interrupts the path of the illumination system allow the light from the flash bulb to pass into the eye. Simultaneously, a mirror falls in front of the observation telescope, which redirects the light onto the capturing medium, whether it is film or a digital [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]. Because of the eye's tendency to [[accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] while looking though a telescope, it is imperative that the exiting [[vergence]] is parallel in order for an in focus image to be formed on the capturing medium.\n\n===Modes===\nPractical instruments for fundus photography perform the following modes of examination:\n* '''Colour''', where the retina is illuminated by white light and examined in full colour.\n* '''Red free fundus photography''' utilizes a filter in order to better observe superficial lesions and some vascular abnormalities within the retina and surrounding tissue. A green filter ~540\u2013570&nbsp;nm is used to block out red wavelengths of light. This allows a better contrast for viewing retinal blood vessels and associated hemorrhages, pale lesions such as [[drusen]] and exudates, and subtle characteristics such as nerve fibre layer defects and epiretinal membranes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ophthalmological Imaging and Applications |last=Ng|first=E |displayauthors=etal |publisher=CRC Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4665-5915-8 |location= |pages=}}</ref> This is a method of better observing [[intraretinal microvascular abnormalities]], neovascularization at the disc and elsewhere in Diabetic retinopathy progression assessment.

Fundus photographs are also used to document abnormalities of disease process affecting the eye, and/or to follow up on the progress of the eye condition/disease such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Macular degeneration|age-macular degeneration]] (AMD), [[glaucoma]], and [[Neoplasms, fibrous tissue|neoplasm]] of the choroid, cranial nerves, retinal or eyeball.\n\nIn patients with diabetes mellitus, regular fundus screening examinations (once every six months to one year) are important to screen for [[diabetic retinopathy]] as visual loss due to diabetes can be prevented by retinal laser treatment if retinopathy is spotted early.\n\nBesides the prevalent ocular condition/diseases, fundus photography can also be used to monitor individuals on anti-malarial therapy, by noting the changes in the fundus during standard screening.\n\nFundus photography is also used in emergency cases including patients with constant headaches, [[Blood pressure|diastolic pressure]] greater than or equal to 120mmHg and patients with sudden visual loss.\n\nIn patients with headaches, the finding of swollen optic discs, or [[Papilledema|papilloedema]], on fundus photography is a key sign, as this indicates raised [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) which could be due to [[hydrocephalus]], [[Benign Intracranial Hypertension|benign intracranial hypertension]] (aka pseudotumour cerebri) or brain tumor, amongst other conditions. Cupped optic discs are seen in glaucoma.\n\nIn arterial hypertension, hypertensive changes of the retina closely mimic those in the brain, and may predict [[cerebrovascular accidents]] (strokes).\n\nIn certain cases fundus photography can also be used in research studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Fundus photography as a convenient tool to study microvascular responses to cardiovascular disease risk factors in epidemiological studies|journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1940-087X|pmc = 4353376|pmid = 25407823|pages = e51904|issue = 92|doi = 10.3791/51904|first = Patrick|last = De Boever|first2 = Tijs|last2 = Louwies|first3 = Eline|last3 = Provost|first4 = Luc|last4 = Int Panis|first5 = Tim S.|last5 = Nawrot}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and interpretation==\n{{Repetition section | date = March 2019}}\n[[File:Fundus photo showing focal laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy EDA10.JPG|thumb|Fundus photography is also used to document the characteristics of diabetic retinopathy such as macular edema and microaneurysms.

The photographs allow the clinician to study a patient's retina, detect retinal changes and review a patient's retinal findings with a coworker. Fundus photographs are routinely called upon in a wide variety of [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] conditions.<ref name=\"opsweb.org\"/>\n\nFundus photography is used to inspect anomalies associated to diseases that affect the eye, and to monitor their progression. It is able to identify [[glaucoma]] and [[multiple sclerosis]], as well as monitor disease processes such as [[macular degeneration]], retinal neoplasms, choroid disturbances and [[diabetic retinopathy]]. Fundus photographs assist in the planning of additional management options for these irregularities. The medical necessity of fundus photography must be recorded comprehensively so that the clinician is able to compare photographs of a patient from different timelines.\n\nDocuments of a patient's medical record must consist of a recent, relevant history, progress notes and fundus photographs depicting and supporting the relevant diagnosis. The photographs need to be labelled appropriately such as which eye, the date, and patient details.  The patient's records ought to contain documented outcomes of the fundus photography as well as a depiction of variations from previous photographs. They should contain an interpretation of those results and the relevant changes it could have on treatment plan.  Fundus photographs without an interpretation are seen as obsolete. The records should be legible, and contain suitable patient information and clinician details.\n\nThe interpretation of fundus photographs that are glaucomatous must contain a description of the vertical and horizontal cup to disc ratio, vessel pattern, diffuse or focal pallor, asymmetry and development of the above factors. The retinal nerve fibre layer should also be studied and commented on.<ref name=\"Fundus Photography\">{{Cite web|title = Fundus Photography|url = http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/500_599/0539.html|website = www.aetna.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}</ref>\n\nIt is also a useful tool in objectively measuring [[Listing's law|torsion]] as well as in documenting and recording progression of diseases over time. Fundus photography does not replace binocular indirect [[ophthalmoscopy]]; it is a tool to supplement and complement existing findings and to maintain a record of disease progression. Fundus photography is mainly used to monitor the progression of a retinal or optic nerve head disorder. It is also good for providing photo documentation for the continuum of care and to monitor the patient's ocular condition.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\nThe retina consists of ten semi-transparent [[Retina#Structure|layers]] that serve specific functions in the process of [[visual perception]].

As retinal abnormalities often begin in a particular layer of the retina before encroaching into the other layers (such as the formation of [[cotton wool spots]] in the [[nerve fiber layer]]), it is important to be able to appreciate depth when examining a fundus in order to provide an accurate diagnosis.

As the light paths of the two systems are independent, there are minimal reflections of the light source captured in the formed image. The image forming rays continue towards the low powered telescopic eyepiece. When the button is pressed to take a picture, a mirror interrupts the path of the illumination system allow the light from the flash bulb to pass into the eye. Simultaneously, a mirror falls in front of the observation telescope, which redirects the light onto the capturing medium, whether it is film or a digital [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]. Because of the eye\u2019s tendency to [[accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] while looking though a telescope, it is imperative that the exiting [[vergence]] is parallel in order for an in focus image to be formed on the capturing medium.\n\n===Modes===\nPractical instruments for fundus photography perform the following modes of examination:\n* '''Colour''', where the retina is illuminated by white light and examined in full colour.\n* '''Red free fundus photography''' utilizes a filter in order to better observe superficial lesions and some vascular abnormalities within the retina and surrounding tissue. A green filter ~540\u2013570&nbsp;nm is used to block out red wavelengths of light. This allows a better contrast for viewing retinal blood vessels and associated hemorrhages, pale lesions such as [[drusen]] and exudates, and subtle characteristics such as nerve fibre layer defects and epiretinal membranes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ophthalmological Imaging and Applications |last=Ng|first=E |displayauthors=etal |publisher=CRC Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4665-5915-8 |location= |pages=}}</ref> This is a method of better observing [[intraretinal microvascular abnormalities]], neovascularization at the disc and elsewhere in Diabetic retinopathy progression assessment.

Fundus photographs are also used to document abnormalities of disease process affecting the eye, and/or to follow up on the progress of the eye condition/disease such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Macular degeneration|age-macular degeneration]] (AMD), [[glaucoma]], and [[Neoplasms, fibrous tissue|neoplasm]] of the choroid, cranial nerves, retinal or eyeball.\n\nIn patients with diabetes mellitus, regular fundus screening examinations (once every six months to one year) are important to screen for [[diabetic retinopathy]] as visual loss due to diabetes can be prevented by retinal laser treatment if retinopathy is spotted early.\n\nBesides the prevalent ocular condition/diseases, fundus photography can also be used to monitor individuals on anti-malarial therapy, by noting the changes in the fundus during standard screening.\n\nFundus photography is also used in emergency cases including patients with constant headaches, [[Blood pressure|diastolic pressure]] greater than or equal to 120mmHg and patients with sudden visual loss.\n\nIn patients with headaches, the finding of swollen optic discs, or [[Papilledema|papilloedema]], on fundus photography is a key sign, as this indicates raised [[intracranial pressure]] (ICP) which could be due to [[hydrocephalus]], [[Benign Intracranial Hypertension|benign intracranial hypertension]] (aka pseudotumour cerebri) or brain tumor, amongst other conditions. Cupped optic discs are seen in glaucoma.\n\nIn arterial hypertension, hypertensive changes of the retina closely mimic those in the brain, and may predict [[cerebrovascular accidents]] (strokes).\n\nIn certain cases fundus photography can also be used in research studies.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Fundus photography as a convenient tool to study microvascular responses to cardiovascular disease risk factors in epidemiological studies|journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1940-087X|pmc = 4353376|pmid = 25407823|pages = e51904|issue = 92|doi = 10.3791/51904|first = Patrick|last = De Boever|first2 = Tijs|last2 = Louwies|first3 = Eline|last3 = Provost|first4 = Luc|last4 = Int Panis|first5 = Tim S.|last5 = Nawrot}}</ref>\n\n==Recording and interpretation==\n{{Repetition section | date = March 2019}}\n[[File:Fundus photo showing focal laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy EDA10.JPG|thumb|Fundus photography is also used to document the characteristics of diabetic retinopathy such as macular edema and microaneurysms.

The photographs allow the clinician to study a patient's retina, detect retinal changes and review a patient's retinal findings with a coworker. Fundus photographs are routinely called upon in a wide variety of [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] conditions.<ref name=\"opsweb.org\"/>\n\nFundus photography is used to inspect anomalies associated to diseases that affect the eye, and to monitor their progression. It is able to identify [[glaucoma]] and [[multiple sclerosis]], as well as monitor disease processes such as [[macular degeneration]], retinal neoplasms, choroid disturbances and [[diabetic retinopathy]]. Fundus photographs assist in the planning of additional management options for these irregularities. The medical necessity of fundus photography must be recorded comprehensively so that the clinician is able to compare photographs of a patient from different timelines.\n\nDocuments of a patient's medical record must consist of a recent, relevant history, progress notes and fundus photographs depicting and supporting the relevant diagnosis. The photographs need to be labelled appropriately such as which eye, the date, and patient details.  The patient\u2019s records ought to contain documented outcomes of the fundus photography as well as a depiction of variations from previous photographs. They should contain an interpretation of those results and the relevant changes it could have on treatment plan.  Fundus photographs without an interpretation are seen as obsolete. The records should be legible, and contain suitable patient information and clinician details.\n\nThe interpretation of fundus photographs that are glaucomatous must contain a description of the vertical and horizontal cup to disc ratio, vessel pattern, diffuse or focal pallor, asymmetry and development of the above factors. The retinal nerve fibre layer should also be studied and commented on.<ref name=\"Fundus Photography\">{{Cite web|title = Fundus Photography|url = http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/500_599/0539.html|website = www.aetna.com|accessdate = 2015-09-17}}</ref>\n\nIt is also a useful tool in objectively measuring [[Listing's law|torsion]] as well as in documenting and recording progression of diseases over time. Fundus photography does not replace binocular indirect [[ophthalmoscopy]]; it is a tool to supplement and complement existing findings and to maintain a record of disease progression. Fundus photography is mainly used to monitor the progression of a retinal or optic nerve head disorder. It is also good for providing photo documentation for the continuum of care and to monitor the patient's ocular condition.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\nThe retina consists of ten semi-transparent [[Retina#Structure|layers]] that serve specific functions in the process of [[visual perception]]. Fundus photography provides a bird\u2019s-eye view of the top most layer, the [[inner limiting membrane]], as well as the other underlying layers. As retinal abnormalities often begin in a particular layer of the retina before encroaching into the other layers (such as the formation of [[cotton wool spots]] in the [[nerve fiber layer]]), it is important to be able to appreciate depth when examining a fundus in order to provide an accurate diagnosis.

This marked the beginning of the revolution.  Over the next three months, the Texan colonists drove all Mexican army troops out of the province.  In January 1836, Mexican president and general  [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] led Mexican troops into Texas to put down the rebellion.  General [[Jose Urrea]] marched half of the troops up the Texas coast in the [[Goliad campaign]], while Santa Anna led the rest of the troops to [[San Antonio|San Antonio de Bexar]].  After a thirteen-day siege, Santa Anna's army defeated the small group of Texans at the [[Battle of the Alamo]] and continued east.  Many Texans, including the government, fled their homes in the [[Runaway Scrape]]. On March 19 the Texas troops marched into an open prairie outside of Goliad during a heavy fog. When they stopped to rest their animals, Urrea and his main army surrounded them. The Texas force numbered at least 300 soldiers, and the Mexicans had 300 to 500 troops. With no choice but battle, [[James Fannin]] chose to stand and fight near Coleto Creek. Santa Anna and his troops searched for the Texan government and the Texan army led by [[Sam Houston]].  On April 21, 1836, the Texans defeated Santa Anna's army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]; Santa Anna was captured the following day.  The Mexican army retreated back to Mexico City, ending the Texas Revolution. Texas was now an independent colony and later joined the United States.\n\n==Prelude to war: 1823&ndash;1834==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n\n!Year\n!Political events\n!Military events\n|-\n| '''1823'''\n|\n* February 18{{spaced ndash}}[[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] disapproved [[Stephen F.

This marked the beginning of the revolution.  Over the next three months, the Texan colonists drove all Mexican army troops out of the province.  In January 1836, Mexican president and general  [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] led Mexican troops into Texas to put down the rebellion.  General [[Jose Urrea]] marched half of the troops up the Texas coast in the [[Goliad campaign]], while Santa Anna led the rest of the troops to [[San Antonio|San Antonio de Bexar]].  After a thirteen-day siege, Santa Anna's army defeated the small group of Texans at the [[Battle of the Alamo]] and continued east.  Many Texans, including the government, fled their homes in the [[Runaway Scrape]]. On March 19 the Texas troops marched into an open prairie outside of Goliad during a heavy fog. When they stopped to rest their animals, Urrea and his main army surrounded them. The Texas force numbered at least 300 soldiers, and the Mexicans had 300 to 500 troops. With no choice but battle, [[James Fannin]] chose to stand and fight near Coleto Creek. Santa Anna and his troops searched for the Texan government and the Texan army led by [[Sam Houston]].  On April 21, 1836, the Texans defeated Santa Anna's army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]; Santa Anna was captured the following day.  The Mexican army retreated back to Mexico City, ending the Texas Revolution. Texas was now an independent colony and later joined the United States.\n\n==Prelude to war: 1823&ndash;1834==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n\n!Year\n!Political events\n!Military events\n|-\n| '''1823'''\n|\n* February 18{{spaced ndash}}[[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] disapproved [[Stephen F.
