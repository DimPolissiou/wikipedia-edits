The team originally planned on making a [[Mecha#In video games|mecha]] title but later settled on doing a vertically scrolling shooter instead after initial testings of the mech game proved to be unsuccessful, while integrating some of their original ideas from the former project into the final release. It also marked the debut of [[mangaka]] and ''[[Knuckle Bash]]'' [[Video game design#Game designer|designer]] [[Junya Inoue]] in the [[video game industry]], serving as one of its graphic designers.\n\n''Dogyuun'' has been praised by reviewers in recent years for its visuals, sound design, gameplay, multiplayer, challenge and overall intensity but others felt that some of its mechanics were underdeveloped and lamented the lack of a console release. As of [[2019 in video gaming|2019]], the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in [[2017 in video gaming|2017]] by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan [[Intellectual property|IP]]s.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Dogyuun (Dogy\u016bn!!).png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\n''Dogyuun'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game reminiscent of ''[[Aero Fighters]]'' and ''[[Recca]]'', where players assume the role of two pilots who took a part on a reconnaissance mission on planet Dino taking control of the Sylfers bomber space fighter crafts through ten stages in a revenge effort to defeat an invading alien race of metallic robots who have captured a police communication center and its inhabitants after their comrade, Kyle, was killed by one of them as the main objective.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/><ref name=\"D!!g56\">{{cite magazine|author=Y\u016bri|title=Dogyuun!!|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=71|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=May 1992|pages=10\u201312|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name=\"D!!flyer\">''Dogyuun'' arcade flyer (Toaplan, EU)</ref><ref name=\"MBASICM124\">{{cite magazine|author=Yanma|url=https://archive.org/stream/micomBASIC_1992-10#page/n226/mode/1up|title=Super Soft Hot Information - Video Game: \u30c9\u30ae\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3|magazine=[[:ja:\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3BASIC\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3|Micom BASIC Magazine]]|issue=124|publisher=[[:ja:\u96fb\u6ce2\u65b0\u805e\u793e|The Dempa Shimbunsha Corporation]]|date=October 1992|page=243|lang=ja}}</ref> As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the game initially appears to be very standard; Players start with a single laser beam that can be held on at close range for dealing minimal damage against enemies when not firing and other weapons can be acquired by destroying incoming carriers, ranging from homing lasers to a lightning beam, which can be distinguished by their color.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/><ref name=\"D!!g56\"/><ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/> If a weapon module of the same color is picked up, a 5000-point bonus is granted.<ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/>\n\nA unique gameplay feature is the \"Unit Beam\" system; players have the ability to combine the two ships into one and increase their [[firepower]] much further than normal but this can also prove to be a highly risky proposition, however, as both ships can be destroyed by a single enemy fire or colliding against enemies but players are able to detach their ships at any given time. When separated, players are also able to capture a small enemy to gain points continually or hold items for later use.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/><ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/> There are only two types of [[Item (gaming)|item]] modules that can be attached to the ships; A single-use [[bomb]] module capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]] that can also be triggered after taking enemy hits and a speed module that enhances the ship's speed to quickly avoid enemy fire, in addition of activating a set of two satellite \"options\" when using the default main weapon.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/><ref name=\"D!!g56\"/><ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/>\n\nIn some occasions, players can pick up a spinning [[1UP]] icon with two different sides, with one side that grants an extra live after being picked up and another side that grants 100000 points instead.<ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/> Similar to ''[[Gun Frontier (video game)|Gun Frontier]]'', the game hosts a number of hidden bonus secrets to be found, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives. The title uses a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/> The original Japanese version employs a mechanism where the difficulty will max out.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continue]] playing. Although there is an ending, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous shoot 'em ups from Toaplan and each loop increases in difficulty, however reaching the fifth loop results in a [[kill screen]] that crashes the arcade hardware.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n''Dogyuun'' takes place in a future where transmission with a police communication center at the planet Dino has ceased. Three pilots were sent for a reconnaissance assignment in order to determine the current situation before one of them, Kyle, is assaulted and killed by a metallic robot from an invading alien race, indicating that the communication center has been overrun by them and held its personnel as hostages. Seeking revenge for the death of their comrade, the two pilots embark on a full counterattack against the aliens with their Sylfers bomber crafts.<ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/><ref name=\"D!!ss\">{{cite web|url=http://shootingstar.game.coocan.jp/dogyuun.html|title=\uff24\uff4f\uff47\uff59\uff55\uff55\uff4e|publisher=Shooting Star|access-date=2019-09-07|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Dogyuun art design.jpg|thumb|right|Most of the artwork were hand-drawn sketches created by the development team before being transpose to [[pixel art]] graphics.]]\n''Dogyuun'' was created by most of the same team that worked on previous projects at Toaplan such as ''Snow Bros.'' and who would also later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994.<ref name=\"ah\"/><ref name=\"D!!staffroll\">{{cite video game|title=Dogyuun|developer=[[Toaplan]]|publisher=[[Toaplan]]|date=October 1992|platform=Arcade|level=Staff roll|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name=\"D!!gsla\">{{cite web|url=http://chibarei.blog.jp/gsl/words2/inouejunya/junyainoue.html|title=\u4e95\u4e0a\u6df3\u54c9|work=Game Staff List Association|publisher=BrandGamer-R\uff65TYPERS|date=2002|access-date=2019-11-19|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701142047/http://chibarei.blog.jp/gsl/words2/inouejunya/junyainoue.html|archive-date=2016-07-01|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"CshH17yTyf15y\">{{cite book|last=|first=|title=\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc -

center and held its [[inhabitants]] as [[hostage]]s, players assume the role of two [[fighter pilot]]s taking control of the Sylfers [[bomber]] [[List of fictional spacecraft#Space fighters|space fighter]] crafts in an [[revenge]] attempt to overthrow the invaders and free the surviving [[colonists]] after one of their comrades is killed by one of them during a [[reconnaissance]] assignment.\n\nHeaded by [[Tamsoft]] co-founder and ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden]]'' [[Video game producer|producer]] Toshiaki \u014cta, ''Dogyuun'' was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan such as ''[[Snow Bros.]]'' and who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared [[bankruptcy]] in [[1994 in video gaming|1994]], putting emphasis on visuals instead of gameplay. The team originally planned on making a [[Mecha#In video games|mecha]] title but later settled on doing a vertically scrolling shooter instead after initial testings of the mech game proved to be unsuccessful, while integrating some of their original ideas from the former project into the final release. It also marked the debut of [[mangaka]] and ''[[Knuckle Bash]]'' [[Video game design#Game designer|designer]] [[Junya Inoue]] in the [[video game industry]], serving as one of its graphic designers.\n\n''Dogyuun'' has been praised by reviewers in recent years for its visuals, sound design, gameplay, multiplayer, challenge and overall intensity but others felt that some of its mechanics were underdeveloped and lamented the lack of a console release. As of [[2019 in video gaming|2019]], the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in [[2017 in video gaming|2017]] by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan [[Intellectual property|IP]]s.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:ARC Dogyuun (Dogy\u016bn!!).png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\n''Dogyuun'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed vertically scrolling [[shoot 'em up]] game reminiscent of ''[[Aero Fighters]]'' and ''[[Recca]]'', where players assume the role of two pilots who took a part on a reconnaissance mission on planet Dino taking control of the Sylfers bomber space fighter crafts through ten stages in a revenge effort to defeat an invading alien race of metallic robots who have captured a police communication center and its inhabitants after their comrade, Kyle, was killed by one of them as the main objective.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/><ref name=\"D!!g56\">{{cite magazine|author=Y\u016bri|title=Dogyuun!!|magazine=[[Gamest]]|issue=71|publisher=[[Shinseisha]]|date=May 1992|pages=10\u201312|lang=ja}}</ref><ref name=\"D!!flyer\">''Dogyuun'' arcade flyer (Toaplan, EU)</ref><ref name=\"MBASICM124\">{{cite magazine|author=Yanma|url=https://archive.org/stream/micomBASIC_1992-10#page/n226/mode/1up|title=Super Soft Hot Information - Video Game: \u30c9\u30ae\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3|magazine=[[:ja:\u30de\u30a4\u30b3\u30f3BASIC\u30de\u30ac\u30b8\u30f3|Micom BASIC Magazine]]|issue=124|publisher=[[:ja:\u96fb\u6ce2\u65b0\u805e\u793e|The Dempa Shimbunsha Corporation]]|date=October 1992|page=243|lang=ja}}</ref> As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the game initially appears to be very standard; Players start with a single laser beam that can be held on at close range for dealing minimal damage against enemies when not firing and other weapons can be acquired by destroying incoming carriers, ranging from homing lasers to a lightning beam, which can be distinguished by their color.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/><ref name=\"D!!g56\"/><ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/> If a weapon module of the same color is picked up, a 5000-point bonus is granted.<ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/>\n\nA unique gameplay feature is the \"Unit Beam\" system; players have the ability to combine the two ships into one and increase their [[firepower]] much further than normal but this can also prove to be a highly risky proposition, however, as both ships can be destroyed by a single enemy fire or colliding against enemies but players are able to detach their ships at any given time. When separated, players are also able to capture a small enemy to gain points continually or hold items for later use.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/><ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/> There are only two types of [[Item (gaming)|item]] modules that can be attached to the ships; A single-use [[bomb]] module capable of obliterating any enemy caught within its [[blast radius]] that can also be triggered after taking enemy hits and a speed module that enhances the ship's speed to quickly avoid enemy fire, in addition of granting a set of two satellite \"options\" that are activated when using the default main weapon.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/><ref name=\"D!!g56\"/><ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/>\n\nIn some occasions, players can pick up a spinning [[1UP]] icon with two different sides, with one side that grants an extra live after being picked up and another side that grants 100000 points instead.<ref name=\"D!!flyer\"/> Similar to ''[[Gun Frontier (video game)|Gun Frontier]]'', the game hosts a number of hidden bonus secrets to be found, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives. The title uses a [[Saved game#Checkpoints|checkpoint]] in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying.<ref name=\"D!!hg101\"/> The original Japanese version employs a mechanism where the difficulty will max out.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Getting hit by enemy fire will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the [[Game over|game is over]] unless players insert more credits into the arcade machine to [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continue]] playing. Although there is an ending, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage as with previous shoot 'em ups from Toaplan and each loop increases in difficulty, however reaching the fifth loop results in a [[kill screen]] that crashes the arcade hardware.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n''Dogyuun'' takes place in a future where transmission with a police communication center at the planet Dino has ceased. Three pilots were sent for a reconnaissance assignment in order to determine the current situation before one of them, Kyle, is assaulted and killed by a metallic robot from an invading alien race, indicating that the communication center has been overrun by them and held its personnel as hostages.

{"title_page": "Erotic humiliation", "text_new": "{{Hatnote|This article is about consensual erotic humiliation; for abusive sexual humiliation, see the main articles [[humiliation]] and [[sexual abuse]]}}\n{{short description|Consensual use of humiliation in a sexual context}}\n[[File:Public humiliation caning.jpg|thumb|Humiliation of a man being \"forced\" to kneel and hold a dominatrix's purse with his mouth while being punished (caning) in public.]]\n\n'''Erotic humiliation''' is [[consent (BDSM)|consensual]] psychological [[humiliation]] performed in order to produce erotic excitement or [[sexual arousal]]. This can be for either the person(s) being humiliated and demeaned or the person(s) humiliating, or both. It is sometimes performed before spectators, including pornography and [[webcam]] viewers. It may be part of [[BDSM]] and other [[sexual roleplay]], or accompanied by the sexual stimulation of the genitals (or other erotic region) of one or both parties in the activity.\n\nHumiliation is a subjective issue and is dependent on context. It does not need to be sexual in nature; as with many other sexual activities, it is the feelings that are obtained from the experience that are desired, regardless of the nature of the actual activity. Usually there is a feeling of [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|submission]] for the person being humiliated and [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|dominance]] for the person implementing the humiliation. As with  other types of dominant-submissive play, it is the submissive who is in control; the submissive sets the limits, because the submissive is free to leave if his or her demands are not met.\n\nErotic humiliation can be done verbally, physically, or both, and can be either private or public. Some individuals assume an acting role and others prefer to be spoken to in a degrading way. A classic technique that can be used to put the submissive into a [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] mind space is to humiliate them while also providing them with sexual stimulation. Select individuals who desire this form of humiliation also use it to acquire emotional release. Humiliation can become [[ritual]]ized, and unlike some sexual variations, it can also be easily carried out over a long distance (such as [[online]]).\n\nWhile fantasy and fascination with erotic humiliation is a prevalent part of BDSM and other sexual roleplay, relatively little has been written on it.<ref name=\"Wild Side Sex\">{{cite book|author=Midori (\u7f8e\u767b\u91cc) |title=''Wild Side Sex: The Book of Kink. Educational, Sensual, And Entertaining Essays''|year=2005|publisher=Daedalus Publishing|isbn=978-1-881943-22-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO0BbX_oBiUC&dq=erotic+humiliation|page=48}}</ref> Humiliation play can, however, be taken to a point where it becomes emotionally or psychologically distressing to one or the other partner, especially if it is [[public humiliation]]. Erotic humiliation can become extreme enough to be considered a form of [[edgeplay]], which some consider may best be approached with advance [[Negotiation (BDSM)|negotiation]] and use of a [[safeword]].\n\n==Terminology and overview==\n[[File:Nude slave girl.jpg|thumb|left|A nude submissive female cleans the shoe of her male master by licking it, on a public road in USA, 2012]]\n\nThe most common name for the individual being humiliated is the ''[[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]]'', and the opposite individual who humiliates the bottom is often called the ''[[Top (BDSM)|top]]''. However, these terms are standard ones that are used in general [[Domination & submission (BDSM)|dominant/submissive]] roleplay and are not specific to humiliation interests.\n\n* If the top is regarded as a female, they are sometimes called the ''humiliatrix''. Other common names include [[Master (BDSM)|''Master''/''Dom'']] (male top), and ''Mistress''/[[Sexual domination|''Domme'']] (female top). \n* For the bottom (irrespective of gender), other common names are  ''[[Slave (BDSM)|slave]]'' and [[Sexual submission|''sub''/''submissive'']].\n\nWhile elements of erotic humiliation may be part of a number of [[domination and submission]]-based activities, humiliation is not the same as [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|submission]]. The recipient does not necessarily seek to be ordered about. Humiliation comes into its own as a sexual force when the recipient seeks the humiliation over and above means. For example, being spanked is primarily valued because of the belittlement involved. Humiliation therefore encompasses a range of [[paraphilia]], including [[foot fetish]], [[breast fetish]], [[shoe fetish]], [[body worship]], [[spanking]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], and most [[BDSM]] styles. It can be as basic as the desire to kiss and massage feet as a precursor to sex; and it can be complex, involving roleplay and public displays of subservience.

As with any form of pain experimentation in a sexual context, [[Consent (BDSM)|consent]] and (paradoxically) a high degree of awareness and communication are needed to ensure that the result is desirable, rather than abusive. For example, a submissive may enjoy being insulted in some ways but would be genuinely crushed and devastated if humiliated or insulted in other ways.\n\nHumiliation play is also connected to [[sexual fetish]]ism, in that non-sexual activities may become sexualised by association with arousal, and also may be associated with [[exhibitionism]] in the sense of wanting others to witness (or being aroused by others witnessing) one's sexual degradation.\n\nFor some people, activities such as name-calling are a way of achieving [[ego reduction]] or getting over [[sexual inhibition]]s. For example, between gay people, terms usually associated with [[homophobia]] may be used, such as ''[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]'' and ''[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]''.\n\nAs with all sexual activities, some people have [[Sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]] about humiliation, and others actually undertake it as a lifestyle or in a [[Scene (BDSM)|scene]]. Sexual fantasies relating to mild humiliation are common. Some humiliation roleplay ([[Animal roleplay|pup-play]] and [[age play]] in particular) is combined with loyalty and care-giving to the extent that these fetishes can be seen as exercises in trust rather than primarily a humiliation fetish. The desire to be beneath the other partner during intercourse, the idea of \"getting caught\" (as in having sex in the garden or woods), and simulated rape are emotional games that emphasise status, vulnerability, and control. However, for most people such ideas remain fantasies; the people would have strong reservations about the fantasies' being made public, or engaged in with a partner in real life, however erotic the idea may be.  When someone reveals a fetish to a partner, this usually is a result of great trust. However, the desire to be humiliated may be a motivating cause for confession, in that the act of confessing can itself be humiliating. Many people worry about being ridiculed for their fetishes, and such ridicule from their partners could be psychologically catastrophic. Therefore, many people use online humiliation (in which the [[humiliator]] and others are involved via the [[Internet]], using chat, email, websites, etc.) as a compromise between exhibitionism and reality on the one hand, and safety and anonymity on the other.\n\n==Online humiliation==\nOnline humiliation is the desire to be seen in a sexually embarrassing context on the Internet. This practice allows the submissive to seek fetish partners from across the world. As the Internet has grown and continues to grow, so does online humiliation. Anecdotal reports indicate that the proportion of men being dominated by women on the Internet, through some type of personal service provided for a fee by the woman, vastly exceeds the instances of a woman being dominated online by a man, or another woman.\n\nCommon methods of online humiliation:\n\n* Public [[pillory]].\n* Embarrassing photographic or video assignments for submissives, who must publicly post pictures or videos of their humiliation. The dominant may require public acts or exposure. Sometimes humiliating words are written on the submissive's body before photographing.\n* Requiring the submissive to post publicly their name, address, phone number, employer, or other personal information.\n* The requirement for submissives to keep online journals detailing personal information, such as masturbation frequency, thoughts or fantasies, technique or aid(s) used, and disposal of semen (if the submissive is allowed to masturbate).\n* The requirement for the submissive to place themself in [[chastity]], and to publicly post a picture showing their status.\n* Verbal abuse.\n* Publicly bidding for items that reveal their fetishes.\n* Money slavery, in which the submissive must buy the dominant gifts and pay the dominant's bills and taxes, or give the dominant direct access to their bank accounts and credit cards.\n* Homework slavery, in which the submissive must do the dominant's homework or occupational work.\n* Repetitive assignments, such as copying the phone book.\n* Humiliating the submissive by changing information on social sites.\n* Controlling the submissive's computer remotely, through [[remote desktop software]] the submissive is required to install.\n\nThese practices can be conducted through chat, [[webcam]], e-mail, BDSM contact websites, and proprietary virtual spaces such as ''[[Second Life]]'' or [[FetLife]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Commonscat|BDSM humiliation}}\n* [[Dominance and submission]]\n* [[Edgeplay]]\n* [[Erotic hypnosis]]\n* [[Erotic sexual denial]]\n* [[Financial domination]]\n* [[Salirophilia]]\n* [[Sexual fetishism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n\n* {{cite book |last1 = Brame |first1 = Gloria |authorlink1 = Gloria Brame |last2 = Brame |first2 = William D. |last3 = Jacobs |first3 = Jon |title = Different loving &ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission |year = 1993 |publisher = [[Villard (imprint)|Villard Books]] |isbn = 978-0-6797-6956-9 }}\n\n{{BDSM}}\n\n[[Category:BDSM terminology]]\n[[Category:Sexual acts]]\n[[Category:Sexology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Hatnote|This article is about consensual erotic humiliation; for abusive sexual humiliation, see the main articles [[humiliation]] and [[sexual abuse]]}}\n{{short description|Consensual use of humiliation in a sexual context}}\n[[File:Public humiliation caning.jpg|thumb|Humiliation of a man being \"forced\" to kneel and hold a dominatrix's purse with his mouth while being punished (caning) in public.]]\n\n'''Erotic humiliation''' is [[consent (BDSM)|consensual]] psychological [[humiliation]] performed in order to produce erotic excitement or [[sexual arousal]]. This can be for either the person(s) being humiliated and demeaned or the person(s) humiliating, or both. It is sometimes performed before spectators, including pornography and [[webcam]] viewers. It may be part of [[BDSM]] and other [[sexual roleplay]], or accompanied by the sexual stimulation of the genitals (or other erotic region) of one or both parties in the activity.\n\nHumiliation is a subjective issue and is dependent on context. It does not need to be sexual in nature; as with many other sexual activities, it is the feelings that are obtained from the experience that are desired, regardless of the nature of the actual activity. Usually there is a feeling of [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|submission]] for the person being humiliated and [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|dominance]] for the person implementing the humiliation. As with  other types of dominant-submissive play, it is the submissive who is in control; the submissive sets the limits, because the submissive is free to leave if his or her demands are not met.\n\nErotic humiliation can be done verbally, physically, or both, and can be either private or public. Some individuals assume an acting role and others prefer to be spoken to in a degrading way. A classic technique that can be used to put the submissive into a [[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]] mind space is to humiliate them while also providing them with sexual stimulation. Select individuals who desire this form of humiliation also use it to acquire emotional release. Humiliation can become [[ritual]]ized, and unlike some sexual variations, it can also be easily carried out over a long distance (such as [[online]]).\n\nWhile fantasy and fascination with erotic humiliation is a prevalent part of BDSM and other sexual roleplay, relatively little has been written on it.<ref name=\"Wild Side Sex\">{{cite book|author=Midori (\u7f8e\u767b\u91cc) |title=''Wild Side Sex: The Book of Kink.

Erotic humiliation can become extreme enough to be considered a form of [[edgeplay]], which some consider may best be approached with advance [[Negotiation (BDSM)|negotiation]] and use of a [[safeword]].\n\n==Terminology and overview==\n[[File:Nude slave girl.jpg|thumb|left|A nude submissive female cleans the shoe of her male master by licking it, on a public road in USA, 2012]]\n\nThe most common name for the individual being humiliated is the ''[[Bottom (BDSM)|bottom]]'', and the opposite individual who humiliates the bottom is often called the ''[[Top (BDSM)|top]]''. However, these terms are standard ones that are used in general [[Domination & submission (BDSM)|dominant/submissive]] roleplay and are not specific to humiliation interests.\n\n* If the top is regarded as a female, they are sometimes called the ''humiliatrix''. Other common names include [[Master (BDSM)|''Master''/''Dom'']] (male top), and ''Mistress''/[[Sexual domination|''Domme'']] (female top). \n* For the bottom (irrespective of gender), other common names are  ''[[Slave (BDSM)|slave]]'' and [[Sexual submission|''sub''/''submissive'']].\n\nWhile elements of erotic humiliation may be part of a number of [[domination and submission]]-based activities, humiliation is not the same as [[Domination and submission (BDSM)|submission]]. The recipient does not necessarily seek to be ordered about. Humiliation comes into its own as a sexual force when the recipient seeks the humiliation over and above means. For example, being spanked is primarily valued because of the belittlement involved. Humiliation therefore encompasses a range of [[paraphilia]], including [[foot fetish]], [[breast fetish]], [[shoe fetish]], [[body worship]], [[spanking]], [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], and most [[BDSM]] styles. It can be as basic as the desire to kiss and massage feet as a precursor to sex; and it can be complex, involving roleplay and public displays of subservience. It can also be for a set period of time (a \"[[Scene (BDSM)|scene]]\") or an ongoing facet of a relationship. The ''humiliation'' is not intrinsic to the act or the object. Rather, it is [[semiotics|semiotically]] charged by the shared attitude of the partners engaged in the act. They invest specific acts, objects, or body parts with a humiliating aspect.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Giannini | first1 = AJ | last2 = Colapietro | first2 = G | last3 = Slaby | first3 = AE | last4 = Melemis | first4 = SM | last5 = Bowman | first5 = RK | title = Sexualization of the female foot as a response to sexually transmitted epidemics: a preliminary study | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 491\u20138 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9819924 | doi=10.2466/pr0.83.6.491-498}}</ref>\n\n==Means of humiliation==\n\n<!-- Do not remove these images: Wikipedia is not censored and the current consensus is for this article to have such images as they are important for the article -->\n\n[[File:Erotic humiliation.jpg|thumb|250px|Two women humiliating their male submissives in public.

For example, one person might [[Animal roleplay|play the part of a dog]] because they enjoy being mock-forced into it, and the top might emphasize the lowness of the bottom's status as an animal, whereas another person might play the role of the dog without any element of humiliation, simply as an expression of an inner animal or playful spirit.\n\n==Psychology of humiliation==\n[[File:Piss drinking.png|thumb|left|upright=0.6|A woman urinating into the mouth of a man as an example of the practice of [[golden showers]].

As with any form of pain experimentation in a sexual context, [[Consent (BDSM)|consent]] and (paradoxically) a high degree of awareness and communication are needed to ensure that the result is desirable, rather than abusive. For example, a submissive may enjoy being insulted in some ways but would be genuinely crushed and devastated if humiliated or insulted in other ways.\n\nHumiliation play is also connected to [[sexual fetish]]ism, in that non-sexual activities may become sexualised by association with arousal, and also may be associated with [[exhibitionism]] in the sense of wanting others to witness (or being aroused by others witnessing) one's sexual degradation.\n\nFor some people, activities such as name-calling are a way of achieving [[ego reduction]] or getting over [[sexual inhibition]]s. For example, between gay people, terms usually associated with [[homophobia]] may be used, such as ''[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]'' and ''[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]''.\n\nAs with all sexual activities, some people have [[Sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]] about humiliation, and others actually undertake it as a lifestyle or in a [[Scene (BDSM)|scene]]. Sexual fantasies relating to mild humiliation are common. Some humiliation roleplay ([[Animal roleplay|pup-play]] and [[age play]] in particular) is combined with loyalty and care-giving to the extent that these fetishes can be seen as exercises in trust rather than primarily a humiliation fetish. The desire to be beneath the other partner during intercourse, the idea of \"getting caught\" (as in having sex in the garden or woods), and simulated rape are emotional games that emphasise status, vulnerability, and control. However, for most people such ideas remain fantasies; the people would have strong reservations about the fantasies' being made public, or engaged in with a partner in real life, however erotic the idea may be.  When someone reveals a fetish to a partner, this usually is a result of great trust. However, the desire to be humiliated may be a motivating cause for confession, in that the act of confessing can itself be humiliating. Many people worry about being ridiculed for their fetishes, and such ridicule from their partners could be psychologically catastrophic. Therefore, many people use online humiliation (in which the [[humiliator]] and others are involved via the [[Internet]], using chat, email, websites, etc.) as a compromise between exhibitionism and reality on the one hand, and safety and anonymity on the other.\n\n==Online humiliation==\nOnline humiliation is the desire to be seen in a sexually embarrassing context on the Internet. This practice allows the submissive to seek fetish partners from across the world. As the Internet has grown and continues to grow, so does online humiliation. Anecdotal reports indicate that the proportion of men being dominated by women on the Internet, through some type of personal service provided for a fee by the woman, vastly exceeds the instances of a woman being dominated online by a man, or another woman.\n\nCommon methods of online humiliation:\n\n* Public [[pillory]].\n* Embarrassing photographic or video assignments for submissives, who must publicly post pictures or videos of their humiliation. The dominant may require public acts or exposure. Sometimes humiliating words are written on the submissive's body before photographing.\n* Requiring the submissive to post publicly their name, address, phone number, employer, or other personal information.\n* The requirement for submissives to keep online journals detailing personal information, such as masturbation frequency, thoughts or fantasies, technique or aid(s) used, and disposal of semen (if the submissive is allowed to masturbate).\n* The requirement for the submissive to place themself in [[chastity]], and to publicly post a picture showing their status.\n* Verbal abuse.\n* Publicly bidding for items that reveal their fetishes.\n* Money slavery, in which the submissive must buy the dominant gifts and pay the dominant's bills and taxes, or give the dominant direct access to their bank accounts and credit cards.\n* Homework slavery, in which the submissive must do the dominant's homework or occupational work.\n* Repetitive assignments, such as copying the phone book.\n* Humiliating the submissive by changing information on social sites.\n* Controlling the submissive's computer remotely, through [[remote desktop software]] the submissive is required to install.\n\nThese practices can be conducted through chat, [[webcam]], e-mail, BDSM contact websites, and proprietary virtual spaces such as ''[[Second Life]]'' or [[FetLife]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Commonscat|BDSM humiliation}}\n* [[Dominance and submission]]\n* [[Edgeplay]]\n* [[Erotic hypnosis]]\n* [[Erotic sexual denial]]\n* [[Financial domination]]\n* [[Salirophilia]]\n* [[Sexual fetishism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n\n* {{cite book |last1 = Brame |first1 = Gloria |authorlink1 = Gloria Brame |last2 = Brame |first2 = William D. |last3 = Jacobs |first3 = Jon |title = Different loving &ndash; The World of Sexual Dominance and Submission |year = 1993 |publisher = [[Villard (imprint)|Villard Books]] |isbn = 978-0-6797-6956-9 }}\n\n{{BDSM}}\n\n[[Category:BDSM terminology]]\n[[Category:Sexual acts]]\n[[Category:Sexology]]\n", "name_user": "Deisenbe", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVerbal humiliation:Spelling/grammar/punctuation/typographical correction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erotic_humiliation"}

In 2019, there were around 200 pupils in the Junior School and 700 in the Senior School.\n\n==History==\n[[File:StJohnsHospitalExeter.png|thumb|left|St John's Hospital site of the school from 1633 to 1878]]\nThe School traces its origins from the opening of the Exeter Free Grammar School on 1 August 1633, attended mainly by the sons of the City freemen.  Exeter's wealthy merchants, notably Thomas Walker, provided the finance, with sufficient bequests to pay the Headmaster \u00a350 a year and to install the school in the medieval buildings of St John's Hospital, which had stood on the south side of the High Street since the 12th century.\n\nIn 1878 the school opened as Exeter Grammar School at a new campus designed by noted architect [[William Butterfield]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cherry |first=Bridget |author2=Nikolaus Pevsner |title=Devon |year=1991 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |isbn=0-300-09596-1 | page=407 }}</ref> The school occupies this {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on Victoria Park Road to this day. The cost at the time was \u00a37,600 with a further \u00a316,750 spent on the erection of buildings.  It was decided that St John's Hospital Trust had to pay to Exeter School the net annual income of all endowments for Exhibitions and Scholarships attached to the School, and it also had to pay a proportion of the residue of its income.\n\nIn 1920 the Governors of Exeter School decided that it was no longer possible for them to continue the School without considerable assistance.  The Exeter Education Authority agreed to assist but only if the School came under its direct control so, in April 1921, control of the school was handed over to the City.  It then became a \"maintained\" school until 1929 when it became an \"aided\" school, thus regaining charge of its own finances under a newly appointed Governing Body.<ref>Bush, R.J.E.

In September 1976 the first \"[[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]]\" pupils were admitted into the school.<ref>[http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/doc/1097%5Cmrdoc%5Cpdf%5Ca1097uab.pdf \"Study of Occupational Change\"], [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], 1972</ref>\n\nFrom 1979, the School participated in the [[Assisted Places Scheme]], taking over 200 pupils at its peak, but this scheme was abolished in 1997 and the last of these pupils left in the summer of 2004.<ref>[http://www.garfnet.org.uk/new_mill/summer97/exeter.htm \"Exeter Middle School's Cup Final\"], The New Millennium</ref> In 1981 the [[Sixth Form]] became coeducational.

In 2019, there were around 200 pupils in the Junior School and 700 in the Senior School.\n\n==History==\n[[File:StJohnsHospitalExeter.png|thumb|left|St John's Hospital site of the school from 1633 to 1878]]\nThe School traces its origins from the opening of the Exeter Free Grammar School on 1 August 1633, attended mainly by the sons of the City freemen.  Exeter\u2019s wealthy merchants, notably Thomas Walker, provided the finance, with sufficient bequests to pay the Headmaster \u00a350 a year and to install the school in the medieval buildings of St John\u2019s Hospital, which had stood on the south side of the High Street since the 12th century.\n\nIn 1878 the school opened as Exeter Grammar School at a new campus designed by noted architect [[William Butterfield]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cherry |first=Bridget |author2=Nikolaus Pevsner |title=Devon |year=1991 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |isbn=0-300-09596-1 | page=407 }}</ref> The school occupies this {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on Victoria Park Road to this day. The cost at the time was \u00a37,600 with a further \u00a316,750 spent on the erection of buildings.  It was decided that St John\u2019s Hospital Trust had to pay to Exeter School the net annual income of all endowments for Exhibitions and Scholarships attached to the School, and it also had to pay a proportion of the residue of its income.\n\nIn 1920 the Governors of Exeter School decided that it was no longer possible for them to continue the School without considerable assistance.  The Exeter Education Authority agreed to assist but only if the School came under its direct control so, in April 1921, control of the school was handed over to the City.  It then became a \"maintained\" school until 1929 when it became an \"aided\" school, thus regaining charge of its own finances under a newly appointed Governing Body.<ref>Bush, R.J.E.

In September 1976 the first \"[[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent]]\" pupils were admitted into the school.<ref>[http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/doc/1097%5Cmrdoc%5Cpdf%5Ca1097uab.pdf \"Study of Occupational Change\"], [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], 1972</ref>\n\nFrom 1979, the School participated in the [[Assisted Places Scheme]], taking over 200 pupils at its peak, but this scheme was abolished in 1997 and the last of these pupils left in the summer of 2004.<ref>[http://www.garfnet.org.uk/new_mill/summer97/exeter.htm \"Exeter Middle School's Cup Final\"], The New Millennium</ref> In 1981 the [[Sixth Form]] became coeducational.

There is an Alumni Office which opened in September 2013. It was set up to develop and foster lifelong relationships between the School and its past pupils and staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exeterschool.org.uk/alumni|title=Alumni - Exeter School website|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Academic standards==\nIn March 2014, the [[Independent Schools Inspectorate]] reported upon eight areas: the quality of the pupils' achievements and learning; the contribution of curricular and extra-curricular provision; the contribution of teaching; the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils; the contribution of arrangements for pastoral care; the contribution of arrangements for welfare, health and safety; the quality of governance; and the quality of leadership and management, including links with parents, carers and guardians.\n\nThe report concluded that the 7-18 co-educational day school was at the highest level, excellent, in each of the eight areas.\n\nThe team of nine reported that \"the quality of the pupils' achievements is excellent in their academic work and their activities.\" The ISI report continues: \"Teaching is excellent and promotes high quality learning. The broad curriculum enables pupils to have a wide range of experiences and the extra -curricular provision is extensive. Pupils achieve individual and team successes in a wide range of activities and national competitions.

She rose to prominence with her hit studio album ''Sweet Dream'' in 2002, and starred in well-received television series ''[[Successful Story of a Bright Girl]]'' (2002), ''[[My Love Patzzi]]'' (2002), ''[[Wedding (TV series)|Wedding]]'' (2005), ''My Bratty Princess'' (2005), ''[[Confession Couple]]'' (2017) and ''[[The Last Empress (TV series)|The Last Empress]]'' (2018-2019).\n\n==Early life and education==\nJang spent most of her childhood in her birthplace, [[Yeokchon-dong]], [[Eunpyeong District]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea. She appeared with her father, Ju Heo-seong, who is also an actor, in the play ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' in her primary school days, thus sparking her interest to become an actress. Jang also went on to become a model for television advertisements in her high school days before entering [[Chung-ang University]]'s Department of Theater, Faculty of Fine Arts where she majored in Theater and Film on March 2000. She graduated 10 years later, on February 19, 2010. The delay was due to her continuous work since her debut after she entered the university. She also received an alumni association award for her contributions to the university during the graduation rites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/02/12/2010021200277.html |title=Jang Na-ra to Finally Graduate from University |work=The Chosun Ilbo|date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=2016-06-12}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Music===\nJang made her debut in the entertainment world as a singer in May 2001.

Initially, it was not well received and only reached number 12 in Korean music charts. After starring in the popular [[sitcom]] ''[[Nonstop (TV series)|New Nonstop]]'', she became more well known and released the other tracks in the album such as her pop ballad style song, ''Confession'' and the ''April Story'', ranked at the top in various music charts.<ref name=\"soompi.com\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.soompi.com/2007/04/09/artist-of-the-week-jang-nara/#.U6ZbL6i7n9A |title=Artist of the week - Jang Nara |website=Soompi |date=9 April 2007 |accessdate=2016-06-12}}</ref> The album sold 300,000 copies.

Cahill in 1890 as the first free Diocesan Catholic [[high school]] for boys in the nation. It is also known as \"Boys Catholic High School\" or simply \"Roman.\" The school is located at the intersection of Broad and Vine Streets in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Archdiocese of Philadelphia]].\n\n===Founder===\nThomas E. Cahill born May 27, 1828 was the son of Thomas Cahill, a native of County Louth Ireland colloquially known as 'the Wee County' who came to America in 1817 and of Maria Elliott, daughter of one of the oldest colonial families of Delaware. His father was a railroad contractor, who suffered heavy reverses in his business and his mother died at the age of 36. Thomas left school to do his share towards the support of a large family. At the age of 17, he opened a little store in Philadelphia, located between Pine and Spruce Street on 26th at a wharf on the Schuylkill River.\n\nSuccessful from the start, with the proceeds of his first venture, he embarked in the wood, coal, and ice business, and later organized the Cold Spring Ice and Coal Company. In 1854 he became the first president. In 1869 he effected a consolidation of the large ice firms of the city, which were incorporated under the name of the famous brand of Knickerbocker Ice Company.\n\n===History===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nRoman Catholic was founded with funding provided by the estate of Thomas E. Cahill, a 19th-century Philadelphia merchant. He envisioned the need to create a school that offered a free [[Catholic education]] for boys, past their grammar school years. He died before he saw his vision come to life, however his wishes were followed and guided by his written will and his wife Sophia Cahill.  As such, Roman Catholic opened its doors in 1890 and offered a free education to boys. Due to increased costs of staff and facilities, free admission to the school ended in the 1960s.\n[[File:Roman Catholic High School 301 N. Broad Street.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The school in 2013]]\n\n===The Early Years===\nWhen Roman Catholic High School was dedicated on September 6, 1890 a total of 105 boys were selected for entrance into the new high school. Later only 26 students survived economic hardships and became members of the first graduating class in 1894.The percentage of graduates compared to the number who began as freshman was a little less than 25%. It was not until 34 years later in 1928 that one-half of those who started received diplomas. During the 95 years of its opening, a total of 16,228 students were graduated from Catholic High.\n\n===Crisis of the 1980s===\nIn 1985, the Archdiocese slated the school for closing due to lowering enrollment. However, the school's [[alumni association]], with the blessing of Philadelphia's [[John Krol|John Cardinal Krol]], embarked on a campaign to save the school. Roman's Alumni Association, which had existed for over 70 years, came together to raise funds and increase enrollment. The [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the school even applied to have the building itself kept as a historic landmark, which was accepted. The significance of the historic landmark designation means the building on the corner of Broad and Vine Streets can never legally be torn down. Also, its exterior must always stay the same \u2014 though it does not have to remain a school.\n\n===The \"New\" Roman Catholic High School===\nBefore 1986, students who attended Roman were from \"feeder [[parish]]es\"; Roman served as the school for the boys from the [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], [[Chinatown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Chinatown]], [[East Falls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|East Falls]], [[Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]], [[Manayunk, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Manayunk]], [[North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|North Philadelphia]], and [[Roxborough, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Roxborough]] regions of Philadelphia.\n\nToday, however, Roman enrolls boys from almost every [[List of Philadelphia neighborhoods|Philadelphia neighborhood]], including [[Northeast Philadelphia|The Near and Far Northeast]], [[West Philadelphia]], [[Fishtown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fishtown]], [[Port Richmond, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Port Richmond]], [[Mayfair, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Mayfair]], [[South Philadelphia|South Philly]], [[New Jersey]], Fox Chase, Roxborough, and the outlying suburbs.\n\nRoman Catholic High School was built to hold about 750 to 800 students. However, because of high demand, it is above capacity and holds closer to 1100. To select its students, the school holds an [[entrance examination|entrance test]] every October, November, and December. Of the 600 or 700 students that apply, only about 300 to 350 will be accepted. Students who do well on these tests also may receive scholarships ranging from a few hundred dollars to as much as $4000 a year. Usually, about 40 students receive scholarships.\n\nRoman, like other high schools, has a tracking system: that is, first track (also called honors track), second track, and third track. Roman, however, is unique in that it tracks its honors class into three classes. While students in the honors classes learn the same material at the same pace, it creates a better learning system to have students of the same level together.\n\nBeginning with the 2012\u20132013 school year, Roman announced the implementation of a 1:1 iPad initiative, starting with the incoming freshmen. Due to the ever-changing face of education, students require different tools and strategies. The initiative will allow students and teachers to individualize and differentiate instruction in a way that is familiar to today's students. Students will work on essential 21st century skill sets needed to meet state and national standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romancatholichs.com/index.php?task=news&view=yes&nid=191|title=Roman Catholic High School - News|publisher=Romancatholichs.com|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual abuse scandal===\n{{further|Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Philadelphia}}\nIn July 2011, ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]'' magazine published an article by Robert Huber regarding the [[Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Philadelphia#New grand jury in 2011|2011 grand jury report]], which documented new charges of child sexual abuse by priests active in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.

Roman's 1953 and 1997 additions are visible in the foreground, showing the contrast between the red brick facades and the marble facade of the original 1890 building.]]\nThe campus is composed of four facilities with the main building located on the northeast corner intersection of Broad and Vine Streets.\n\n'''Main Building-Original:'''\nDedicated on September 6, 1890. The footprint of the School's original building property established a main entrance on the frontage of North Broad Street.  The buildings' length was 140 feet and extended eastward on Vine Street for 115 feet bordered on the north with the very narrow Pearl Street and bounded eastward by a ten foot wide alley commonly known as Watts Street, rededicated to the school. The land was formerly a Railroad Depot that was moved just north to Cahowhill Street. The exterior is a three-story building of [[Victorian Gothic]] design, faced with \"[[Lee, Massachusetts]]\" marble (the same as selected for [[Philadelphia City Hall]]), placed on a granite base (quarried from [[Conshohocken, Pennsylvania]]) and sited to impact majestically at the intersection by prominent architect [[Edwin Forrest Durang]].  The building has two ornamental stone facades along Vine and Broad Streets joined at a square corner tower and two brick facades at the rear of the building. The building originally had a 150-foot marble tower topped in copper at the corner of Board and Vine, which was destroyed by fire in 1959 and not replaced.\n\nOriginally, there were 20 classrooms, each designed to accommodate between 24 and 42 pupils, the building contained offices, a library suite, mechanical arts workshops, and on the third floor, a hall with a 700-person seating capacity, a gymnasium, and studios with natural lighting for drawing and modeling. External fire towers provided access to lavatory facilities, but no provision was made for a lunchroom. The tower, not entirely ornamental, was fitted with instruments for astronomy classes.\n\nHistorically Certified in 1986 by the Historical Commission,<ref>https://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:327688#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=4&z=-0.3446%2C0.2334%2C1.8753%2C0.7463</ref><ref>https://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:327696#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.9584%2C0.164%2C2.702%2C1.0753</ref> it is classified as [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and consistent with a number of important Catholic churches and institutions in the City.\n\n'''Main Building-East Wing:'''\nIn 1953 the original three-story building received an additional two-story wing along the eastside. It connected and integrated the exterior brick fa\u00e7ade as part of the interior. The space was utilized for physics and biology labs and the cafeteria.<ref name=history/> in 1996 the school received permission form the Archdiocese to build a $3.5 million expansion to the school, which was funded by the many alumni, friends, and foundations who recognized the historical importance of sustaining a Catholic high school presence in Center City. This wing, which is dedicated as Renaissance Hall housed an expansion of the cafeteria, a new discipline office, one classroom, and an information center which housed the library, computer lab, and television studio (named after broadcaster [[John Facenda]]. an Alumni). Also during this project, the labs in the 1954 wing were completely gutted and remodeled with new technology, furniture, and equipment. The Library and Information Center was renovated in the summer of 2013 upgrading computers, copiers, printers and furniture named in honor of John and Mary McShain.\n\n'''Annex Building- 13th & Wood Street:'''\nIn 2006, the school opened an additional building acquired from the City which had historical significance related to the City's Medical Examiner. The 13th Street Annex was dedicated to James McSherry, an alumnus and benefactor to the school.<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/local/20090217_Philly_s_Roman_Catholic_High_receives_posthumous_gift.html/</ref> This new facility housed a sports training center, creative art studio, a multi-purpose room and the alumni association offices.\n \n'''Arts Building-Howard Center for the Arts:''' \nAs part of \"A Vision of Promise\u201d on May 30, 2017 the school held a breaking ground ceremony on an additional new building with anticipated completion sometime in 2018.<ref>http://catholicphilly.com/2017/06/news/local-news/roman-catholic-hs-to-expand-campus-with-new-arts-center/</ref> The initial stage is the construction of a 40,000-square foot building. The arts center is named for Barry and Elayne Howard, longtime supporters and benefactors of Roman Catholic. \nThis new expanded academic facility is located about a block away at 1212 Wood Street, and includes band rooms, instrument storage space, a computer-aided design lab, a digital photography studio, a piano lab, a small theater and an expansion for art programs. More additions to the school in the Vision of Promise are planned.<ref name=history>[http://www.romancatholichs.com/?pid=198#History \"History\"], romancatholichs.com; accessed August 17, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2016}}\n{{See also|High school sports}}\nRoman Catholic has been prominent in the [[Philadelphia Catholic League]] in [[basketball]] since the League's inception, winning 30 championship games since 1920. In 2015, 2016, and 2018 Catholic High won the Philadelphia Catholic league Title (PCL), Philadelphia City Title (District XII) and Pennsylvania Boys Class AAAA (Large School) State Championship.\n\nRoman has also had success in [[American football|football]]. In the 2006 playoffs, Roman finished with a strong 9\u20133 record while losing to [[La Salle College High School|La Salle]] in the second round of Catholic League playoffs. In 2007, Roman defeated Northeast Catholic, and Father Judge en route to a win in the Catholic League Championship, 10\u20139 over St. Joseph's Prep. This was Roman's best record ever at 12\u20132. This marks the team's second Red Division championship since the inception of the new Catholic League format, which began in 1999 and ended in 2007.\n\nRoman Catholic H.S. also has a rivalry with the public high school Roxborough High. This rivalry has started an annual Thanksgiving Day football game; a game Roman Catholic has beat Roxborough at for decades.\n\nBoys Catholic High School is home to one of the most successful [[sport rowing|crews]] in North America, practicing for over 10 months a year. Roman's crew team sculls (using two oars per man while rowing) rather than sweeps (using one oar a man while rowing). Recently it contributed a Lightweight Four to the Philadelphia Catholic League Rowing championships, finishing second in 2005 to Monsignor Bonner High School by six-tenths of a second. Roman's major sculling rivals are [[The Haverford School]], [[Conestoga High School]], and [[Malvern Preparatory School]]. In 2003 and 2005, two Roman students represented the [[United States]] at the Junior World Championships in Athens, Greece, & Brandenburg, Germany. In 2006, 2010, 2012, and 2016 the team won the Philadelphia Catholic League Championship.\n\nThe school's golf team has enjoyed many years of success as one of the top teams in the league.\n\nThe school's ice hockey team started in 1993. Since then, they have won 4 championships; 2000, 2002, 2010, and 2013.\n\nThe school's baseball team has won two Catholic League Championships; 1978 and 1992. The 1992 team had the best record in school history, finishing the season 15-1 (27-1 overall, losing only the final game of the regular season) after beating Bishop Kenrick in the Catholic League Championship game.\n\n==Rectors==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* Msgr.

Cahill in 1890 as the first free Diocesan Catholic [[high school]] for boys in the nation. It is also known as \"Boys Catholic High School\" or simply \"Roman.\" The school is located at the intersection of Broad and Vine Streets in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]], within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Archdiocese of Philadelphia]].\n\n===Founder===\nThomas E. Cahill born May 27, 1828 was the son of Thomas Cahill, a native of County Louth Ireland colloquially known as 'the Wee County' who came to America in 1817 and of Maria Elliott, daughter of one of the oldest colonial families of Delaware. His father was a railroad contractor, who suffered heavy reverses in his business and his mother died at the age of 36. Thomas left school to do his share towards the support of a large family. At the age of 17, he opened a little store in Philadelphia, located between Pine and Spruce Street on 26th at a wharf on the Schuylkill River.\n\nSuccessful from the start, with the proceeds of his first venture, he embarked in the wood, coal, and ice business, and later organized the Cold Spring Ice and Coal Company. In 1854 he became the first president. In 1869 he effected a consolidation of the large ice firms of the city, which were incorporated under the name of the famous brand of Knickerbocker Ice Company.\n\n===History===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nRoman Catholic was founded with funding provided by the estate of Thomas E. Cahill, a 19th-century Philadelphia merchant. He envisioned the need to create a school that offered a free [[Catholic education]] for boys, past their grammar school years. He died before he saw his vision come to life, however his wishes were followed and guided by his written will and his wife Sophia Cahill.  As such, Roman Catholic opened its doors in 1890 and offered a free education to boys. Due to increased costs of staff and facilities, free admission to the school ended in the 1960s.\n[[File:Roman Catholic High School 301 N. Broad Street.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The school in 2013]]\n\n===The Early Years===\nWhen Roman Catholic High School was dedicated on September 6, 1890 a total of 105 boys were selected for entrance into the new high school. Later only 26 students survived economic hardships and became members of the first graduating class in 1894.The percentage of graduates compared to the number who began as freshman was a little less than 25%. It was not until 34 years later in 1928 that one-half of those who started received diplomas. During the 95 years of its opening, a total of 16,228 students were graduated from Catholic High.\n\n===Crisis of the 1980s===\nIn 1985, the Archdiocese slated the school for closing due to lowering enrollment. However, the school's [[alumni association]], with the blessing of Philadelphia's [[John Krol|John Cardinal Krol]], embarked on a campaign to save the school. Roman's Alumni Association, which had existed for over 70 years, came together to raise funds and increase enrollment. The [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the school even applied to have the building itself kept as a historic landmark, which was accepted. The significance of the historic landmark designation means the building on the corner of Broad and Vine Streets can never legally be torn down. Also, its exterior must always stay the same \u2014 though it does not have to remain a school.\n\n===The \"New\" Roman Catholic High School===\nBefore 1986, students who attended Roman were from \"feeder [[parish]]es\"; Roman served as the school for the boys from the [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], [[Chinatown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Chinatown]], [[East Falls, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|East Falls]], [[Fairmount, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fairmount]], [[Manayunk, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Manayunk]], [[North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|North Philadelphia]], and [[Roxborough, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Roxborough]] regions of Philadelphia.\n\nToday, however, Roman enrolls boys from almost every [[List of Philadelphia neighborhoods|Philadelphia neighborhood]], including [[Northeast Philadelphia|The Near and Far Northeast]], [[West Philadelphia]], [[Fishtown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Fishtown]], [[Port Richmond, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Port Richmond]], [[Mayfair, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Mayfair]], [[South Philadelphia|South Philly]], [[New Jersey]], Fox Chase, Roxborough, and the outlying suburbs.\n\nRoman Catholic High School was built to hold about 750 to 800 students. However, because of high demand, it is above capacity and holds closer to 1100. To select its students, the school holds an [[entrance examination|entrance test]] every October, November, and December. Of the 600 or 700 students that apply, only about 300 to 350 will be accepted. Students who do well on these tests also may receive scholarships ranging from a few hundred dollars to as much as $4000 a year. Usually, about 40 students receive scholarships.\n\nRoman, like other high schools, has a tracking system: that is, first track (also called honors track), second track, and third track. Roman, however, is unique in that it tracks its honors class into three classes. While students in the honors classes learn the same material at the same pace, it creates a better learning system to have students of the same level together.\n\nBeginning with the 2012-2013 school year, Roman announced the implementation of a 1:1 iPad initiative, starting with the incoming freshmen. Due to the ever-changing face of education, students require different tools and strategies. The initiative will allow students and teachers to individualize and differentiate instruction in a way that is familiar to today's students. Students will work on essential 21st century skill sets needed to meet state and national standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romancatholichs.com/index.php?task=news&view=yes&nid=191|title=Roman Catholic High School - News|publisher=Romancatholichs.com|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual abuse scandal===\n{{further|Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Philadelphia}}\nIn July 2011, ''[[Philadelphia (magazine)|Philadelphia]]'' magazine published an article by Robert Huber regarding the [[Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Philadelphia#New grand jury in 2011|2011 grand jury report]], which documented new charges of child sexual abuse by priests active in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.

Roman's 1953 and 1997 additions are visible in the foreground, showing the contrast between the red brick facades and the marble facade of the original 1890 building.]]\nThe campus is composed of four facilities with the main building located on the northeast corner intersection of Broad and Vine Streets.\n\n'''Main Building-Original:'''\nDedicated on September 6, 1890. The footprint of the School's original building property established a main entrance on the frontage of North Broad Street.  The buildings' length was 140 feet and extended eastward on Vine Street for 115 feet bordered on the north with the very narrow Pearl Street and bounded eastward by a ten foot wide alley commonly known as Watts Street, rededicated to the school. The land was formerly a Railroad Depot that was moved just north to Cahowhill Street. The exterior is a three story building of [[Victorian Gothic]] design, faced with \"[[Lee, Massachusetts]]\" marble (the same as selected for [[Philadelphia City Hall]]), placed on a granite base (quarried from [[Conshohocken, Pennsylvania]]) and sited to impact majestically at the intersection by prominent architect [[Edwin Forrest Durang]].  The building has two ornamental stone facades along Vine and Broad Streets joined at a square corner tower and two brick facades at the rear of the building. The building originally had a 150-foot marble tower topped in copper at the corner of Board and Vine, which was destroyed by fire in 1959 and not replaced.\n\nOriginally, there were 20 classrooms, each designed to accommodate between 24 and 42 pupils, the building contained offices, a library suite, mechanical arts workshops, and on the third floor, a hall with a 700-person seating capacity, a gymnasium, and studios with natural lighting for drawing and modeling. External fire towers provided access to lavatory facilities, but no provision was made for a lunchroom. The tower, not entirely ornamental, was fitted with instruments for astronomy classes.\n\nHistorically Certified in 1986 by the Historical Commission,<ref>https://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:327688#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=4&z=-0.3446%2C0.2334%2C1.8753%2C0.7463</ref><ref>https://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:327696#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.9584%2C0.164%2C2.702%2C1.0753</ref> it is classified as [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and consistent with a number of important Catholic churches and institutions in the City.\n\n'''Main Building-East Wing:'''\nIn 1953 the original three-story building received an additional two-story wing along the eastside. It connected and integrated the exterior brick fa\u00e7ade as part of the interior. The space was utilized for physics and biology labs and the cafeteria.<ref name=history/> in 1996 the school received permission form the Archdiocese to build a $3.5 million expansion to the school, which was funded by the many alumni, friends, and foundations who recognized the historical importance of sustaining a Catholic high school presence in Center City. This wing, which is dedicated as Renaissance Hall housed an expansion of the cafeteria, a new discipline office, one classroom, and an information center which housed the library, computer lab, and television studio (named after broadcaster [[John Facenda]]. an Alumni). Also during this project, the labs in the 1954 wing were completely gutted and remodeled with new technology, furniture, and equipment. The Library and Information Center was renovated in the summer of 2013 upgrading computers, copiers, printers and furniture named in honor of John and Mary McShain.\n\n'''Annex Building- 13th & Wood Street:'''\nIn 2006, the school opened an additional building acquired from the City which had historical significance related to the City's Medical Examiner. The 13th Street Annex was dedicated to James McSherry, an alumnus and benefactor to the school.<ref>https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/local/20090217_Philly_s_Roman_Catholic_High_receives_posthumous_gift.html/</ref> This new facility housed a sports training center, creative art studio, a multi-purpose room and the alumni association offices.\n \n'''Arts Building-Howard Center for the Arts:''' \nAs part of \"A Vision of Promise\u201d on May 30, 2017 the school held a breaking ground ceremony on an additional new building with anticipated completion sometime in 2018.<ref>http://catholicphilly.com/2017/06/news/local-news/roman-catholic-hs-to-expand-campus-with-new-arts-center/</ref> The initial stage is the construction of a 40,000-square foot building. The arts center is named for Barry and Elayne Howard, longtime supporters and benefactors of Roman Catholic. \nThis new expanded academic facility is located about a block away at 1212 Wood Street, and includes band rooms, instrument storage space, a computer-aided design lab, a digital photography studio, a piano lab, a small theater and an expansion for art programs. More additions to the school in the Vision of Promise are planned.<ref name=history>[http://www.romancatholichs.com/?pid=198#History \"History\"], romancatholichs.com; accessed August 17, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2016}}\n{{See also|High school sports}}\nRoman Catholic has been prominent in the [[Philadelphia Catholic League]] in [[basketball]] since the League's inception, winning 30 championship games since 1920. In 2015, 2016, and 2018 Catholic High won the Philadelphia Catholic league Title (PCL), Philadelphia City Title (District XII) and Pennsylvania Boys Class AAAA (Large School) State Championship.\n\nRoman has also had success in [[American football|football]]. In the 2006 playoffs, Roman finished with a strong 9-3 record while losing to [[La Salle College High School|La Salle]] in the second round of Catholic League playoffs. In 2007, Roman defeated Northeast Catholic, and Father Judge en route to a win in the Catholic League Championship, 10-9 over St. Joseph's Prep. This was Roman's best record ever at 12-2. This marks the team's second Red Division championship since the inception of the new Catholic League format, which began in 1999 and ended in 2007.\n\nRoman Catholic H.S. also has a rivalry with the public high school Roxborough High. This rivalry has started an annual Thanksgiving Day football game; a game Roman Catholic has beat Roxborough at for decades.\n\nBoys Catholic High School is home to one of the most successful [[sport rowing|crews]] in North America, practicing for over 10 months a year. Roman's crew team sculls (using two oars per man while rowing) rather than sweeps (using one oar a man while rowing). Recently it contributed a Lightweight Four to the Philadelphia Catholic League Rowing championships, finishing second in 2005 to Monsignor Bonner High School by six-tenths of a second. Roman's major sculling rivals are [[The Haverford School]], [[Conestoga High School]], and [[Malvern Preparatory School]]. In 2003 and 2005, two Roman students represented the [[United States]] at the Junior World Championships in Athens, Greece, & Brandenburg, Germany. In 2006, 2010, 2012, and 2016 the team won the Philadelphia Catholic League Championship.\n\nThe school's golf team has enjoyed many years of success as one of the top teams in the league.\n\nThe school's ice hockey team started in 1993. Since then, they have won 4 championships; 2000, 2002, 2010, and 2013.\n\nThe school\u2019s baseball team has won two Catholic League Championships; 1978 and 1992. The 1992 team had the best record in school history, finishing the season 15-1 (27-1 overall, losing only the final game of the regular season) after beating Bishop Kenrick in the Catholic League Championship game.\n\n==Rectors==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* Msgr.
