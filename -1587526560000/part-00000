The village was returned to German hands in 1963.]]\nAt the end of [[World War II]], plans were made in the [[Netherlands]] to '''annex German territory''' as compensation for the damages caused by the war. In October 1945, the Dutch state asked [[Germany]] for 25 billion [[guilder]]s in [[War reparations|reparations]]. In February 1945 it had already been established at the [[Yalta Conference]] that reparations would not be given in monetary form. The plan which was worked out in most detail was the one made by {{ill|Frits Bakker Schut|nl}}, and hence became known as the '''Bakker-Schut Plan'''.\n\nIn its most ambitious form, this plan included the cities of [[Cologne]], [[Aachen]], [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], and would have enlarged the country's European area by 30 to 50 percent. The local population had to be either deported, or, when still speaking the original [[Low German]] dialects, [[Batavianization|Dutchified]]. The plan was largely dropped after U.S. dismissal of it. Eventually, an area of a total size of {{cvt|69|km2}} was allocated to the Netherlands. Almost all of this was returned to [[West Germany]] in 1963 after Germany paid the Netherlands 280 million [[Deutschmark|German marks]].\n\nMany Germans living in the Netherlands were declared \"enemy subjects\" after World War II ended and put into an internment camp in an operation called [[Operation Black Tulip|Black Tulip]]. A total of 3,691 Germans were ultimately deported.\n\n==Liberation==\nIn the first year following the liberation of the Netherlands in May 1945, dozens of pamphlets and brochures were published that propagated annexation of territory of the former [[German Reich]], preferably without the accompanying German population. Several highly placed persons, including then [[Foreign Minister]] [[Eelco van Kleffens|Eelco Nicolaas van Kleffens]], put forth their own ideas regarding annexation in these publications. Opinions varied widely as to how much territory should be annexed. Some people only wanted a few border corrections, others drew the new border past [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe proponents of annexation joined in several local committees. On 19 June 1945, the [[The Hague|Hague]] committee to examine the question of Dutch territorial expansion was founded. During a meeting of this committee on 12 July 1945, it was decided to split the committee in the ''Study Group Territorial Expansion'' (Studiegroep Gebiedsuitbreiding), chaired by Ph.J. Idenburg, and the ''Action Committee'' (Comit\u00e9 van Actie), which had as its primary function the education of the Dutch population about the expansion plans. \n\nSix days later, the latter committee was renamed the ''Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion''. It was chaired by former [[Finance minister]] [[Johannes van den Broek]]. On 25 August 1945, Minister Van Kleffens founded the ''State Commission for the Study of the Annexation Question'', which was charged with writing a final report regarding the annexation question by May 1946.\n\nThe Study Group Territorial Expansion set up many groups that reported about their findings. The final judgment of the State Commission would be largely based on the results of this study group. The Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion published on the progress of the study group by giving out brochures and giving lectures. The annexation question however led to intense discussions, which lead certain groups to go their own way and among other things found the Annexation Committee of the Foundation for Agriculture.\n\n==Bakker Schut Plan==\nBakker Schut was the president of the National service for the National Plan, secretary of the Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion, and a member of the State Commission for the Study of the Annexation Question and of the Study Group Territorial Expansion. In his expansion plan, he suggested to annex a large part of northwestern Germany. All the land west of the line [[Wilhelmshaven]]-[[Osnabr\u00fcck]]-[[Hamm]]-[[Wesel]] would be added to the Netherlands, as well as the land east of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], where the border followed the [[Rhine]] until close to [[Cologne]], then diverging towards [[Aachen]] in the west. \n\nIn the A Variation of the plan, among others the large cities of Aachen, Cologne, [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Oldenburg]] and Osnabr\u00fcck were annexed. Bakker Schut called this the [[Weser River|Weser border]] and ended his writings with the slogan ''Nederland's grens kome aan de Wezer'' (The border of the Netherlands be at the Weser). In a smaller plan B, the west-[[Rhineland]] cities Cologne, [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]] and [[Neuss]] were not annexed. In a third option, plan C, the proposed annexation was much smaller.

Hence, he justified the annexation using arguments like increased power and greater security for the Dutch state. He furthermore considered the annexation as compensation for war damages and as a part of the population policy to be followed. Contrary to what might be expected, after an inventory he considered the natural resources of the territory to be annexed as insufficiently important to motivate annexation. In his view, even a transfer of the entire [[Ruhr Area]] would not be sufficient to pay for the damages.\n\n===Forced migration===\nA big point of discussion in Bakker Schut's expansion plan was the proposed forced migration of the original German population. Millions of Germans would have to be expelled to the remaining German territories, ostensibly because it was feared that increasing the Dutch population from 9 to 11 million people could cause trouble in providing everybody with food. \n\nA pamphlet titled ''Oostland - Ons Land'' (East land - Our land) contained a complete schedule for the expulsion of the population, starting with all inhabitants of municipalities with a population of at least 2,500, all former members of the [[NSDAP]] and related organizations, and all inhabitants who had settled in the area after 1933. In special cases, the inhabitants could request to be [[naturalization|naturalized]], for instance if they had made efforts for the Dutch state during the war, if they usually spoke [[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]] instead of [[High German]], if they had no family members up to the second degree that lived in Germany, or if they wished to become Dutch.\n\n<!-- Almost all these names are and were existing Low German and/or Dutch place names (Monniken-Glaabbeek may be an exception); they were not invented for the annexation plan as suggested by including it here in this article\n===Dutch names===\nIt was also already determined which Dutch names the cities and areas in the territory to be annexed would get.

Van Kleffens promoted territorial expansion, while Minister of Social Affairs [[Willem Drees]] (later [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]]) was dead set against it. Generally, [[socialists]] were against annexation and [[Protestants]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]] were reluctant. The [[Catholics]] saw advantages in the territorial expansion, mainly as a method to give the farmers near the border more room, and because the German territories to be annexed were predominantly Catholic, so that remaining inhabitants would have increased the percentage of Catholics in the Netherlands. \n\nDutch churches objected to the proposed mass expulsion, because in their eyes the German population could not be found guilty of the crimes of the [[Nazis]] during World War II. Prime Minister [[Wim Schermerhorn]] was also not in favor of annexing German territory, but [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]], an energetic supporter of the annexation plan, strongly urged him to start negotiating on this with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In 1946, in the name of the Dutch government, he officially claimed {{cvt|4,980|km2}} of German territory, which was not even half of the area envisioned by Van Kleffens. The Dutch-German border would be drawn from [[Vaals]] via [[Winterswijk]] to the [[Ems River]], so that 550,000 Germans would live inside the Dutch national borders.\n\n==Implementation==\nIn 1947, the planned large-scale annexation was rejected by the [[Allied High Commission]], on the grounds that Germany already contained [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|14,000,000 refugees from the annexations in the east]] and that the remaining territory could not handle more refugees. Furthermore, the allies (in particular the Americans) considered it vital to have a stable West Germany in view of the coming [[Cold War]].\n\nAt a conference of foreign ministers of the western allied occupation forces in London (14 January until 25 February 1947), the Dutch government (Cabinet Beel I) claimed an area of {{Convert|1,840|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. This claim included, apart from the island of [[Borkum]], large parts of the Emsland, Bentheim, the cities of [[Ahaus]], [[Rees, Germany|Rees]], [[Kleve]], [[Erkelenz]], [[Geilenkirchen]], and [[Heinsberg]]; and the areas around these cities.\n\nIn 1946, about 160,000 people lived in this area, of whom more than 90% spoke German. This plan was a very simplified version of the C-variation of the Bakker-Schut Plan. The [[Catholic People's Party|KVP]] considered this proposal much too small, while the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|CPN]] rejected any kind of reparations in the form of territorial expansion.\n\nThe London conference of 23 April 1949 only permitted some less far-reaching border modifications. At 12 noon that day, Dutch troops moved to occupy an area of {{Convert|69|km2|acre|abbr=on}}, the largest parts of which were [[Elten]] (near [[Emmerich am Rhein]]) and [[Selfkant]]. Many other small border corrections were executed, mostly in the vicinity of [[Arnhem]] and [[Dinxperlo]]. At that time, these areas were inhabited by a total of almost 10,000 people.\n\n===Overview of areas annexed in 1949 (from north to south)===\n*Uninhabited areas ({{cvt|0.3|km2}}) between [[Nieuweschans]] and [[Ter Apel]]\n*Uninhabited areas on both sides of the [[Channel Almelo-Nordhorn]] ({{cvt|0.3|km2}})\n*Area near [[Losser]], 18 inhabitants ({{cvt|1|km2}})\n*Small border road near [[Rekken]] south of [[Haaksbergen]]\n*Uninhabited area near Kotten ({{cvt|0.09|km2}})\n*[[Suderwick]], small village bordering on [[Dinxperlo]], 342 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.64|km2}})\n*[[Elten]], small town on the Rhine, 3,235 inhabitants ({{cvt|19.54|km2}})\n*Small border road near [[Millingen aan de Rijn]]\n*[[Duivelsberg/Wylerberg]] between [[Beek, Ubbergen|Beek]] and [[Wijlerberg]]\n* [[Neutraleweg|Border road]] near [[Mook en Middelaar|Mook]];\n* Uninhabited area near [[Ottersum]] ({{cvt|0.05|km2}});\n* Border road near [[Siebengewald]], four inhabitants;\n* Two areas north and south of [[Arcen]], sixty inhabitants ({{cvt|0.4|and|0.41|km2}})\n* Area near [[Sittard]] of {{cvt|41.34|km2}} inhabited by 5,665 people ([[Selfkant]], governed under the name of its main village Tudderen);\n* Border road near [[Ubach over Worms]];\n* Area near [[Rimburg]] and [[Kerkrade]], 130 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.88|km2}});\n* Fixed some border-technical mistakes in Kerkrade\n* Area near [[Eijgelshoven]], 110 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.11|km2}})\n\n==Return==\nStarting in March 1957, West Germany negotiated the return of these areas with the Netherlands. These negotiations led to an agreement ({{lang-de|Vertrag vom 8.

The village was returned to German hands in 1963.]]\nAt the end of [[World War II]], plans were made in the [[Netherlands]] to '''annex German territory''' as compensation for the damages caused by the war. In October 1945, the Dutch state asked [[Germany]] for 25 billion [[guilder]]s in [[War reparations|reparations]]. In February 1945 it had already been established at the [[Yalta Conference]] that reparations would not be given in monetary form. The plan which was worked out in most detail was the one made by {{ill|Frits Bakker Schut|nl}}, and hence became known as the '''Bakker-Schut Plan'''.\n\nIn its most ambitious form, this plan included the cities of [[Cologne]], [[Aachen]], [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], and would have enlarged the country's European area by 30 to 50 percent. The local population had to be either deported, or, when still speaking the original [[Low German]] dialects, [[Batavianization|Dutchified]]. The plan was largely dropped after U.S. dismissal of it. Eventually, an area of a total size of {{cvt|69|km2}} was allocated to the Netherlands. Almost all of this was returned to [[West Germany]] in 1963 after Germany paid the Netherlands 280 million [[Deutschmark|German marks]].\n\nMany Germans living in the Netherlands were declared \"enemy subjects\" after World War II ended and put into an internment camp in an operation called [[Operation Black Tulip|Black Tulip]]. A total of 3,691 Germans were ultimately deported.\n\n==Liberation==\nIn the first year following the liberation of the Netherlands in May 1945, dozens of pamphlets and brochures were published that propagated annexation of territory of the former [[German Reich]], preferably without the accompanying German population. Several highly placed persons, including then [[Foreign Minister]] [[Eelco van Kleffens|Eelco Nicolaas van Kleffens]], put forth their own ideas regarding annexation in these publications. Opinions varied widely as to how much territory should be annexed. Some people only wanted a few border corrections, others drew the new border past [[Hamburg]].\n\nThe proponents of annexation joined in several local committees. On 19 June 1945, the [[The Hague|Hague]] committee to examine the question of Dutch territorial expansion was founded. During a meeting of this committee on 12 July 1945, it was decided to split the committee in the ''Study Group Territorial Expansion'' (Studiegroep Gebiedsuitbreiding), chaired by Ph.J. Idenburg, and the ''Action Committee'' (Comit\u00e9 van Actie), which had as its primary function the education of the Dutch population about the expansion plans. \n\nSix days later, the latter committee was renamed the ''Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion''. It was chaired by former [[Finance minister]] [[Johannes van den Broek]]. On 25 August 1945, Minister Van Kleffens founded the ''State Commission for the Study of the Annexation Question'', which was charged with writing a final report regarding the annexation question by May 1946.\n\nThe Study Group Territorial Expansion set up many groups that reported about their findings. The final judgment of the State Commission would be largely based on the results of this study group. The Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion published on the progress of the study group by giving out brochures and giving lectures. The annexation question however led to intense discussions, which lead certain groups to go their own way and among other things found the Annexation Committee of the Foundation for Agriculture.\n\n==Bakker Schut Plan==\nBakker Schut was the president of the National service for the National Plan, secretary of the Dutch Committee for Territorial Expansion, and a member of the State Commission for the Study of the Annexation Question and of the Study Group Territorial Expansion. In his expansion plan, he suggested to annex a large part of northwestern Germany. All the land west of the line [[Wilhelmshaven]]-[[Osnabr\u00fcck]]-[[Hamm]]-[[Wesel]] would be added to the Netherlands, as well as the land east of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], where the border followed the [[Rhine]] until close to [[Cologne]], then diverging towards [[Aachen]] in the west. \n\nIn the A Variation of the plan, among others the large cities of Aachen, Cologne, [[M\u00fcnster]], [[Oldenburg]] and Osnabr\u00fcck were annexed. Bakker Schut called this the [[Weser River|Weser border]] and ended his writings with the slogan ''Nederland's grens kome aan de Wezer'' (The border of the Netherlands be at the Weser). In a smaller plan B, the west-[[Rhineland]] cities Cologne, [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]] and [[Neuss]] were not annexed. In a third option, plan C, the proposed annexation was much smaller. It included an area west of [[Varel]], the entire [[Emsland]], and the area around [[Wesel]] until near the [[Duchy of Cleves]].\n\n===Areas to be annexed===\n[[Image:Bakker Schut-plan.PNG|right|thumb|500px|The '''Bakker-Schut Plan'''.

In special cases, the inhabitants could request to be [[naturalization|naturalized]], for instance if they had made efforts for the Dutch state during the war, if they usually spoke [[Low Saxon languages|Low Saxon]] instead of [[High German]], if they had no family members up to the second degree that lived in Germany, or if they wished to become Dutch.\n\n<!-- Almost all these names are and were existing Low German and/or Dutch place names (Monniken-Glaabbeek may be an exception); they were not invented for the annexation plan as suggested by including it here in this article\n===Dutch names===\nIt was also already determined which Dutch names the cities and areas in the territory to be annexed would get. The table below gives a small sample of the suggested name changes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n!'''Suggested names'''\n!'''Original German names'''\n |-\n |Aken\n |[[Aachen]]\n |-\n |Emmelkamp\n |[[Emlichheim]]\n |-\n |Emmerik\n |[[Emmerich am Rhein|Emmerich]]\n |-\n |Geelkerken\n |[[Geilenkirchen]]\n |-\n |Gelderen\n |[[Geldern]]\n |-\n |Gogh\n |[[Goch]]\n |-\n |Gulik\n |[[J\u00fclich]]\n |-\n |Hoog Elten\n |[[Elten|Hoch-Elten]]\n |-\n |Jemmingen\n |[[Jemgum]]\n |-\n |Kleef\n |[[Kleve]]\n |-\n |Keulen\n |[[Keulen|K\u00f6ln]]\n |-\n |Meurs\n |[[Moers]]\n |-\n |Monniken-Glaabbeek\n |[[M\u00f6nchengladbach]]\n |-\n |Munster\n |[[M\u00fcnster]]\n |-\n |Neder-Benthem\n |[[Bad Bentheim]]\n |-\n |Nieuwenhuis\n |[[Neuenhaus]]\n |-\n |Noordhoorn\n |[[Nordhorn]]\n |-\n |Osnabrugge\n |[[Osnabr\u00fcck]]\n |-\n |Veldhuizen\n |[[Veldhausen]]\n |-\n |Wezel\n |[[Wesel]]\n |-\n |Zelfkant\n |[[Selfkant]]\n |-\n |Zwilbroek\n |[[Zwillbrock]]\n|\n-->\n==Dispute==\nIn the Dutch cabinet, a dispute about the annexation question arose. Van Kleffens promoted territorial expansion, while Minister of Social Affairs [[Willem Drees]] (later [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]]) was dead set against it. Generally, [[socialists]] were against annexation and [[Protestants]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]] were reluctant. The [[Catholics]] saw advantages in the territorial expansion, mainly as a method to give the farmers near the border more room, and because the German territories to be annexed were predominantly Catholic, so that remaining inhabitants would have increased the percentage of Catholics in the Netherlands. \n\nDutch churches objected to the proposed mass expulsion, because in their eyes the German population could not be found guilty of the crimes of the [[Nazis]] during World War II. Prime Minister [[Wim Schermerhorn]] was also not in favor of annexing German territory, but [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]], an energetic supporter of the annexation plan, strongly urged him to start negotiating on this with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In 1946, in the name of the Dutch government, he officially claimed {{cvt|4,980|km2}} of German territory, which was not even half of the area envisioned by Van Kleffens. The Dutch-German border would be drawn from [[Vaals]] via [[Winterswijk]] to the [[Ems River]], so that 550,000 Germans would live inside the Dutch national borders.\n\n==Implementation==\nIn 1947, the planned large-scale annexation was rejected by the [[Allied High Commission]], on the grounds that Germany already contained [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|14,000,000 refugees from the annexations in the east]] and that the remaining territory could not handle more refugees. Furthermore, the allies (in particular the Americans) considered it vital to have a stable West Germany in view of the coming [[Cold War]].\n\nAt a conference of foreign ministers of the western allied occupation forces in London (14 January until 25 February 1947), the Dutch government (Cabinet Beel I) claimed an area of {{Convert|1,840|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. This claim included, apart from the island of [[Borkum]], large parts of the Emsland, Bentheim, the cities of [[Ahaus]], [[Rees, Germany|Rees]], [[Kleve]], [[Erkelenz]], [[Geilenkirchen]], and [[Heinsberg]]; and the areas around these cities.\n\nIn 1946, about 160,000 people lived in this area, of whom more than 90% spoke German. This plan was a very simplified version of the C-variation of the Bakker-Schut Plan. The [[Catholic People's Party|KVP]] considered this proposal much too small, while the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|CPN]] rejected any kind of reparations in the form of territorial expansion.\n\nThe London conference of 23 April 1949 only permitted some less far-reaching border modifications. At 12 noon that day, Dutch troops moved to occupy an area of {{Convert|69|km2|acre|abbr=on}}, the largest parts of which were [[Elten]] (near [[Emmerich am Rhein]]) and [[Selfkant]]. Many other small border corrections were executed, mostly in the vicinity of [[Arnhem]] and [[Dinxperlo]]. At that time, these areas were inhabited by a total of almost 10,000 people.\n\n===Overview of areas annexed in 1949 (from north to south)===\n*Uninhabited areas ({{cvt|0.3|km2}}) between [[Nieuweschans]] and [[Ter Apel]]\n*Uninhabited areas on both sides of the [[Channel Almelo-Nordhorn]] ({{cvt|0.3|km2}})\n*Area near [[Losser]], 18 inhabitants ({{cvt|1|km2}})\n*Small border road near [[Rekken]] south of [[Haaksbergen]]\n*Uninhabited area near Kotten ({{cvt|0.09|km2}})\n*[[Suderwick]], small village bordering on [[Dinxperlo]], 342 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.64|km2}})\n*[[Elten]], small town on the Rhine, 3,235 inhabitants ({{cvt|19.54|km2}})\n*Small border road near [[Millingen aan de Rijn]]\n*[[Duivelsberg/Wylerberg]] between [[Beek, Ubbergen|Beek]] and [[Wijlerberg]]\n* [[Neutraleweg|Border road]] near [[Mook en Middelaar|Mook]];\n* Uninhabited area near [[Ottersum]] ({{cvt|0.05|km2}});\n* Border road near [[Siebengewald]], four inhabitants;\n* Two areas north and south of [[Arcen]], sixty inhabitants ({{cvt|0.4|and|0.41|km2}})\n* Area near [[Sittard]] of {{cvt|41.34|km2}} inhabited by 5,665 people ([[Selfkant]], governed under the name of its main village Tudderen);\n* Border road near [[Ubach over Worms]];\n* Area near [[Rimburg]] and [[Kerkrade]], 130 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.88|km2}});\n* Fixed some border-technical mistakes in Kerkrade\n* Area near [[Eijgelshoven]], 110 inhabitants ({{cvt|0.11|km2}})\n\n==Return==\nStarting in March 1957, West Germany negotiated the return of these areas with the Netherlands. These negotiations led to an agreement ({{lang-de|Vertrag vom 8.

This also meant that their counterparts, the male lovers, also stopped performing in masks.

Frye, the prestigious and stylish boot maker; Rockport, a company known for its sporting and casual shoes; and [[Ellesse]], an Italian company known for making expensive athletic shoes and clothing. Later acquisitions included [[Boston Whaler]] and The Hockey Company ([[CCM (ice hockey)|CCM]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/reebok-to-buy-ccm-jofa-koho-brands-in-329-million-us-takeover-1.474982|title=Reebok to buy CCM, Jofa, Koho brands in $329 million US takeover|last=|first=|date=April 8, 2004|website=CBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

He worked diligently to improve human rights worldwide. In 1986, Reebok became one of the first companies to pull out of South Africa because of the country's practice of [[apartheid]] and two years later Reebok sponsored the Amnesty International Human Rights Now tour. Fireman subsequently established the annual Reebok Human Rights Awards in 1988 recognizing activists under the age of 30 who exposed and reduced human rights atrocities.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fireman|first=Paul|title=From the Pain Come the Dream: The Recipients of the Reebok Human Rights Award|publisher=Umbrage|year=2003|isbn=1884167357|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFireman sold Reebok to [[Adidas]] in 2005.<ref name=\"healy\">{{cite news|last1=Healy|first1=Beth|title=Paul Fireman takes another shot|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2011/06/10/reebok_founder_fireman_returns_to_sneaker_business_with_20m_stake_in_colorado_firm/|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=10 June 2011}}</ref> He is currently the Chairman of Fireman Capital Partners, a Boston-based, consumer-focused private equity firm founded in 2008 with his son Dan, the firm\u2019s Managing Partner.<ref name=\"healy\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firemancapital.com/team/dan-fireman/|title=Dan Fireman {{!}} Fireman Capital Partners {{!}} Boston Massachusetts|website=www.firemancapital.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \n\n==Golf Course Development==\n\nFireman has been active in golf course development and in 1991 he purchased Willowbend Country Club ([[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee, MA]]). The development of additional courses followed that included Rio Mar Resort and Country Club ([[Puerto Rico]]), Costa Caribe Golf and Country Club (Puerto Rico), Coco Beach Golf and Country Club (Puerto Rico), The Ranch Golf Club ([[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick, MA]]), and Starr Pass Club ([[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson, AZ]]).<ref name=\"rynecki\" />\n[[File:Liberty-National-Golf-Course-e1575328328742.jpg|thumb|LIberty National Golf Course with a view of the 18th hole and clubhouse. Lower Manhattan with the Freedom Tower is in the background. ]]\n[[Liberty National Golf Club]] ([[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City, NJ]]) is Fireman\u2019s most impressive foray in to the world of golf. In 1995 Fireman purchased a mile of neglected and decaying New Jersey shoreline along the Hudson River that was an eyesore. The land the Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, and a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods. However, the land when Fireman originally toured the site was \u201ca toxic moonscape of corroded oil tanks, contaminated soil, and rusting warehouses.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/24/golf-barclays-pga-lifestyle-sports-golf-liberty-national.html|title=Inside A $250 Million Golf Course|last=Bertoni|first=Steven|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \u201cI loved the site and the historical value with the Statue of Liberty, and the city, and it was on the water,\u201d Fireman says. \u201cI just plunged into it because I thought it would be a phenomenal golf site and improve the world.

Liberty National also hosts junior golf tournaments, the First Tee of New Jersey, and local high school golf teams from Jersey City practice and play their home matches at the course.  \n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nThe Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation was created in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=www.ppffound.org/about/|title=The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since its inception, the foundation has distributed over $165 million to charitable organizations with a focus primarily on improving the communities of both Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nAddressing homelessness has been a major initiative of the foundation. One Family Inc. was created to preventing family homelessness through advocacy, education, and innovation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=www.onefamilyinc.org|title=One Family, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Using a multi-pronged approach, One Family advocates for public policies that will increase affordable housing and provide services to families experiencing or who are at risk for homelessness with an aim to promote permanent solutions to homelessness. The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Foundation also joined with other donors to create Home Funders, a collaborative fund that finances very affordable rental housing for low-income families in Massachusetts.\n\nFireman is a strong supporter of [[The First Tee]] whose mission is to impact the lives of young people by providing educational programs that build character, instill life-enhancing values and promote healthy habits through the game of golf.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/The_First_Tee/Fireman_Donation/prweb12989117.htm|title=Paul and Dan Fireman Show Support For The First Tee Chapters of New Jersey With a Unique Donation|website=PRWeb|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.hunter-pr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TFT-NJ-Mentees.pdf|title=Paul Fireman Meets Mentees from New Jersey First Tee Chapters|date=May 12, 2016|work=Hunter Public Relations|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping through the United States, the Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation rapidly acted in March 2020 by making impactful donations to the Massachusetts COVID-19 Relief Fund<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macovid19relieffund.org/|title=Massachusetts COVID-19 Relief Fund|website=www.macovid19relieffund.org|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>, the Boston Resiliency Fund<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.gov/departments/treasury/boston-resiliency-fund|title=Boston Resiliency Fund|date=2020-03-16|website=Boston.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>, the Jersey City COVID-19 Response Fund, and the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund. \n[[File:Paul and Phyllis Fireman after donating Bullard Thermal Imaging Cameras to the Brockton City Firefighters.jpg|thumb|Paul and Phyllis Fireman after donating Bullard Thermal Imaging Cameras to the Brockton City Fire Department in 2000. |alt=]]\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe Academy of Achievement\u2019s Golden Plate Award, 1987\n\nThurgood Marshall Corporate Leadership Award\n\nNortheastern University Commencement Speaker and Honorary Degree, Doctor of Humanities, 1990<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.northeastern.edu/services/archives-special-collections/northeastern-history/commencement-speakers-honorary-degrees|title=Commencement Speakers & Honorary Degrees {{!}} Northeastern University Library|website=library.northeastern.edu|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nBabson College, Honorary Degree, LL.D.
