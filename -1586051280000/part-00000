The building serves as the headquarters for [[CIVT-DT|CTV Vancouver]].]] \nThis is an overview of media in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].\n\n==Newspapers==\n[[File:Granville Square, Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Vancouver's two major daily newspapers, ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' and ''[[The Province]]'', are both headquartered at [[Granville Square]].]]\nVancouver has two major [[English language|English-language]] daily newspapers, ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' (a [[broadsheet]]) and ''[[The Province]]'' (a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]). Both are published by [[Postmedia Network]]. There are also two national newspapers distributed in the city: ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', which began distribution of a \"national edition\" into B.C. in 1983, and in more recent years launched a three-page B.C. news section in an effort to increase its readership in the city.  The ''[[National Post]]'', also owned by Postmedia, entered city markets only in the last few years but has very little British Columbia content.\n\nVancouver has four [[Chinese language|Chinese-language]] daily newspapers, ''[[Ming Pao]]'', ''[[Sing Tao Daily (Canada)|Sing Tao]]'', ''[[World Journal]]'' and ''[[The Epoch Times]]''. ''Ming Pao'' and ''Sing Tao'' cater to a Cantonese-speaking readership whereas ''World Journal'' and ''The Epoch Times'' target Mandarin speakers.\n\nVancouver business publications include the following: \n{{div col}}\n*''[http://www.bcbusinessonline.ca/ BC Business Mag]'' (monthly)\n*''[http://www.businessedge.ca Business Edge Vancouver]'' (weekly)\n*''[[Business in Vancouver]]'' (weekly)\n*''[http://www.journalofcommerce.com/ Journal of Commerce BC]'' (daily)\n*''[http://www.makeitbusiness.com/ Make It Business]'' (monthly)\n*''[http://www.westerninvestor.com Western Investor]'' (monthly)\n{{col div end}}\nOne free daily newspaper, ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' is published in the city from Monday to Friday. It contains a small number of local news stories.\n\t \n''[[The Georgia Straight]]'' is a weekly \"alternative\" newspaper, though in addition to left-leaning news and opinion it also features upscale advertising for products such as condominiums and has lifestyle articles on topics such as health and style. Its most extensive sections are focused on entertainment and music features and listings. ''The Georgia Straight'' began as a counterculture newspaper in the 1960s, full of controversial politics and occasional \"obscene\" cartoons and pictures, including the hippie classic comic ''[[Harold Hedd]]''. During this period the ''Straight''{{'}}s owner and publisher, Dan MacLeod, was repeatedly harassed by the city and its anti-hippie mayor [[Tom Campbell (mayor)|Tom Campbell]]. MacLeod's offices were repeatedly raided and he was beaten by police.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} During the 1970s MacLeod converted the publication to a much more entertainment-oriented publication, avoiding political content until the mid-1980s.\n\nThe Post Group Multimedia publishes 3 weekly newspapers: ''The Asian Pacific Post'' (Chinese), ''South Asian Post'' (Indo-Canadian), and ''[[The Filipino Post]]'', for the three largest immigrant communities in the Lower Mainland.\n\n''The Express'' is the title used for an occasional union-published newspaper published by the press unions when they are on strike.\n\n===Neighbourhood papers===\n<!--If this is supposed to be GVRD coverage, and not Vancouver only - which I thought was the drift of Vancouver-named pages now, as per the WikiProject - then the Courier and West Ender need their Surrey, Coquitlam, North Shore kin listed as well-->\nThe ''[[Vancouver Courier]]'', a free community newspaper, is distributed to most households in the city every Thursday. The ''WE'', a free weekly paper that used to be distributed primarily in the city's West End neighbourhood, has recently been trying to compete with the ''[[Georgia Straight]]'' as a weekly alternative newspaper for the entire city covering civic news and opinion (it does not try to compete with the ''Straight''{{'}}s exhaustive entertainment coverage and listings).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!

''Ming Pao'' and ''Sing Tao'' cater to a Cantonese-speaking readership whereas ''World Journal'' and ''The Epoch Times'' target Mandarin speakers.\n\nVancouver business publications include the following: \n{{div col}}\n*''[http://www.bcbusinessonline.ca/ BC Business Mag]'' (monthly)\n*''[http://www.businessedge.ca Business Edge Vancouver]'' (weekly)\n*''[[Business in Vancouver]]'' (weekly)\n*''[http://www.journalofcommerce.com/ Journal of Commerce BC]'' (daily)\n*''[http://www.makeitbusiness.com/ Make It Business]'' (monthly)\n*''[http://www.westerninvestor.com Western Investor]'' (monthly)\n{{col div end}}\nOne free daily newspaper, ''[[Metro International|Metro]]'' is published in the city from Monday to Friday. It contains a small number of local news stories.\n\t \n''[[The Georgia Straight]]'' is a weekly \"alternative\" newspaper, though in addition to left-leaning news and opinion it also features upscale advertising for products such as condominiums and has lifestyle articles on topics such as health and style. Its most extensive sections are focused on entertainment and music features and listings. ''The Georgia Straight'' began as a counterculture newspaper in the 1960s, full of controversial politics and occasional \"obscene\" cartoons and pictures, including the hippie classic comic ''[[Harold Hedd]]''. During this period the ''Straight''{{'}}s owner and publisher, Dan MacLeod, was repeatedly harassed by the city and its anti-hippie mayor [[Tom Campbell (mayor)|Tom Campbell]]. MacLeod's offices were repeatedly raided and he was beaten by police.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} During the 1970s MacLeod converted the publication to a much more entertainment-oriented publication, avoiding political content until the mid-1980s.\n\nThe Post Group Multimedia publishes 3 weekly newspapers: ''The Asian Pacific Post'' (Chinese), ''South Asian Post'' (Indo-Canadian), and ''[[The Filipino Post]]'', for the three largest immigrant communities in the Lower Mainland.\n\n''The Express'' is the title used for an occasional union-published newspaper published by the press unions when they are on strike.\n\n===Neighbourhood papers===\n<!--If this is supposed to be GVRD coverage, and not Vancouver only - which I thought was the drift of Vancouver-named pages now, as per the WikiProject - then the Courier and West Ender need their Surrey, Coquitlam, North Shore kin listed as well-->\nThe ''[[Vancouver Courier]]'', a free community newspaper, is distributed to most households in the city every Thursday. The ''WE'', a free weekly paper that used to be distributed primarily in the city's West End neighbourhood, has recently been trying to compete with the ''[[Georgia Straight]]'' as a weekly alternative newspaper for the entire city covering civic news and opinion (it does not try to compete with the ''Straight''{{'}}s exhaustive entertainment coverage and listings).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!

A study conducted by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), a working group of the [[Arctic Council]], distinguishes between short-term and long-term adaptation measures, as well as climate-centered and vulnerability-centered options. In the short-term, adaptation measures can focus on immediate challenges caused by increased extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfalls or melting permafrost (climate-centered). In the long-term, other developments, such as the effects of demographic, social and economic change must be considered when determining how climate change will affect the population (vulnerability-centered).<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Adaptation measures ===\n\n==== The Greenlandic Government ====\nAt the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], the then Greenlandic Minister for Finance, Mineral Resources and Foreign Affairs, Vittus Qujaukitsoq described climate change adaptation in Greenland as being a policy priority. He underlined the importance of incorporating the knowledge and experience of the Inuit people to gain an all-encompassing understanding of the ongoing climatic changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://naalakkersuisut.gl/~/media/Nanoq/Files/Attached%20Files/Engelske-tekster/Taler/Climate%20change%20in%20GreenlandParis.pdf|title=Speech by Minister for Finance, Mineral Resources and Foreign Affairs Mr. Vittus Qujaukitsoq}}</ref>\n\nThe government's website ''[http://climategreenland.gl/en/ Climate Greenland]''<ref>'[http://climategreenland.gl/en/ Climate Greenland]'</ref> is both a resource tool to find relevant organizations or stakeholders, as was well as information on the impacts of climate change on Greenland and how the country is responding to it. It focuses on the four areas 'citizen', 'trade', 'municipality' and 'education'. Climate Change Adaptation is defined as \"being prepared for the challenges caused by the climate changes and about relating to possibilities as well as challenges.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://climategreenland.gl/en/citizen/climate-adaptation/|title=Climate adaptation - Climate Greenland|work=Climate Greenland|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref> The Government publishes adaptation reports for sectors, such as fisheries, hunting or [[Tourism in Greenland|tourism]].\n\nIn 2009 the Greenland Climate Research Centre was set up in the capital of Greenland, [[Nuuk]]. The centre received a grant of [[Danish krone|DKK]] 35 million by the [[Ministry of Higher Education and Science (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]]. The aim of the centre is to study the impact of climate change on Greenland [[Climate change in the Arctic|and the Arctic]] and the consequences for nature and society. It is linked to the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources and the [[University of Greenland]], Ilisimatusarfik.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.natur.gl/en/communication/news/article/a/new-greenland-climate-research-center/|title=New Greenland Climate Research Center {{!}} Pinngortitaleriffik - Gr\u00f8nlands Naturinstitut|website=www.natur.gl|language=da|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n==== The Arctic Council ====\n[[File:Arctic region CIA.jpg|alt=|thumb|Countries within the Arctic Region]]\nIn 2008, following increased media attention for the Arctic, the five countries adjacent to the [[Arctic Ocean]] (Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia and the United States) published the [[Ilulissat Declaration]]. This proclaims the Arctic states' responsibility to protect the ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean.<ref name=\":7\" /> In addition, the [[Arctic Council|Council's]] Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) has published a series of reports one of which looks at adaptation in particular. The 2017 Adaptation Actions for a Changing Arctic (AACA) Report covers the [[Baffin Bay]]/[[Davis Strait]] region which includes the western part of Greenland aiming to offer information \"to assist local decision makers and stakeholders [...] in developing adaptation tools and strategies to better deal with climate change [...].\"<ref name=\":9\" /> Following extensive stakeholder dialogues, the report identified seven themes of local adaptation:\n\n# Living resources\n# Non-living resources (e.g. mineral extraction)\n# Education\n# Human health and well-being\n# Tourism\n# Shipping\n# Infrastructure\n\nThe report concludes that it is crucial to consider the cumulative and cascading effects of change in order to build adaptive capacities. Suggested measures are structural/physical, social as well as institutional. Lastly, as a precursor to adaptation measures, the AACA points out six factors (political leadership, institutional organisation, local and regional leadership, the need for usable science and sufficient funding and public support) to build adaptive readiness.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Inuit culture and tradition ==\n=== Traditional ecological knowledge ===\nWidely discussed in academic literature since the 1980s, [[traditional ecological knowledge]] cumulatively consists of knowledge, practices and beliefs about the interaction of living beings and their environment.<ref>Berkes, F. (2008). ''Sacred Ecology.'' New York: Routledge.</ref> In Greenland, traditional knowledge does not only underpin the life of subsistence hunters and fishermen but also more broadly community life and [[Inuit culture|culture]]. While climate change is making practical aspects such as the prediction of weather or animal migration more difficult, it also highlights the importance of traditional knowledge for adaptive capacity building in other areas e.g. the recognition of approaching hazards and survival skills.<ref name=\":9\" /> The process of knowledge transfer between generations for building resilience is also important to address as it is weakened by trends of urbanisation and alternative livelihoods. Such trends can further lead to the alienation of people from their environment. This increases the need for the management of ecosystems which are the base of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenland's]] economic activities, cultural characteristics and natural services.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== The concept of anticipation ===\n[[File:Leaving Kulusuk (33806528314).jpg|thumb|Inuit hunters near Kulusuk, Greenland]]\n[[Greenlandic Inuit]] as a societal group are academically recognised for their \"finely tuned ability to be flexible, to innovate, and to seize opportunities in the environment.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=Mark|date=2010|title=Anticipation, climate change, and movement in Greenland|url=http://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/etudinuit/2010-v34-n1-etudinuit3992/045402ar/|journal=&#201;tudes/Inuit/Studies|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|page=22|doi=10.7202/045402ar|issn=0701-1008|via=}}</ref> This means that a successful adaptation to changing climatic conditions is attributed to a specific ontology which includes the ability to relate to one's world, making sense of it and reflecting on expectations about it; anticipation. In Greenlandic the term 'anticipation' is divided into two meanings which are primarily used by subsistence hunters and fishermen: ''neriguaa'' (\"to hope for, or to be hopeful of something\") and ''aarleraa'' (\"to be fearful, especially of bad weather\"). This distinction of meanings carries the acceptance of uncertainty as well as potential disappointments and failure.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Geography of Greenland]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.natur.gl/en/ Institute for Natural Resources]\n* [https://gcrc.gl/ Climate Research Centre]\n* [https://www.amap.no/ Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Climate of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Effects of global warming|Greenland]]\n[[Category:Climate change and society|Adaptation in Greenland]]\n[[Category:Environment of the Arctic|G]]\n[[Category:Sea ice|Arctic Sea, Global warming]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Flag of Greenland.png|thumb|Flag of Greenland]]\n'''Climate change adaptation''' is a pressing issue '''i'''n [[Greenland]].

In 197], the [[Naalakkersuisut|Home Rule Government]] was established in Greenland. It gained further rights in 2009, which moved Greenland towards self-rule.<ref name=\":2\" /> The government is financially dependent on Denmark which provides 60% of Greenland's annual budget revenue.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=Mark|date=2008|title=Self Rule in Greenland: Towards the World's First Inuit State?|url=|journal=Indigenous Affairs 3-4/08|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> One of the country's greatest challenges is to ensure modern life styles introduced primarily through the industrialisation processes and triggered by intensive fishery while pursuing economic wealth creation and further independence.<ref name=\":9\">AMAP, 2017.

A study conducted by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), a working group of the [[Arctic Council]], distinguishes between short-term and long-term adaptation measures, as well as climate-centered and vulnerability-centered options. In the short-term, adaptation measures can focus on immediate challenges caused by increased extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfalls or melting permafrost (climate-centered). In the long-term, other developments, such as the effects of demographic, social and economic change must be considered when determining how climate change will affect the population (vulnerability-centered).<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== Adaptation measures ===\n\n==== The Greenlandic Government ====\nAt the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]], the then Greenlandic Minister for Finance, Mineral Resources and Foreign Affairs, Vittus Qujaukitsoq described climate change adaptation in Greenland as being a policy priority. He underlined the importance of incorporating the knowledge and experience of the Inuit people to gain an all-encompassing understanding of the ongoing climatic changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://naalakkersuisut.gl/~/media/Nanoq/Files/Attached%20Files/Engelske-tekster/Taler/Climate%20change%20in%20GreenlandParis.pdf|title=Speech by Minister for Finance, Mineral Resources and Foreign Affairs Mr. Vittus Qujaukitsoq}}</ref>\n\nThe government's website ''[http://climategreenland.gl/en/ Climate Greenland]''<ref>'[http://climategreenland.gl/en/ Climate Greenland]'</ref> is both a resource tool to find relevant organizations or stakeholders, as was well as information on the impacts of climate change on Greenland and how the country is responding to it. It focuses on the four areas 'citizen', 'trade', 'municipality' and 'education'. Climate Change Adaptation is defined as \"being prepared for the challenges caused by the climate changes and about relating to possibilities as well as challenges.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://climategreenland.gl/en/citizen/climate-adaptation/|title=Climate adaptation - Climate Greenland|work=Climate Greenland|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref> The Government publishes adaptation reports for sectors, such as fisheries, hunting or [[Tourism in Greenland|tourism]].\n\nIn 2009 the Greenland Climate Research Centre was set up in the capital of Greenland, [[Nuuk]]. The centre received a grant of [[Danish krone|DKK]] 35 million by the [[Ministry of Higher Education and Science (Denmark)|Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]]. The aim of the centre is to study the impact of climate change on Greenland [[Climate change in the Arctic|and the Arctic]] and the consequences for nature and society. It is linked to the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources and the [[University of Greenland]], Ilisimatusarfik.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.natur.gl/en/communication/news/article/a/new-greenland-climate-research-center/|title=New Greenland Climate Research Center {{!}} Pinngortitaleriffik - Gr\u00f8nlands Naturinstitut|website=www.natur.gl|language=da|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>\n\n==== The Arctic Council ====\n[[File:Arctic region CIA.jpg|alt=|thumb|Countries within the Arctic Region]]\nIn 2008, following increased media attention for the Arctic, the five countries adjacent to the [[Arctic Ocean]] (Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia and the United States) published the [[Ilulissat Declaration]]. This proclaims the Arctic states' responsibility to protect the ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean.<ref name=\":7\" /> In addition, the [[Arctic Council|Council's]] Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) has published a series of reports one of which looks at adaptation in particular. The 2017 Adaptation Actions for a Changing Arctic (AACA) Report covers the [[Baffin Bay]]/[[Davis Strait]] region which includes the western part of Greenland aiming to offer information \"to assist local decision makers and stakeholders [...] in developing adaptation tools and strategies to better deal with climate change [...].\"<ref name=\":9\" /> Following extensive stakeholder dialogues, the report identified seven themes of local adaptation:\n\n# Living resources\n# Non-living resources (e.g. mineral extraction)\n# Education\n# Human health and well-being\n# Tourism\n# Shipping\n# Infrastructure\n\nThe report concludes that it is crucial to consider the cumulative and cascading effects of change in order to build adaptive capacities. Suggested measures are structural/physical, social as well as institutional. Lastly, as a precursor to adaptation measures, the AACA points out six factors (political leadership, institutional organisation, local and regional leadership, the need for usable science and sufficient funding and public support) to build adaptive readiness.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Inuit culture and tradition ==\n=== Traditional ecological knowledge ===\nWidely discussed in academic literature since the 1980s, [[traditional ecological knowledge]] cumulatively consists of knowledge, practices and beliefs about the interaction of living beings and their environment.<ref>Berkes, F. (2008). ''Sacred Ecology.'' New York: Routledge.</ref> In Greenland, traditional knowledge does not only underpin the life of subsistence hunters and fishermen but also more broadly community life and [[Inuit culture|culture]]. While climate change is making practical aspects such as the prediction of weather or animal migration more difficult, it also highlights the importance of traditional knowledge for adaptive capacity building in other areas e.g. the recognition of approaching hazards and survival skills.<ref name=\":9\" /> The process of knowledge transfer between generations for building resilience is also important to address as it is weakened by trends of urbanisation and alternative livelihoods. Such trends can further lead to the alienation of people from their environment. This increases the need for the management of ecosystems which are the base of [[Economy of Greenland|Greenland's]] economic activities, cultural characteristics and natural services.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n=== The concept of anticipation ===\n[[File:Leaving Kulusuk (33806528314).jpg|thumb|Inuit hunters near Kulusuk, Greenland]]\n[[Greenlandic Inuit]] as a societal group are academically recognised for their \"finely tuned ability to be flexible, to innovate, and to seize opportunities in the environment.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nuttall|first=Mark|date=2010|title=Anticipation, climate change, and movement in Greenland|url=http://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/etudinuit/2010-v34-n1-etudinuit3992/045402ar/|journal=&#201;tudes/Inuit/Studies|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|page=22|doi=10.7202/045402ar|issn=0701-1008|via=}}</ref> This means that a successful adaptation to changing climatic conditions is attributed to a specific ontology which includes the ability to relate to one's world, making sense of it and reflecting on expectations about it; anticipation. In Greenlandic the term 'anticipation' is divided into two meanings which are primarily used by subsistence hunters and fishermen: ''neriguaa'' (\"to hope for, or to be hopeful of something\") and ''aarleraa'' (\"to be fearful, especially of bad weather\"). This distinction of meanings carries the acceptance of uncertainty as well as potential disappointments and failure.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Geography of Greenland]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.natur.gl/en/ Institute for Natural Resources]\n* [https://gcrc.gl/ Climate Research Centre]\n* [https://www.amap.no/ Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Climate of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Effects of global warming|Greenland]]\n[[Category:Climate change and society|Adaptation in Greenland]]\n[[Category:Environment of the Arctic|G]]\n[[Category:Sea ice|Arctic Sea, Global warming]]\n", "name_user": "2001:8003:a601:e800:c127:35d4:9a40:5b6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(added stuff they forgot)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation_in_Greenland"}
