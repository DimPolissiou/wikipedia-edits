His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' (1955) shows \"new people\" (generally identified with ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''), triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with [[Neanderthals]]) by deceit and violence. His 1956 novel ''[[Pincher Martin]]'' records the thoughts of a drowning sailor. ''[[Free Fall (Golding novel)|Free Fall]]'' (1959) explores the issue of free choice as a prisoner held in solitary confinement in a German POW camp during World War Two looks back over his life. ''[[The Spire]]'' (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be [[Salisbury Cathedral]]); the spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity.\n\nIn his 1967 novel ''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' three separate stories in a shared setting (a small English town in the 1920s) are linked by a narrator, and ''The Scorpion God'' (1971) consists of three novellas, the first set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band ('Clonk, Clonk'), the second in an ancient Egyptian court ('The Scorpion God') and the third in the court of a Roman emperor ('Envoy Extraordinary'). The last of these reworks his 1958 play ''The Brass Butterfly''. His later novels include ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' (1979), which is about a terrorist group, a paedophile teacher, and a mysterious angel-like figure who survives a fire in [[the Blitz]], ''[[The Paper Men]]'' (1984) which is about the conflict between a writer and his biographer, and a sea trilogy ''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]'', which includes ''Rites of Passage'' (1980), ''Close Quarters'' (1987), and ''Fire Down Below'' (1989), the first book of which (originally intended as a stand-alone novel) won the [[Booker Prize]].\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''[[Poems (poetry by Golding)|Poems]]'' (1934)\n\n===Drama===\n*''The Brass Butterfly''  (1958)\n\n===Novels===\n*''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954) \n*''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' (1955)\n*''[[Pincher Martin]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Free Fall (Golding)|Free Fall]]'' (1959)\n*''[[The Spire]]'' (1964)\n*''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' (1967)\n*''The Scorpion God''   (1971)\n*''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' (1979)\n*''[[The Paper Men]] (1984)\n*''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]'' (trilogy)\n**''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1980)\n**''[[Close Quarters (Golding)|Close Quarters]]'' (1987)\n**''[[Fire Down Below (novel)|Fire Down Below]]'' (1989)\n*''[[The Double Tongue]]'' (posthumous publication 1995)<ref>''The Double Tongue'' 1996 Faber reprint {{ISBN|978-0-571-17720-2}}</ref>\n\n===Non-fiction===\n*''[[The Hot Gates]]''  (1965)\n*''[[A Moving Target]]''  (1982)\n*''An Egyptian Journal'' (1985)\n\n===Unpublished works===\n*''Seahorse'' was written in 1948.

The two discussed Lovelock's [[Gaia Hypothesis|hypothesis]], that the living matter of the planet Earth functions like a single organism, and Golding suggested naming this hypothesis after [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Titan of the earth in Greek mythology.<ref name=\"ecolo.org\">James Lovelock, \u2018What is Gaia?\u2019, [http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/what_is_Gaia.html accessed 16 May 2013]</ref> His publishing success made it possible for Golding to resign his teaching post at Bishop Wordsworth's School in 1961, and he spent that academic year in the United States as writer-in-residence at [[Hollins University|Hollins College]], near [[Roanoke, Virginia]].\n\nGolding won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' in 1979, and the [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] for ''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' in 1980. In 1983 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], and was according to the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' \"an unexpected and even contentious choice\".<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nIn 1988 Golding was appointed a [[Knight Bachelor]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=51558 |date=13 December 1988 |page=13986 }}</ref> In September 1993, only a few months after his sudden death, the First International William Golding Conference was held in France, where Golding's presence had been promised and was eagerly expected.<ref>F. Regard (ed.), F''ingering Netsukes: Selected Papers from the First International William Golding Conference'', Saint-Etienne, PUSE, 1995.</ref>\n\nDespite his success, Golding \"was abnormally thin-skinned when it came to criticism of his work. He simply could not read even the mildest reservation and on occasion left the country when his books were published.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/books/review/Boyd-t.html \"Man as an Island\"].\n ''The New York Times''.</ref>\n\n===Fiction===\nHis first novel, ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954; film, 1963 and 1990; play, adapted by [[Nigel Williams (author)|Nigel Williams]], 1995), describes a group of boys stranded on a tropical island reverting to savagery. ''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' (1955) shows \"new people\" (generally identified with ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]''), triumphing over a gentler race (generally identified with [[Neanderthals]]) by deceit and violence. His 1956 novel ''[[Pincher Martin]]'' records the thoughts of a drowning sailor. ''[[Free Fall (Golding novel)|Free Fall]]'' (1959) explores the issue of free choice as a prisoner held in solitary confinement in a German POW camp during World War Two looks back over his life. ''[[The Spire]]'' (1964) follows the building (and near collapse) of a huge spire onto a medieval cathedral (generally assumed to be [[Salisbury Cathedral]]); the spire symbolizing both spiritual aspiration and worldly vanity.\n\nIn his 1967 novel ''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' three separate stories in a shared setting (a small English town in the 1920s) are linked by a narrator, and ''The Scorpion God'' (1971) consists of three novellas, the first set in a prehistoric African hunter-gatherer band ('Clonk, Clonk'), the second in an ancient Egyptian court ('The Scorpion God') and the third in the court of a Roman emperor ('Envoy Extraordinary'). The last of these reworks his 1958 play ''The Brass Butterfly''. His later novels include ''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' (1979), which is about a terrorist group, a paedophile teacher, and a mysterious angel-like figure who survives a fire in [[the Blitz]], ''[[The Paper Men]]'' (1984) which is about the conflict between a writer and his biographer, and a sea trilogy ''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]'', which includes ''Rites of Passage'' (1980), ''Close Quarters'' (1987), and ''Fire Down Below'' (1989), the first book of which (originally intended as a stand-alone novel) won the [[Booker Prize]].\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''[[Poems (poetry by Golding)|Poems]]'' (1934)\n\n===Drama===\n*''The Brass Butterfly''  (1958)\n\n===Novels===\n*''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' (1954) \n*''[[The Inheritors (William Golding)|The Inheritors]]'' (1955)\n*''[[Pincher Martin]]'' (1956)\n*''[[Free Fall (Golding)|Free Fall]]'' (1959)\n*''[[The Spire]]'' (1964)\n*''[[The Pyramid (Golding)|The Pyramid]]'' (1967)\n*''The Scorpion God''   (1971)\n*''[[Darkness Visible (Golding)|Darkness Visible]]'' (1979)\n*''[[The Paper Men]] (1984)\n*''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]'' (trilogy)\n**''[[Rites of Passage (novel)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1980)\n**''[[Close Quarters (Golding)|Close Quarters]]'' (1987)\n**''[[Fire Down Below (novel)|Fire Down Below]]'' (1989)\n*''[[The Double Tongue]]'' (posthumous publication 1995)<ref>''The Double Tongue'' 1996 Faber reprint {{ISBN|978-0-571-17720-2}}</ref>\n\n===Non-fiction===\n*''[[The Hot Gates]]''  (1965)\n*''[[A Moving Target]]''  (1982)\n*''An Egyptian Journal'' (1985)\n\n===Unpublished works===\n*''Seahorse'' was written in 1948.

The first presenter on air was Dickie Dodd.\n\nRadio 106's launch schedule included a heavy emphasis on speech content, including daily guests on mid-morning shows and a nightly 3-hour phone-in. Specialist music output featured country, soul and motown at weekends. The station's launch team included Kevin Fernihough, Mark Keen, Willie Morgan, Kenny Hague, Jake Yapp, Peter King and Sarah Graham.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.justin-case.co.uk/simon/keen.htm | title = Mark Keen information | accessdate = 2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAgainst competition from established [[BBC Local Radio]] and [[GWR Group|GWR]]-owned commercial stations, Radio 106 recorded poor listening figures for its first set of [[RAJAR]] audience figures, so within seven months of launch, the station's owners [[Border Radio Holdings]] opted for a complete relaunch.\n\n===Century 106===\nIn April 1998, [[John Myers (radio executive)|John Myers]] took control of the station, which was rebranded as Century 106 and relaunched with a new team of presenters including [[Adrian Allen]] and Chris Ashley.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/rau/radio-stations/analogue/AL200-1.htm | title = Radio Authority Century 106 file | accessdate = 2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nFormer [[Radio Trent]] [[Radio presenter|presenter]] [[David Lloyd (broadcaster)|David Lloyd]] became the station's Managing Director and Programme Controller with ex-Trent colleagues including Tony Lyman, Craig Strong, Gary Burton and Andy Marriott joining the presenting line-up. Other additions to the team included Steve Jordan (breakfast) and Bernie Keith (afternoons).\n\nIn May 2000, Century 106, along with the other Century stations in the North East and North West, were sold to [[Capital Radio]]. David Lloyd left the station to join [[Galaxy 105]] in Leeds while presenter Adrian Allen walked out mid-show in protest. The sale to Capital brought an increase in the station's sports coverage - as emphasised in the slogan ''music, fun and football''. More new presenters joined Century, including Ian Skye, [http://www.jason-king.com Jason King], Stuart Ellis, [[Sam Pinkham]] and Paula White.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/thehotw/aircheck_UKLeics.htm | title = History of radio in East Midlands | accessdate = 2010-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022091041/http://geocities.com/thehotw/aircheck_UKLeics.htm| url-status = dead |archivedate=2009-10-22}}</ref>\n\n===Heart 106 ===\nWhen Capital later merged with GWR, the [[Office of Fair Trading]] ordered Century to be sold off.

A further, more subtle rebrand was applied in September 2006 which saw the dropping of the frequencies from station names across the [[Heart Network]].\n\nOn 25 June 2007, Chrysalis announced the sale of Heart, along with its sister stations [[The Arrow (radio)|The Arrow]], [[LBC]] and [[Galaxy Radio|Galaxy]], for \u00a3170 million to [[Global Radio]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/06/25/bcnchrys125.xml Chrysalis sells three radio stations]</ref>\n\nFollowing Global's takeover of [[GCap Media]], the Office of Fair Trading again ordered Global to sell off Heart and four other Midlands stations - [[BRMB]], [[Mercia FM]], [[Wyvern FM]] and [[Beacon Radio]].

The first presenter on air was Dickie Dodd.\n\nRadio 106's launch schedule included a heavy emphasis on speech content, including daily guests on mid-morning shows and a nightly 3-hour phone-in. Specialist music output featured country, soul and motown at weekends. The station's launch team included Kevin Fernihough, Mark Keen, Willie Morgan, Kenny Hague, Jake Yapp, Peter King and Sarah Graham.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.justin-case.co.uk/simon/keen.htm | title = Mark Keen information | accessdate = 2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAgainst competition from established [[BBC Local Radio]] and [[GWR Group|GWR]]-owned commercial stations, Radio 106 recorded poor listening figures for its first set of [[RAJAR]] audience figures, so within seven months of launch, the station's owners [[Border Radio Holdings]] opted for a complete relaunch.\n\n===Century 106===\nIn April 1998, [[John Myers (radio executive)|John Myers]] took control of the station, which was rebranded as Century 106 and relaunched with a new team of presenters including [[Adrian Allen]] and Chris Ashley.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/rau/radio-stations/analogue/AL200-1.htm | title = Radio Authority Century 106 file | accessdate = 2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nFormer [[Radio Trent]] [[Radio presenter|presenter]] [[David Lloyd (broadcaster)|David Lloyd]] became the station's Managing Director and Programme Controller with ex-Trent colleagues including Tony Lyman, Craig Strong, Gary Burton and Andy Marriott joining the presenting line-up.

David Lloyd left the station to join [[Galaxy 105]] in Leeds while presenter Adrian Allen walked out mid-show in protest. The sale to Capital brought an increase in the station's sports coverage - as emphasised in the slogan ''music, fun and football''.

A further, more subtle rebrand was applied in September 2006 which saw the dropping of the frequencies from station names across the [[Heart Network]].\n\nOn 25 June 2007, Chrysalis announced the sale of Heart, along with its sister stations [[The Arrow (radio)|The Arrow]], [[LBC]] and [[Galaxy Radio|Galaxy]], for \u00a3170 million to [[Global Radio]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2007/06/25/bcnchrys125.xml Chrysalis sells three radio stations]</ref>\n\nFollowing Global's takeover of [[GCap Media]], the Office of Fair Trading again ordered Global to sell off Heart and four other Midlands stations - [[BRMB]], [[Mercia FM]], [[Wyvern FM]] and [[Beacon Radio]].

The main palace was constructed using wood, of which only the base pillars remain. The main fort ruins consist of the queen's quarters, six chambers, with each chamber having its own private restroom. In addition, ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front of the palace grounds out of which only two remain as the third one was destroyed during a bombardment. The Raigad Fort also has ruins of a market which was accessible to horseback riders. The fort also overlooks an artificial lake known as the Ganga Sagar Lake.\n\n[[File:MahaDarwaja Raigad Fort.JPG|thumb|left|The Maha Darwaja]]\n\nThe only main pathway to the fort passes through the \"Maha Darwaja\" (Huge Door) which was previously closed at sunset. The Maha Darwaja has two huge bastions on both sides of the door which are approximately 65\u201370 feet in height. The top of the fort is 600&nbsp;ft above this door.\n\nThe fort has a famous wall called \"Hirakani Buruj\" (Hirakani Bastion) constructed over a huge steep cliff. The legend goes \"that a woman by the name of Hirakani from a nearby village had come to sell milk to the people living at the fort. She happened to be inside the fort when the gates got closed and locked at sunset. Hearing the cries of her infant son back at the village echo after nightfall, the anxious mother couldn't wait till dawn and courageously climbed down the steep cliff in pitch darkness all for the love of her little one. She later repeated this extraordinary feat in front of Shivaji and was bravely rewarded for it.\" In appreciation of her courage and bravery, Shivaji built the Hirakani Bastion over this cliff.\n\nThe King's ''[[Durbar (court)|durbar]]'' inside the Raigad Fort has a replica of the original throne that faces the main doorway called the ''Nagarkhana Darwaja''. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid hearing from the doorway to the throne. A secondary entrance, called the ''Mena Darwaja'', was supposedly the private entrance for the royal ladies of the fort that lead to the queen's quarters. The convoy of the king and the king himself used the ''Palkhi Darwaja.'' To the right of Palkhi Darwaja, is a row of three dark and deep chambers.

The Raigad Fort, formerly known as Rairi, was built by Chandraraoji More, the King of Jawali, who was then seized by  [[Shivaji]] who made it his capital in 1674 when he was crowned the King of a Maratha Kingdom which later developed into the [[Maratha Empire]], eventually covering much of western and central India.<ref name=imp>{{cite web | title =Raigarh |publisher=[[Imperial Gazetteer of India]], Volume 21|pages= 47\u201348|year=1909| url = http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_053.gif| accessdate = 2014-02-19 }}</ref>\n\nThe fort rises {{convert|820|m|ft|-2}} above the sea level and is located in the [[Sahyadri]] mountain range. There are approximately 1737 steps leading to the fort. The [[Raigad Ropeway]], an [[aerial tramway]]  exists to reach the top of the fort in 10 minutes. The fort was looted and destroyed by the British after it was captured in 1818.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Ghats from Ryghur.jpg|thumb|left|The Ghats from Ryghur]]\n\n[[Shivaji]]Maharaj seized the fort in 1656, then known as the fort of ''Rairi'' from Chandraraoji More, The King of Jawali. Chhtrapati Shivaji Maharaj renovated and expanded the fort of Rairi and renamed it as Raigad (''King's Fort''). It became the capital of Chhtrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Maratha Empire.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nThe villages of Pachad and Raigadwadi are located at the base of the Raigad fort. These two villages were considered very important during the Maratha rule in Raigad. The actual climb to the top of the Raigad fort starts from Pachad. During \n  Shivaji Maharaj's rule, A cavalry of 10,000 was always kept on standby in Pachad village. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}Chhtrapati\nShivaji Maharaj also built another fort [[Lingana]] around 2 miles away from Raigad. The Lingana fort was used to keep prisoners.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[File:Raigad 1896.jpg|thumb|Raigad 1896]]\n\nIn 1689, Zulfikhar Khan captured Raigad and Aurangzeb renamed it as ''Islamgad''. In 1707, Siddi Fathekan captured the fort and held it until 1733.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naravane|first1=M.S.|title=The maritime and coastal forts of India|date=1998|publisher=APH Pub.

And on 9 May 1818, as per the treaty, it was handed over to the [[East India Company|British East India Company]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Major features==\n\n[[File:Raigad fort walls hidden in the green.JPG|Hidden Walls of the Raigad Fort|thumb|right]]\n[[File:RaigadFort1.jpg|Raigad Fort Palace Ruins|thumb|right]]\n\nThe Raigad Fort was built by [[Shivaji]], Maharashtra  and the chief architect/engineer was Hiroji Indulkar. The main palace was constructed using wood, of which only the base pillars remain. The main fort ruins consist of the queen's quarters, six chambers, with each chamber having its own private restroom. In addition, ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front of the palace grounds out of which only two remain as the third one was destroyed during a bombardment. The Raigad Fort also has ruins of a market which was accessible to horseback riders. The fort also overlooks an artificial lake known as the Ganga Sagar Lake.\n\n[[File:MahaDarwaja Raigad Fort.JPG|thumb|left|The Maha Darwaja]]\n\nThe only main pathway to the fort passes through the \"Maha Darwaja\" (Huge Door) which was previously closed at sunset. The Maha Darwaja has two huge bastions on both sides of the door which are approximately 65\u201370 feet in height. The top of the fort is 600&nbsp;ft above this door.\n\nThe fort has a famous wall called \"Hirakani Buruj\" (Hirakani Bastion) constructed over a huge steep cliff. The legend goes \"that a woman by the name of Hirakani from a nearby village had come to sell milk to the people living at the fort. She happened to be inside the fort when the gates got closed and locked at sunset. Hearing the cries of her infant son back at the village echo after nightfall, the anxious mother couldn't wait till dawn and courageously climbed down the steep cliff in pitch darkness all for the love of her little one. She later repeated this extraordinary feat in front of Shivaji and was bravely rewarded for it.\" In appreciation of her courage and bravery, Shivaji built the Hirakani Bastion over this cliff.\n\nThe King's ''[[Durbar (court)|durbar]]'' inside the Raigad Fort has a replica of the original throne that faces the main doorway called the ''Nagarkhana Darwaja''. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid hearing from the doorway to the throne. A secondary entrance, called the ''Mena Darwaja'', was supposedly the private entrance for the royal ladies of the fort that lead to the queen's quarters. The convoy of the king and the king himself used the ''Palkhi Darwaja.'' To the right of Palkhi Darwaja, is a row of three dark and deep chambers. Historians believe that these were the granaries for the fort.<ref>[http://www.raigadropeway.com/fort.htm Write-up from the Raigad ropeway]</ref>\n\n[[File:Raigad Fort Tak Mak Tok The famous cliff.JPG|thumb|right|The Takmak Tok]]\n\nFrom the fort, one can view the execution point called ''Takmak Tok'', a cliff from which sentenced prisoners were thrown to their death.

''Jazzed Magazine''.</ref>\n\n\"I Hate Myself for Loving You\" was released as the first single, backed with a live version of the Jett composition \"Love Is Pain\" (the original version of which appears on 1981's ''[[I Love Rock 'n Roll (album)|I Love Rock 'n Roll]]'').  \"Little Liar\" was the second single, backed with an obscure Jett/Laguna composition \"What Can I Do for You\", which had been recorded for a movie Jett was set to make in 1979 that was never completed. The song eventually turned up again on the Jett fan-club only CD 1979. For Record Store Day in 2015, the track was included on the [https://www.turntablelab.com/products/joan-jett-the-first-sessions-colored-vinyl-vinyl-lp-record-store-day limited edition (4000 split color vinyl)  LP \"The First Sessions\"] documenting the first several songs Joan wrote with Kenny Laguna, her newly acquired producer.  This was to be the first of many Jett/Laguna collaborations, as they were inseparable from that moment in 1979 to the present day. \n\nTwo videos were shot for \"Little Liar\", the first, a concept video, feature a slightly confusing storyline with two Joans (one in white, one in black) interacting. After seeing the result of the first Little Liar video, Jett was unhappy with the silliness and visual translation so immediately shot a new live video (synced with the studio version of the song) for this track.

The song eventually turned up again on the Jett fan-club only CD 1979. For Record Store Day in 2015, the track was included on the [https://www.turntablelab.com/products/joan-jett-the-first-sessions-colored-vinyl-vinyl-lp-record-store-day limited edition (4000 split color vinyl)  LP \"The First Sessions\"] documenting the first several songs Joan wrote with Kenny Laguna, her newly acquired producer.  This was to be the first of many Jett/Laguna collaborations, as they were inseparable from that moment in 1979 to the present day. \n\nTwo videos were shot for \"Little Liar\", the first, a concept video, feature a slightly confusing storyline with two Joans (one in white, one in black) interacting. After seeing the result of the first Little Liar video, Jett was unhappy with the silliness and visual translation so immediately shot a new live video (synced with the studio version of the song) for this track.
