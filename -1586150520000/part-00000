Hubbard published at least 31 scientific papers devoted to vision.\n\n==Social commentary and political activity==\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hubbard became interested in social and political dimensions of biological issues. In her book ''The Politics of Women's Biology'', she wrote that she had been a \"devout scientist\" from 1947 until the late 1960s, but the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[women's liberation movement]] led her to change her priorities.\n\nHubbard describes an instance where she was working with squid as one of the pivotal moments where her interests shifted from scientific research to social relevance. Despite working with squid, cattle, and frogs for years when researching the complexities of vision, at that instant it suddenly began to bother her. She said, \u201cI began to have the feeling that nothing I could find out was worth killing another squid.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAround the same time in the late 1960s, as a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Ruth was asked to give a talk about being a female in the sciences. While conducting interviews of her fellow female scientists, Hubbard discovered that they were all in similar situations. Each of the women were accomplished in their fields, yet none of them had real jobs.<ref name=\":0\" /> They all had what Ruth called \u201cnonjobs.\u201d They had titles such as lecturer or associate which meant they had little to no job security, while their male-counterparts were either on the path to professorships or had already received tenure.<ref name=\":3\" /> This led Ruth and others to join a group that petitioned Harvard to reevaluate the job statuses of its female faculty. Ruth Hubbard was the first woman to be offered a Harvard tenure professorship in the Biology Department in 1973.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter being promoted in 1973 from what she called the \"typical women's ghetto\" of \"research associate and lecturer\" positions to a tenured faculty position at Harvard, she felt increased freedom to pursue new interests.<ref>Ruth Hubbard (1990), ''The Politics of Women's Biology'', Rutgers University Press. pp. 1\u20132. {{ISBN|0-8135-1490-8}}.</ref>\n\nOne such interest manifested itself in the new seminar course she taught at Harvard titled \u201cBiology 109 - Biology and Women\u2019s Issues.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> The class looked at the role of women in science and how the absence of women in scientific fields had affected the scientific questions that were asked.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, Ruth gave several interviews challenging the power structure in STEM fields. What constitutes science, she told the Globe in 1990, usually is decided by \u201ca self-perpetuating, self-reflexive group: by the chosen for the chosen,\u201d and those \u201cchosen\u201d historically were upper-class white men.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/09/04/ruth-hubbard-first-woman-tenured-biology-harvard/zdiRSECiShE4rAJaCBNNTP/story.html|title=Ruth Hubbard, 92, first woman tenured in biology at Harvard - The Boston Globe|last=Reporter|first=Bryan Marquard-|website=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> \u201cWomen and nonwhite, working-class and poor men have largely been outside the process of science-making,\u201d Dr. Hubbard told The New York Times in 1981. \u201cThough we have been described by scientists, by and large we have not been the describers and definers of scientific reality.

And where to look for that identity if not in our genes?<ref>Ruth Hubbard (June 7, 2006), [http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Hubbard/ Race & Genes]. raceandgenomics.ssrc.org</ref></blockquote>Ruth also became a critic of recombinant DNA research, in a time when the field was booming. She was concerned that people were attempting to assign every trait, disease, and behavior a genetic cause, leading to an oversimplification of science which does not consider the complexities of nature and outside factors. She termed this craze \u201cgenomania.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> She was also worried about the safeguards surrounding such research. In a letter published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Hubbard stated that if an epidemic caused by a recombinant organism were to break out, it would be almost impossible to distinguish it from the natural E. coli strains that humans are already exposed to.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HUBBARD|first=R.|date=1976-09-03|title=Recombinant DNA: Unknown Risks|journal=Science|volume=193|issue=4256|pages=834\u2013836|doi=10.1126/science.193.4256.834-a|pmid=17753611|issn=0036-8075|bibcode=1976Sci...193..834H}}</ref>\n\n===Commentary on gender and science===\nIn her essay \"Science and Science Criticism,\" published in 2001 as a chapter of ''The Gender and Science Reader'', Hubbard iterates that she is a scientist and states that \"[n]ature is part of history and culture\", but not vice versa. She goes on to say that scientists are largely unable to grasp the concept of nature being part of life--- noting how she needed several years to understand the statement. Going into her scientific history, the narrator mentions how she originally never questioned how her efforts fit into society. Narrowing her focus, she exposits that the Vietnam-era women's rights  and [[women's liberation movement]]s helped teach her of the roles of science in society.<ref name=GenderScienceReader/>\n\nShe continues forth with the various means of debate for both sides. One notable instance from men is when they revive various old and unfounded biological theories on women to justify the typical subservient positions of the female gender. Hubbard even refers to the means of debate as \"breathing new life\" into old theories and assumptions. She further exposits the issues revolving around gender equality that were mainly brought to her attention by how she and her colleagues suddenly started getting promoted from their \"ghetto\" lab positions right into proper titles. She promptly stresses that \"[she believes] the subject of women's biology is profoundly political\", explaining away the book's title as she does so. Proceeding onward her desire to go beyond \"defining [women as a whole] as victims of male power and dominance,\" and pushes for women everywhere to show independence and individuality while learning to accept and embrace the biology that's continuously used by men to undermine them. To follow up, she goes on to talk about women's health activists re-educating women on the functions of their body and goes on to encourage women to use the re-education to attain great power by eliminating the footholds of male misinformation and misrepresentation of their bodies.<ref name=GenderScienceReader>{{cite book| chapter=Science and Science Criticism |title=The Gender and Science Reader| pages=49\u201351| author=Ruth Hubbard |editors=Muriel Lederman, Ingrid Bartsch |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2001 |isbn=9780415213585}}</ref>\n\nThe essay asserts that women scientists must ultimately and paradoxically turn away from the sciences to make their stand against male supremacy as opposed to the many female and [[feminist]] poets, novelists, and artists that can illustrate their points clearly and easily. She notes that politics seems to vanish within the sciences, exemplifying this point by noting social classes aren't a specific category listed under US health studies. The point she makes is that social and political realities can be blended or integrated subtly into all mediums. The subtlety of the integration ultimately creates great difficulty in discerning fact from [[prejudice]]. In addition, artists, novelists, and poets can compose their works without being victim to review under the funding agencies that makes the use of scientific fact tedious and less effective. The author leads in to surmise that the issues around [[women's rights]] must be raised and brought into public focus. After bringing up how science integrates itself into culture, she exemplifies the point by noting the prominence of biological terms in historical terminology and alluringly points out a biologist's tendency to place humanity above all other animals--- not unlike how men view women and their desire for equality. She raises the question of whether or not women can improve the sciences but makes an attempt to bring into attention her belief that women can make an impact. Hubbard closes by saying that scientists never want their work to be forgotten and lost, and that she sides with feminism for political insight and analytic testing on the scientific assumptions about women.<ref name=GenderScienceReader/>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Ruth Hubbard and George Wald 1967.jpg|thumb|Hubbard and Wald in 1967]]\nRuth Hoffman was married to WWII GI and fellow Harvard graduate Frank Hubbard in 1942.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" /> Ruth fondly remembered the months that the pair spent traveling via motorcycle across Europe as Frank researched harpsichords.

Wald was a Professor of Biology and Ruth\u2019s boss in the research lab. However, the two began and kept their love affair a secret for more than a decade since they were married to other people at the time. After their respective divorces to previous partners, Ruth and George married in 1958.<ref name=\":5\" /> The couple had two children: a son, musician and music historian Elijah Wald, and a daughter, attorney Deborah Wald.<ref name=\"dowling2\" /> Hubbard would go on to publish a book, ''Exploding the Gene Myth'', with her son Elijah.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBoth Ruth and her brother Alexander followed in the footsteps of their activist parents.

Hubbard published at least 31 scientific papers devoted to vision.\n\n==Social commentary and political activity==\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hubbard became interested in social and political dimensions of biological issues. In her book ''The Politics of Women's Biology'', she wrote that she had been a \"devout scientist\" from 1947 until the late 1960s, but the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[women's liberation movement]] led her to change her priorities.\n\nHubbard describes an instance where she was working with squid as one of the pivotal moments where her interests shifted from scientific research to social relevance. Despite working with squid, cattle, and frogs for years when researching the complexities of vision, at that instant it suddenly began to bother her. She said, \u201cI began to have the feeling that nothing I could find out was worth killing another squid.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAround the same time in the late 1960s, as a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Ruth was asked to give a talk about being a female in the sciences.

Each of the women were accomplished in their fields, yet none of them had real jobs.<ref name=\":0\" /> They all had what Ruth called \u201cnonjobs.\u201d They had titles such as lecturer or associate which meant they had little to no job security, while their male-counterparts were either on the path to professorships or had already received tenure.<ref name=\":3\" /> This led Ruth and others to join a group that petitioned Harvard to reevaluate the job statuses of its female faculty.

And where to look for that identity if not in our genes?<ref>Ruth Hubbard (June 7, 2006), [http://raceandgenomics.ssrc.org/Hubbard/ Race & Genes]. raceandgenomics.ssrc.org</ref></blockquote>Ruth also became a critic of recombinant DNA research, in a time when the field was booming. She was concerned that people were attempting to assign every trait, disease, and behavior a genetic cause, leading to an oversimplification of science which does not consider the complexities of nature and outside factors. She termed this craze \u201cgenomania.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> She was also worried about the safeguards surrounding such research. In a letter published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Hubbard stated that if an epidemic caused by a recombinant organism were to break out, it would be almost impossible to distinguish it from the natural E. coli strains that humans are already exposed to.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HUBBARD|first=R.|date=1976-09-03|title=Recombinant DNA: Unknown Risks|journal=Science|volume=193|issue=4256|pages=834\u2013836|doi=10.1126/science.193.4256.834-a|pmid=17753611|issn=0036-8075|bibcode=1976Sci...193..834H}}</ref>\n\n===Commentary on gender and science===\nIn her essay \"Science and Science Criticism,\" published in 2001 as a chapter of ''The Gender and Science Reader'', Hubbard iterates that she is a scientist and states that \"[n]ature is part of history and culture\", but not vice versa. She goes on to say that scientists are largely unable to grasp the concept of nature being part of life--- noting how she needed several years to understand the statement. Going into her scientific history, the narrator mentions how she originally never questioned how her efforts fit into society. Narrowing her focus, she exposits that the Vietnam-era women's rights  and [[women's liberation movement]]s helped teach her of the roles of science in society.<ref name=GenderScienceReader/>\n\nShe continues forth with the various means of debate for both sides. One notable instance from men is when they revive various old and unfounded biological theories on women to justify the typical subservient positions of the female gender. Hubbard even refers to the means of debate as \"breathing new life\" into old theories and assumptions. She further exposits the issues revolving around gender equality that were mainly brought to her attention by how she and her colleagues suddenly started getting promoted from their \"ghetto\" lab positions right into proper titles. She promptly stresses that \"[she believes] the subject of women's biology is profoundly political\", explaining away the book's title as she does so. Proceeding onward her desire to go beyond \"defining [women as a whole] as victims of male power and dominance,\" and pushes for women everywhere to show independence and individuality while learning to accept and embrace the biology that's continuously used by men to undermine them. To follow up, she goes on to talk about women's health activists re-educating women on the functions of their body and goes on to encourage women to use the re-education to attain great power by eliminating the footholds of male misinformation and misrepresentation of their bodies.<ref name=GenderScienceReader>{{cite book| chapter=Science and Science Criticism |title=The Gender and Science Reader| pages=49\u201351| author=Ruth Hubbard |editors=Muriel Lederman, Ingrid Bartsch |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2001 |isbn=9780415213585}}</ref>\n\nThe essay asserts that women scientists must ultimately and paradoxically turn away from the sciences to make their stand against male supremacy as opposed to the many female and [[feminist]] poets, novelists, and artists that can illustrate their points clearly and easily. She notes that politics seems to vanish within the sciences, exemplifying this point by noting social classes aren't a specific category listed under US health studies. The point she makes is that social and political realities can be blended or integrated subtly into all mediums. The subtlety of the integration ultimately creates great difficulty in discerning fact from [[prejudice]]. In addition, artists, novelists, and poets can compose their works without being victim to review under the funding agencies that makes the use of scientific fact tedious and less effective. The author leads in to surmise that the issues around [[women's rights]] must be raised and brought into public focus. After bringing up how science integrates itself into culture, she exemplifies the point by noting the prominence of biological terms in historical terminology and alluringly points out a biologist's tendency to place humanity above all other animals--- not unlike how men view women and their desire for equality. She raises the question of whether or not women can improve the sciences but makes an attempt to bring into attention her belief that women can make an impact. Hubbard closes by saying that scientists never want their work to be forgotten and lost, and that she sides with feminism for political insight and analytic testing on the scientific assumptions about women.<ref name=GenderScienceReader/>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Ruth Hubbard and George Wald 1967.jpg|thumb|Hubbard and Wald in 1967]]\nRuth Hoffman was married to WWII GI and fellow Harvard graduate Frank Hubbard in 1942.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" /> Ruth fondly remembered the months that the pair spent traveling via motorcycle across Europe as Frank researched harpsichords. The couple divorced in 1951.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbl.edu/obituaries/ruth-hubbard-wald/|title=Ruth Hubbard Wald|website=www.mbl.edu|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\nRuth had met her second husband, George Wald, while they were both at Harvard. Wald was a Professor of Biology and Ruth\u2019s boss in the research lab. However, the two began and kept their love affair a secret for more than a decade since they were married to other people at the time. After their respective divorces to previous partners, Ruth and George married in 1958.<ref name=\":5\" /> The couple had two children: a son, musician and music historian Elijah Wald, and a daughter, attorney Deborah Wald.<ref name=\"dowling2\" /> Hubbard would go on to publish a book, ''Exploding the Gene Myth'', with her son Elijah.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nBoth Ruth and her brother Alexander followed in the footsteps of their activist parents. Alexander Hoffman was a well-known lawyer and activist. Some of his high-profile clients included Cesar Chavez, Lenny Bruce, and multiple members of the Black Panther Party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2009-11-05/article/34033?headline=Remembering-Alexander-Hoffman|title=Remembering Alexander Hoffmann.
