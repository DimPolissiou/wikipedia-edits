He had been staying at the [[Playboy Club]], where he was to meet a connection who would pick up the marijuana. The connection was arrested for [[heroin]] smuggling, however he informed the authorities about Jung to get a reduced sentence.<ref name=\"interview\" /> After arguing with the judge about the purpose of sending a man to prison \"for crossing an imaginary line with a bunch of plants\",<ref name=\"mountain\" /> Jung was sent to the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury]].<ref name=\"wayward son BG\" />\n\n==Medell\u00edn Cartel==\nAt [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury|FCI Danbury]] during his [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] [[Illegal drug trade|trafficking]] sentence, March 1974, Jung's cellmate was [[Carlos Lehder|Carlos Lehder Rivas]], a young [[German Colombian]] man who introduced Jung to the dominant and powerful international drug-trafficking [[Medell\u00edn Cartel]]; in return, Jung taught Lehder about smuggling. (Miguel El Cart\u00e8r/Associate) In April 1975, when Jung and Lehder were released, they went into business together. Their plan was to fly hundreds of kilograms of [[cocaine]] from [[Pablo Escobar]]'s Colombian ranch to the U.S., and Jung's [[California]] connection, Richard Barile, would take it from there.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Jung had a security man who would accompany him to the exchanges, where Jung would give the man the keys to a car and half the cocaine, and then leave.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A day or two later, they would meet again and exchange keys to cars.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThough only the middle man, Jung made millions off the operation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He came up with the idea to steal single-engine airplanes for his transportation and charge $10,000 per kilogram, with five planes going from Colombia to California, carrying 300 kilograms per plane: this equated to $15 million per run for Jung. In the 1970s Jung was earning $3 million to $5 million per day.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} To avoid the need of [[money laundering|laundering]] his earnings, he kept his money in the national bank of Panama.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nBy the late 1970s, Lehder had effectively cut Jung out, by going straight to Barile.

(Miguel El Cart\u00e8r/Associate) In April 1975, when Jung and Lehder were released, they went into business together.
