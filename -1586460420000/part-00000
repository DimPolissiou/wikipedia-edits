{"title_page": "Halfback (American football)", "text_new": "{{short description|Offensive position in American football}}\n[[File:20090104 Adrian Peterson (28).JPG|{{largethumb}}|[[Adrian Peterson]] lined up at halfback]]\nA '''halfback''' ('''HB''') is an [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] position in [[American football]], whose duties involve lining up in the [[backfield]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050425171507/http://images.nfl.com/fans/images/how_players_lineup.jpg Halfback lineup in a play] archived from NFL.com</ref> and [[Carry (gridiron football)|carrying]] the [[Ball (gridiron football)|ball]] on most [[Rush (gridiron football)|rushing]] [[American football plays|play]]s, i.e. a [[running back]].  When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield, and especially when that player is placed behind another player (usually a [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]] back), as in the [[I formation]], that player is instead referred to as a '''tailback''' (see [[Halfback (American football)#History|History]] below).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usafootball.com/resource-center/coaching/coaches-guide/?id=17&p=37|title=USA Football|website=www.usafootball.com}}</ref><ref>[http://football.about.com/cs/football101/g/gl_halfback.htm Halfback info] at about.com</ref>\n\nThe halfback position is one of the more glamorous positions on the field, and is commonly viewed as a requirement for a team's success.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120716183700/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n42_v222/ai_21227621 Halfback job type] at findarticles.com</ref> Sometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as he is an [[eligible receiver]]. Occasionally, they line up as additional wide receivers. When not running or catching the ball, the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking, either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football.\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Adrian Peterson and AJ Hawk.jpg|thumb|Adrian Peterson running with the ball]]\n\nBefore the emergence of the [[T-formation]] in the 1940s, all members of the offensive backfield were legitimate threats to run or pass the ball.  Most teams used four offensive backs on every play: a [[quarterback]], two halfbacks, and a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]]. The quarterback began each play a quarter of the way back, the halfbacks began each play side by side and halfway back, and the fullback began each play the farthest back.\n\nHistorically, from the 1870s through the 1950s, the halfback position was both an offensive and defensive position. Now that most offensive formations have only one or two [[running back]]s, the original designations do not mean as much, as the fullback is now usually a lead blocker (technically a halfback), while the halfback or tailback (called such because he stands at the \"tail\" of the I) lines up behind the fullback. There has also been a shift in most offense's dependence on halfbacks, as the quarterback is now generally considered the most essential part of a team. However, the average output of the halfback has not changed.\n\nIn the related sport of [[Canadian football]], [[Halfback (Canadian football)|halfback]] is usually a [[defense (sports)|defensive]] rather than offensive position since the 1980s, though used to also refer to an [[offense (sports)|offensive]] position similar to a [[slotback]] that could line up off the tight end or behind the quarterback. Older systems require the halfback be proficient at throwing the ball downfield as well.\n\nMany of the \"scat backs\" in the modern era produce more total yards and touchdowns than their ancestor \"power backs\" by breaking off big plays on outside runs and receptions. The [[spread offense]] and the [[hurry-up offense]] change the halfback's role but create more opportunity for these plays. The spread, the hurry-up, and the [[pro-style offense]]s dominate American football but the \"smash-mouth\" style of play is far from extinct. A power-running scheme is often utilized to counter an effective Spread attack, as it allows a team to control the clock and keep the ball out of the opposing offense's control. This strategy is utilized in NFL, college, and all other forms of American football. The need for \"power backs\" is very prevalent, alongside the need for \"scat backs\", and anything in between.\n\nIn the past few decades the role of the halfback has gone through a great shift as most offensive game plans are now fueled by creativity and finesse instead of raw force. Stamina and durability is more important than ever in the hurry-up offense. On the other hand, speed is often valued over strength, and pass-catching ability is sometimes valued over blocking proficiency. Power was once the most desired trait in a halfback, but has been over taken by the need for a diverse skill set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/story/2012-08-27/nfl-running-backs-Ray-Rice-Michael-Turner/57400806/1|title=Ravens' Ray Rice leads running back evolution|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the last few decades the running back's individual share of offensive output has declined as quarterbacks are generally treated as the cornerstone of the offense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/19/football-evolved-the-hurry-up-offense-and-the-running-back/|title=Football Evolved: The Hurry-Up Offense And The Running Back|date=19 August 2013|publisher=}}</ref> The demands of an up-tempo offense also favor a multiple running back system.\n\nWhile the timeline differs for individual each player, running backs generally hit their peak between the ages of 22 and 28. A study conducted by [[Apex Fantasy Leagues]] concluded that about 84 percent of peak seasons fall within that range.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/2020/02/the-peak-age-for-an-nfl-running-back/|title=The Peak Age For An NFL Running Back|date=2020-02-05|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\n===Smash mouth football===\nFrom the dawn of American football through the 1880s most offensive schemes focused on the running game. In a running based game plan the halfback was typically the cornerstone of the offense. This system focused on a physical run attack concentrated in the inside of the field, and therefore depended on a skilled \"power back.\" There were no forward passes, and pure speed took a backseat to tackle-breaking and [[Dive (American football)|bucking]] ability. There was a focus on physicality over finesse, as this type of playing style earned the moniker of [[smashmouth offense|\"smash mouth\" football]].\n[[File:Willie Heston (bentley image).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Willie Heston]], a great early power back]]\nBack [[Willie Heston]] of [[Fielding Yost]]'s \"point-a-minute\" [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] team has been acknowledged as the first to play at what later was designated as the tailback position on offense.  Prior to Heston, left halfbacks ran plays in one direction, and right halfbacks ran plays in the other direction. Because of Heston's speed and agility, Yost placed Heston in the tailback position so that he could carry the ball on plays to either side of the line.<ref name=Arch>{{cite news|author=Arch Ward|title=Remember Him?  Willie Heston of Michigan, Whose Plunging Forced Opponents to Use Seven Man Line|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |date=1936-12-28}}</ref>\n\nHeston's charging ability and open-field running have also been credited with leading to the origin of the \"[[Seven-man line defense#7\u20131\u20132\u20131 defense|seven man line and a diamond on defense]].\"<ref name=Arch /> Minnesota's [[College Football Hall of Fame]] coaching staff of [[Henry L.

Halfback [[Jim Thorpe]] rushed for some 2,000 yards in 1912 as a member of the [[1912 Carlisle Indians football team|Carlisle Indians]]. In 1928, [[Ken Strong]] accounted for some 3,000 yards.

Like the wide receiver, who generally cannot make big plays without the quarterback passing to him (with the exception of the [[end-around]] play), the halfback needs good blocking from the offensive line and fullback to successfully gain yardage. Also, a halfback will generally have more rushing attempts than a receiver will have receptions. This is mainly because most football teams have one primary halfback to receive most of the carries, while successful passes will generally be spread between a number of different receivers (wide receivers, tight ends, running backs). The ability to protect the football on the run is the principal skill required of a running back. For an offense to succeed the ball has to be protected, and defensive attempts at stripping the ball will largely occur during runs on the inside of the playing field.\n\nHalfbacks are expected to have good on-field \"vision\" in that they can identify open lanes on the field to run through. Hall-of-Famer [[Emmitt Smith]] of the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Le'Veon Bell]] of the [[New York Jets]], for example, are renowned for their patient running styles and ability to quickly identify lanes created by blockers, despite not being known for their speed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000772625/article/has-leveon-bell-created-a-new-rushing-style |title=Has Le'Veon Bell created a new rushing style? |date=January 17, 2017 |website=NFL.com |language=en |access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Harry Gilmer - 1948 Bowman.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Harry Gilmer]] catching a football.]]\n\n===Receiving ===\nIn addition to skill at running the ball, some halfbacks in the [[National Football League]] are known for their skill at catching passes. The role of the halfback as a receiver out of the backfield has expanded greatly in the NFL over the years, and a versatile halfback who provides his team with running and pass-catching abilities is highly valued. On passing plays, a halfback will often run a safe route, such as a hook, creating a safe target for a quarterback to throw to if all other receivers are covered.  The increase in demand for halfbacks with good receiving abilities can be attributed to the rise in popularity of the [[West Coast offense]] and its variants, which often requires its halfbacks to catch passes on a regular basis.  A great early example of a system that combined accomplished rushing skills with receiving ability is the offense of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] of the 1980s and 1990s under [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] and [[George Seifert]].  Their teams featured two [[Pro Bowl]] running backs who also had excellent receiving skills in [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] and [[Ricky Watters]].  Craig became the first player in NFL history to both rush and receive more than 1,000 yards in a season.  Currently [[Marshall Faulk]] is one of the top 20 pass catchers in NFL history. A good example of a dual threat running and pass-catching halfback is [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]; in 2003, while with the [[San Diego Chargers]], Tomlinson rushed for 1,645 yards and caught 100 passes for 725 yards, giving him 2,370 total yards from the line of scrimmage, and he became the first NFL player ever to rush for over 1,000 yards and catch 100 passes in a season.\n\nSome teams have a halfback who is more skilled at catching short passes than the starting halfback on the team, and/or is better at pass blocking or \"picking up the blitz\" than that of the other backs. Known as a \"third down\" back, he is often put in the game in third down and long situations where a pass is needed to pick up a first down. He can also be used to fool the defense by making them think he is being put into the game for a pass play, when the play is actually a run. [[Darren Sproles]] was one of the most prominent examples of a \"third down\" back. While never considered a workhorse back partly due to his diminutive 5'6\" stature, Sproles was effective due to his elusiveness and ability to catch and block, enjoying a 14-year career with over 4,800 career receiving yards as a result.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadspin.com/darren-sproles-is-everything-he-shouldnt-have-been-1828835324 |title=Darren Sproles Is Everything He Shouldn't Have Been |last=O'Connell |first=Robert |date=September 6, 2018 |website=Deadspin |language=en-US |access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref> Current examples of these third down backs include [[Tarik Cohen]] of the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Duke Johnson]] of the [[Houston Texans]], [[Chris Thompson (running back)|Chris Thompson]] of the [[Washington Redskins]] and [[James White (running back)|James White]] of the [[New England Patriots]].\n\n===Blocking===\nHalfbacks are also required to help the offensive line in passing situations, and, in the case of the [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], running plays. Halfbacks will often block blitzing linebackers or safeties on passing plays when the offensive line is occupied with the defensive linemen. On running plays, the fullback will often attempt to create a hole in the defensive line for the halfback to run through. Effective blocking backs are usually key components for a running back's success (as seen in LaDainian Tomlinson record-breaking season in 2006).\n\n===Physical characteristics===\n[[File:Marshawn_Lynch_Vegas.jpg|thumb|180px|Cal halfback [[Marshawn Lynch]].]]\nThere is a great diversity in those who play at the running back position. At one extreme are smaller, faster players. These fast, agile, and elusive running backs are often called \"scat backs\" because their low center of gravity and maneuverability allow them to dodge tacklers. Hall-of-famer [[Barry Sanders]] of the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]] exemplified this running style. \"Scat backs\" still active in the NFL include [[LeSean McCoy]] of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Tevin Coleman]] of the [[San Francisco 49ers]], [[Christian McCaffrey]] of the [[Carolina Panthers]] and [[Alvin Kamara]] of the [[New Orleans Saints]]. This type of running back has grown in demand due to changes in offensive play calling, style, and tempo. The trending spread offense demands a player that can utilize open space as much as possible as run blockers are sacrificed to spread out the defense.<ref name=\"Livestrong Types\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.livestrong.com/article/470925-types-of-football-running-backs/ |title=Types of Football Running Backs |last=Silverman |first=Steve |website=LIVESTRONG.COM |language=en |access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref>\n\nAt the other extreme are \"power backs\": bigger, stronger players who can break through tackles using brute strength and raw power. They are usually (but not always) slower runners compared to other backs, and typically run straight ahead (or \"North-and-South\" in football terminology) rather than dodging to the outside edges of the playing field (i.e. running \"East-and-West\") like shorter, quicker, lighter backs will often do. Power backs from previous generations such as [[Jim Brown]] and [[Larry Csonka]] were often classified as [[fullback (American football)|fullbacks]], but halfbacks such as [[Jerome Bettis]] and [[Steven Jackson]] also exemplify the power back position. More recent examples include [[Marshawn Lynch]], [[LeGarrette Blount]], [[Frank Gore]] of the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Leonard Fournette]] of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blackandteal.com/2017/06/30/jacksonville-jaguars-leonard-fournette-power/ |title=Jacksonville Jaguars: Leonard Fournette is about more than power |last=Sims |first=Luke |date=2017-06-30 |website=Black and Teal |language=en-US |access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> and [[Derrick Henry]] of the [[Tennessee Titans]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://titansized.com/2017/12/29/derrick-henrys-punishing-running-style-propel-titans-postseason/ |title=Derrick Henry\u2019s punishing running style could propel Titans to postseason |last=Brandon Morales 1 year ago |date=2017-12-29 |website=Titan Sized |language=en-US |access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> For many years the \u201cpower\u201d running back was the central component of an offense. In that time period formations and rhythm favored this type of player. This sort of offensive scheme is now a rarity, as \u201cpower backs\u201d take on supporting roles behind faster and more versatile running backs.<ref name=\"Livestrong Types\" />\n\nIn the modern age, an \u201cevery-down\u201d halfback has to have a combination of running ability, pass-catching ability, and blocking ability. The \"every-down\" designation comes from a running back's ability to perform important functions beyond rushing on the ever-increasing number of passing plays such as receiving the ball and pass-blocking for their quarterback. A primary running back also needs abundant stamina to remain consistent in an up-tempo offense. Backs such as [[Walter Payton]] and [[Emmitt Smith]] were appraised for their versatile running styles and abilities. More recent examples include [[Adrian Peterson]], [[Todd Gurley]] of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and [[Melvin Gordon]] of the [[Los Angeles Chargers]].<ref name=\"Livestrong Types\" />\n\n===Goal line backs===\nMany teams also have a halfback designated as a \"goal line back\" or \"short yardage specialist\".  This halfback comes into the game in short yardage situations when the offense needs only one to five yards to get a first down.  They also come into the game when the offense nears the goal-line.  Normally when an offense gets inside the 5-yard line they send in their goal-line formation which usually includes eight blockers, a quarterback, a halfback, and a fullback.  The closer they are to the goal-line the more likely they are to use this formation. If a certain halfback is used often near the goal-line he is called the goal-line back.  Short yardage and goal-line backs are usually larger power backs that are not prone to [[fumble|fumbling]].  Their job is to get the first down or touchdown by muscling through or pushing a large mass of players that are being blocked without dropping the ball.\n\n===Special teams===\nA halfback might be called upon to return [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]s and [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]s on special teams. Although this is most often done by [[wide receiver]]s and [[defensive back]]s, such as [[cornerback]]s (because they are generally the fastest players on the team), some halfbacks have enough speed and talent to perform this role. The NFL's current all-time leading in kickoff return yards (14,014 yards) and punt return yards (4,999) by a halfback is [[Brian Mitchell (American football)|Brian Mitchell]]. He also gained 1,967 rushing yards, 2,336 receiving yards, and 15 fumble return yards, giving him a total of 23,330 all-purpose yards, the second most in NFL history behind [[Jerry Rice]]. A halfback, typically a back-up, can also play [[upback]], which is a blocking back who lines up approximately 1\u20133 yards behind the line of scrimmage in punting situations and usually receive snaps on a [[fake punt]].\n\n===Passing===\n[[File:Ronnie Brown throwing out of Wildcat Jets-Dolphin game, Nov 2009 - 039.jpg|thumb|Halfback Ronnie Brown throwing out of the wildcat.]]\nOn rare occasions, and in the early days of the sport, a halfback is asked to throw the ball when running a [[Halfback option play|HB option]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133024/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4340080/Option-football-from-eternity-to.html Halfback option] at ecnext.com.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000510090910/http://www.football.com/playbook/option.shtml Halfback option play] at football.com.</ref> This play is generally referred to as a half-back pass, regardless if the player throwing the football is a tailback or fullback. This play is risky because most halfbacks are inexperienced passers, and so it is often run only by certain halfbacks more skilled at passing than most. The halfback can also throw the ball while running a direct snap play where the center snaps the ball to halfback directly. This has become particular in teams that use the [[Wildcat formation]], most prominently the [[Miami Dolphins]], where running back [[Ronnie Brown]] would run, pass, and receive out of this set.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Halfback (Canadian football)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://football.about.com/cs/football101/a/positionoff.htm  Football 101: Basic Football positions]\n\n{{American football positions}}\n\n[[Category:American football positions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Offensive position in American football}}\n[[File:20090104 Adrian Peterson (28).JPG|{{largethumb}}|[[Adrian Peterson]] lined up at halfback]]\nA '''halfback''' ('''HB''') is an [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] position in [[American football]], whose duties involve lining up in the [[backfield]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050425171507/http://images.nfl.com/fans/images/how_players_lineup.jpg Halfback lineup in a play] archived from NFL.com</ref> and [[Carry (gridiron football)|carrying]] the [[Ball (gridiron football)|ball]] on most [[Rush (gridiron football)|rushing]] [[American football plays|play]]s, i.e. a [[running back]].  When the principal ball carrier lines up deep in the backfield, and especially when that player is placed behind another player (usually a [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]] back), as in the [[I formation]], that player is instead referred to as a '''tailback''' (see [[Halfback (American football)#History|History]] below).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usafootball.com/resource-center/coaching/coaches-guide/?id=17&p=37|title=USA Football|website=www.usafootball.com}}</ref><ref>[http://football.about.com/cs/football101/g/gl_halfback.htm Halfback info] at about.com</ref>\n\nThe halfback position is one of the more glamorous positions on the field, and is commonly viewed as a requirement for a team's success.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120716183700/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n42_v222/ai_21227621 Halfback job type] at findarticles.com</ref> Sometimes the halfback can catch the ball from the backfield on short passing plays as he is an [[eligible receiver]]. Occasionally, they line up as additional wide receivers. When not running or catching the ball, the primary responsibility of a halfback is to aid the offensive linemen in blocking, either to protect the quarterback or another player carrying the football.\n\n==History==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Adrian Peterson and AJ Hawk.jpg|thumb|Adrian Peterson running with the ball]]\n\nBefore the emergence of the [[T-formation]] in the 1940s, all members of the offensive backfield were legitimate threats to run or pass the ball.  Most teams used four offensive backs on every play: a [[quarterback]], two halfbacks, and a [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]]. The quarterback began each play a quarter of the way back, the halfbacks began each play side by side and halfway back, and the fullback began each play the farthest back.\n\nHistorically, from the 1870s through the 1950s, the halfback position was both an offensive and defensive position. Now that most offensive formations have only one or two [[running back]]s, the original designations do not mean as much, as the fullback is now usually a lead blocker (technically a halfback), while the halfback or tailback (called such because he stands at the \"tail\" of the I) lines up behind the fullback. There has also been a shift in most offense's dependence on halfbacks, as the quarterback is now generally considered the most essential part of a team. However, the average output of the halfback has not changed.\n\nIn the related sport of [[Canadian football]], [[Halfback (Canadian football)|halfback]] is usually a [[defense (sports)|defensive]] rather than offensive position since the 1980s, though used to also refer to an [[offense (sports)|offensive]] position similar to a [[slotback]] that could line up off the tight end or behind the quarterback. Older systems require the halfback be proficient at throwing the ball downfield as well.\n\nMany of the \"scat backs\" in the modern era produce more total yards and touchdowns than their ancestor \"power backs\" by breaking off big plays on outside runs and receptions. The [[spread offense]] and the [[hurry-up offense]] change the halfback's role but create more opportunity for these plays. The spread, the hurry-up, and the [[pro-style offense]]s dominate American football but the \"smash-mouth\" style of play is far from extinct. A power-running scheme is often utilized to counter an effective Spread attack, as it allows a team to control the clock and keep the ball out of the opposing offense's control. This strategy is utilized in NFL, college, and all other forms of American football. The need for \"power backs\" is very prevalent, alongside the need for \"scat backs\", and anything in between.\n\nIn the past few decades the role of the halfback has gone through a great shift as most offensive game plans are now fueled by creativity and finesse instead of raw force. Stamina and durability is more important than ever in the hurry-up offense. On the other hand, speed is often valued over strength, and pass-catching ability is sometimes valued over blocking proficiency. Power was once the most desired trait in a halfback, but has been over taken by the need for a diverse skill set.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/story/2012-08-27/nfl-running-backs-Ray-Rice-Michael-Turner/57400806/1|title=Ravens' Ray Rice leads running back evolution|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the last few decades the running back's individual share of offensive output has declined as quarterbacks are generally treated as the cornerstone of the offense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/08/19/football-evolved-the-hurry-up-offense-and-the-running-back/|title=Football Evolved: The Hurry-Up Offense And The Running Back|date=19 August 2013|publisher=}}</ref> The demands of an up-tempo offense also favor a multiple running back system.\n\nWhile the timeline differs for individual each player, running backs generally hit their peak between the ages of 22 and 28. A study conducted by Apex Fantasy Leagues concluded that about 84 percent of peak seasons fall within that range.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apexfantasyleagues.com/2020/02/the-peak-age-for-an-nfl-running-back/|title=The Peak Age For An NFL Running Back|date=2020-02-05|website=Apex Fantasy Football Money Leagues|access-date=2020-02-17}}</ref>\n\n===Smash mouth football===\nFrom the dawn of American football through the 1880s most offensive schemes focused on the running game. In a running based game plan the halfback was typically the cornerstone of the offense. This system focused on a physical run attack concentrated in the inside of the field, and therefore depended on a skilled \"power back.\" There were no forward passes, and pure speed took a backseat to tackle-breaking and [[Dive (American football)|bucking]] ability. There was a focus on physicality over finesse, as this type of playing style earned the moniker of [[smashmouth offense|\"smash mouth\" football]].\n[[File:Willie Heston (bentley image).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Willie Heston]], a great early power back]]\nBack [[Willie Heston]] of [[Fielding Yost]]'s \"point-a-minute\" [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] team has been acknowledged as the first to play at what later was designated as the tailback position on offense.  Prior to Heston, left halfbacks ran plays in one direction, and right halfbacks ran plays in the other direction. Because of Heston's speed and agility, Yost placed Heston in the tailback position so that he could carry the ball on plays to either side of the line.<ref name=Arch>{{cite news|author=Arch Ward|title=Remember Him?

More recent examples include [[Marshawn Lynch]], [[LeGarrette Blount]], [[Frank Gore]] of the [[Buffalo Bills]], [[Leonard Fournette]] of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://blackandteal.com/2017/06/30/jacksonville-jaguars-leonard-fournette-power/ |title=Jacksonville Jaguars: Leonard Fournette is about more than power |last=Sims |first=Luke |date=2017-06-30 |website=Black and Teal |language=en-US |access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> and [[Derrick Henry]] of the [[Tennessee Titans]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://titansized.com/2017/12/29/derrick-henrys-punishing-running-style-propel-titans-postseason/ |title=Derrick Henry\u2019s punishing running style could propel Titans to postseason |last=Brandon Morales 1 year ago |date=2017-12-29 |website=Titan Sized |language=en-US |access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> For many years the \u201cpower\u201d running back was the central component of an offense. In that time period formations and rhythm favored this type of player. This sort of offensive scheme is now a rarity, as \u201cpower backs\u201d take on supporting roles behind faster and more versatile running backs.<ref name=\"Livestrong Types\" />\n\nIn the modern age, an \u201cevery-down\u201d halfback has to have a combination of running ability, pass-catching ability, and blocking ability. The \"every-down\" designation comes from a running back's ability to perform important functions beyond rushing on the ever-increasing number of passing plays such as receiving the ball and pass-blocking for their quarterback. A primary running back also needs abundant stamina to remain consistent in an up-tempo offense. Backs such as [[Walter Payton]] and [[Emmitt Smith]] were appraised for their versatile running styles and abilities. More recent examples include [[Adrian Peterson]], [[Todd Gurley]] of the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and [[Melvin Gordon]] of the [[Los Angeles Chargers]].<ref name=\"Livestrong Types\" />\n\n===Goal line backs===\nMany teams also have a halfback designated as a \"goal line back\" or \"short yardage specialist\".  This halfback comes into the game in short yardage situations when the offense needs only one to five yards to get a first down.  They also come into the game when the offense nears the goal-line.  Normally when an offense gets inside the 5-yard line they send in their goal-line formation which usually includes eight blockers, a quarterback, a halfback, and a fullback.  The closer they are to the goal-line the more likely they are to use this formation. If a certain halfback is used often near the goal-line he is called the goal-line back.  Short yardage and goal-line backs are usually larger power backs that are not prone to [[fumble|fumbling]].  Their job is to get the first down or touchdown by muscling through or pushing a large mass of players that are being blocked without dropping the ball.\n\n===Special teams===\nA halfback might be called upon to return [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]s and [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]]s on special teams. Although this is most often done by [[wide receiver]]s and [[defensive back]]s, such as [[cornerback]]s (because they are generally the fastest players on the team), some halfbacks have enough speed and talent to perform this role. The NFL's current all-time leading in kickoff return yards (14,014 yards) and punt return yards (4,999) by a halfback is [[Brian Mitchell (American football)|Brian Mitchell]]. He also gained 1,967 rushing yards, 2,336 receiving yards, and 15 fumble return yards, giving him a total of 23,330 all-purpose yards, the second most in NFL history behind [[Jerry Rice]]. A halfback, typically a back-up, can also play [[upback]], which is a blocking back who lines up approximately 1\u20133 yards behind the line of scrimmage in punting situations and usually receive snaps on a [[fake punt]].\n\n===Passing===\n[[File:Ronnie Brown throwing out of Wildcat Jets-Dolphin game, Nov 2009 - 039.jpg|thumb|Halfback Ronnie Brown throwing out of the wildcat.]]\nOn rare occasions, and in the early days of the sport, a halfback is asked to throw the ball when running a [[Halfback option play|HB option]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133024/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4340080/Option-football-from-eternity-to.html Halfback option] at ecnext.com.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000510090910/http://www.football.com/playbook/option.shtml Halfback option play] at football.com.</ref> This play is generally referred to as a half-back pass, regardless if the player throwing the football is a tailback or fullback. This play is risky because most halfbacks are inexperienced passers, and so it is often run only by certain halfbacks more skilled at passing than most. The halfback can also throw the ball while running a direct snap play where the center snaps the ball to halfback directly. This has become particular in teams that use the [[Wildcat formation]], most prominently the [[Miami Dolphins]], where running back [[Ronnie Brown]] would run, pass, and receive out of this set.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Halfback (Canadian football)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://football.about.com/cs/football101/a/positionoff.htm  Football 101: Basic Football positions]\n\n{{American football positions}}\n\n[[Category:American football positions]]\n", "name_user": "Mbraude", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfback_(American_football)"}

In 1973 he was selected as a youth in the I Afro Latin American Games that were played in Mexico, and that same year he closed his youth participation in the I Central American Sports Games that were held in [[Guatemala City|Ciudad de Guatemala]].\n\nIn 1974 he played in the \u00a8B\u00a8 category at Laboratorios Jimenez, which was looking for his promotion to the Major League, but it was a year later when Escuintla's fans cheered him as a goal scorer, playing with the Aces of the Minar Tiquisate, was present in the rival goals with the amount of 24 goals, product of his imagination and creativity.\n\nIn 1976 he began his great trip playing with [[Comunicaciones F.C.|Comunicaciones]], where he played 8 years in his first stage. Together with players like [[Felix McDonald|F\u00e9lix McDonald]], [[Ram\u00f3n Zanabria]] and [[Byron P\u00e9rez]], they were part of the team that won the [[1978 CONCACAF Champions' Cup|CONCACAF Champions Cup 1978]] and the 1977-78 [[Liga Nacional de F\u00fatbol de Guatemala|league championship]]; He continued his successful career by finishing third in the [[UNCAF Interclub Cup|Central American Fraternity Cup]] that year. Sanchez would make both goals of the victory against the great rival, [[C.S.D. Municipal|CSD Municipal]] in the second round of the Central American zone and in the return his team ended up tied to zero. In the third round of Central America (end of the zone), Oscar in the first game scored the winning goal against [[Deportivo Saprissa]] of [[Costa Rica]] at minute 2 of the game and in the lap played in Guatemala he was again the figure of the match by remarking two goals at minutes 14th and 31st that would mean the classification of Comunicaciones and subsequently the consecration of the \"crema\" team of the [[1978 CONCACAF Champions' Cup|CONCACAF 1978 Champions' Cup]].\n\nHe was the top scorer in the league from the 1976 season to the 1979\u201380 season and holds the record for the most goals scored in a league with 41 in the 1977/78 season.\n\nIn 1977, Sanchez scored six goals in a 9\u20130 victory for Comunicaciones against [[Antigua GFC]], tying the historical record of Hugo \"Tin tan\" Pe\u00f1a of the league in 1961\n\nHe also scored five goals in a single game on two other occasions, one that same year against [[Tipograf\u00eda Nacional|Tipografia Nacional]] and the other in 1988 against [[Club Xelaj\u00fa MC|Xelaj\u00fa MC]] while playing for [[Cob\u00e1n Imperial|CSD Cob\u00e1n Imperial]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lahora.com.gt/02/03/12/paginas/deportes.htm#n4 |author=L\u00f3pez, Roberto |publisher=Diario La Hora, Guatemala |title=''\"'Pando' Ram\u00edrez se qued\u00f3 aun gol de igualar la marca\"'' |accessdate=2006-12-17 |language=es |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218082328/http://www.lahora.com.gt/02/03/12/paginas/deportes.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prensalibre.com/especiales/ME/guatefut/07.html |publisher=[[Prensa Libre (Guatemala)|Prensa Libre]], Guatemala |title=''Guatemala, 100 a\u00f1os de F\u00fatbol - 1979-1979'' |accessdate=2006-12-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128134913/http://www.prensalibre.com/especiales/ME/guatefut/07.html |archivedate=2006-11-28 |language=es |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.prensalibre.com/pl/2008/enero/31/217723.html Prensa Libre - Edici\u00f3n electr\u00f3nica - Deportes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the 1983 Summer Cup final, S\u00e1nchez scored a goal in the 60th minute in Comunicaciones 3\u20131 victory against Municipal.\n\nIn a friendly match played at the [[Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores|Estadio Mateo Flores]], S\u00e1nchez scored the only goal of the victory of his team Comunicaciones to [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] of [[Croatia]].\n\nAfter his departure from Comunicaciones, S\u00e1nchez played for the clubs [[CSD Municipal|Municipal]], [[Aurora FC]], [[Cob\u00e1n Imperial|Cob\u00e1n]], [[C.D.

Weeks later after performing at the Jayhawk Theatre in [[Topeka, Kansas]] on December 29, 1928, Rose reported Reed to the Topeka Police, and he was arrested. Rose had a concealed gun on her when she met Bobby at the police station. She pulled the trigger, but the safety was on. She then physically attacked her soon-to-be new son-in-law, and the police had to pry her off the hapless Reed. June soon married him, leaving both her family and the act. The marriage did not last, but the two remained on friendly terms. June's only child was a daughter, born April Rose Hyde (April 2, c. 1932, New York City {{spaced ndash}} December 28, 1998, [[Paris, France]]). A marriage license, dated November 30, 1928 for Ellen Hovick and Weldon Hyde, would seem to indicate that Bobby Reed's real name was Weldon Hyde.<ref>[http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=Numident&h=33377992&indiv=try&o_vc=Record:OtherRecord&rhSource=60541 Dates of birth and death of April Kent], familysearch.org; accessed August 6, 2014.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/10/theater/theater-the-real-june-is-still-singing-out.html?pagewanted=|title=The real June is still singing out|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=August 10, 2003|accessdate=December 22, 2011}}</ref> April became an actress in the 1950s known as '''April Kent'''.

Havoc moved to Hollywood in the late 1940s, and had roles in movies such as ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]''. Havoc and her sister continued to get demands for money and gifts from their mother until her death in 1954.<ref name=beck/>\n\nAfter their mother's death, the sisters then were free to write about her without risking a lawsuit. Lee's memoir, titled ''Gypsy'', was published in 1957 and was taken as inspirational material for the [[Jule Styne]], [[Stephen Sondheim]], and [[Arthur Laurents]] Broadway musical ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable]]''. Havoc did not like the way she was portrayed in the piece, which became a source of contention between the two, but gave her agreement in her sister's financial interest.

The usage of ''P'' vs ''p'' depends upon the field in which one is working, on the nearby presence of other symbols for quantities such as [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[momentum]], and on writing style.\n\n===Formula===\n{{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n[[File:Pressure force area.svg|200px|right]]\nMathematically:\n:<math>p = \\frac{F}{A},</math><ref name=\"Georgia State University, Physics & Astronomy\">{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/press.html |title=Pressure |accessdate=2018-06-14 }}</ref>\nwhere:\n:<math>p</math> is the pressure,\n:<math>F</math> is the magnitude of the [[normal force]],\n:<math>A</math> is the area of the surface on contact.\n\nPressure is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity. It relates the [[vector area]] element (a vector normal to the surface) with the [[normal force]] acting on it. The pressure is the scalar [[proportionality constant]] that relates the two normal vectors:\n:<math>d\\mathbf{F}_n = -p\\,d\\mathbf{A} = -p\\,\\mathbf{n}\\,dA.</math>\n\nThe minus sign comes from the fact that the force is considered towards the surface element, while the normal vector points outward. The equation has meaning in that, for any surface ''S'' in contact with the fluid, the total force exerted by the fluid on that surface is the [[surface integral]] over ''S'' of the right-hand side of the above equation.\n\nIt is incorrect (although rather usual) to say \"the pressure is directed in such or such direction\". The pressure, as a scalar, has no direction. The force given by the previous relationship to the quantity has a direction, but the pressure does not. If we change the orientation of the surface element, the direction of the normal force changes accordingly, but the pressure remains the same.\n\nPressure is distributed to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. It is a fundamental parameter in [[thermodynamics]], and it is [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].\n\n===Units===\n[[File:Barometer mercury column hg.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury column]]\nThe [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N/m<sup>2</sup>, or kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>). This name for the unit was added in 1971;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html |title=14th Conference of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures |publisher=Bipm.fr |accessdate=2012-03-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630020548/http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 }}</ref> before that, pressure in SI was expressed simply in newtons per square metre.\n\nOther units of pressure, such as [[pound-force per square inch|pounds per square inch]] (Ibf/in<sup>2</sup>)and [[bar (unit)|bar]], are also in common use. The [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|CGS]] unit of pressure is the [[barye]] (Ba), equal to 1&nbsp;dyn\u00b7cm<sup>\u22122</sup>, or 0.1&nbsp;Pa. Pressure is sometimes expressed in grams-force or kilograms-force per square centimetre (g/cm<sup>2</sup> or kg/cm<sup>2</sup><!--don't add an f to kg, this is making the point about usage without it-->) and the like without properly identifying the force units. But using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as units of force is expressly forbidden in SI. The [[technical atmosphere]] (symbol: at) is 1&nbsp;kgf/cm<sup>2</sup> (98.0665&nbsp;kPa, or 14.223&nbsp;psi).\n\nSince a system under pressure has the potential to perform work on its surroundings, pressure is a measure of potential energy stored per unit volume. It is therefore related to energy density and may be expressed in units such as [[joule]]s per cubic metre (J/m<sup>3</sup>, which is equal to Pa).\nMathematically:\n:<math>p = \\frac{F \\times \\text{distance}}{A \\times \\text{distance}} = \\frac{\\text{work}}{\\text{volume}} = \\frac{\\text{energy (J)}}{\\text{volume }(\\text{m}^3)}.</math>\n\nSome [[meteorologist]]s prefer the hectopascal (hPa) for atmospheric air pressure, which is equivalent to the older unit [[millibar]] (mbar). Similar pressures are given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, where the hecto- prefix is rarely used. The inch of mercury is still used in the United States. Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in [[decibar]]s (dbar) because pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth.\n \nThe [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately equal to typical air pressure at Earth [[mean sea level]] and is defined as {{val|101325|u=Pa}}.\n\nBecause pressure is commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a [[manometer]], pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., [[centimetres of water]], [[millimetres of mercury]] or [[inches of mercury]]). The most common choices are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's high density allows a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to be used to measure a given pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height ''h'' and density ''\u03c1'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''\u03c1gh''}}, where ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. When millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury are quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury; rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms of SI units.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} One millimetre of mercury is approximately equal to one [[torr]]. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a measured, rather than defined, quantity. These ''manometric units'' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are still common.\n\n[[Underwater diving|Underwater divers]] use the [[metre sea water]] (msw or MSW) and [[foot sea water]] (fsw or FSW) units of pressure, and these are the standard units for pressure gauges used to measure pressure exposure in [[diving chamber]]s and [[Dive computer|personal decompression computers]].

Although the force applied to the surface is the same, the thumbtack applies more pressure because the point concentrates that force into a smaller area. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. Unlike [[stress (physics)|stress]], pressure is defined as a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]]. The negative [[gradient]] of pressure is called the [[force density]].\n\nAnother example is a knife. If we try to cut with the flat edge, force is distributed over a larger surface area resulting in less pressure, and it will not cut. Whereas using the sharp edge, which has less surface area, results in greater pressure, and so the knife cuts smoothly. This is one example of a practical application of pressure.\n\nFor gases, pressure is sometimes measured not as an ''absolute pressure'', but relative to [[atmospheric pressure]]; such measurements are called ''gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues.

An example of this is the air pressure in an [[automobile]] [[tire]], which might be said to be \"{{convert|220|kPa|psi|abbr=on|lk=in}}\", but is actually 220&nbsp;kPa (32&nbsp;psi) above atmospheric pressure.

However, whenever equation-of-state properties, such as densities or changes in densities, must be calculated, pressures must be expressed in terms of their absolute values. For instance, if the atmospheric pressure is {{convert|100|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}, a gas (such as helium) at {{convert|200|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} (gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues.

Much debate has transpired on this issue.-->) ({{convert|200|kPa|psi|abbr=on|disp=or}} [absolute]). Focusing on gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--> values, one might erroneously conclude the first sample had twice the density of the second one.\n\n===Scalar nature===\nIn a static [[gas]], the gas as a whole does not appear to move. The individual molecules of the gas, however, are in constant [[Brownian motion|random motion]]. Because we are dealing with an extremely large number of molecules and because the motion of the individual molecules is random in every direction, we do not detect any motion. If we enclose the gas within a container, we detect a pressure in the gas from the molecules colliding with the walls of our container. We can put the walls of our container anywhere inside the gas, and the force per unit area (the pressure) is the same. We can shrink the size of our \"container\" down to a very small point (becoming less true as we approach the atomic scale), and the pressure will still have a single value at that point. Therefore, pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has magnitude but no direction sense associated with it. Pressure force acts in all directions at a point inside a gas. At the surface of a gas, the pressure force acts perpendicular (at right angle) to the surface.\n\nA closely related quantity is the [[stress (physics)|stress]] tensor ''\u03c3'', which relates the vector force <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> to the \n[[vector area]] <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> via the linear relation <math>\\mathbf{F} = \\sigma\\mathbf{A}</math>.\n\nThis [[tensor]] may be expressed as the sum of the [[viscous stress tensor]] minus the hydrostatic pressure. The negative of the stress tensor is sometimes called the pressure tensor, but in the following, the term \"pressure\" will refer only to the scalar pressure.\n\nAccording to the theory of [[general relativity]], pressure increases the strength of a gravitational field (see [[stress\u2013energy tensor]]) and so adds to the mass-energy cause of [[gravity]]. This effect is unnoticeable at everyday pressures but is significant in [[neutron star]]s, although it has not been experimentally tested.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10509-009-0016-8 |title=Einstein's gravity under pressure |accessdate=2012-03-27 |doi=10.1007/s10509-009-0016-8 |volume=321 |issue=2 |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |pages=151\u2013156|arxiv=0705.0825 |bibcode=2009Ap&SS.321..151V |year=2009 |last1=Vishwakarma |first1=Ram Gopal }}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Fluid pressure===\n\n'''Fluid pressure''' is most often the compressive stress at some point within a [[fluid]].

Such conditions conform with principles of [[fluid statics]]. The pressure at any given point of a non-moving (static) fluid is called the '''hydrostatic pressure'''. <!--For bolding note that this page is the target of redirection from \"hydrostatic pressure\"-->\n\nClosed bodies of fluid are either \"static\", when the fluid is not moving, or \"dynamic\", when the fluid can move as in either a pipe or by compressing an air gap in a closed container.

Consequently, although a fluid moving at higher speed will have a lower [[static pressure]], it may have a higher stagnation pressure when forced to a standstill. Static pressure and stagnation pressure are related by:\n:<math>p_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + p</math>\n\nwhere \n:<math>p_0</math> is the [[stagnation pressure]]\n:<math>v</math> is the flow velocity\n:<math>p</math> is the static pressure.\n\nThe pressure of a moving fluid can be measured using a [[Pitot tube]], or one of its variations such as a [[Kiel probe]] or [[Cobra probe]], connected to a [[manometer]].

All liquids and [[solid]]s have a tendency to [[evaporate]] into a gaseous form, and all [[gas]]es have a tendency to [[condense]] back to their liquid or solid form.\n\nThe [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and lift the liquid to form vapour bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher pressure, and therefore higher temperature, because the fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases.\n\nThe vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure|partial vapor pressure]].\n\n===Liquid pressure===\n{{See also|Fluid statics#Pressure in fluids at rest}}\n{{Continuum mechanics}}\nWhen a person swims under the water, water pressure is felt acting on the person's eardrums. The deeper that person swims, the greater the pressure. The pressure felt is due to the weight of the water above the person. As someone swims deeper, there is more water above the person and therefore greater pressure. The pressure a liquid exerts depends on its depth.\n\nLiquid pressure also depends on the density of the liquid. If someone was submerged in a liquid more dense than water, the pressure would be correspondingly greater. Thus, we can say that the depth, density and liquid pressure are directly proportionate. The pressure due to a liquid in liquid columns of constant density or at a depth within a substance is represented by the following formula:\n:<math>p = \\rho gh,</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''p'' is liquid pressure,\n:''g'' is gravity at the surface of overlaying material,\n:''\u03c1'' is [[density]] of liquid,\n:''h'' is height of liquid column or depth within a substance.\n\nAnother way of saying the same formula is the following:\n\n:<math>p = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{depth}.</math>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Derivation of this equation\n|-\n|This is derived from the definitions of pressure and weight density. Consider an area at the bottom of a vessel of liquid. The weight of the column of liquid directly above this area produces pressure. From the definition\n\n:<math>\\text{weight density} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{volume}}</math>\n\nwe can express this weight of liquid as\n\n:<math>\\text{weight} = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{volume},</math>\n\nwhere the volume of the column is simply the area multiplied by the depth. Then we have\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\frac{\\text{force}}{\\text{area}} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{area}} = \\frac{\\text{weight density} \\times \\text{volume}}{\\text{area}},</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\frac{\\text{weight density} \\times \\text{(area} \\times \\text{depth)}}{\\text{area}}.</math>\n\nWith the \"area\" in the numerator and the \"area\" in the denominator canceling each other out, we are left with\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{depth}.</math>\n\nWritten with symbols, this is our original equation:\n:<math>p= \\rho gh.</math>\n|}\n\nThe pressure a liquid exerts against the sides and bottom of a container depends on the density and the depth of the liquid. If atmospheric pressure is neglected, liquid pressure against the bottom is twice as great at twice the depth; at three times the depth, the liquid pressure is threefold; etc. Or, if the liquid is two or three times as dense, the liquid pressure is correspondingly two or three times as great for any given depth. Liquids are practically incompressible \u2013 that is, their volume can hardly be changed by pressure (water volume decreases by only 50 millionths of its original volume for each atmospheric increase in pressure). Thus, except for small changes produced by temperature, the density of a particular liquid is practically the same at all depths.\n\nAtmospheric pressure pressing on the surface of a liquid must be taken into account when trying to discover the ''total'' pressure acting on a liquid. The total pressure of a liquid, then, is ''\u03c1gh'' plus the pressure of the atmosphere. When this distinction is important, the term ''total pressure'' is used. Otherwise, discussions of liquid pressure refer to pressure without regard to the normally ever-present atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe pressure does not depend on the ''amount'' of liquid present. Volume is not the important factor \u2013 depth is. The average water pressure acting against a dam depends on the average depth of the water and not on the volume of water held back. For example, a wide but shallow lake with a depth of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}} exerts only half the average pressure that a small {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} deep pond does. (The ''total force'' applied to the longer dam will be greater, due to the greater total surface area for the pressure to act upon. But for a given {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide section of each dam, the {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep water will apply one quarter the force of {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep water). A person will feel the same pressure whether his/her head is dunked a metre beneath the surface of the water in a small pool or to the same depth in the middle of a large lake. If four vases contain different amounts of water but are all filled to equal depths, then a fish with its head dunked a few centimetres under the surface will be acted on by water pressure that is the same in any of the vases. If the fish swims a few centimetres deeper, the pressure on the fish will increase with depth and be the same no matter which vase the fish is in. If the fish swims to the bottom, the pressure will be greater, but it makes no difference what vase it is in. All vases are filled to equal depths, so the water pressure is the same at the bottom of each vase, regardless of its shape or volume. If water pressure at the bottom of a vase were greater than water pressure at the bottom of a neighboring vase, the greater pressure would force water sideways and then up the narrower vase to a higher level until the pressures at the bottom were equalized. Pressure is depth dependent, not volume dependent, so there is a reason that water seeks its own level.\n\nRestating this as energy equation, the energy per unit volume in an ideal, incompressible liquid is constant throughout its vessel. At the surface, gravitational potential energy is large but liquid pressure energy is low. At the bottom of the vessel, all the gravitational potential energy is converted to pressure energy. The sum of pressure energy and gravitational potential energy per unit volume is constant throughout the volume of the fluid and the two energy components change linearly with the depth.<ref>Streeter, V. L., ''Fluid Mechanics'', Example&nbsp;3.5, McGraw&ndash;Hill Inc. (1966), New York.</ref>  Mathematically, it is described by [[Bernoulli's equation]], where velocity head is zero and comparisons per unit volume in the vessel are\n:<math>\\frac{p}{\\gamma} + z = \\mathrm{const}.</math>\n\nTerms have the same meaning as in [[#Fluid pressure|section Fluid pressure]].\n\n===Direction of liquid pressure===\nAn experimentally determined fact about liquid pressure is that it is exerted equally in all directions.<ref name=\"Hewitt\">Hewitt 251 (2006)</ref> If someone is submerged in water, no matter which way that person tilts his/her head, the person will feel the same amount of water pressure on his/her ears. Because a liquid can flow, this pressure isn't only downward. Pressure is seen acting sideways when water spurts sideways from a leak in the side of an upright can. Pressure also acts upward, as demonstrated when someone tries to push a beach ball beneath the surface of the water. The bottom of a boat is pushed upward by water pressure ([[buoyancy]]).\n\nWhen a liquid presses against a surface, there is a net force that is perpendicular to the surface. Although pressure doesn't have a specific direction, force does. A submerged triangular block has water forced against each point from many directions, but components of the force that are not perpendicular to the surface cancel each other out, leaving only a net perpendicular point.<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> This is why water spurting from a hole in a bucket initially exits the bucket in a direction at right angles to the surface of the bucket in which the hole is located. Then it curves downward due to gravity. If there are three holes in a bucket (top, bottom, and middle), then the force vectors perpendicular to the inner container surface will increase with increasing depth \u2013 that is, a greater pressure at the bottom makes it so that the bottom hole will shoot water out the farthest. The force exerted by a fluid on a smooth surface is always at right angles to the surface. The speed of liquid out of the hole is <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2gh}</math>, where ''h'' is the depth below the free surface.<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> This is the same speed the water (or anything else) would have if freely falling the same vertical distance ''h''.\n\n===Kinematic pressure===\n:<math>P=p/\\rho_0</math>\nis the kinematic pressure, where <math>p</math> is the pressure and <math>\\rho_0</math> constant mass density.

Pressure may also be expressed in terms of [[standard atmospheric pressure]]; the [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the [[torr]] is defined as {{frac|760}} of this. Manometric units such as the [[centimetre of water]], [[millimetre of mercury]], and [[inch of mercury]] are used to express pressures in terms of the height of [[Pressure measurement#Liquid column|column of a particular fluid]] in a manometer.\n\n==Definition==\n'''Pressure''' is the amount of force applied at [[right angle]]s to the surface of an object per unit area.

The usage of ''P'' vs ''p'' depends upon the field in which one is working, on the nearby presence of other symbols for quantities such as [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[momentum]], and on writing style.\n\n===Formula===\n{{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n[[File:Pressure force area.svg|200px|right]]\nMathematically:\n:<math>p = \\frac{F}{A},</math><ref name=\"Georgia State University, Physics & Astronomy\">{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/press.html |title=Pressure |accessdate=2018-06-14 }}</ref>\nwhere:\n:<math>p</math> is the pressure,\n:<math>F</math> is the magnitude of the [[normal force]],\n:<math>A</math> is the area of the surface on contact.\n\nPressure is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity. It relates the [[vector area]] element (a vector normal to the surface) with the [[normal force]] acting on it. The pressure is the scalar [[proportionality constant]] that relates the two normal vectors:\n:<math>d\\mathbf{F}_n = -p\\,d\\mathbf{A} = -p\\,\\mathbf{n}\\,dA.</math>\n\nThe minus sign comes from the fact that the force is considered towards the surface element, while the normal vector points outward. The equation has meaning in that, for any surface ''S'' in contact with the fluid, the total force exerted by the fluid on that surface is the [[surface integral]] over ''S'' of the right-hand side of the above equation.\n\nIt is incorrect (although rather usual) to say \"the pressure is directed in such or such direction\". The pressure, as a scalar, has no direction. The force given by the previous relationship to the quantity has a direction, but the pressure does not. If we change the orientation of the surface element, the direction of the normal force changes accordingly, but the pressure remains the same.\n\nPressure is distributed to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. It is a fundamental parameter in [[thermodynamics]], and it is [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].\n\n===Units===\n[[File:Barometer mercury column hg.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury column]]\nThe [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N/m<sup>2</sup>, or kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>).

The [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|CGS]] unit of pressure is the [[barye]] (Ba), equal to 1&nbsp;dyn\u00b7cm<sup>\u22122</sup>, or 0.1&nbsp;Pa. Pressure is sometimes expressed in grams-force or kilograms-force per square centimetre (g/cm<sup>2</sup> or kg/cm<sup>2</sup><!--don't add an f to kg, this is making the point about usage without it-->) and the like without properly identifying the force units. But using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as units of force is expressly forbidden in SI. The [[technical atmosphere]] (symbol: at) is 1&nbsp;kgf/cm<sup>2</sup> (98.0665&nbsp;kPa, or 14.223&nbsp;psi).\n\nSince a system under pressure has the potential to perform work on its surroundings, pressure is a measure of potential energy stored per unit volume. It is therefore related to energy density and may be expressed in units such as [[joule]]s per cubic metre (J/m<sup>3</sup>, which is equal to Pa).\nMathematically:\n:<math>p = \\frac{F \\times \\text{distance}}{A \\times \\text{distance}} = \\frac{\\text{work}}{\\text{volume}} = \\frac{\\text{energy (J)}}{\\text{volume }(\\text{m}^3)}.</math>\n\nSome [[meteorologist]]s prefer the hectopascal (hPa) for atmospheric air pressure, which is equivalent to the older unit [[millibar]] (mbar). Similar pressures are given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, where the hecto- prefix is rarely used. The inch of mercury is still used in the United States. Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in [[decibar]]s (dbar) because pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth.\n \nThe [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately equal to typical air pressure at Earth [[mean sea level]] and is defined as {{val|101325|u=Pa}}.\n\nBecause pressure is commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a [[manometer]], pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., [[centimetres of water]], [[millimetres of mercury]] or [[inches of mercury]]). The most common choices are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's high density allows a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to be used to measure a given pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height ''h'' and density ''\u03c1'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''\u03c1gh''}}, where ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. When millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury are quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury; rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms of SI units.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} One millimetre of mercury is approximately equal to one [[torr]]. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a measured, rather than defined, quantity. These ''manometric units'' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are still common.\n\n[[Underwater diving|Underwater divers]] use the [[metre sea water]] (msw or MSW) and [[foot sea water]] (fsw or FSW) units of pressure, and these are the standard units for pressure gauges used to measure pressure exposure in [[diving chamber]]s and [[Dive computer|personal decompression computers]].

Although the force applied to the surface is the same, the thumbtack applies more pressure because the point concentrates that force into a smaller area. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. Unlike [[stress (physics)|stress]], pressure is defined as a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]]. The negative [[gradient]] of pressure is called the [[force density]].\n\nAnother example is a knife. If we try to cut with the flat edge, force is distributed over a larger surface area resulting in less pressure, and it will not cut. Whereas using the sharp edge, which has less surface area, results in greater pressure, and so the knife cuts smoothly. This is one example of a practical application of pressure.\n\nFor gases, pressure is sometimes measured not as an ''absolute pressure'', but relative to [[atmospheric pressure]]; such measurements are called ''gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues.

However, whenever equation-of-state properties, such as densities or changes in densities, must be calculated, pressures must be expressed in terms of their absolute values. For instance, if the atmospheric pressure is {{convert|100|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}, a gas (such as helium) at {{convert|200|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} (gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues.

Focusing on gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--> values, one might erroneously conclude the first sample had twice the density of the second one.\n\n===Scalar nature===\nIn a static [[gas]], the gas as a whole does not appear to move. The individual molecules of the gas, however, are in constant [[Brownian motion|random motion]]. Because we are dealing with an extremely large number of molecules and because the motion of the individual molecules is random in every direction, we do not detect any motion. If we enclose the gas within a container, we detect a pressure in the gas from the molecules colliding with the walls of our container. We can put the walls of our container anywhere inside the gas, and the force per unit area (the pressure) is the same. We can shrink the size of our \"container\" down to a very small point (becoming less true as we approach the atomic scale), and the pressure will still have a single value at that point. Therefore, pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has magnitude but no direction sense associated with it. Pressure force acts in all directions at a point inside a gas. At the surface of a gas, the pressure force acts perpendicular (at right angle) to the surface.\n\nA closely related quantity is the [[stress (physics)|stress]] tensor ''\u03c3'', which relates the vector force <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> to the \n[[vector area]] <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> via the linear relation <math>\\mathbf{F} = \\sigma\\mathbf{A}</math>.\n\nThis [[tensor]] may be expressed as the sum of the [[viscous stress tensor]] minus the hydrostatic pressure. The negative of the stress tensor is sometimes called the pressure tensor, but in the following, the term \"pressure\" will refer only to the scalar pressure.\n\nAccording to the theory of [[general relativity]], pressure increases the strength of a gravitational field (see [[stress\u2013energy tensor]]) and so adds to the mass-energy cause of [[gravity]]. This effect is unnoticeable at everyday pressures but is significant in [[neutron star]]s, although it has not been experimentally tested.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10509-009-0016-8 |title=Einstein's gravity under pressure |accessdate=2012-03-27 |doi=10.1007/s10509-009-0016-8 |volume=321 |issue=2 |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |pages=151\u2013156|arxiv=0705.0825 |bibcode=2009Ap&SS.321..151V |year=2009 |last1=Vishwakarma |first1=Ram Gopal }}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Fluid pressure===\n\n'''Fluid pressure''' is most often the compressive stress at some point within a [[fluid]].  (The term ''fluid'' refers to both liquids and gases \u2013 for more information specifically about liquid pressure, see [[Pressure#Liquid pressure|section below]].)\n[[File:Defekter unterflurhydrant goettingen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Water escapes at high speed from a damaged hydrant that contains water at high pressure]]\nFluid pressure occurs in one of two situations:\n# An open condition, called \"open channel flow\", e.g. the ocean, a swimming pool, or the atmosphere.\n# A closed condition, called \"closed conduit\", e.g. a water line or gas line.\n\nPressure in open conditions usually can be approximated as the pressure in \"static\" or non-moving conditions (even in the ocean where there are waves and currents), because the motions create only negligible changes in the pressure. Such conditions conform with principles of [[fluid statics]]. The pressure at any given point of a non-moving (static) fluid is called the '''hydrostatic pressure'''. <!--For bolding note that this page is the target of redirection from \"hydrostatic pressure\"-->\n\nClosed bodies of fluid are either \"static\", when the fluid is not moving, or \"dynamic\", when the fluid can move as in either a pipe or by compressing an air gap in a closed container. The pressure in closed conditions conforms with the principles of [[fluid dynamics]].\n\nThe concepts of fluid pressure are predominantly attributed to the discoveries of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]].

Consequently, although a fluid moving at higher speed will have a lower [[static pressure]], it may have a higher stagnation pressure when forced to a standstill. Static pressure and stagnation pressure are related by:\n:<math>p_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + p</math>\n\nwhere \n:<math>p_0</math> is the [[stagnation pressure]]\n:<math>v</math> is the flow velocity\n:<math>p</math> is the static pressure.\n\nThe pressure of a moving fluid can be measured using a [[Pitot tube]], or one of its variations such as a [[Kiel probe]] or [[Cobra probe]], connected to a [[manometer]]. Depending on where the inlet holes are located on the probe, it can measure static pressures or stagnation pressures.\n\n===Surface pressure and surface tension===\nThere is a two-dimensional analog of pressure \u2013 the lateral force per unit length applied on a line perpendicular to the force.\n\nSurface pressure is denoted by \u03c0:\n:<math>\\pi = \\frac{F}{l}</math>\nand shares many similar properties with three-dimensional pressure. Properties of surface chemicals can be investigated by measuring pressure/area isotherms, as the two-dimensional analog of [[Boyle's law]], {{nowrap|''\u03c0A'' {{=}} ''k''}}, at constant temperature.\n\n[[Surface tension]] is another example of surface pressure, but with a reversed sign, because \"tension\" is the opposite to \"pressure\".\n\n=== Pressure of an ideal gas ===\n{{main|Ideal gas law}}\nIn an [[ideal gas]], molecules have no volume and do not interact. According to the [[ideal gas law]], pressure varies linearly with temperature and quantity, and inversely with volume:\n:<math>p = \\frac{nRT}{V},</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''p'' is the absolute pressure of the gas,\n:''n'' is the [[amount of substance]],\n:''T'' is the absolute temperature,\n:''V'' is the volume,\n:''R'' is the [[ideal gas constant]].\n\n[[Real gas]]es exhibit a more complex dependence on the variables of state.<ref>P. Atkins, J. de Paula ''Elements of Physical Chemistry'', 4th Ed, W. H. Freeman, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7167-7329-5}}.</ref>\n\n===Vapour pressure===\n{{main|Vapour pressure}}\nVapour pressure is the pressure of a [[vapour]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its condensed [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s in a closed system. All liquids and [[solid]]s have a tendency to [[evaporate]] into a gaseous form, and all [[gas]]es have a tendency to [[condense]] back to their liquid or solid form.\n\nThe [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and lift the liquid to form vapour bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher pressure, and therefore higher temperature, because the fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases.\n\nThe vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure|partial vapor pressure]].\n\n===Liquid pressure===\n{{See also|Fluid statics#Pressure in fluids at rest}}\n{{Continuum mechanics}}\nWhen a person swims under the water, water pressure is felt acting on the person's eardrums. The deeper that person swims, the greater the pressure. The pressure felt is due to the weight of the water above the person. As someone swims deeper, there is more water above the person and therefore greater pressure. The pressure a liquid exerts depends on its depth.\n\nLiquid pressure also depends on the density of the liquid. If someone was submerged in a liquid more dense than water, the pressure would be correspondingly greater. Thus, we can say that the depth, density and liquid pressure are directly proportionate. The pressure due to a liquid in liquid columns of constant density or at a depth within a substance is represented by the following formula:\n:<math>p = \\rho gh,</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''p'' is liquid pressure,\n:''g'' is gravity at the surface of overlaying material,\n:''\u03c1'' is [[density]] of liquid,\n:''h'' is height of liquid column or depth within a substance.\n\nAnother way of saying the same formula is the following:\n\n:<math>p = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{depth}.</math>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Derivation of this equation\n|-\n|This is derived from the definitions of pressure and weight density. Consider an area at the bottom of a vessel of liquid. The weight of the column of liquid directly above this area produces pressure. From the definition\n\n:<math>\\text{weight density} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{volume}}</math>\n\nwe can express this weight of liquid as\n\n:<math>\\text{weight} = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{volume},</math>\n\nwhere the volume of the column is simply the area multiplied by the depth. Then we have\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\frac{\\text{force}}{\\text{area}} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{area}} = \\frac{\\text{weight density} \\times \\text{volume}}{\\text{area}},</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\frac{\\text{weight density} \\times \\text{(area} \\times \\text{depth)}}{\\text{area}}.</math>\n\nWith the \"area\" in the numerator and the \"area\" in the denominator canceling each other out, we are left with\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{depth}.</math>\n\nWritten with symbols, this is our original equation:\n:<math>p= \\rho gh.</math>\n|}\n\nThe pressure a liquid exerts against the sides and bottom of a container depends on the density and the depth of the liquid. If atmospheric pressure is neglected, liquid pressure against the bottom is twice as great at twice the depth; at three times the depth, the liquid pressure is threefold; etc. Or, if the liquid is two or three times as dense, the liquid pressure is correspondingly two or three times as great for any given depth. Liquids are practically incompressible \u2013 that is, their volume can hardly be changed by pressure (water volume decreases by only 50 millionths of its original volume for each atmospheric increase in pressure). Thus, except for small changes produced by temperature, the density of a particular liquid is practically the same at all depths.\n\nAtmospheric pressure pressing on the surface of a liquid must be taken into account when trying to discover the ''total'' pressure acting on a liquid. The total pressure of a liquid, then, is ''\u03c1gh'' plus the pressure of the atmosphere. When this distinction is important, the term ''total pressure'' is used. Otherwise, discussions of liquid pressure refer to pressure without regard to the normally ever-present atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe pressure does not depend on the ''amount'' of liquid present. Volume is not the important factor \u2013 depth is. The average water pressure acting against a dam depends on the average depth of the water and not on the volume of water held back. For example, a wide but shallow lake with a depth of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}} exerts only half the average pressure that a small {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} deep pond does. (The ''total force'' applied to the longer dam will be greater, due to the greater total surface area for the pressure to act upon. But for a given {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide section of each dam, the {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep water will apply one quarter the force of {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep water). A person will feel the same pressure whether his/her head is dunked a metre beneath the surface of the water in a small pool or to the same depth in the middle of a large lake. If four vases contain different amounts of water but are all filled to equal depths, then a fish with its head dunked a few centimetres under the surface will be acted on by water pressure that is the same in any of the vases. If the fish swims a few centimetres deeper, the pressure on the fish will increase with depth and be the same no matter which vase the fish is in. If the fish swims to the bottom, the pressure will be greater, but it makes no difference what vase it is in. All vases are filled to equal depths, so the water pressure is the same at the bottom of each vase, regardless of its shape or volume. If water pressure at the bottom of a vase were greater than water pressure at the bottom of a neighboring vase, the greater pressure would force water sideways and then up the narrower vase to a higher level until the pressures at the bottom were equalized. Pressure is depth dependent, not volume dependent, so there is a reason that water seeks its own level.\n\nRestating this as energy equation, the energy per unit volume in an ideal, incompressible liquid is constant throughout its vessel. At the surface, gravitational potential energy is large but liquid pressure energy is low. At the bottom of the vessel, all the gravitational potential energy is converted to pressure energy. The sum of pressure energy and gravitational potential energy per unit volume is constant throughout the volume of the fluid and the two energy components change linearly with the depth.<ref>Streeter, V. L., ''Fluid Mechanics'', Example&nbsp;3.5, McGraw&ndash;Hill Inc. (1966), New York.</ref>  Mathematically, it is described by [[Bernoulli's equation]], where velocity head is zero and comparisons per unit volume in the vessel are\n:<math>\\frac{p}{\\gamma} + z = \\mathrm{const}.</math>\n\nTerms have the same meaning as in [[#Fluid pressure|section Fluid pressure]].\n\n===Direction of liquid pressure===\nAn experimentally determined fact about liquid pressure is that it is exerted equally in all directions.<ref name=\"Hewitt\">Hewitt 251 (2006)</ref> If someone is submerged in water, no matter which way that person tilts his/her head, the person will feel the same amount of water pressure on his/her ears. Because a liquid can flow, this pressure isn't only downward. Pressure is seen acting sideways when water spurts sideways from a leak in the side of an upright can. Pressure also acts upward, as demonstrated when someone tries to push a beach ball beneath the surface of the water. The bottom of a boat is pushed upward by water pressure ([[buoyancy]]).\n\nWhen a liquid presses against a surface, there is a net force that is perpendicular to the surface. Although pressure doesn't have a specific direction, force does. A submerged triangular block has water forced against each point from many directions, but components of the force that are not perpendicular to the surface cancel each other out, leaving only a net perpendicular point.<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> This is why water spurting from a hole in a bucket initially exits the bucket in a direction at right angles to the surface of the bucket in which the hole is located. Then it curves downward due to gravity. If there are three holes in a bucket (top, bottom, and middle), then the force vectors perpendicular to the inner container surface will increase with increasing depth \u2013 that is, a greater pressure at the bottom makes it so that the bottom hole will shoot water out the farthest. The force exerted by a fluid on a smooth surface is always at right angles to the surface. The speed of liquid out of the hole is <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2gh}</math>, where ''h'' is the depth below the free surface.<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> This is the same speed the water (or anything else) would have if freely falling the same vertical distance ''h''.\n\n===Kinematic pressure===\n:<math>P=p/\\rho_0</math>\nis the kinematic pressure, where <math>p</math> is the pressure and <math>\\rho_0</math> constant mass density.

By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals as well.

A notable instance of this involves the film ''[[Bird Box (film)|Bird Box]]''. A week after its release, Netflix claimed that it had the biggest seven-day viewing record of any of its original films at over 45 million viewers, but did not provide data to validate it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18412309/netflix-transparency-data-viewers-ratings-subscribers-bird-box-numbers|title=Netflix execs say they'll finally start releasing viewership data soon|work=The Verge|date=April 17, 2019|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> It also was not possible to accurately compare its week-long success to a major cultural event such as the [[Super Bowl]] or [[Academy Awards]] or to a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film run.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/netflix-raises-movie-viewership-curtain-with-bird-box/|title=Netflix's 'Bird Box' success gets Hollywood clucking|work=The Seattle Times|date=January 2, 2019|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> In June 2019, Netflix claimed that 30,869,863 accounts watched the [[Adam Sandler]]- and [[Jennifer Aniston]]-starring Netflix original film ''[[Murder Mystery (film)|Murder Mystery]]'', despite it being critically panned, making it the biggest \"opening weekend\" for a Netflix original film. If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million, which makes Netflix's deal for ''House of Cards'' extremely cost effective, according to Spacey.<ref>{{cite web|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703195214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|archivedate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.\n\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\nNetflix upgrades to HD video streaming in India for basic plans & Mobile [https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDpIGcQGXD7-o6I7UMAqxSQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowsruUCzDxgKoDMKPExQY?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen]\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=December 11, 2018}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997] '''Netflix doesn't add shows with more seasons like SpongeBob SquarePants you start with \n                                                season 5 and 6 it was the least brand in the world.''' ]'''\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the media service}}\n{{short description|Internet video streaming and DVD-by-mail service with original and licensed content}}\n{{Use American English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox dot-com company\n| name = Netflix, Inc.\n| logo = [[File:Netflix 2015 logo.svg|frameless|upright]]\n| screenshot =Netflix -

By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals as well.

A notable instance of this involves the film ''[[Bird Box (film)|Bird Box]]''. A week after its release, Netflix claimed that it had the biggest seven-day viewing record of any of its original films at over 45 million viewers, but did not provide data to validate it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18412309/netflix-transparency-data-viewers-ratings-subscribers-bird-box-numbers|title=Netflix execs say they'll finally start releasing viewership data soon|work=The Verge|date=April 17, 2019|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> It also was not possible to accurately compare its week-long success to a major cultural event such as the [[Super Bowl]] or [[Academy Awards]] or to a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film run.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/netflix-raises-movie-viewership-curtain-with-bird-box/|title=Netflix's 'Bird Box' success gets Hollywood clucking|work=The Seattle Times|date=January 2, 2019|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> In June 2019, Netflix claimed that 30,869,863 accounts watched the [[Adam Sandler]]- and [[Jennifer Aniston]]-starring Netflix original film ''[[Murder Mystery (film)|Murder Mystery]]'', despite it being critically panned, making it the biggest \"opening weekend\" for a Netflix original film. If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million, which makes Netflix's deal for ''House of Cards'' extremely cost effective, according to Spacey.<ref>{{cite web|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703195214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|archivedate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.\n\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\nNetflix upgrades to HD video streaming in India for basic plans & Mobile [https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDpIGcQGXD7-o6I7UMAqxSQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowsruUCzDxgKoDMKPExQY?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen]\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=December 11, 2018}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "147.92.70.38", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix"}

Her debut movie role was as \"Emma Jones\" in ''[[Street Scene (film)|Street Scene]]'' (1931), which starred [[Sylvia Sidney]], and in which Bondi reprised her stage role, followed by \"Mrs. Davidson\" in ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]'' (1932), which starred [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Walter Huston]].\n\nShe was one of the first five women to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]] in the newly created category of \"Best Supporting Actress\" for her work in ''[[The Gorgeous Hussy]]'', although she lost the award to [[Gale Sondergaard]].

She played the mother of [[James Stewart]] in the four films ''[[Of Human Hearts]]'', ''[[Vivacious Lady]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939) and ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946). She continued acting well into her later years, winning an [[Emmy Award]] for an appearance on ''[[The Waltons]]'' in 1976.\n\n==Life and career==\nBondi was born '''Beulah Bondy''' in [[Chicago, Illinois]], the daughter of Eva Suzanna ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Marble), an author, and Abraham O.

Webb's ''One of the Family'' at the 49th Street Theatre on December 21, 1925. She next appeared in another hit, [[Maxwell Anderson]]'s ''[[Saturday's Children]],'' in 1926. It was Bondi's performance in [[Elmer Rice]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[Street Scene (play)|Street Scene]]'', which opened at the Playhouse Theatre on January 10, 1929, that brought Bondi to the movies at the age of 43. Her debut movie role was as \"Emma Jones\" in ''[[Street Scene (film)|Street Scene]]'' (1931), which starred [[Sylvia Sidney]], and in which Bondi reprised her stage role, followed by \"Mrs. Davidson\" in ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]'' (1932), which starred [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Walter Huston]].\n\nShe was one of the first five women to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]] in the newly created category of \"Best Supporting Actress\" for her work in ''[[The Gorgeous Hussy]]'', although she lost the award to [[Gale Sondergaard]]. Two years later she was nominated again for ''[[Of Human Hearts]]'' and lost again, but her reputation as a character actress kept her employed. She would most often be seen in the role of the mother of the star of the film for the rest of her career, with the exception of ''[[Make Way for Tomorrow]]'' (1937) as the abandoned Depression-era 'Ma' Cooper. She often played mature roles in her early film career even though she was only in her early 40s. In 1940 Bondi played Mrs. Webb in ''[[Our Town]]'' and Granny Tucker in ''[[The Southerner (film)|The Southerner]]'', directed by [[Jean Renoir]] and released in 1945.<ref name=tcm>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/18861%7C20673/Beulah-Bondi/filmography.html \"Beulah Bondi\"], filmography, [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM), Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc., New York, N.Y.
