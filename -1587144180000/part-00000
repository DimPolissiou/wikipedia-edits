It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp. 90\u201392</ref>\n\nInspired by the sight of Bowie's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the [[Berlin Wall]], the song tells the story of two lovers, one from [[East Berlin|East]] and one from [[West Berlin]]. Bowie's performance of {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} on [[Berlin Wall#David Bowie, 1987|6 June 1987]], at the German [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in [[West Berlin]] has been considered a catalyst to the later [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-bowie-death/423483/|work=The Atlantic|last=Ford|first=Matt|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=11 January 2016|title=Remembering David Bowie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112083919/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-bowie-death/423483/|archive-date=12 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749546/david-bowie-berlin-wall-heroes|work=Vox|last=Fisher|first=Max|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=11 January 2016|title=David Bowie at the Berlin Wall: the incredible story of a concert and its role in history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113052820/http://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749546/david-bowie-berlin-wall-heroes|archive-date=13 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/david-bowie-plays-berlin-711/|publisher=Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=9 November 2014|title=The Berlin Wall \u2013 A multimedia history: David Bowie plays Berlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114015829/http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/david-bowie-plays-berlin-711/|archive-date=14 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Following his [[Death of David Bowie|death]] in January 2016, the German government thanked Bowie for \"helping to bring down the Wall\", adding \"you are now among Heroes\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/11/germany-to-david-bowie-thank-you-for-helping-to-bring-down-the-berlin-wall/ |title=Germany to David Bowie: Thank You for Helping to Bring Down the Berlin Wall |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=11 January 2016 |accessdate=12 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004130922/http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/11/germany-to-david-bowie-thank-you-for-helping-to-bring-down-the-berlin-wall/ |archive-date=4 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has received numerous accolades since its release, as seen with its inclusion on lists ranking the \"greatest songs\" compiled by various music publications; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named the song the 46th greatest ever, and ''[[NME]]'' named it the 15th greatest.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/david-bowie-heroes-20110525 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050101013301/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6596661/500songs|archive-date=1 January 2005|title=The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time \u2013 November 2003|accessdate=26 September 2016 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref name=\"NME500\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_songs_2014.htm|accessdate=15 February 2016|work=NME|title=NME The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218133410/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_songs_2014.htm|archive-date=18 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork Media\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/pitchfork.htm|title=The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present|accessdate=15 January 2016|publisher=Pitchfork Media|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108135757/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/Pitchfork.htm|archive-date=8 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Bowie scholar David Buckley has written that {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} \"is perhaps pop's definitive statement of the potential triumph of the human spirit over adversity\".<ref>{{cite book|author=David Buckley|title=David Bowie: The Music and The Changes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63|year=2015|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-617-6|page=63|access-date=22 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302054741/https://books.google.com/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63|archive-date=2 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Title and lyrics==\nThe song title is a reference to the 1975 track \"[[Neu!

The other parts consist of [[synthesizer]] parts by Eno using an [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]] [[VCS3]] to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three [[oscillators]], producing a juddering effect. In addition, [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] generated an unusual sustained sound by allowing his guitar to [[Audio feedback|feed back]] and sitting at different positions in the room to alter the [[pitched feedback|pitch of the feedback]].

It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000).

The other parts consist of [[synthesizer]] parts by Eno using an [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]] [[VCS3]] to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three [[oscillators]], producing a juddering effect. In addition, [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] generated an unusual sustained sound by allowing his guitar to [[Audio feedback|feed back]] and sitting at different positions in the room to alter the [[pitched feedback|pitch of the feedback]]. Visconti mixed out Dennis Davis' [[Bass drum|kick drum]], stating that the track \"seemed to plod\" with it but had a more energetic feel without it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Vocal gating progression===\nBowie's vocal was recorded with a \"multi-latch\" system devised by Visconti that creatively misused [[noise gate|gating]].<ref>Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding'', p.88. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.</ref> Three microphones were used to capture the vocal, with one microphone nine inches from Bowie, one 20&nbsp;feet away and one 50&nbsp;feet away. Each microphone was muted as the next one was triggered. As the music built, Bowie was forced to sing at increased volumes to overcome the gating effect, leading to an increasingly impassioned vocal performance as the song progresses.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/classictracks.htm | title=Classic Tracks: Heroes | magazine=[[Sound on Sound]] | date=October 2004 | accessdate=17 November 2018 | author=Buskin, Richard | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526195658/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Oct04/articles/classictracks.htm | archive-date=26 May 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> Jay Hodgson writes, ''\"Bowie's performance thus grows in intensity precisely as ever more ambience infuses his delivery until, by the final verse, he has to shout just to be heard&nbsp;...
