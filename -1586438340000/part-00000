He was the grandson of the former [[prime minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]] and elder brother of the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]. He was married three times, lastly to [[Elizabeth von Arnim]], who caricatured him in her novel ''[[Vera (novel)|Vera]]''.<ref>Erica Brown. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=155 Literary Encyclopedia: Elizabeth von Arnim (1866\u20131941)].</ref> Despite his landmark achievements in other respects, this Earl Russell is most famous for being tried for [[bigamy]] in the House of Lords in 1901, and was known to Edwardian society as the \"Wicked Earl\".\n\n== Education ==\nRussell proved hard work for his grandparents and was sent to school; first [[Cheam School|Cheam]] (1877) and then [[Winchester College]] (Jan 1879).  Winchester became his spiritual home and the friends he made there his surrogate family.  It was there that he befriended poet and critic [[Lionel Johnson]], whom he would describe as \u201cthe greatest influence of my life at Winchester\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life and Adventures|last=Russell|first=Earl|publisher=Cassell & Co.|year=1923|isbn=|location=London|pages=89}}</ref> though Johnson was the younger man.  When Russell went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1883, the pair wrote long, earnest letters to each other in which they explored spiritual matters and questions of sin and morality.  Twice the correspondence was banned by Johnson's father who feared that Russell's Buddhist beliefs would have a baneful influence on Johnson's welfare as a Christian.  Not to be thwarted, Russell engaged an Oxford friend, [[Charles Edward Sayle]], to correspond with Johnson on his behalf.  Johnson also corresponded with Sayle's Rugby friend [[John Haden Badley|Jack Badley]].  In 1919, Russell anonymously published Johnson's side of the correspondence with all three as ''Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson|last=Russell|first=Earl|publisher=George Allen & Unwin Ltd|year=1919|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Oxford ==\nAt Balliol, Russell read Classics.  The famous Greek scholar [[Benjamin Jowett]] was then Master of Balliol and also Vice-Chancellor of the University.  Russell found Oxford stimulating, welcoming the \u201cuntrammelled and unfettered discussions on everything in heaven and earth\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life and Adventures|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=104}}</ref> But his Oxford career was cut dramatically short when in May 1885, he was sent down by Jowett for supposedly writing a \"scandalous\" letter to another male undergraduate.  Russell denied the charges but was refused a formal inquiry. Incensed at having been falsely accused, he lost his temper with Jowett, telling him he was no gentleman, and left the college.  In an unprecedented move, Jowett blocked Russell's return to Balliol and denied him the necessary ''bene discessit'' to enable him to transfer to Cambridge with his approbation.  After leaving Oxford, Russell toured the USA where he met philosopher [[George Santayana]].  The pair became lifelong friends and later George Santayana would claim that Russell told him in confidence that the real reason for his sending down was that Lionel Johnson had stayed overnight in his rooms and when spotted by the authorities had been declared too young to be Russell's \"natural friend\"; though there is evidence to suggest that even this is not the real version of events.  Nevertheless, the scandal, which remains steeped in mystery, would be revisited on Russell throughout his life, casting doubt on his sexuality, and, according to Santayana, earning him the epithet \"Wicked Earl\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Derham|first=Ruth|date=Winter 2017-18|title='A Very Improper Friend': the influence of Jowett and Oxford on Frank Russell.|url=https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/article/view/3415|journal=Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies|volume=37:2|pages=267\u2013362|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Marital history==\nFrank Russell was twice divorced, and separated permanently from his third and last wife three years after they married.  He also had extramarital affairs.\n\nHis first wife was Mabel Edith Scott, daughter of \"adventuress\" Lady Selina (Lina) Scott and her husband Sir Claude Edward Scott (1840-1880) of the [[Scott baronets|Scott baronets of Lytchet Minster]]. They married in 1890. The marriage was a disaster, lasting only 3 months.  Mabel tried to divorce him (and lost) in 1891, accusing him in the process of \"immoral behaviour\" with another university friend, Herbert Ainslie Roberts.  Having failed to convince the jury, she subsequently attempted to obtain a separation by indirect means, suing for restitution of conjugal rights in 1894.<ref>Under the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1884]], failure to comply with an order of restitution of conjugal rights served to establish desertion (\"statutory desertion\") which gave the other spouse the right to an immediate decree of [[judicial separation]], and, if coupled with the husband\u2019s [[adultery]], allowed the wife to obtain an immediate [[divorce]]. See [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228673/0369.pdf] </ref> The Earl counter-sued on the ground that her continued accusations of sodomy amounted to legal cruelty, and was granted a judicial separation in 1895.  Mabel appealed and the verdict was overturned. The case went all the way to the House of Lords where the appellate judges denied both satisfaction, binding the definition of legal cruelty to physical violence and making ''Russell v. Russell'' [2] a case of legal significance for the next 70 years.  Russell's mother-in-law also tried to harass him, by distributing 500 statements to members of the Commons and Lords, to relatives, the press and other key figures in society, accusing Russell of sodomy.

However, they never divorced. Von Arnim famously caricatured Russell in her 1921 novel ''Vera'' and in response he whitewashed her from his memoirs written in 1923. At the start of the Second World War von Arnim moved to the United States, where she died in 1941.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&product_id=6754 ''The Enchanted April''] NYRB Classics</ref>\n\nEarl Russell had no children, but his second and third marriages brought him several stepchildren. His second wife, Mollie, had one son by her first husband and two sons by her second husband. His third wife, Elizabeth, had five children by her first husband.\n\n==Russell as a motoring enthusiast==\nRussell was an early motorist and an active member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|RAC]] and [https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Motor_Union_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland Motor Union]. He was an outspoken defender of motorists' rights.  He is famed for having the registration A 1. This is frequently reported as being the first number plate issued in Britain, but it is not \u2013 it was, however, the first registration issued by the [[London County Council]] (LCC). \"Motoring Illustrated\" of 19 December 1903 reported that the London County Council started issuing numbers on 7 December 1903, whereas other authorities started before that date. From surviving records, the first number known to have been issued is Hastings' DY 1 issued on 23 November 1903<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Newall|first1=Les|title=A 1 \u2013 Britain's First Registration|journal=\"1903 and All That\" Newsletter|date=September 1995|issue=61|pages=8}}</ref>. It is also frequently reported that the Earl queued all night to obtain the number and only just beat another potential applicant for the number by a few seconds. There does not appear to be any contemporary record of this in motoring journals, though several report that he obtained the number A 1. Thus, it seems unlikely that this story is correct too.\n\n==Political and legal career==\nAfter the passing of the [[Local Government Act 1894|1894 Local Government Act]], Russell was elected to Cookham Parish and District Councils and became a [[Board of guardians|Guardian of the Poor]] responsible for the administration of Maidenhead workhouse.   In the same year he also became JP for Berkshire.  In 1895 he was elected onto [[London County Council]] as Progressive Party candidate for West Newington.  After failing to take the Hammersmith seat in 1898, he was made an [[Alderman]].  He became a member of the [[National Liberal Club]] (NLC) and the [[Reform Club]].  \n\nAfter his release from prison, he sought to reform the divorce laws that had put him there, introducing four bills into the House of Lords over a six-year period (all of which were considered too radical) and established the ''Society for Promoting Reforms in the Marriage and Divorce Laws of England'' which was later absorbed into the ''Divorce Law Reform Union.''  With second wife, Mollie, he became an active campaigner for women's suffrage.  \n\nHe was called to the Bar at [[Gray's Inn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/russell1861.htm|title=Russell, Earl |work=Cracroft's Peerage|accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> in 1905 and defended both motorists and suffragists.  He published a treatise on the inequality of the divorce laws in 1912.  Russell's attempts to reform divorce laws were partly negated by his own personal history,<ref>Christopher Hudson.

At the start of the Second World War von Arnim moved to the United States, where she died in 1941.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&product_id=6754 ''The Enchanted April''] NYRB Classics</ref>\n\nEarl Russell had no children, but his second and third marriages brought him several stepchildren. His second wife, Mollie, had one son by her first husband and two sons by her second husband. His third wife, Elizabeth, had five children by her first husband.\n\n==Russell as a motoring enthusiast==\nRussell was an early motorist and an active member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|RAC]] and [https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Motor_Union_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland Motor Union]. He was an outspoken defender of motorists' rights.  He is famed for having the registration A 1. This is frequently reported as being the first number plate issued in Britain, but it is not \u2013 it was, however, the first registration issued by the [[London County Council]] (LCC). \"Motoring Illustrated\" of 19 December 1903 reported that the London County Council started issuing numbers on 7 December 1903, whereas other authorities started before that date. From surviving records, the first number known to have been issued is Hastings' DY 1 issued on 23 November 1903<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Newall|first1=Les|title=A 1 \u2013 Britain's First Registration|journal=\"1903 and All That\" Newsletter|date=September 1995|issue=61|pages=8}}</ref>. It is also frequently reported that the Earl queued all night to obtain the number and only just beat another potential applicant for the number by a few seconds. There does not appear to be any contemporary record of this in motoring journals, though several report that he obtained the number A 1. Thus, it seems unlikely that this story is correct too.\n\n==Political and legal career==\nAfter the passing of the [[Local Government Act 1894|1894 Local Government Act]], Russell was elected to Cookham Parish and District Councils and became a [[Board of guardians|Guardian of the Poor]] responsible for the administration of Maidenhead workhouse.   In the same year he also became JP for Berkshire.  In 1895 he was elected onto [[London County Council]] as Progressive Party candidate for West Newington.  After failing to take the Hammersmith seat in 1898, he was made an [[Alderman]].  He became a member of the [[National Liberal Club]] (NLC) and the [[Reform Club]].  \n\nAfter his release from prison, he sought to reform the divorce laws that had put him there, introducing four bills into the House of Lords over a six-year period (all of which were considered too radical) and established the ''Society for Promoting Reforms in the Marriage and Divorce Laws of England'' which was later absorbed into the ''Divorce Law Reform Union.''  With second wife, Mollie, he became an active campaigner for women's suffrage.  \n\nHe was called to the Bar at [[Gray's Inn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/russell1861.htm|title=Russell, Earl |work=Cracroft's Peerage|accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> in 1905 and defended both motorists and suffragists.  He published a treatise on the inequality of the divorce laws in 1912.  Russell's attempts to reform divorce laws were partly negated by his own personal history,<ref>Christopher Hudson. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=508936&in_page_id=1879 \"The wife who changed history \u2013 by asking for the first divorce\"] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 18 January 2008</ref> but he is still rightly considered a pioneer in the field.  \n\nRussell became a Fabian in 1912 and the first peer to declare his support for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. He was [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport]] and [[Under-Secretary of State for India]] in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s government from 1929 to 1931.  \n\n== Publications ==\n\n* ''Lay Sermons'' (1902)\n* ''Divorce'' (1912)\n* ''Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson'' (1919)\n* ''My Life and Adventures'' (1923)\n\n==Other activities==\nRussell was chairman of a number of companies, including Plenty & Son of Newbury, [[Humber Limited|Humber]], and the Globe & Phoenix Mining Co.\n\nRussell supported his brother's pacifism during the First World War, and was a close friend of [[George Santayana]] and [[Lionel Johnson]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Anonymous.

''C. kunmingensis'' belongs to a group of animals called fuxianhuiids, and was an early ancestor of modern arthropods, which include insects, spiders and crustaceans.<ref name=\"CamCCBY\"/>\n\n\"This is a unique glimpse into what the ancestral nervous system looked like,\" said study co-author Javier Ortega-Hern\u00e1ndez. \"It\u2019s the most complete example of a central nervous system from the Cambrian period.\"<ref name=\"CamCCBY\"/>\n\nStarting about 2010, researchers have identified partially-fossilized nervous systems in several different species from the period, but these have mostly been fossilized brains.

Since the nervous system and soft tissues are essentially made of fatty-like substances, finding them preserved as fossils is extremely rare.

In vertebrates, it consists of the brain and spinal cord, but in arthropods it consists of a condensed brain and a chain-like series of interconnected masses of nervous tissue called [[ganglia]] that resemble a string of beads. Like modern arthropods, ''C. kunmingensis'' had a nerve cord, analogous to a spinal cord in vertebrates, running throughout its body, with each one of the bead-like ganglia controlling a single pair of walking legs. Closer examination of the exceptionally preserved ganglia revealed dozens of spindly fibers, each measuring about five thousandths of a millimeter in length. \"These delicate fibers displayed a highly regular distribution pattern, and so we wanted to figure out if they were made of the same material as the ganglia that form the nerve cord,\" according to Ortega-Hern\u00e1ndez. \"Using [[fluorescence microscopy]], we confirmed that the fibers were in fact individual nerves, fossilized as [[carbon film]]s, offering an unprecedented level of detail. These fossils greatly improve our understanding of how the nervous system evolved.\" For Ortega-Hern\u00e1ndez and his colleagues, a key question is what this discovery tells us about the evolution of early animals, since the nervous system contains so much information. Further analysis revealed that some aspects of the nervous system in ''C. kunmingensis'' appear to be structured similar to that of modern [[priapulid]]s (penis worms) and [[onychophoran]]s (velvet worms), with regularly-spaced nerves coming out from the ventral nerve cord.

Maynard was also featured alongside Butler in the music video for the same song.\n\nConor performed at the Hertfordshire Summer Ball on 13 May 2016, along with other acts such as Becky Hill.\n\nIn July 2016, due to the success of his covers on YouTube, Conor announced he would be releasing an album of covers with one original track. A few of the covers included \"Pillowtalk\", \"One Dance\", \"Hello\" and \"Stitches\". The original was called \"This Is My Version\" and was written about a relationship he had previously been in. The album, ''Covers'', was released on 5 August 2016.\n\nMaynard featured on a dance track called \"Dancing in the Headlights\" by [[DJ Antoine]].

He revealed that following the success of his debut album, he entered into a relationship and found it difficult to effectively split his time which resulted in the disappointing charting of ''[[Talking About]]'' and ''Royalty''. Maynard subsequently began making the majority of his income via online stream such as [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]] as opposed to album sales and live performances. He then admitted that he wants to release a new album of original music online but is currently unable to because he is under contractual talks with his label. He also stated that once the situation is fixed he will be able to release original content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14AtQGTNm6Q|title=Conor Maynard - ON FAME, LOGAN PAUL & HIS BROTHER'S SCANDAL (Honest Interview)|first=|last=Caspar|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The single is extracted from his second upcoming album, which is predicted to be released at the beginning of 2016.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, the single \"[[I'm Famous]]\" by Marcus Butler was released featuring Maynard. It peaked at number 85 on the UK Singles Chart top 100, failing to reach the top 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/48966/marcus-butler-ft-conor-maynard/|title=MARCUS BUTLER FT CONOR MAYNARD - full Official Chart History - Official Charts Company|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> The single spent only one week on the chart. Maynard was also featured alongside Butler in the music video for the same song.\n\nConor performed at the Hertfordshire Summer Ball on 13 May 2016, along with other acts such as Becky Hill.\n\nIn July 2016, due to the success of his covers on YouTube, Conor announced he would be releasing an album of covers with one original track. A few of the covers included \"Pillowtalk\", \"One Dance\", \"Hello\" and \"Stitches\". The original was called \"This Is My Version\" and was written about a relationship he had previously been in. The album, ''Covers'', was released on 5 August 2016.\n\nMaynard featured on a dance track called \"Dancing in the Headlights\" by [[DJ Antoine]]. Maynard also featured on a track called \"Catch Me Here\" by Drumsound and Bassline Smith which Conor had already written for 2 years. On 23 December 2016 he released the single \"Are You Sure?\" with [[Kris Kross Amsterdam]] featuring vocals from [[Ty Dolla Sign]].\n\nIn an interview on 8 January 2018 with [[Caspar Lee]], Maynard discussed the status of his new album. He revealed that following the success of his debut album, he entered into a relationship and found it difficult to effectively split his time which resulted in the disappointing charting of ''[[Talking About]]'' and ''Royalty''. Maynard subsequently began making the majority of his income via online stream such as [[YouTube]] and [[Spotify]] as opposed to album sales and live performances. He then admitted that he wants to release a new album of original music online but is currently unable to because he is under contractual talks with his label. He also stated that once the situation is fixed he will be able to release original content.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14AtQGTNm6Q|title=Conor Maynard - ON FAME, LOGAN PAUL & HIS BROTHER'S SCANDAL (Honest Interview)|first=|last=Caspar|date=8 January 2018|accessdate=22 March 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.\n\nBMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.<ref name=Odin>Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.</ref> The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.\n\nAircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.\n\nThe 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.\n\nThe ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.\n\nThe company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand.\n\nIn 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.\n\nThe 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.\n\nThe first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).\n\n== Branding ==\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1   = BMW Dixi badge.jpg\n| caption1 = BMW badge on a 1931 [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]]\n| image2   = Flag of Bavaria (lozengy).svg\n| caption2 = Flag of [[Bavaria]]\n}}\n\n=== Company name ===\nThe name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8ba\u026a\u032f\u0281\u026a\u0283\u0259 m\u0254\u02c8t\u02b0\u0254\u0281n\u0329 \u02c8v\u025b\u0250\u032fk\u0259}}).

Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].\n\nThe entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.\n\nDuring the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.\n\nIn the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nIn 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.\n\nBMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.\n\nBMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).\nSome BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.\n\nBMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.\n\nIn September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Automobiles ==\n=== Current models ===\n{{See also|List of BMW vehicles|Mini (marque)|Rolls-Royce Motor Cars}}\n\nThe current model lines of BMW cars are:\n* '''[[BMW 1 Series|1 Series]]''' five-door hatchbacks (model code [[BMW 1 Series (F40)|F40]]).

Woolworths, however, has no association to Australia's [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] supermarket chain.\n\nThe South African Woolworths business consists of full-line fashion, home and beauty stores, many of which incorporate a premium food retail offering. Stand-alone food stores and \"Food Stops\" attached to [[Engen Petroleum|Engen]] petrol stations are also located in urban areas. Woolworths operates 218 full line stores and 430 food stand alone stores in South Africa, with 64 stores throughout the rest of Africa. Woolworths sells clothing and accessory items under a number of premium brands, namely Studio W, RE: and Edition, with the Group\u2019s Australian brands [[Country Road]], [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]] and Trenery also represented.\n\nThe Group's Australian-based specialty apparel and homewares retail subsidiary Country Road Group operates 557 stores (and a further 242 concession locations within [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]]), The Group operates under separate brands [[Country Road]], [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]], [[Trenery]], [[Mimco]] and [[Politix]].\n\n==History==\n\nFounded by [[Max Sonnenberg]], Woolworths first opened its doors on 30 October 1931 in Plein Street Cape Town, in the dining room of the recently-closed down Royal Hotel. It was an immediate success, and two more stores were opened in the Cape. It was clear that the new business had the potential to expand nationwide except for a lack of capital. Sonnenberg's friend Elie Susman put up the money for the expansion of the business into the [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] and became Sonnenberg's business partner.[[File:Woolworths_first_store_in_The_Royal_Hotel,_Plein_Street.jpg|thumb|The first Woolworths store, in the stately dining room of The Royal Hotel, Cape Town]]\nThe choice of name came from Sonnenberg's friendship with a London shipper and financier called Percy (P.R.) Lewis. Lewis was a director of Australasian Chain Stores, ACS, a London shipping and finance house that had been formed to service a rapidly expanding Australian business founded by W.T. Christmas. London shippers commonly provided finance and often selected goods, sight unseen, which were dispatched to their clients. Given that the (now defunct) American company [[F. W. Woolworth Company|F.W Woolworth Company]] had no desire to trade in Australia, \"Father\" Christmas as he was known, used the name for his new [[Woolworths Group (Australia)|Woolworths]] enterprise.  Lewis proposed to Sonnenberg that ACS could add to 'Father' Christmas's order sheet and send a scaled-down quantity of every item that was succeeding in Australia, to South Africa. Sonnenberg therefore also adopted the name for his new venture. Two years later, a South African court ruled that sufficient goodwill had been established to refuse an injunction brought against the use of the name by the American retailer.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An African Shopkeeper|last=Susman|first=David|publisher=Fernwood Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-874950-78-3|location=Cape Town|pages=27}}</ref>\n\n== Corporate Affairs and Culture ==\n\n===Good Business Journey===\nStarted in 2007, the Good Business Journey set specific public targets in sustainability for the company.

Woolworths, however, has no association to Australia's [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] supermarket chain.\n\nThe South African Woolworths business consists of full-line fashion, home and beauty stores, many of which incorporate a premium food retail offering. Stand-alone food stores and \"Food Stops\" attached to [[Engen Petroleum|Engen]] petrol stations are also located in urban areas. Woolworths operates 218 full line stores and 430 food stand alone stores in South Africa, with 64 stores throughout the rest of Africa. Woolworths sells clothing and accessory items under a number of premium brands, namely Studio W, RE: and Edition, with the Group\u2019s Australian brands [[Country Road]], [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]] and Trenery also represented.\n\nThe Group's Australian-based specialty apparel and homewares retail subsidiary Country Road Group operates 557 stores (and a further 242 concession locations within [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]]), The Group operates under separate brands [[Country Road]], [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]], [[Trenery]], [[Mimco]] and [[Politix]].\n\n==History==\n\nFounded by [[Max Sonnenberg]], Woolworths first opened its doors on 30 October 1931 in Plein Street Cape Town, in the dining room of the recently-closed down Royal Hotel. It was an immediate success, and two more stores were opened in the Cape. It was clear that the new business had the potential to expand nationwide except for a lack of capital. Sonnenberg's friend Elie Susman put up the money for the expansion of the business into the [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] and became Sonnenberg's business partner.[[File:Woolworths_first_store_in_The_Royal_Hotel,_Plein_Street.jpg|thumb|The first Woolworths store, in the stately dining room of The Royal Hotel, Cape Town]]\nThe choice of name came from Sonnenberg's friendship with a London shipper and financier called Percy (P.R.) Lewis. Lewis was a director of Australasian Chain Stores, ACS, a London shipping and finance house that had been formed to service a rapidly expanding Australian business founded by W.T. Christmas. London shippers commonly provided finance and often selected goods, sight unseen, which were dispatched to their clients. Given that the (now defunct) American company [[F. W. Woolworth Company|F.W Woolworth Company]] had no desire to trade in Australia, \"Father\" Christmas as he was known, used the name for his new [[Woolworths Group (Australia)|Woolworths]] enterprise.  Lewis proposed to Sonnenberg that ACS could add to 'Father' Christmas's order sheet and send a scaled-down quantity of every item that was succeeding in Australia, to South Africa. Sonnenberg therefore also adopted the name for his new venture. Two years later, a South African court ruled that sufficient goodwill had been established to refuse an injunction brought against the use of the name by the American retailer.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An African Shopkeeper|last=Susman|first=David|publisher=Fernwood Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-874950-78-3|location=Cape Town|pages=27}}</ref>\n\n== Corporate Affairs and Culture ==\n\n===Good Business Journey===\nStarted in 2007, the Good Business Journey set specific public targets in sustainability for the company.
