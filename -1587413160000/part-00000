It is unclear whether Peggy was born there or in Ireland.(\"I am Irish \u2013 impulse rather than reason guided me\"). O'Neil attended a [[Sisters of Loreto|Loreto]] [[convent school]]. At the age of nine, her father Frederick died in a train wreck, her mother Mary Buckley O'Neill died three years later. Peggy came under the care of local relatives.<ref name=\"Memoirs\" /> An uncle named Charlie Zimmerman, a music director, encouraged her artistic talent and took to theater choirs. He also cast as a choral singer in the play \"The Sweetest Girl in Paris\", the opening play for the newly rebuilt [[La Salle Theater (Chicago)|La Salle Theater]] in Chicago in 1910.<ref>\"The Theatre,\" ''[[The Rock Island Argus]]'', February 1, 1911, p. 3</ref><ref name=\"Memoirs\">{{Google books|vVmIDwAAQBAJ|Janet Murphy: ''The Girl from Gneeveguilla''|page=23}}</ref><ref>[https://c8.alamy.com/comp/HHA4KT/the-sweetest-girl-in-paris-1910-chicago-musical-sheet-music-cover-HHA4KT.jpg Theater poster \"The Sweetest Girl of Paris\"] 1910</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Peggy O'Neil 1914.jpg|thumb|upright|Peggy O'Neil, 1914]]\nO'Neil acted in several plays until her career met a turning point in 1919. A \"particularly Irish actress with red hair\" was sought for a London play. [[Robert Courtneidge]] a producer who travelled to the United States, met O'Neil.<ref>[[Irish Independent]], 18 August 1919</ref> She then went to London to play the role of Paddy in [[Gertrude Page]]'s ''Paddy the Next Best Thing''. She fell in love with the city and made the decision to spend the rest of her life there. This move delayed her engagement to the US millionaire Joe Moran.<ref name=\"Memoirs\"/> In the following years she was a welcome guest on English speaking stages.\n\nIn October 1920, it was announced that an assassination attempt had been made against O'Neill. A chocolate present contained the poisons [[arsenic]] and [[strychnine]]. She survived the attack, but her dog died. No culprit was identified.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/79951659/ \"Poisoned Chocolade Drops for Peggy O'Neil\"] aus [[Washington Post]] vom 5. Dezember 1920</ref>\n\nIn the autumn of 1928, at the National Radio Exhibition she noticed [[John Logie Baird]]'s television in the [[Olympia, London]]. There she was invited to perform some Irish songs, which helped to popularise the invention. This helped the new medium to gain additional popularity.<ref>R.F.

The conversation took place in April 1930 on the occasion of the [[Ideal Home Exhibition]] in [[Southampton]].\n\nO'Neill appeared in small supporting roles in films from 1913, and by 1938 had played a role in 23 feature-length and short films. Roles in ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', ''[[Let's Dance (1950 film)|Let's Dance]]'' and ([[body double|body doubling]] for [[Ingrid Bergman]]) ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' followed.\n\nAs a painter, she presented three oil paintings to the public [[Wertheim Gallery]] and [[Burlington Gardens]].\n\nThe 1930s, O'Neil suffered financially and physically. In 1935 she had to declare bankruptcy, which she put down to inexperience and carelessness.<ref name=\"Memoirs\"/>\n\n== Later years and death ==\nFrom the mid-1940s, she were increasingly plagued by [[arthritic]] pain, which soon led to her being unable to leave home and relying on a wheelchair. She died impoverished on 7 January 1960 at Middlesex Hospital from heart failure. She was laid to rest in the [[St Pancras and Islington Cemetery]]. The \"Actors' Benevolent Fund\" paid for the funeral. However, there is no grave stone. which points to the grave. O'Neil died a spinster and had no children.\n\n== ''Peggy O'Neil'' song ==\nIn 1921, Harry Pease, Ed. G.

It is unclear whether Peggy was born there or in Ireland.(\"I am Irish \u2013 impulse rather than reason guided me\"). O'Neil attended a [[Sisters of Loreto|Loreto]] [[convent school]]. At the age of nine, her father Frederick died in a train wreck, her mother Mary Buckley O'Neill died three years later. Peggy came under the care of local relatives.<ref name=\"Memoirs\" /> An uncle named Charlie Zimmerman, a music director, encouraged her artistic talent and took to theater choirs. He also cast as a choral singer in the play \"The Sweetest Girl in Paris\", the opening play for the newly rebuilt [[La Salle Theater (Chicago)|La Salle Theater]] in Chicago in 1910.<ref>\"The Theatre,\" ''[[The Rock Island Argus]]'', February 1, 1911, p. 3</ref><ref name=\"Memoirs\">{{Google books|vVmIDwAAQBAJ|Janet Murphy: ''The Girl from Gneeveguilla''|page=23}}</ref><ref>[https://c8.alamy.com/comp/HHA4KT/the-sweetest-girl-in-paris-1910-chicago-musical-sheet-music-cover-HHA4KT.jpg Theater poster \"The Sweetest Girl of Paris\"] 1910</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Peggy O'Neil 1914.jpg|thumb|upright|Peggy O'Neil, 1914]]\nO'Neil acted in several plays until her career met a turning point in 1919. A \"particularly Irish actress with red hair\" was sought for a London play. [[Robert Courtneidge]] a producer who travelled to the United States, met O'Neil.<ref>[[Irish Independent]], 18 August 1919</ref> She then went to London to play the role of Paddy in [[Gertrude Page]]'s ''Paddy the Next Best Thing''. She fell in love with the city and made the decision to spend the rest of her life there. This move delayed her engagement to the US millionaire Joe Moran.<ref name=\"Memoirs\"/> In the following years she was a welcome guest on English speaking stages.\n\nIn October 1920, it was announced that an assassination attempt had been made against O'Neill. A chocolate present contained the poisons [[arsenic]] and [[strychnine]]. She survived the attack, but her dog died. No culprit was identified.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/79951659/ \"Poisoned Chocolade Drops for Peggy O'Neil\"] aus [[Washington Post]] vom 5.

There she was invited to perform some Irish songs, which helped to popularise the invention. This helped the new medium to gain additional popularity.<ref>R.F.

The conversation took place in April 1930 on the occasion of the [[Ideal Home Exhibition]] in [[Southampton]].\n\nO'Neill appeared in small supporting roles in films from 1913, and by 1938 had played a role in 23 feature-length and short films. Roles in ''[[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'', ''[[Let's Dance (1950 film)|Let's Dance]]'' and ([[body double|body doubling]] for [[Ingrid Bergman]]) ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' followed.\n\nAs a painter, she presented three oil paintings to the public [[Wertheim Gallery]] and [[Burlington Gardens]].\n\nThe 1930s, O'Neil suffered financially and physically. In 1935 she had to declare bankruptcy, which she put down to inexperience and carelessness.<ref name=\"Memoirs\"/>\n\n== Later years and death ==\nFrom the mid-1940s, she were increasingly plagued by [[arthritic]] pain, which soon led to her being unable to leave home and relying on a wheelchair. She died impoverished on 7 January 1960 at Middlesex Hospital from heart failure. She was laid to rest in the [[St Pancras and Islington Cemetery]]. The \"Actors' Benevolent Fund\" paid for the funeral. However, there is no grave stone. which points to the grave.

The subject is thus built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and decision theory, and derives several key results for the application of [[decision making]] under uncertainty to the [[financial market]]s. The underlying economic logic distills to a \u201dfundamental valuation result\u201d,<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> as aside, which is developed in the following sections.\n\n===Present value, expectation and utility===\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of [[present value]] and [[Expected value|expectation]].<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>\n\nCalculating their present value allows the decision maker to aggregate the [[cashflow]]s (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future, to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is therefore the starting point for financial decision making. (Its history is correspondingly early: [[Richard Witt]] discusses [[compound interest]] in depth already in 1613, in his book \"Arithmeticall Questions\";<ref>C. Lewin (1970). [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf An early book on compound interest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163926/https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf |date=2016-12-21 }}, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</ref> further developed by [[Johan de Witt]] and [[Edmond Halley]].)\n\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the [[Expected value|expected value criterion]] which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, <math>X_{s}</math> and <math>p_{s}</math> respectively. (These ideas originate with [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1654.)\n\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider [[risk aversion]] (\"as any student of finance knows\"<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>). In other words, since individuals receive greater [[Utility#Economic definitions|utility]] from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is to therefore \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes (\"states\") correspondingly, <math>Y_{s}</math>. See [[Indifference price]]. (Some investors may in fact be [[risk seeking]] as opposed to [[Risk aversion|risk averse]], but the same logic would apply).\n\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]]. More formally, the resulting [[expected utility hypothesis]] states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective]] value associated with a gamble by an individual is ''that individual''{{'}}s [[Expected value|statistical expectation]] of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\n\nThe impetus for these ideas arise from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]; see also [[Ellsberg paradox]]. (The development here is originally due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, and later formalized by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1947.)\n\n===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|JEL classification codes\n|-\n|In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]], Financial Economics is one of the 19 primary classifications, at JEL: G.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\n\n[[Economic equilibrium]] is, in general, a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\n\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and are therefore not in equilibrium.<ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\"/> An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\nThe immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]], shows that where markets are as described \u2014and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) [[complete market|complete]]\u2014one may then make financial decisions by constructing a [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] corresponding to the market.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, <math>s</math>, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming [[Frictionless market|no friction]]): essentially [[System of linear equations|solving simultaneously]] for ''n'' (risk-neutral) probabilities, <math>q_{s}</math>, given ''n'' prices. The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\">Freddy Delbaen and Walter Schachermayer. (2004).

Notices of the AMS 51 (5): 526\u2013528</ref> For a simplified example see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}}, where the economy has only two possible states\u2014up and down\u2014and where <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math> (=<math>1-q_{up}</math>) are the two corresponding (i.e. implied) probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or [[probability measure|\"measure\"]].\n\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the riskless return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\",<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> i.e. a security-specific [[risk premium]], compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions and/or conditions.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> This approach is consistent with [[#Present value, expectation and utility|the above]], but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\n\nThus, continuing the example, in pricing a [[derivative (finance)|derivative instrument]] its forecasted cashflows in the up- and down-states, <math>X_{up}</math> and <math>X_{down}</math>, are multiplied through by <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math>, and are then [[present value|discounted]] at the risk-free interest rate; per equation above.  In pricing a \u201cfundamental\u201d, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with <math>Y</math> and <math>r</math> combined. In general, this may be derived by the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] (or extensions) as will be seen under [[#Uncertainty]]. \n\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the instrument as a combination of the [[underlying]] and a risk free \u201cbond\u201d; see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Delta hedging}} (and [[#Uncertainty]] below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such \u201cmanufacturing\u201d is of course not possible - the instrument being \"fundamental\" - and a premium is then required for risk.\n\n===State prices===\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model]] may be derived. This important result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a ''[[representative agent]]''.<ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/>\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally [[complete market]]s, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods. \n\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a [[state price]] security (also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security), a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a [[numeraire]] (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price <math>\\pi_{s}</math> of this particular state of the world.\n\nIn the above example, the state prices, <math>\\pi_{up}</math>,  <math>\\pi_{down}</math>would equate to the present values of <math>$q_{up}</math> and <math>$q_{down}</math>: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the [[state price vector]] is the vector of state prices for all states.\nApplied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [<math>\\pi_{up}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{up}</math> + <math>\\pi_{down}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{down}</math>]; the second formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a [[continuous random variable]] indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by [[integration (mathematics)|integrating]] over the state price \"density\". These concepts are extended to [[martingale pricing]] and the related [[risk-neutral measure]]. See also [[Stochastic discount factor]].\n\nState prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (\"[[contingent claim analysis]]\");<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> but can also be applied to valuation problems.<ref name=\"corp fin state prices\">See de Matos, as well as Bossaerts and \u00d8degaard, under bibliography.</ref> Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value \u2014 true in fact for \"every security\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/> \u2014  as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices.<ref name=\"Chance2\"/><ref name=\"corp fin state prices\"/> These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself.

As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\",<ref name=\"stanford1\"/><ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/> as will be seen below.\n* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.\n* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.\n* [[Option (finance)|Options]]: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.\n* [[Perfect information|Information]]: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with [[Future value|future monetary value]] (FMV).\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"[[deterministic]]\" and \"random\",<ref name=\"Luenberger\"/> or \"[[stochastic]]\".)\n\n===Certainty===\nThe starting point here is \u201cInvestment under certainty\". The [[Fisher separation theorem]], asserts that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. Related is the [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]], which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\n\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'', which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the intrinsic, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of [[dividend]]s. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. [[Net present value]] (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of \"Equity valuation\" topics under {{sectionlink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}.\n([[John Burr Williams]] published his \"Theory\" in 1938; NPV was introduced by [[Joel Dean (economist)|Joel Dean]] in 1951)\n\n[[Bond valuation]], in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal) are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion.<ref name=\"Luenberger\">See Luenberger's ''Investment Science'', under Bibliography.</ref> An immediate extension, [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach|Arbitrage-free bond pricing]], discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate \u2014 i.e. at each coupon's corresponding zero-rate \u2014 as opposed to an overall rate. In many treatments bond valuation precedes [[equity valuation]], under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" ''per se''. Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these \u2014 based on historic ratios or published policy \u2014 and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under [[#Corporate finance theory]].\n\nThese \"certainty\" results are all commonly employed under corporate finance; uncertainty is the focus of \"asset pricing models\", as follows.\n\n===Uncertainty===\nFor [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|\"choice under uncertainty\"]] the twin assumptions of rationality and [[Financial market efficiency|market efficiency]], as more closely defined, lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) with its [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM)\u2014an ''equilibrium-based'' result\u2014and to the [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton theory]] (BSM; often, simply Black\u2013Scholes) for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]]\u2014an ''arbitrage-free'' result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see [[asset pricing]].\n\nBriefly, and intuitively\u2014and consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above\u2014the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows.<ref>\nFor a more formal treatment, see, for example: Eugene F. Fama. 1965. [http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/faj/1965/21/5 Random Walks in Stock Market Prices]. ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'', September/October 1965, Vol. 21, No. 5: 55\u201359.</ref> \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. ''efficient'', prices: the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See [[Earnings response coefficient]].)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information, are identical to the ''best guess of the future'': the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, but what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a [[normal distribution]]\u2014so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news:<ref name=\"Shiller\"/> the [[random walk hypothesis]]. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \n(The EMH was presented by [[Eugene Fama]] in a 1970 review paper,<ref>Fama, Eugene (1970). \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\". Journal of Finance.</ref> consolidating previous works re random walks in stock prices: [[Jules Regnault]], 1863; [[Louis Bachelier]], 1900; [[Maurice Kendall]], 1953; [[Paul Cootner]], 1964; and [[Paul Samuelson]], 1965, among others.)\n\nUnder these conditions investors can then be assumed to act rationally: their investment decision must be calculated or a loss is sure to follow; correspondingly, where an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, then arbitrageurs will exploit it, reinforcing this equilibrium.\nHere, as under the certainty-case above, the specific assumption as to pricing is that prices are calculated as the present value of expected future dividends,\n<ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\">Christopher L.

The CAPM was derived by [[Jack L. Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962), [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently. )\n\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of [[option style|European-styled options]].\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a [[partial differential equation]] describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, [[geometric Brownian motion]] (see [[Brownian model of financial markets]]).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (<math>V</math>, the value, or price, of the option, grows at <math>r</math>, the risk-free rate).<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/>\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price\u2014in an arbitrage-free sense\u2014for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is [[Partial differential equation#Analytical solutions|the solution]] to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above.

With [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption (in the economic sense)]] then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\n\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the [[single-index model]] is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT; [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], 1976) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\"<ref>''The Arbitrage Pricing Theory,'' Chapter VI in Goetzmann, under External links.</ref> It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\n\nAs regards [[portfolio optimization]], the [[Black\u2013Litterman model]] departs from the original [[Markowitz model]] - i.e. of constructing portfolios via an [[efficient frontier]]. Black\u2013Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] can be applied; here deriving a [[Pareto efficient]] portfolio. The [[universal portfolio algorithm]] ([[Thomas M. Cover]], 1991) applies [[machine learning]] to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data. [[Behavioral portfolio theory]] recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals.  Copulas have [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|lately been applied here]]; recently this is the case also [[List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications#Finance_and_Economics|for genetic algorithms]] and [[Machine learning #Applications|Machine learning, more generally]].

Various [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|other numeric techniques]] have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that [[martingale pricing]] is now the standard approach.\n\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based off the same logic (using \"[[contingent claim analysis]]\"). [[Real options valuation]] allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock option valuation]] explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; [[Credit derivative]]s allow that payment obligations and / or delivery requirements might not be honored. [[Exotic derivative]]s are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|copula based analysis]].\n\nSimilarly, the various [[short rate model]]s allow for an extension of these techniques to [[Fixed income#Derivatives|fixed income-]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s.

(The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2014 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2014 are discussed [[#Departures from normality|in the next section]].\n\nAfter the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], a further development: ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]]) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2014 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as [[counterparty credit risk]], funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing,<ref>[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf \"Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917015231/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf |date=2016-09-17 }}, Christian Kj\u00f8lhede & Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]</ref> and a [[Credit Valuation Adjustment]], or CVA\u2014and potentially other ''valuation adjustments'', collectively [[xVA]]\u2014is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\n\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) curve, as opposed to [[LIBOR]] as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]]  is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting Dilemma |first=John |last=Hull |first2=Alan |last2=White |journal=[[Journal of Investment Management]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=14\u201327}}</ref> (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]] discounting\".) [[Swap (finance)#Valuation|Swap pricing]] - and, therefore, [[yield curve]] construction - is further modified: previously, swaps were valued off a single \"self discounting\" interest rate curve; whereas post crisis, to accommodate OIS discounting, valuation is now under a \"[[multi-curve framework]]\" where \"forecast curves\" are constructed for each floating-leg [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]], with discounting on the ''common'' OIS curve.\n\n===Corporate finance theory===\n[[Image:Manual decision tree.jpg|right|thumb|Project valuation via decision tree.]]\nCorporate finance theory has also been extended: mirroring the [[#Certainty|above]] developments, asset-valuation and decisioning no longer need assume \"certainty\". \n[[Monte Carlo methods in finance]] allow financial analysts to construct \"[[stochastic]]\" or [[probabilistic]] corporate finance models, as opposed to the traditional static and [[deterministic]] models;<ref name=\"Damodaran_Risk\"/> see {{sectionlink|Corporate finance|Quantifying uncertainty}}. \nRelatedly, Real Options theory allows for owner\u2014i.e. managerial\u2014actions that impact underlying value: by incorporating option pricing logic, these actions are then applied to a distribution of future outcomes, changing with time, which then determine the \"project's\" valuation today.<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> \n(Simulation was first applied to (corporate) finance by [[David B.

Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold (see [[Kurtosis risk]], [[Skewness risk]], [[Long tail]]) and that in practice, traders, analysts and [[financial risk management|risk managers]] frequently modify the \"standard models\" (see [[Model risk]]). In fact, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] had discovered already in the 1960s that changes in financial prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\n\n[[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]] have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while [[Jump diffusion#In economics and finance|jump diffusion models]] allow for (option) pricing incorporating [[jump process|\"jumps\"]] in the [[spot price]].<ref name=\"holes\">{{cite journal |title=  How to use the holes in Black-Scholes |first= Fischer |last=Black|author-link1=Fischer Black |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=1|issue=Jan|year=1989|pages=67\u201373|jstor=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6622.1989.tb00175.x}}</ref> \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard [[value at risk]] models with [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulations]], [[Mixture model#A financial model|mixture models]], [[principal component analysis]], [[extreme value theory]], as well as models for [[volatility clustering]].<ref>See for example III.A.3, in Carol Alexander, ed.

In this way calculated prices \u2014 and numeric structures \u2014 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense.  The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first [[Stochastic volatility#Calibration and estimation|calibrated to observed prices]], and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are [[Heston model|Heston]], [[SABR volatility model|SABR]] and [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]]. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |title=  Managing smile risk |first= Patrick |last=Hagan |display-authors=etal|journal=[[Wilmott Magazine]] |volume=|issue=Sep|year=2002 |pages=84\u2013108|jstor=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nRelated to local volatility are the [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice]]-based [[Implied binomial tree|implied-binomial]] and [[Implied trinomial tree|-trinomial trees]] \u2014 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2014 which are similarly (but less commonly) used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. \n[[Edgeworth binomial tree]]s allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required.<ref>See for example Pg 217 of: Jackson, Mary; Mike Staunton (2001).

This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no \"[[double counting (accounting)|double counting]]\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA.

The latter is extended to [[agent-based computational economics]], where price is treated as an [[emergent phenomenon]], resulting from the interaction of the various market participants (agents). The [[noisy market hypothesis]] argues that prices can be influenced by speculators and [[momentum trader]]s, as well as by [[insider trading|insiders]] and institutions that often buy and sell stocks for reasons unrelated to [[fundamental value]]; see [[Noise (economic)]]. The [[adaptive market hypothesis]] is an attempt to reconcile the efficient market hypothesis with behavioral economics, by applying the principles of [[evolution]] to financial interactions. An [[information cascade]], alternatively, shows market participants engaging in the same acts as others (\"[[herd behavior]]\"), despite contradictions with their private information. [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|Copula-based modelling]] has similarly been applied.

The subject is thus built on the foundations of [[microeconomics]] and decision theory, and derives several key results for the application of [[decision making]] under uncertainty to the [[financial market]]s. The underlying economic logic distills to a \u201dfundamental valuation result\u201d,<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> as aside, which is developed in the following sections.\n\n===Present value, expectation and utility===\nUnderlying all of financial economics are the concepts of [[present value]] and [[Expected value|expectation]].<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>\n\nCalculating their present value allows the decision maker to aggregate the [[cashflow]]s (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future, to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is therefore the starting point for financial decision making. (Its history is correspondingly early: [[Richard Witt]] discusses [[compound interest]] in depth already in 1613, in his book \"Arithmeticall Questions\";<ref>C. Lewin (1970). [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf An early book on compound interest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221163926/https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/0121-0132.pdf |date=2016-12-21 }}, Institute and Faculty of Actuaries</ref> further developed by [[Johan de Witt]] and [[Edmond Halley]].)\n\nAn immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the [[Expected value|expected value criterion]] which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, <math>X_{s}</math> and <math>p_{s}</math> respectively. (These ideas originate with [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1654.)\n\nThis decision method, however, fails to consider [[risk aversion]] (\"as any student of finance knows\"<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/>). In other words, since individuals receive greater [[Utility#Economic definitions|utility]] from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is to therefore \"adjust\" the weight assigned to the various outcomes (\"states\") correspondingly, <math>Y_{s}</math>. See [[Indifference price]]. (Some investors may in fact be [[risk seeking]] as opposed to [[Risk aversion|risk averse]], but the same logic would apply).\n\nChoice under uncertainty here may then be characterized as the maximization of [[expected utility]]. More formally, the resulting [[expected utility hypothesis]] states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the [[Subjective theory of value|subjective]] value associated with a gamble by an individual is ''that individual''{{'}}s [[Expected value|statistical expectation]] of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.\n\nThe impetus for these ideas arise from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the [[St. Petersburg paradox]]; see also [[Ellsberg paradox]]. (The development here is originally due to [[Daniel Bernoulli]] in 1738, and later formalized by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in 1947.)\n\n===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" | width=\"250\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|JEL classification codes\n|-\n|In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]], Financial Economics is one of the 19 primary classifications, at JEL: G.

This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.\n\n[[Economic equilibrium]] is, in general, a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and, in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. [[General equilibrium theory|General equilibrium]] deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)\n\nThe two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an \"arbitrage equilibrium\". Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and are therefore not in equilibrium.<ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\"/> An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.\n\nThe immediate, and formal, extension of this idea, the [[fundamental theorem of asset pricing]], shows that where markets are as described \u2014and are additionally (implicitly and correspondingly) [[complete market|complete]]\u2014one may then make financial decisions by constructing a [[Risk-neutral measure|risk neutral probability measure]] corresponding to the market.\n\"Complete\" here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, <math>s</math>, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming [[Frictionless market|no friction]]): essentially [[System of linear equations|solving simultaneously]] for ''n'' (risk-neutral) probabilities, <math>q_{s}</math>, given ''n'' prices. The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Delbaen_Schachermayer\">Freddy Delbaen and Walter Schachermayer. (2004).

Notices of the AMS 51 (5): 526\u2013528</ref> For a simplified example see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Risk neutral valuation}}, where the economy has only two possible states\u2014up and down\u2014and where <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math> (=<math>1-q_{up}</math>) are the two corresponding (i.e. implied) probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or [[probability measure|\"measure\"]].\n\nWith this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the riskless return, plus an \"adjustment for risk\",<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> i.e. a security-specific [[risk premium]], compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions and/or conditions.<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/> This approach is consistent with [[#Present value, expectation and utility|the above]], but with the expectation based on \"the market\" (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.\n\nThus, continuing the example, in pricing a [[derivative (finance)|derivative instrument]] its forecasted cashflows in the up- and down-states, <math>X_{up}</math> and <math>X_{down}</math>, are multiplied through by <math>q_{up}</math> and <math>q_{down}</math>, and are then [[present value|discounted]] at the risk-free interest rate; per equation above.  In pricing a \u201cfundamental\u201d, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with <math>Y</math> and <math>r</math> combined. In general, this may be derived by the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] (or extensions) as will be seen under [[#Uncertainty]]. \n\nThe difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by \u201cmanufacturing\u201d the instrument as a combination of the [[underlying]] and a risk free \u201cbond\u201d; see {{sectionlink|Rational pricing|Delta hedging}} (and [[#Uncertainty]] below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such \u201cmanufacturing\u201d is of course not possible - the instrument being \"fundamental\" - and a premium is then required for risk.\n\n===State prices===\nWith the above relationship established, the further specialized [[Arrow\u2013Debreu model]] may be derived. This important result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a ''[[representative agent]]''.<ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/>\nThe Arrow\u2013Debreu model applies to economies with maximally [[complete market]]s, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods. \n\nA direct extension, then, is the concept of a [[state price]] security (also called an Arrow\u2013Debreu security), a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a [[numeraire]] (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (\"up\" and \"down\" in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the state price <math>\\pi_{s}</math> of this particular state of the world.\n\nIn the above example, the state prices, <math>\\pi_{up}</math>,  <math>\\pi_{down}</math>would equate to the present values of <math>$q_{up}</math> and <math>$q_{down}</math>: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the [[state price vector]] is the vector of state prices for all states.\nApplied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be [<math>\\pi_{up}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{up}</math> + <math>\\pi_{down}</math>\u00d7<math>X_{down}</math>]; the second formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a [[continuous random variable]] indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by [[integration (mathematics)|integrating]] over the state price \"density\". These concepts are extended to [[martingale pricing]] and the related [[risk-neutral measure]]. See also [[Stochastic discount factor]].\n\nState prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (\"[[contingent claim analysis]]\");<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/> but can also be applied to valuation problems.<ref name=\"corp fin state prices\">See de Matos, as well as Bossaerts and \u00d8degaard, under bibliography.</ref> Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value \u2014 true in fact for \"every security\"<ref name=\"Miller\"/> \u2014  as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices.<ref name=\"Chance2\"/><ref name=\"corp fin state prices\"/> These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself. (Breeden and Litzenberger's work in 1978<ref>{{cite journal |title=Prices of State-Contingent Claims Implicit in Option Prices |first=Douglas T. |last=Breeden |first2=Robert H. |last2=Litzenberger |author2-link=Robert Litzenberger |journal=[[Journal of Business]] |volume=51 |issue=4 |year=1978 |pages=621\u2013651 |jstor=2352653 |doi=10.1086/296025}}</ref> established the use of state prices in financial economics.)\n\n==Resultant models==\n[[Image:MM2.png|thumb|right|Modigliani\u2013Miller Proposition II with risky debt.

As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of \"time, uncertainty, options, and information\",<ref name=\"stanford1\"/><ref name=\"Doyne_Geanakoplos\"/> as will be seen below.\n* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.\n* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.\n* [[Option (finance)|Options]]: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.\n* [[Perfect information|Information]]: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with [[Future value|future monetary value]] (FMV).\nApplying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of \"no uncertainty\" and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted \"[[deterministic]]\" and \"random\",<ref name=\"Luenberger\"/> or \"[[stochastic]]\".)\n\n===Certainty===\nThe starting point here is \u201cInvestment under certainty\". The [[Fisher separation theorem]], asserts that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. Related is the [[Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem]], which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.\n\nThe mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by ''[[The Theory of Investment Value]]'', which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using \"evaluation by the rule of present worth\". Thus, for a common stock, the intrinsic, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of [[dividend]]s. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, \"rationally\", i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset's riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners' preferences; see below. [[Net present value]] (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of \"Equity valuation\" topics under {{sectionlink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}.\n([[John Burr Williams]] published his \"Theory\" in 1938; NPV was introduced by [[Joel Dean (economist)|Joel Dean]] in 1951)\n\n[[Bond valuation]], in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal) are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion.<ref name=\"Luenberger\">See Luenberger's ''Investment Science'', under Bibliography.</ref> An immediate extension, [[Bond valuation#Arbitrage-free pricing approach|Arbitrage-free bond pricing]], discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate \u2014 i.e. at each coupon's corresponding zero-rate \u2014 as opposed to an overall rate. In many treatments bond valuation precedes [[equity valuation]], under which cashflows (dividends) are not \"known\" ''per se''. Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these \u2014 based on historic ratios or published policy \u2014 and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under [[#Corporate finance theory]].\n\nThese \"certainty\" results are all commonly employed under corporate finance; uncertainty is the focus of \"asset pricing models\", as follows.\n\n===Uncertainty===\nFor [[Decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|\"choice under uncertainty\"]] the twin assumptions of rationality and [[Financial market efficiency|market efficiency]], as more closely defined, lead to [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) with its [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM)\u2014an ''equilibrium-based'' result\u2014and to the [[Black\u2013Scholes model|Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton theory]] (BSM; often, simply Black\u2013Scholes) for [[Valuation of options|option pricing]]\u2014an ''arbitrage-free'' result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see [[asset pricing]].\n\nBriefly, and intuitively\u2014and consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above\u2014the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows.<ref>\nFor a more formal treatment, see, for example: Eugene F. Fama. 1965. [http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/faj/1965/21/5 Random Walks in Stock Market Prices]. ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'', September/October 1965, Vol. 21, No. 5: 55\u201359.</ref> \nGiven the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more \"correct\", i.e. ''efficient'', prices: the [[efficient-market hypothesis]], or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See [[Earnings response coefficient]].)\nThe EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an \"optimal forecast\", i.e. prices using all available information, are identical to the ''best guess of the future'': the assumption of [[rational expectations]]. \nThe EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, but what is required, however, is that investors' reactions follow a [[normal distribution]]\u2014so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.\nIn the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news:<ref name=\"Shiller\"/> the [[random walk hypothesis]]. \nThis news, of course, could be \"good\" or \"bad\", minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. \n(The EMH was presented by [[Eugene Fama]] in a 1970 review paper,<ref>Fama, Eugene (1970). \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work\".

The CAPM was derived by [[Jack L. Treynor|Jack Treynor]] (1961, 1962), [[William F. Sharpe]] (1964), [[John Lintner]] (1965) and [[Jan Mossin]] (1966) independently. )\n\nBlack\u2013Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of [[option style|European-styled options]].\nThe model is expressed as the Black\u2013Scholes equation, a [[partial differential equation]] describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, [[geometric Brownian motion]] (see [[Brownian model of financial markets]]).\nThe key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently \"eliminate risk\", absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (<math>V</math>, the value, or price, of the option, grows at <math>r</math>, the risk-free rate).<ref name=\"Rubinstein\"/><ref name=\"Cochrane & Culp\"/>\nThis hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price\u2014in an arbitrage-free sense\u2014for the option. And this price is returned by the Black\u2013Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is [[Partial differential equation#Analytical solutions|the solution]] to the equation.)\nSince the formula is without reference to the share's expected return, Black\u2013Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the \"elimination of risk\" here, and mathematically consistent with [[#Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium]] above.

As regards [[asset pricing]], developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under \"Portfolio theory\" below, while \"Derivative pricing\" relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing.  As regards the use of capital, \"Corporate finance theory\" relates, mainly, to the application of these models.\n\n===Portfolio theory===\n[[Image:Pareto Efficient Frontier for the Markowitz Portfolio selection problem..png|thumb|right|200px|Plot of two criteria when maximizing return and minimizing risk in financial portfolios (Pareto-optimal points in red)]]\n[[File:Four Correlations.png|thumb|right|alt=Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.|Examples of bivariate copul\u00e6 used in finance.]]\n:''See also: [[Post-modern portfolio theory]] and {{sectionlink|Mathematical finance|Risk and portfolio management: the P world}}.''\nThe majority of developments here relate to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]] and the [[Carhart four-factor model]], propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The [[intertemporal CAPM]] and [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|consumption-based CAPM]] similarly extend the model. With [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption (in the economic sense)]] then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor's calculation of required return.\n\nWhereas the above extend the CAPM, the [[single-index model]] is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The [[arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT; [[Stephen Ross (economist)|Stephen Ross]], 1976) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT \"gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.\"<ref>''The Arbitrage Pricing Theory,'' Chapter VI in Goetzmann, under External links.</ref> It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.\n\nAs regards [[portfolio optimization]], the [[Black\u2013Litterman model]] departs from the original [[Markowitz model]] - i.e. of constructing portfolios via an [[efficient frontier]]. Black\u2013Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the 'views' (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] can be applied; here deriving a [[Pareto efficient]] portfolio. The [[universal portfolio algorithm]] ([[Thomas M. Cover]], 1991) applies [[machine learning]] to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data. [[Behavioral portfolio theory]] recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals.  Copulas have [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|lately been applied here]]; recently this is the case also [[List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications#Finance_and_Economics|for genetic algorithms]] and [[Machine learning #Applications|Machine learning, more generally]].

Various [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|other numeric techniques]] have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that [[martingale pricing]] is now the standard approach.\n\nDrawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based off the same logic (using \"[[contingent claim analysis]]\"). [[Real options valuation]] allows that option holders can influence the option's underlying; models for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|employee stock option valuation]] explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; [[Credit derivative]]s allow that payment obligations and / or delivery requirements might not be honored. [[Exotic derivative]]s are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or [[Copula (probability theory)#Quantitative finance|copula based analysis]].\n\nSimilarly, the various [[short rate model]]s allow for an extension of these techniques to [[Fixed income#Derivatives|fixed income-]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s.

(The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here \u2014 as well as implications re the standard theory \u2014 are discussed [[#Departures from normality|in the next section]].\n\nAfter the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]], a further development: ([[Over-the-counter (finance)|over the counter]]) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment \u2014 called into question during the crisis. \nAddressing this, therefore, issues such as [[counterparty credit risk]], funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing,<ref>[http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf \"Post-Crisis Pricing of Swaps using xVAs\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917015231/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/files/96440392/Master_Thesis_Pure.pdf |date=2016-09-17 }}, Christian Kj\u00f8lhede & Anders Bech, Master thesis, [[Aarhus University]]</ref> and a [[Credit Valuation Adjustment]], or CVA\u2014and potentially other ''valuation adjustments'', collectively [[xVA]]\u2014is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.\n\nA related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) curve, as opposed to [[LIBOR]] as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the [[overnight rate]]  is considered a better proxy for the \"risk-free rate\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=LIBOR vs. OIS: The Derivatives Discounting Dilemma |first=John |last=Hull |first2=Alan |last2=White |journal=[[Journal of Investment Management]] |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2013 |pages=14\u201327}}</ref> (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as \"[[Credit Support Annex|CSA]] discounting\".)

Wide departures from these are commonly observed, and there are thus, respectively, two main sets of challenges.\n\n===Departures from normality===\n[[Image:Ivsrf.gif|thumb|right|Implied volatility surface. The Z-axis represents implied volatility in percent, and X and Y axes represent the option delta, and the days to maturity.]]\n{{See also|Capital asset pricing model#Problems|Modern portfolio theory#Criticisms|Black\u2013Scholes model#Criticism and comments}}\nAs discussed, the assumptions that market prices follow a [[random walk]] and / or that asset returns are normally distributed are fundamental. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold (see [[Kurtosis risk]], [[Skewness risk]], [[Long tail]]) and that in practice, traders, analysts and [[financial risk management|risk managers]] frequently modify the \"standard models\" (see [[Model risk]]). In fact, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] had discovered already in the 1960s that changes in financial prices do not follow a [[normal distribution]], the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.\n\n[[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]] have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above \"classical\" financial models; while [[Jump diffusion#In economics and finance|jump diffusion models]] allow for (option) pricing incorporating [[jump process|\"jumps\"]] in the [[spot price]].<ref name=\"holes\">{{cite journal |title=  How to use the holes in Black-Scholes |first= Fischer |last=Black|author-link1=Fischer Black |journal=[[Journal of Applied Corporate Finance]] |volume=1|issue=Jan|year=1989|pages=67\u201373|jstor=|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6622.1989.tb00175.x}}</ref> \nRisk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard [[value at risk]] models with [[Historical simulation (finance)|historical simulations]], [[Mixture model#A financial model|mixture models]], [[principal component analysis]], [[extreme value theory]], as well as models for [[volatility clustering]].<ref>See for example III.A.3, in Carol Alexander, ed.

PRMIA Publications. {{ISBN|978-0976609704}}</ref> \nFor further discussion see {{sectionlink|Fat-tailed distribution|Applications in economics}}, and {{sectionlink|Value at risk|Criticism}}.\nPortfolio managers, likewise, have modified their optimization criteria and algorithms; see [[#Portfolio theory]] above. \n\nClosely related is the [[volatility smile]], where, as above, [[implied volatility]] \u2014 the volatility corresponding to the BSM price \u2014 is observed to ''differ'' as a function of [[strike price]] (i.e. [[moneyness]]), true only if the price-change distribution is non-normal, unlike that assumed by BSM. \nThe term structure of volatility describes how (implied) volatility differs for related options with different maturities. \nAn implied volatility surface is then a three-dimensional surface plot of volatility smile and term structure. \nThese empirical phenomena negate the assumption of constant volatility\u2014and [[log-normal]]ity\u2014upon which Black\u2013Scholes is built.<ref name=\"Haug Taleb\"/><ref name=\"holes\"/>  \nWithin institutions, the function of Black-Scholes is now, largely, to ''communicate'' prices via implied volatilities, much like bond prices are communicated via [[yield to maturity|YTM]]; see {{sectionlink|Black\u2013Scholes model|The volatility smile}}.\n\nIn consequence traders (and risk managers) now, instead, use \"smile-consistent\" models, firstly, when valuing derivatives not directly mapped to the surface, facilitating the pricing of other, i.e. non-quoted, strike/maturity combinations, or of non-European derivatives, and generally for hedging purposes.  \nThe two main approaches are [[local volatility]] and [[stochastic volatility]]. \nThe first returns the volatility which is \u201clocal\u201d to each spot-time point of the [[Finite difference methods for option pricing|finite difference-]] or [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing|simulation-based valuation]]; i.e. as opposed to implied volatility, which holds overall.  In this way calculated prices \u2014 and numeric structures \u2014 are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense.  The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first [[Stochastic volatility#Calibration and estimation|calibrated to observed prices]], and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are [[Heston model|Heston]], [[SABR volatility model|SABR]] and [[Constant elasticity of variance model|CEV]]. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.<ref>{{cite journal |title=  Managing smile risk |first= Patrick |last=Hagan |display-authors=etal|journal=[[Wilmott Magazine]] |volume=|issue=Sep|year=2002 |pages=84\u2013108|jstor=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nRelated to local volatility are the [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice]]-based [[Implied binomial tree|implied-binomial]] and [[Implied trinomial tree|-trinomial trees]] \u2014 essentially a discretization of the approach \u2014 which are similarly (but less commonly) used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. \n[[Edgeworth binomial tree]]s allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) [[Skewness|skew]] and [[kurtosis]] in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required.<ref>See for example Pg 217 of: Jackson, Mary; Mike Staunton (2001).

Working paper, [[London School of Economics and Political Science]].</ref>\n\nAs discussed, additional to assuming log-normality in returns, \"classical\" BSM-type models also (implicitly) assume the existence of a credit-risk-free environment, where one can perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge, and then discount at \"the\" risk-free-rate.  \nAnd therefore, post crisis, the various x-value adjustments must be employed, effectively correcting the risk-neutral value for [[counterparty credit risk|counterparty-]] and [[XVA#Valuation_adjustments|funding-related]] risk.\nThese xVA are ''additional'' to any smile or surface effect. This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no \"[[double counting (accounting)|double counting]]\" of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...) \n\nAs mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly [[financial engineering]]) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above \"extreme event\" approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. \nRecognizing this, [[James Rickards]], amongst other critics of financial economics, suggests that, instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely: \n:\"The  current  system,  based  on  the  idea  that  risk  is  distributed  in  the  shape  of  a  bell  curve,  is  flawed...

Recently, however, researchers in [[experimental economics]] and [[experimental finance]] have challenged this assumption [[Empirical evidence|empirically]]. These assumptions are also challenged [[Theory|theoretically]], by [[behavioral finance]], a discipline primarily concerned with the limits to rationality of economic agents.\n\nConsistent with, and complementary to these findings, various persistent [[Market anomaly|market anomalies]] have been documented, these being price and/or return distortions\u2014e.g. [[size premium]]s\u2014which appear to contradict the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]; [[calendar effect]]s are the best known group here. Related to these are various of the [[economic puzzle]]s, concerning phenomena similarly contradicting the theory. The ''[[equity premium puzzle]]'', as one example, arises in that the difference between the observed returns on stocks as compared to government bonds is consistently higher than the [[risk premium]] rational equity investors should demand, an \"[[abnormal return]]\".

Built during the [[Crown Colony of Malta]], it was a vernacular structure which appears in an iconic 1885 photo of the former fishing village - prior development into a residential and holiday location. It was among the few old buildings in the area at one time, which at some point became a residence until it became vacant.\n\nBeing at one side in a development zone and on another side in a conservation area made the latter irrelevant, according to some Planning Authority (PA) regulations. It thus became subjected to demolition and re-development, and the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|Superintendence for Cultural Property]] found no objection by claiming that it has vernacular characteristics with no detailed design.\n\nThe initial observation and decisions taken by the PA and the Superintendence have received waves of criticism to demolish the building, to replace it with another double purpose building - with NGOs, the local council, residents and interesting parties reaching out information and file opposition to proceed with the proposed development. The building was demolished gradually in 2018.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Marsaskala}}\n{{see also|List of monuments in Marsaskala}}\nThe location where the building existed until 2018 was originally a [[fishing village]] but gradually developed into a crowded [[urbanization|building zone]], as a holiday destination for locals and foreigners as well as permanent residence to others.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|2000|p=138}}</ref> It was inhabited since pre-history and was a Roman port in antiquity.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1971|p=198}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Atauz|2008|p=354}}</ref> Throughout [[History of Malta|Maltese history]] Marsaskala was prone to barbary attacks from the sea and was not safe to live and prosper.

A number of coastal defence structures were built in different centuries.

The NGOs observed that such buildings are being demolished by developers and replaced by non-contextual buildings with a building style not traditional to Maltese built environment. The NGOs believe that, if the developers are willing, such building could be presereved and converted into a number of possibilities such accommodation in hospitality services and catering. The NGOs fear that not enough is being done to preserve vernacular architecture and when such buildings are demolished it changes the typical area where the building stood. The NGOs believe that the building in Marsaskala has contributed to the architectural development of the village.<ref name=\"pressreader.com\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Grech|2017h|pp=1, 4}}</ref>\n\nThe Executive President of Din l-Art \u0126elwa, Maria Grazia Cassar, became a militant spokesperson against the demolition of vernacular buildings in rural and urban environment. She said that such buildings are pertinent to be retained. A meeting was set up by Din l-Art \u0126elwa where the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and other distinctive people were invited. The meeting took place right after the [[Maltese general election, 2017|2017 general election]] which was thought to be an ideal period to set mutual understandings. The NGO presented its views against the permissions lately given by the Planning Authority, but the response was a set back for the organisation.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassar|2018|p=2}}</ref>\n\nFlimkien g\u0127al Ambjent A\u0127jar requested an investigation into the granting of the permission.<ref>{{harvnb|TVM|2017}}</ref>\n\n===Residents===\nPeople from Marsaskala opposed the demolition of the building, together with rejecting any replacement building, independent and irrelevant to the opinion of the superintendence. The main reason behind the objection by Marsaskala residents was to maintain the old building and restore it. Some official objections by individuals, numbering at least 18, were presented to the Planning Authority. Driven by the outrage of many other residents, the Marsaskala Local Council has showed opposition and supported similar views of the objectors.<ref name=oldest/>\n\n===Media===\nMore people were informed through the media and social network.<ref>{{harvnb|Net News|2017}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26, 2017, the [[Malta Today]] revealed the planning application proposal.

[[Marsaskala]], Malta. Built during the [[Crown Colony of Malta]], it was a vernacular structure which appears in an iconic 1885 photo of the former fishing village - prior development into a residential and holiday location. It was among the few old buildings in the area at one time, which at some point became a residence until it became vacant.\n\nBeing at one side in a development zone and on another side in a conservation area made the latter irrelevant, according to some Planning Authority (PA) regulations. It thus became subjected to demolition and re-development, and the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|Superintendence for Cultural Property]] found no objection by claiming that it has vernacular characteristics with no detailed design.\n\nThe initial observation and decisions taken by the PA and the Superintendence have received waves of criticism to demolish the building, to replace it with another double purpose building - with NGOs, the local council, residents and interesting parties reaching out information and file opposition to proceed with the proposed development. The building was demolished gradually in 2018.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Marsaskala}}\n{{see also|List of monuments in Marsaskala}}\nThe location where the building existed until 2018 was originally a [[fishing village]] but gradually developed into a crowded [[urbanization|building zone]], as a holiday destination for locals and foreigners as well as permanent residence to others.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|2000|p=138}}</ref> It was inhabited since pre-history and was a Roman port in antiquity.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1971|p=198}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Atauz|2008|p=354}}</ref> Throughout [[History of Malta|Maltese history]] Marsaskala was prone to barbary attacks from the sea and was not safe to live and prosper. The nearby then villages, and later cities, of [[\u017bejtun]] and [[\u017babbar]] were subject to similar landings from sea.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsaskala Local Council|2014}}</ref>\n\nBuildings erected in the area and in the immediate vicinity were generally fortified. A number of coastal defence structures were built in different centuries. Thus there was minimum interest to develop a community until well in the 19th century, with the exception of few [[farmhouse]]s, when the course of events and situation in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] has changed drastically.<ref>{{harvnb|My Guide Malta|2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Context===\nAccording to Louis de Boisgelin (historian of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St John]]), in 1805 there was nothing notable as for [[urban development]] in Marsaskala, apart from the port which was evidently used as a harbour.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerdu|1805|p=21}}</ref> By 10 March 1854, fishing in the zone required permission with respect to certain conditions.<ref>{{harvnb|Proclamations|1853|pp=28, 29}}</ref> Since the 1950s,<ref>{{harvnb|Cilia|2002|pp=33, 34}}</ref> electricity also became available for [[private property]] at the request of the owners.<ref name=journal>{{harvnb|Time|Tide|1971|p=29}}</ref> In 1969 it was observed that there was the first [[building boom]] in the area.<ref name=balls>{{harvnb|Balls|1969|pp=76\u201378}}</ref> By the 1970s, [[sewage]] system was installed for most of the buildings of Marsaskala.<ref>{{harvnb|National Gov. Pub.|1975|p=96}}</ref>\n\nThe surrounding land remained mostly arable with traditional terraced fields at the backdrop of the summer residences until the 20th century, when permissions was granted to build apartment dwellings.<ref name=seaside/> People from the [[Three Cities|Cottonera]] had built a number of summer residences in Marsaskala, also because in the 19th century the area was under the parish of [[Senglea]]. Marsaskala became a vice-parish of \u017babbar by the early 20th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Attard|2017a|pp=2\u20134}}</ref> Another part of Marsaskala was part of \u017bejtun.<ref>{{harvnb|Zen|2009a}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the area where the building stands saw a massive transformation. A government census taken on 26 April 1931 found a good number of habitable houses of the time were vacant throughout the year.<ref>{{harvnb|Government Census|1932|p=xxiii}}</ref> During WWII the few residents of the village were evacuated, leaving only the presence of the British military.<ref>{{harvnb|Pullicino|2012|p=92}}</ref> On 19 March 1949, Marsaskala was declared a parish of its own, when the villagers did not just return but there was also an increase in population.<ref>{{harvnb|Bonnici|Cassar|2004|p=227}}</ref> In 1963 it was noted that most houses in Marsaskala were next to the sea, with the main reason being to enjoy the [[Sea breeze|breeze]] in warm weather.<ref>{{harvnb|Rose|1963|p=139}}</ref>\n\nThe town experienced another significant change in 1982, from a rural and fishing village to a major tourist destination,<ref name=seaside/> in which period was experiencing a \u201cVillscape in transition\u201d.<ref>{{harvnb|Young|1983|pp=35-41}}</ref> the [[Jerma Palace Hotel]] was opened in the locality which led to a [[consequentialism]] further development; this has resulted in the change of use of the area, and sea activity took a minor role since the 1980s.<ref name=seaside/><ref>{{harvnb|Independent|2016}}</ref> The hotel closed down in 2007 and other alternatives were sought by the Marsaskala Local Council to regenerate the area. The Council has noted that cultural heritage was the prime reason for foreigners to visit the area but at the same time it was not being preserved.<ref>{{harvnb|Marsaskala Local Council|2012}}</ref>\n\nA number of building blocks, in the vicinity of Triq ix-Xatt and close to sea, were deemed an [[eyesore]] and unsustainable to the village in 2010.<ref name=demolition/> This and other formalized the question whether Marsaskala has adopted [[Bu\u0121ibba|Bugibbisation]], which happens when a large concentration of buildings overshadow the characteristics of a traditional Maltese village.<ref name=seaside/> Most traditional old houses in Marsaskala have been destroyed and replaced with economical accommodation for the growing demand of the population; this has led a rapid destruction of much of the [[List of monuments in Marsaskala|heritage of Marsaskala]], of which since the 21st century the urban area barely portrays what used to be a fishing village.<ref>{{harvnb|Vella|2017}}</ref> A proposed regeneration for Marsaskala in 2008 supported the idea of a \u201cTransit Village\u201d with a hybrid transformation.<ref>{{harvnb|Studio Malta|2008}}</ref>\n\n===Area===\nThe first group of houses in Marsaskala were constructed around the mid-19th century, during the [[Crown Colony of Malta]], and some were built to be used for the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] such as [[fishing]], but also for [[leisure]]. Other working activities involved farming and collecting salt from pans at the sea shore.<ref name=seaside>{{harvnb|Baldacchino|2013|p=99}}</ref> The most prominent buildings were those next to the shore. Some of these houses were used almost only for [[summer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scerri}}</ref> These houses were generally small with plenty of space in front and behind.<ref>{{harvnb|Restoration Directorate|2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s several British people lived in the proximity of the building and a road, Triq ix-Xatt, in front of the building was constructed partially by [[land reclamation]] to accommodate more access to traffic and pedestrians.<ref>{{harvnb|Vella|2014}}</ref> At this point, the first wave of food stores and restaurants catered for the population who lived there and its visitors.<ref name=journal/> Several of the early buildings in Triq ix-Xatt were not spared from modifications to accommodate restaurants, cafeterias and take-aways.<ref name=seaside/> At this point, a natural sandy beach in Triq ix-Xatt was lost forever as it has become too spoilt to dare to swim.<ref name=seaside/> Some of the cultural buildings in Triq ix-Xatt were demolished or partially demolished for similar reasons, as this made well for greater income to the developers.<ref name=demolition>{{harvnb|Holden|Fennell|2013|p=204}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, the remaining empty land on one side of the building was developed with the erection of the [[Brighton]] Hotel. The place became much frequented because of the Brighton [[Pizzeria]]; this also has since made an impact in the whereabouts of the building because of the [[litter]] the clients left.<ref name=seaside/><ref>{{harvnb|Baldacchino|2013|p=96}}</ref> Some of the traditional houses in the street were demolished and replaced by modern buildings, described as being mediocre in terms of architecture and aesthetic design.<ref>{{harvnb|Debono|2017g|p=6}}</ref>\n\n===Building===\n[[File:Malta 1 (6951827865).jpg|thumb|left|The last building on the right, fronted by the marina]]\nThe building at 3, Triq ix-Xatt (Marina Street),<ref>{{harvnb|Independent|2008}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dietrich|2010|p=152}}</ref> Marsaskala, was located between the front of scheduled [[Villa Apap Bologna]] with its adjoint chapel and the main promenade of the village.<ref name=debonos/> It was built sometimes in the 19th century but its exact date and other details are unknown.<ref name=debonos/> The Planning Authority was requested by the Local Council and others to make a study about the details of the building but these were not carried out.<ref name=debonos/> It is established that the building appeared on site since the earliest and all photos know of the site.<ref name=\"maltanews.today\">{{harvnb|Mamo|2017}}</ref> The first photo taken of the area, showing the building, is in a nostalgic photograph of 1885.<ref>{{harvnb|Zen|2009b}}</ref> It is generally described as of being vernacular architecture, meaning it may had no architect or general planning.<ref>{{harvnb|Cassar|2017a|pp=10, 11}}</ref> The latter implies that it was built for convenience to the owners for specific purpose close to the sea.<ref name=grazia>{{harvnb|Cassar|2017b}}</ref> It is known to have been one of the few early sea-side houses.<ref>{{harvnb|Independent|2013}}</ref> It has been described as one of the oldest residential properties in Marsaskala.<ref name=debonos/><ref name=nazzjon>{{harvnb|Attard|2017b|pp=1\u20132}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Borg|2017a}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Borg|2017b}}</ref> It was entirely located within the Urban Conservation Area (UCA).<ref name=debonos/>\n\nUntil more buildings became on demand and some roads were required to be constructed, patrons of summer houses freely walked from their doorsteps on natural coast formation to the sea for a swim.<ref>{{harvnb|Tayar|2000|pp=51, 52}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 2010s the residence was sold and left vacant by the new patron.

It had a number of apertures, some of which were walled up over the years, with the remaining [[apertures]] having modern black [[aluminum]] frames, which replaced other apertures.

The NGOs believe that, if the developers are willing, such building could be presereved and converted into a number of possibilities such accommodation in hospitality services and catering.

The meeting took place right after the [[Maltese general election, 2017|2017 general election]] which was thought to be an ideal period to set mutual understandings.

It received its first arrivals on 2 December 1941. In early 1942, the camp experienced an outbreak of [[typhoid fever]] which was exacerbated by the arrival of Jewish deportees from Slovenia. The NDH's ruling [[Usta\u0161e]] movement subsequently assumed direct control of the camp and many detainees were consequently subjected to torture, rape and degradation. In mid-May, Croatia's [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] ordered that the camp be shut down. Between 15 June and 7 July 1942, 2,400\u20133,200 detainees were transported to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]], where they perished. As many as 3,800 women and children were interred at the camp over the course of its existence, and at least 569 women and children died, although this figure may have been as high as 800. \n\nIn 1945, Yugoslavia's new [[communist]] authorities undertook exhumations on the \u0110akovo camp's former grounds. In September 1952, the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia unveiled a monument to the victims of the camp. Following [[Croatia]]'s independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the former campsite was turned into a [[gas station]]. A commemorative ceremony is held every year at the site, as well as at a nearby cemetery where the bodies of detainees were buried. The cemetery is unique in that it is the only burial site in Europe where victims of [[the Holocaust]] were interred under their first and last names and not merely their [[Identification of inmates in German concentration camps|inmate number]]. In 2013, a sculpture titled Peace in Heaven, by Croatian-born Israeli sculptor [[Dina Merhav]], was unveiled in \u0110akovo to commemorate those who were interred at the camp.\n\n==Background==\n===Interwar Yugoslavia===\nEthnic tensions between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] increased following the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. During the [[interwar period]], many Croats came to resent Serb political hegemony in the newly established state, which resulted in the passing of legislation that favoured Serb political, religious and business interests.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=158}} Tensions flared in 1928, following the shooting of five Croatian parliamentary deputies by the Montenegrin Serb politician [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]]. Two died on the spot and two others were wounded but survived. A fifth, the opposition leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], died nearly two months later of complications attributed to the shooting. In January 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] instituted a [[6 January Dictatorship|royal dictatorship]] and renamed the country [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Shortly thereafter, the Croatian politician [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] formed the [[Usta\u0161e]], a [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movement which sought to achieve Croatian independence through violent means. The Usta\u0161e were outlawed in Yugoslavia, but received covert assistance from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which had territorial pretensions in [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. The Usta\u0161e carried out a number of actions aimed at undermining Yugoslavia, most notably the [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932 and the assassination of King Alexander in [[Marseilles]] in 1934. Following Alexander's assassination, the Usta\u0161e movement's senior-most leaders, including Paveli\u0107, were tried [[trial in absentia|in absentia]] in both France and Yugoslavia and sentenced to death, but were granted protection by Mussolini and thus evaded capture.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=25\u201334}}\n\nFollowing the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' between [[Nazi Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with Germany and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the [[Axis powers]]. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] and occupied neighbouring [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Albania]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Royal Yugoslav Government declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=8}} Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} In late February 1941, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} Intending to secure his southern flank for the [[Operation Barbarossa|impending attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]], German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Royal Yugoslav Government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], in a bloodless [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They placed his teenage nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] on the throne and brought to power a \"government of national unity\" led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=10\u201313}} The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered Yugoslavia's [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]], which commenced on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}}\n\n===Creation of the NDH===\n[[File:Ndh 1941.png|thumb|right|230px|A map depicting the occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u20131943]]\nYugoslavia was quickly overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. Hitler wished to irrevocably dismantle Yugoslavia, which he dubbed a \"[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] construct\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Hitler was known to be a virulent [[anti-Serb sentiment|Serbophobe]].{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|p=238}}{{sfn|Lampe|2014|loc=p. 325, note 20}} He and other senior German leaders considered the Serbs to be [[Untermensch|subhuman]] ({{lang-de|Untermensch}}).{{sfn|Umbreit|2000|p=97}} Thus, in Hitler's conception of the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order of Europe]], they were to be collectively punished.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Serbia was reduced to its pre-[[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] borders, becoming the only country in the Western Balkans to be directly occupied by the Germans.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=49}} Serb-inhabited territories west of the [[Drina]] River were incorporated into the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}; NDH), which included most of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} The establishment of the NDH had been announced over the radio by [[Slavko Kvaternik]], a former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] officer who had been in contact with Croatian nationalists abroad, on 10 April.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=155}}\n\nPaveli\u0107 entered the NDH on 13 April and reached [[Zagreb]] two days later. The same day, Germany and Italy extended diplomatic recognition to the NDH. Paveli\u0107 assumed control and bestowed himself the title ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (\"leader\").{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} At the time of its establishment, the NDH had a population of 6.5 million inhabitants, about half of whom were Croats. It was also inhabited by nearly two million Serbs, who constituted about one-third of its total population.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=19\u201320}} Lands inhabited by Serbs accounted for 60\u201370 percent of the NDH's total landmass. Nevertheless, Serbs \u2013 along with others whom the Usta\u0161e deemed \"undesirable\", such as [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] \u2013 were denied citizenship on the basis that they were not [[Aryan race|Aryan]]s. Within hours of the NDH's creation, businesses brandished signs reading: \"No Serbs, Gypsies, Jews and dogs\". Additionally, immediate measures were taken to expunge the presence of the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] from the public sphere.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=31\u201332}} On 17 April, the Usta\u0161e instituted the Legal Provision for the Defence of the People and State, a law legitimizing the establishment of concentration camps and the mass shooting of hostages in the NDH. Thirty concentration camps in total were established across the puppet state.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|pp=136\u2013138}}\n\n==Operation==\n===Establishment and first arrivals===\n[[\u0110akovo]], located about {{convert|197|km}} southeast of Zagreb, is notable as the seat of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of \u0110akovo-Osijek|Archdiocese of \u0110akovo-Osijek]], and prior to and during World War II, was the home to one of Croatia's largest concentrations of ethnic [[Germans]].{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} In November 1941, two senior local Jewish community leaders, Dragutin Rosenberg and Aleksandar Klein, persuaded the head of the Jewish Bureau of the Usta\u0161e Surveillance Service ({{lang-hr|Usta\u0161ka nadzorna slu\u017eba}}; UNS), Vilko K\u00fchnel, to authorize the establishment of a refugee camp in \u0110akovo.{{sfn|Bauer|1981|p=281}} In late November, the [[Osijek]] police ordered the town's Jewish community to make room within five days for 2,000 Jewish women and children. Whereas women and children would be deported to \u0110akovo, Jewish males were to be deported to the largest of the NDH's concentration camps, [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]]. Local Jewish youths quickly converted a {{convert|40|m|adj=on}}-long, three-storey abandoned [[flour mill]] that had once been used by the archdiocese into a refugee camp to house the women and children. Several surrounding buildings were subsequently added to the refugee camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nOn 2 December, 1,800 Jewish women and children and fifty Bosnian Serb women arrived at the camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Most were from [[Sarajevo]], but also from Zagreb, [[Po\u017eega, Croatia|Po\u017eega]], [[Pakrac]], [[Slavonski Brod|Slavonski]] and [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]], [[Nova Gradi\u0161ka]], [[Zenica]] and [[Travnik]].{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}} On 8 December, the Jewish community in Sarajevo requested that the Jewish communities in Sarajevo, Zagreb and Osijek be permitted to provide donations to support the civilian populations of the Jasenovac, Loborgrad and \u0110akovo camps. Ten days later, the UNS's Jewish Bureau permitted the funds that had been raised by the Jewish communities to be allocated to the detainees at these camps.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|p=160}} During their confinement, the detainees were made to do manual labour. Ceramics and leather workshops were established within the camp, where most of the adult female detainees worked. As many as 400 women were made to do agricultural work on farms and in fields near the camp. A kindergarten was organized for the children.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}  \n\nThe campgrounds provided inadequate shelter from the elements.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} The detainees were subjected to appalling sanitary conditions.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=253}} During the first several months of its existence, the camp was guarded by two or three police officers under the command of Dragutin Mayer.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} The policemen allowed detainees to leave the camp to purchase necessary goods in the town, to visit the hospital in Osijek and to call relatives and friends.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=122}} Although the detainees were permitted to purchase medicine and the pesticide [[Zyklon B]] for disinfection, they were [[Price gouging|price gouged]] by the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|pp=315\u2013316}}\n\n===Typhoid epidemic===\nIn early 1942, the camp experienced a [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] outbreak. Prominent locals, most notably the Archbishop of \u0110akovo, [[Anton Ak\u0161amovi\u0107]], feared that the outbreak could spread outside the camp. On 30 January 1942, the authorities dispatched a medical commission to \u0110akovo, which took note of the inhumane living conditions to which the detainees were subjected, and recommended an increase in the amount and quality of medical supplies allocated to the camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} No action was taken to remedy the situation.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} A small number of prisoners were consequently taken to hospitals. Around the same time, local officials demanded that the camp be relocated further from the town to stem the epidemic, but because the arrest and deportation of Slovenian Jews had recently commenced, the UNS sought to enlarge the camp. These deportations led to an increase in the number and size of transports to the camp by February.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} A transport of 1,161 women, originating from [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka concentration camp|Stara Gradi\u0161ka]], arrived at \u0110akovo on 24 February 1942. By this time, the camp housed about 3,000 deportees, around one-quarter of them children under the age of 14.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Of the 1,073 women and children who arrived at \u0110akovo between 26 February and 6 March 1942, 274 \u2013 or just over one-quarter \u2013 were from Zagreb.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}}\n\nThe large increase in the number of detainees swiftly worsened the typhoid epidemic.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} According to the cultural anthropologist [[Peter W. Van Arsdale]], the transfer of women and children from Stara Gradi\u0161ka to \u0110akovo was made intentionally to further the spread of typhoid fever among the \u0110akovo detainees.{{sfn|van Arsdale|2006|p=72}} By March 1942, 631 detainees were hospitalized, an additional 219 were infected, and 131 had died. In response to the epidemic, the authorities and the local Jewish community agreed to place some of the Jewish children from the camp in the care of local Jewish foster families.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} All Jewish children under the age of ten were to be removed from the camp as part of this arrangement.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=122}} Jewish community officials administered the camp until 29 March 1942. In mid-April 1942, the Usta\u0161e assumed direct control of the camp with a detachment from Jasenovac led by Jozo Matijevi\u0107. Some of these new guards set up living quarters in adjacent villages and others lived on the camp premises. The new camp guards ensured that none of the detainees could leave the campgrounds, as had previously been the case, and the detainees were thus no longer able to make contact with the outside world. All subsequent aid deliveries were seized by the Usta\u0161e and detainees were often robbed.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Hunger became rampant; daily rations were reduced to two or three potatoes per person.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} Many detainees were subjected to rape and torture.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=62}} Although no systematic killings took place, detainees were routinely abused and humiliated, and multiple individual killings occurred as well.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=253}} On one occasion, the Usta\u0161e amused themselves by tossing loaves of bread to the starving children. When the children set upon the bread, the Usta\u0161e released their hungry dogs upon them. According to one eyewitness, after a dog tore a piece of flesh from one of the children, one of the Usta\u0161e dragged both the child and the dog into a storehouse and locked the door. As the child screamed, the Usta\u0161e danced to the [[accordion]].{{sfn|Jancar-Webster|1990|p=132}}\n\n===Closure===\n[[File:Voz Jasenovac.JPG|thumb|right|260px|One of the trains that transported prisoners to [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] {{small|(on display in 2010)|small}}]]\nBy May, as many as 800 detainees had succumbed to typhoid fever,{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} which killed between five and six detainees daily.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=62}} An additional 700 detainees contracted other diseases.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|loc=p. 160, note 190}} By this point, the camp had become a burden to the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} On 18 May 1942, the Croatian [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] asked the [[RAVSIGUR|Directorate for Public Order and Security]] ({{lang-hr|Ravnateljstvo za javni red i sigurnost}}; RAVSIGUR) to dissolve the camp within one month.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} This message was personally relayed to RAVSIGUR by the Minister of Health, Ivo Petri\u0107, who proposed the \"relocation\" or \"closing down\" of the camp together with the provision of \"improved and increased food for the prisoners\". Despite Petri\u0107's suggestions, RAVSIGUR decided it would be most expedient to kill all the detainees.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} Zagreb's Jewish community subsequently offered to help restock the camp, but the authorities declined their offer because they had already decided to liquidate it.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}}\n\nBetween 15 June and 7 July, 2,400\u20133,200 detainees were transported from \u0110akovo to Jasenovac.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=286}} The operation was overseen by [[Lieutenant]] ({{lang-hr|Poru\u010dnik}}) Joso Matkovi\u0107.{{sfn|Basta|1986|p=176}} For days, they were left in locked railways carriages on the train tracks outside the camp, and many consequently died of heat, thirst and hunger. Those that survived this ordeal were taken off the railway carriages, ferried across the [[Sava]] River and killed.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=286}} Their bodies were then pushed into the Sava by [[Romani people|Romani]] slave labourers, who were later killed themselves.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} Unaware of their fate, between 7 July and 14 July, the Jewish community in Zagreb sent about 120 food parcels to Jasenovac for the former \u0110akovo detainees. By September 1942, members of Zagreb's Jewish community began to suspect that the detainees had been killed, although when asked, Usta\u0161e officials would only reply that the detainees had been transported to Jasenovac.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=361}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Peace in Heaven 2013 \u0110akovo Croatia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Peace in Heaven monument, by [[Dina Merhav]], commemorates those who were interred at \u0110akovo]]\nDuring the course of its existence, the \u0110akovo camp housed as many as 3,800 civilians.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}} In August 1942, around 1,200 Jews were deported from Osijek, leaving all but 40 to 50 of the Jewish foster children that had been taken from the \u0110akovo camp left in the town. Many of these children subsequently escaped to [[Split, Croatia|Split]], in the Italian occupation zone.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=123}} Around 25,000 Jews were killed in the NDH during [[the Holocaust]], according to [[Yad Vashem]].{{sfn|Yad Vashem 2020}} In 1945, the Yugoslav authorities undertook exhumations on the \u0110akovo camp's former grounds. The following year, former Jasenovac concentration camp administrator [[Miroslav Filipovi\u0107]] testified about the killing of the \u0110akovo detainees at Jasenovac in July 1942.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nIn September 1952, the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia unveiled five monuments to the victims of the Holocaust in Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo, Novi Sad and \u0110akovo.{{sfn|Byford|2013|p=523}} Following [[Croatia]]'s independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the former campsite was turned into a [[gas station]].{{sfn|Suboti\u0107|2019|p=122}} A commemorative ceremony is held at the site every year on the first Sunday in June. The commemoration also encompasses the nearby cemetery in which the camp detainees who died were buried. The cemetery is unique in that it is the only burial site in Europe where victims of the Holocaust were interred under their first and last names and not merely their [[Identification of inmates in

It received its first arrivals on 2 December 1941. In early 1942, the camp experienced an outbreak of [[typhoid fever]] which was exacerbated by the arrival of Jewish deportees from Slovenia. The NDH's ruling [[Usta\u0161e]] movement subsequently assumed direct control of the camp and many detainees were consequently subjected to torture, rape and degradation. In mid-May, Croatia's [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] ordered that the camp be shut down. Between 15 June and 7 July 1942, 2,400\u20133,200 detainees were transported to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]], where they perished. As many as 3,800 women and children were interred at the camp over the course of its existence, and at least 569 women and children died, although this figure may have been as high as 800. \n\nIn 1945, Yugoslavia's new [[communist]] authorities undertook exhumations on the \u0110akovo camp's former grounds. In September 1952, the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia unveiled a monument to the victims of the camp. Following [[Croatia]]'s independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the former campsite was turned into a [[gas station]]. A commemorative ceremony is held every year at the site, as well as at a nearby cemetery where the bodies of detainees were buried. The cemetery is unique in that it is the only burial site in Europe where victims of [[the Holocaust]] were interred under their first and last names and not merely their [[Identification of inmates in German concentration camps|inmate number]]. In 2013, a sculpture titled Peace in Heaven, by Croatian-born Israeli sculptor [[Dina Merhav]], was unveiled in \u0110akovo to commemorate those who were interred at the camp.\n\n==Background==\n===Interwar Yugoslavia===\nEthnic tensions between [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] increased following the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. During the [[interwar period]], many Croats came to resent Serb political hegemony in the newly established state, which resulted in the passing of legislation that favoured Serb political, religious and business interests.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=158}} Tensions flared in 1928, following the shooting of five Croatian parliamentary deputies by the Montenegrin Serb politician [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]]. Two died on the spot and two others were wounded but survived. A fifth, the opposition leader [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], died nearly two months later of complications attributed to the shooting. In January 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] instituted a [[6 January Dictatorship|royal dictatorship]] and renamed the country [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Shortly thereafter, the Croatian politician [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] formed the [[Usta\u0161e]], a [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movement which sought to achieve Croatian independence through violent means. The Usta\u0161e were outlawed in Yugoslavia, but received covert assistance from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which had territorial pretensions in [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]. The Usta\u0161e carried out a number of actions aimed at undermining Yugoslavia, most notably the [[Velebit uprising]] in 1932 and the assassination of King Alexander in [[Marseilles]] in 1934. Following Alexander's assassination, the Usta\u0161e movement's senior-most leaders, including Paveli\u0107, were tried [[trial in absentia|in absentia]] in both France and Yugoslavia and sentenced to death, but were granted protection by Mussolini and thus evaded capture.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=25\u201334}}\n\nFollowing the 1938 ''[[Anschluss]]'' between [[Nazi Germany]] and [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with Germany and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the [[Axis powers]]. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded]] and occupied neighbouring [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Albania]].{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} At the outbreak of [[World War II]], the Royal Yugoslav Government declared its [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=8}} Between September and November 1940, [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] joined the [[Tripartite Pact]], aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=6\u20137}} In late February 1941, [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=12}} Intending to secure his southern flank for the [[Operation Barbarossa|impending attack]] on the [[Soviet Union]], German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Royal Yugoslav Government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, [[Serbian nationalism|Serbian nationalist]] [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] officers deposed the country's [[regent]], [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], in a bloodless [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]. They placed his teenage nephew [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter]] on the throne and brought to power a \"government of national unity\" led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=10\u201313}} The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered Yugoslavia's [[invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion]], which commenced on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=15}}\n\n===Creation of the NDH===\n[[File:Ndh 1941.png|thumb|right|230px|A map depicting the occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u20131943]]\nYugoslavia was quickly overwhelmed by the combined strength of the Axis powers and surrendered in less than two weeks. The government and royal family went into exile, and the country was occupied and dismembered by its neighbours. Hitler wished to irrevocably dismantle Yugoslavia, which he dubbed a \"[[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] construct\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Hitler was known to be a virulent [[anti-Serb sentiment|Serbophobe]].{{sfn|Shepherd|2012|p=238}}{{sfn|Lampe|2014|loc=p. 325, note 20}} He and other senior German leaders considered the Serbs to be [[Untermensch|subhuman]] ({{lang-de|Untermensch}}).{{sfn|Umbreit|2000|p=97}} Thus, in Hitler's conception of the [[New Order (Nazism)|New Order of Europe]], they were to be collectively punished.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=21}} Serbia was reduced to its pre-[[Balkan Wars|Balkan War]] borders, becoming the only country in the Western Balkans to be directly occupied by the Germans.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|p=49}} Serb-inhabited territories west of the [[Drina]] River were incorporated into the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna dr\u017eava Hrvatska}}; NDH), which included most of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=272}} The establishment of the NDH had been announced over the radio by [[Slavko Kvaternik]], a former [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] officer who had been in contact with Croatian nationalists abroad, on 10 April.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=155}}\n\nPaveli\u0107 entered the NDH on 13 April and reached [[Zagreb]] two days later. The same day, Germany and Italy extended diplomatic recognition to the NDH. Paveli\u0107 assumed control and bestowed himself the title ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (\"leader\").{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|p=133}} At the time of its establishment, the NDH had a population of 6.5 million inhabitants, about half of whom were Croats. It was also inhabited by nearly two million Serbs, who constituted about one-third of its total population.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=19\u201320}} Lands inhabited by Serbs accounted for 60\u201370 percent of the NDH's total landmass. Nevertheless, Serbs \u2013 along with others whom the Usta\u0161e deemed \"undesirable\", such as [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] \u2013 were denied citizenship on the basis that they were not [[Aryan race|Aryan]]s. Within hours of the NDH's creation, businesses brandished signs reading: \"No Serbs, Gypsies, Jews and dogs\". Additionally, immediate measures were taken to expunge the presence of the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] from the public sphere.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2008|pp=31\u201332}} On 17 April, the Usta\u0161e instituted the Legal Provision for the Defence of the People and State, a law legitimizing the establishment of concentration camps and the mass shooting of hostages in the NDH. Thirty concentration camps in total were established across the puppet state.{{sfn|Goldstein|1999|pp=136\u2013138}}\n\n==Operation==\n===Establishment and first arrivals===\n[[\u0110akovo]], located about {{convert|197|km}} southeast of Zagreb, is notable as the seat of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of \u0110akovo-Osijek|Archdiocese of \u0110akovo-Osijek]], and prior to and during World War II, was the home to one of Croatia's largest concentrations of ethnic [[Germans]].{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} In November 1941, two senior local Jewish community leaders, Dragutin Rosenberg and Aleksandar Klein, persuaded the head of the Jewish Bureau of the Usta\u0161e Surveillance Service ({{lang-hr|Usta\u0161ka nadzorna slu\u017eba}}; UNS), Vilko K\u00fchnel, to authorize the establishment of a refugee camp in \u0110akovo.{{sfn|Bauer|1981|p=281}} In late November, the [[Osijek]] police ordered the town's Jewish community to make room within five days for 2,000 Jewish women and children. Whereas women and children would be deported to \u0110akovo, Jewish males were to be deported to the largest of the NDH's concentration camps, [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]]. Local Jewish youths quickly converted a {{convert|40|m|adj=on}}-long, three-storey abandoned [[flour mill]] that had once been used by the archdiocese into a refugee camp to house the women and children. Several surrounding buildings were subsequently added to the refugee camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nOn 2 December, 1,800 Jewish women and children and fifty Bosnian Serb women arrived at the camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Most were from [[Sarajevo]], but also from Zagreb, [[Po\u017eega, Croatia|Po\u017eega]], [[Pakrac]], [[Slavonski Brod|Slavonski]] and [[Brod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanski Brod]], [[Nova Gradi\u0161ka]], [[Zenica]] and [[Travnik]].{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}} On 8 December, the Jewish community in Sarajevo requested that the Jewish communities in Sarajevo, Zagreb and Osijek be permitted to provide donations to support the civilian populations of the Jasenovac, Loborgrad and \u0110akovo camps. Ten days later, the UNS's Jewish Bureau permitted the funds that had been raised by the Jewish communities to be allocated to the detainees at these camps.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|p=160}} During their confinement, the detainees were made to do manual labour. Ceramics and leather workshops were established within the camp, where most of the adult female detainees worked. As many as 400 women were made to do agricultural work on farms and in fields near the camp. A kindergarten was organized for the children.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}  \n\nThe campgrounds provided inadequate shelter from the elements.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} The detainees were subjected to appalling sanitary conditions.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=253}} During the first several months of its existence, the camp was guarded by two or three police officers under the command of Dragutin Mayer.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} The policemen allowed detainees to leave the camp to purchase necessary goods in the town, to visit the hospital in Osijek and to call relatives and friends.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=122}} Although the detainees were permitted to purchase medicine and the pesticide [[Zyklon B]] for disinfection, they were [[Price gouging|price gouged]] by the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|pp=315\u2013316}}\n\n===Typhoid epidemic===\nIn early 1942, the camp experienced a [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] outbreak. Prominent locals, most notably the Archbishop of \u0110akovo, [[Anton Ak\u0161amovi\u0107]], feared that the outbreak could spread outside the camp. On 30 January 1942, the authorities dispatched a medical commission to \u0110akovo, which took note of the inhumane living conditions to which the detainees were subjected, and recommended an increase in the amount and quality of medical supplies allocated to the camp.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} No action was taken to remedy the situation.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} A small number of prisoners were consequently taken to hospitals. Around the same time, local officials demanded that the camp be relocated further from the town to stem the epidemic, but because the arrest and deportation of Slovenian Jews had recently commenced, the UNS sought to enlarge the camp. These deportations led to an increase in the number and size of transports to the camp by February.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} A transport of 1,161 women, originating from [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka concentration camp|Stara Gradi\u0161ka]], arrived at \u0110akovo on 24 February 1942. By this time, the camp housed about 3,000 deportees, around one-quarter of them children under the age of 14.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Of the 1,073 women and children who arrived at \u0110akovo between 26 February and 6 March 1942, 274 \u2013 or just over one-quarter \u2013 were from Zagreb.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}}\n\nThe large increase in the number of detainees swiftly worsened the typhoid epidemic.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} According to the cultural anthropologist [[Peter W. Van Arsdale]], the transfer of women and children from Stara Gradi\u0161ka to \u0110akovo was made intentionally to further the spread of typhoid fever among the \u0110akovo detainees.{{sfn|van Arsdale|2006|p=72}} By March 1942, 631 detainees were hospitalized, an additional 219 were infected, and 131 had died. In response to the epidemic, the authorities and the local Jewish community agreed to place some of the Jewish children from the camp in the care of local Jewish foster families.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} All Jewish children under the age of ten were to be removed from the camp as part of this arrangement.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=122}} Jewish community officials administered the camp until 29 March 1942. In mid-April 1942, the Usta\u0161e assumed direct control of the camp with a detachment from Jasenovac led by Jozo Matijevi\u0107. Some of these new guards set up living quarters in adjacent villages and others lived on the camp premises. The new camp guards ensured that none of the detainees could leave the campgrounds, as had previously been the case, and the detainees were thus no longer able to make contact with the outside world. All subsequent aid deliveries were seized by the Usta\u0161e and detainees were often robbed.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} Hunger became rampant; daily rations were reduced to two or three potatoes per person.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} Many detainees were subjected to rape and torture.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=62}} Although no systematic killings took place, detainees were routinely abused and humiliated, and multiple individual killings occurred as well.{{sfn|Matth\u00e4us|2013|p=253}} On one occasion, the Usta\u0161e amused themselves by tossing loaves of bread to the starving children. When the children set upon the bread, the Usta\u0161e released their hungry dogs upon them. According to one eyewitness, after a dog tore a piece of flesh from one of the children, one of the Usta\u0161e dragged both the child and the dog into a storehouse and locked the door. As the child screamed, the Usta\u0161e danced to the [[accordion]].{{sfn|Jancar-Webster|1990|p=132}}\n\n===Closure===\n[[File:Voz Jasenovac.JPG|thumb|right|260px|One of the trains that transported prisoners to [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] {{small|(on display in 2010)|small}}]]\nBy May, as many as 800 detainees had succumbed to typhoid fever,{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} which killed between five and six detainees daily.{{sfn|Mojzes|2011|p=62}} An additional 700 detainees contracted other diseases.{{sfn|Duli\u0107|2005|loc=p. 160, note 190}} By this point, the camp had become a burden to the Usta\u0161e.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} On 18 May 1942, the Croatian [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] asked the [[RAVSIGUR|Directorate for Public Order and Security]] ({{lang-hr|Ravnateljstvo za javni red i sigurnost}}; RAVSIGUR) to dissolve the camp within one month.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} This message was personally relayed to RAVSIGUR by the Minister of Health, Ivo Petri\u0107, who proposed the \"relocation\" or \"closing down\" of the camp together with the provision of \"improved and increased food for the prisoners\". Despite Petri\u0107's suggestions, RAVSIGUR decided it would be most expedient to kill all the detainees.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} Zagreb's Jewish community subsequently offered to help restock the camp, but the authorities declined their offer because they had already decided to liquidate it.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}}\n\nBetween 15 June and 7 July, 2,400\u20133,200 detainees were transported from \u0110akovo to Jasenovac.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=286}} The operation was overseen by [[Lieutenant]] ({{lang-hr|Poru\u010dnik}}) Joso Matkovi\u0107.{{sfn|Basta|1986|p=176}} For days, they were left in locked railways carriages on the train tracks outside the camp, and many consequently died of heat, thirst and hunger. Those that survived this ordeal were taken off the railway carriages, ferried across the [[Sava]] River and killed.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=286}} Their bodies were then pushed into the Sava by [[Romani people|Romani]] slave labourers, who were later killed themselves.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=360}} Unaware of their fate, between 7 July and 14 July, the Jewish community in Zagreb sent about 120 food parcels to Jasenovac for the former \u0110akovo detainees. By September 1942, members of Zagreb's Jewish community began to suspect that the detainees had been killed, although when asked, Usta\u0161e officials would only reply that the detainees had been transported to Jasenovac.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=361}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Peace in Heaven 2013 \u0110akovo Croatia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Peace in Heaven monument, by [[Dina Merhav]], commemorates those who were interred at \u0110akovo]]\nDuring the course of its existence, the \u0110akovo camp house as many as 3,800 civilians.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=315}} In August 1942, around 1,200 Jews were deported from Osijek, leaving all but 40 to 50 of the Jewish foster children that had been taken from the \u0110akovo camp left in the town. Many of these children subsequently escaped to [[Split, Croatia|Split]], in the Italian occupation zone.{{sfn|Gitman|2016|p=123}} Around 25,000 Jews were killed in the NDH during [[the Holocaust]], according to [[Yad Vashem]].{{sfn|Yad Vashem 2020}} In 1945, the Yugoslav authorities undertook exhumations on the \u0110akovo camp's former grounds. The following year, former Jasenovac concentration camp administrator [[Miroslav Filipovi\u0107]] testified about the killing of the \u0110akovo detainees at Jasenovac in July 1942.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}}\n\nIn September 1952, the Union of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia unveiled five monuments to the victims of the Holocaust in Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo, Novi Sad and \u0110akovo.{{sfn|Byford|2013|p=523}} Following [[Croatia]]'s independence from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the former campsite was turned into a [[gas station]].{{sfn|Suboti\u0107|2019|p=122}} A commemorative ceremony is held at the site every year on the first Sunday in June. The commemoration also encompasses the nearby cemetery in which the camp detainees who died were buried. The cemetery is unique in that it is the only burial site in Europe where victims of the Holocaust were interred under their first and last names and not merely their [[Identification of inmates in German concentration camps|inmate number]].{{sfn|Friedman|2013|p=94}} There are 569 camp victims buried in the cemetery.{{sfn|Goldstein|Goldstein|2016|p=316}} On this basis, the historians Jens Hoppe and Alexander Korb have concluded that the camp's mortality rate amounted to nearly 19 percent.{{sfn|Hoppe|Korb|2018|p=53}} In June 2013, a sculpture titled Peace in Heaven, by Croatian-born Israeli

In this period, women were becoming very active in the arts community, yet were still taken for granted. Bishop pushed against this attitude toward women artists with her insistence on applying herself both academically and politically in the art realm. Throughout her educational ventures, she was fully funded by her father's cousin, [[James Bishop Ford]], who aided her family in their time of need. Writing on this financial sponsorship, Isabel Bishop states that she viewed her gender as an advantage: \"I was lucky. I think if I had been a man the relative who sponsored my whole studenthood might not have done so. Men are supposed to make their own way. Young women were supposed to marry. But a young woman putting so much time and effort\u2014being so serious\u2014that was different\u2014that interested him.

Her work was greatly influenced by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and other Dutch and Flemish painters that she had discovered during trips to Europe. In 1932, Bishop began showing her work frequently at the newly opened [[Midtown Galleries]], where her work would be represented throughout her career.<ref name=\"Todd_p58\">Todd, Eileen. ''The \"New Woman\",''  p. 58</ref>\n\nIn 1934, Bishop married Dr. Harold G. Wolff, a neurologist, and moved to [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] New York. However, she continued to work in a loft studio near Union Square at 9 West [[14th Street (Manhattan)|Fourteenth St]], which she continued to use until 1984.<ref name=Lunde_p23/> She became interested in the interaction of form and ground and the mobility of everyday life, what she called \"unfixity\", life and movement captured on canvas.<ref name=\"Lunde_p23\">Bishop, Isabel, and Karl Lunde (1975) ''Isabel Bishop''.

She returned to the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] as an instructor from 1936 to 1937.

Though the family descended from old wealth, their immediate status was of the middle class, and financial insecurity forced the family to move often.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer father was a scholar of Greek and Latin.

In this period, women were becoming very active in the arts community, yet were still taken for granted. Bishop pushed against this attitude toward women artists with her insistence on applying herself both academically and politically in the art realm. Throughout her educational ventures, she was fully funded by her father's cousin, [[James Bishop Ford]], who aided her family in their time of need. Writing on this financial sponsorship, Isabel Bishop states that she viewed her gender as an advantage: \"I was lucky. I think if I had been a man the relative who sponsored my whole studenthood might not have done so. Men are supposed to make their own way. Young women were supposed to marry. But a young woman putting so much time and effort\u2014being so serious\u2014that was different\u2014that interested him. I don't think he would have subsidized me if I had been a boy.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Career==\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s she developed a realist style of painting, primarily depicting women in their daily routine on the streets of Manhattan. Her work was greatly influenced by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and other Dutch and Flemish painters that she had discovered during trips to Europe. In 1932, Bishop began showing her work frequently at the newly opened [[Midtown Galleries]], where her work would be represented throughout her career.<ref name=\"Todd_p58\">Todd, Eileen. ''The \"New Woman\",''  p. 58</ref>\n\nIn 1934, Bishop married Dr. Harold G. Wolff, a neurologist, and moved to [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] New York. However, she continued to work in a loft studio near Union Square at 9 West [[14th Street (Manhattan)|Fourteenth St]], which she continued to use until 1984.<ref name=Lunde_p23/> She became interested in the interaction of form and ground and the mobility of everyday life, what she called \"unfixity\", life and movement captured on canvas.<ref name=\"Lunde_p23\">Bishop, Isabel, and Karl Lunde (1975) ''Isabel Bishop''. New York: Abrams.</ref> Her style is noted for its sensitive modeling of form and \"a submarine pearliness and density of atmosphere\".<ref>Lunde, Karl. p. 27</ref> During this time, Bishop began working in various printing techniques, most notably [[aquatint]].\n\nHer work was included in the first three iterations of the [[Whitney Biennial]] in 1932, 1934, and 1936, as well as ten subsequent annual exhibitions at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. She returned to the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] as an instructor from 1936 to 1937.

The brigade was formed on the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 from [[Yeomanry]] mechanised cavalry regiments of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA). It saw a considerable amount of action during the war, beginning with the [[Western Desert Campaign]] where it was engaged in [[Operation Crusader]] and at the Battles of [[Battle of Gazala|Gazala]], [[Battle of Mersa Matruh|Mersa Matruh]], [[First Battle of El Alamein|First Alamein]] and [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|Alam el Halfa]]. It then joined the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] (the 'Desert Rats') for the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. It remained part of 7th Armoured for the rest of the war, including the campaigns in [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisia]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] and [[Western Front (World War II)#1944\u20131945: The Second Front|North West Europe]]. It continued in the postwar TA until 1956. The brigade's identity was re-established in the [[British Army|Regular Army]] between 1981 and 1993.\n\n==Mobilisation==\n22nd Heavy Armoured Brigade (the 'Heavy' was dropped on 14 April 1940) was formed at the outbreak of [[World War II]] on 3 September 1939 with the mobilisation of three part-time [[Yeomanry]] regiments of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA): [[2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars]] (RGH), [[3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)]] and [[4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)]] (CLY).<ref name = Joslen168>Joslen, pp. 168\u20139.</ref><ref name=Bellis1617>{{harvnb|Bellis|1994|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>{{efn|The 4th CLY was the 2nd Line duplicate of the 3rd CLY formed on 27 September 1939; 2nd RGH was the 2nd Line duplicate of the RGH formed on 24 August 1939.<ref>Frederick, pp. 30, 34.</ref>}} On 15 January 1940 it joined [[2nd Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Armoured Division]] in [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern Command]]. Because [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]] in France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had first call on scarce resources, the equipment of 2nd Armoured Division and its units proceeded slowly during the [[Phoney War]] period.\n\nWhen the [[Battle of France]] was lost and the BEF was being [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]] (without its equipment) at the end of May, the incomplete 2nd Armoured Division was the only armoured formation available to Home Forces. It was moved into the area between [[Northampton]] and [[Newmarket, Suffolk]], to be ready to counter-attack in the event of invasion.<ref name = Joslen16>Joslen, p. 16.</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-7.html Collier Chapter VII.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-8.html Collier, Chapter VIII.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-14.html Collier, Chapter 14.]</ref>\n\nAs the threat of invasion of the United Kingdom receded, it became possible to spare more troops and equipment to reinforce [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] facing the Italians. Most of 2nd Armoured Division was sent out on 26 October 1940, but 22nd Armoured Brigade remained in the UK, having been transferred to 1st Armoured Division.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref name = Joslen16/><ref>Playfair, Vol I, pp. 190, 244\u20137.</ref> It adopted the new organisation for an armoured brigade, which included a battalion of motorised infantry (2nd [[Kings Royal Rifle Corps]]).<ref name = Joslen168/> 10th Company [[Royal Army Service Corps]] provided the brigade's transport.<ref>Sutton, p. 136.</ref>\n\n==North Africa==\nBy the summer of 1941 the Italians in [[Italian Libya|Libya]] had been reinforced by General [[Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]] and the tide had turned against the British forces (most of 2nd Armoured Division was captured on 8 April<ref name = Joslen16/>). The Defence Committee of the British [[War cabinet#Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] decided to send out 22nd Armoured Brigade as soon as possible. It was recognised that the brigade had been trained in an anti-invasion role and would require a certain amount of preparation on arrival \u2013 in desert navigation, for instance. Its new [[Crusader tank]]s would also require require modification for desert conditions. But the Defence Committee hoped that the brigade would reach [[Egypt#British protectorate .281882.E2.80.931952.29|Egypt]] by mid-September and be ready for action by 1 November. In fact, the convoy carrying 22nd Armoured Brigade sailed (without its motor battalion) on 15 August, and after rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]] it finally arrived in Egypt on 2 October. The start of [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s counter-offensive ([[Operation Crusader]]) had to be put off until mid-November.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Farndale, pp. 199, 202\u20133.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol II, p. 256.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 4\u20135, 12, 30, 136.</ref>\n\n===Operation Crusader===\n[[File:IWM-E-6724-Crusader-19411126.jpg|thumb|right|Mark I Crusader tanks in the Western Deseret, November 1941.]]\nThe brigade joined [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] for Operation Crusader. Reinforced by C Battery, 4th [[Royal Horse Artillery]] and a Troop of D Battery, [[102nd (Northumberland Hussars) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery]], the brigade's role was to find and destroy the enemy armour. Eighth Army's advance began at dawn on 18 November and had approximately reached its first day's objectives by evening, but mechanical breakdowns had already reduced 22nd Armd Bde's tank strength from 155 to 136 runners. Next day it was reconnoitring forward towards Bir el Gub when the divisional commander arrived and ordered it to attack the Italian [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|Ariete Division]]. The inexperienced Yeomanry attacked impetuously, and after driving in the Italian covering troops came under heavy fire from the prepared positions behind. When it broke off the attack the brigade had lost 25 tanks, but had destroyed 34 Italian medium tanks, damaged 12 others and knocked out 12 guns. On 20 November the Afrika Korps counter-attacked and 22nd Armoured Bde was recalled from Bir el Gub to take part in the imminent armoured battle. It arrived too late to influence the indecisive battle. The garrison of [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]] began its breakout next day, and the Afrika Korps hurried north to prevent this, pursued by Eighth Army's armour, including 22nd Armoured Bde. However the pursuers were held up by rearguards, boggy ground, and the need to refuel. Over the next few days there was confused fighting round Sidi Rezegh airfield that reduced 22nd Armd Bde's fighting strength from 79 to 34 tanks by the end of 22 November. Next day it did its best to hold off a renewed [[Axis powers|Axis]] attack, but lost another third of its tanks. The fighting round Sidi Rezegh ended when Rommel sent the Afrika Korps on a 'Dash to the Wire', driving eastwards behind Eighth Army towards the Egyptian frontier. The crippled British armoured formations could do little about it, though Tobruk was relieved.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Farndale, p. 207, 210\u201311, 214-8, 221.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 37\u201354, 62\u20133.</ref>\n\nBy the time the brigade rejoined the fighting on 22 December it had received fresh tanks: 3rd and 4th CLY had 80 Crusaders between them, while 2nd RGH had 30 [[M3 Stuart]] light tanks. It was now under the direct command of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] (the rest of 1st Armoured Division had now arrived in Egypt but was still training for desert warfare). 22 to 25 December was spent regaining contact with the enemy's new positions. Then on 27 December Gen [[Ludwig Cr\u00fcwell]] commanding the armour of the Afrika Korps noticed a gap between 22nd Armd Bde at Chor es Sufan and [[22nd Guards Brigade]] north of [[Agedabia]]. Rommel approved Cr\u00fcwell's proposal to defeat the British armour in detail, and he attacked the following day with [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th]] and [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Divisions]] comprising 60 tanks (of which 44 were [[Panzer III]]s and [[Panzer IV|IV]]s), against 22nd Armd Bde's 90 available tanks (35 Stuarts, the rest Crusaders). 22nd Armoured Brigade also had under its command [[2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery]] (RHA) (two 8-gun 25-pounder batteries), 102nd (NH) Anti-Tank Regiment (three 12-gun batteries of 2-pounders), [[13th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|122 Light Anti-Aircraft Battery]] (12 x [[Bofors 40 mm gun]]s) and the motorised infantry of [[Tower Hamlets Rifles|9th Battalion Rifle Brigade (Tower Hamlets Rifles)]]. The German attack was a notable success, 22nd Armd Bde being driven back across the Wadi Faregh with the loss of 37 tanks (many to mechanical breakdown) against only seven German tanks knocked out. The brigade with its supporting troops was attacked again on 30 December and was again mauled, losing another 23 tanks. Having won a respite the Germans withdrew to El Agheilia, while 22nd Armd Bde, having lost nearly all its Crusaders, was also withdrawn to refit.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Farndale, p. 229.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 88\u201392, 136.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Gazala===\n[[File:Grant_tanks_of_5th_Royal_Tank_Regiment_on_the_move_in_the_Western_Desert,_17_February_1942._E8467.jpg|thumb|right|Grant tanks of 5th RTR on the move in the Western Desert, 17 February 1942.]]\nOn 4 March 1942 22nd Armd Bde was reorganised as an independent Brigade Group, with supporting artillery, engineer, transport and medical units. It returned to the front on 17 April 1942 under [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], coming under the command of 1st Armd Division on 23 April.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>PLayfair, Vol III, p. 217.</ref> The [[Battle of Gazala]] began on 26 May when Rommel tried to outflank the Gazala Line of defensive 'boxes'. XXX Corps moved south to give battle the following day. Before 22nd Armd Bde had got far it was attacked by both of the Afrika Korps' Panzer divisions, and it was ordered to fall back to the 'Knightsbridge' box, with the loss of 30 tanks and several guns. From Knightsbridge the brigade was able to attack the Germans' right flank, dealing some sharp blows. 22nd Armoured Bde spent the next day watching the immobile 15th Panzer Division (which was out of fuel). On 29 May the Axis armour began to close in around Knightsbridge, and 22nd Armd Bde sent two regiments to help [[2nd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Armd Bde]] in a fierce armour and artillery action fought in a sandstorm. By evening both sides were battered and exhausted. On 30 May 22nd Armd Bde made unsuccessful attacks on the enemy anti-tank (A/T) screen. By now the battle had become a succession of confused armoured actions in the 'Cauldron' amidst the defensive boxes occupied by the infantry. Eight Army made a new attack on the Cauldon on 4/5 June: 22nd Armd Bde had simultaneously to attack enemy armour and assist [[9th Indian Infantry Brigade|9th Indian Infantry Bde]]. The attack began in moonlight at 02.50 and at first went well, 9th Indian Bde and 107th Rgt RHA of 22nd Armd Bde taking its opening positions, but the Axis positions were further back than realised, and the brigade's armour (156 Crusader, Stuart and [[Grant tank|Grant]] tanks) ran into the concentrated fire of the enemy's artillery and a panzer counter-attack. The tanks could give no aid to 9th Indian Bde, which was pushed off its objectives, and at the end of the day 22nd Armd Bde withdrew to [[Leaguer]] with the loss of some 60 tanks. The following day the infantry and artillery, including 107th Rgt RHA, were overrun in the Cauldron.<ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 223\u201334, Maps 25\u201327.</ref>\n\nReplacing tanks after the Cauldron battle was complicated by the different tank types used by different regiments in the armoured brigades. By 12 June 22nd Armd Bde had 27 Grants, 5 Stuarts and 34 Crusaders. Disruption was also caused by the frequent exchanges of brigades between different armoured division HQs \u2013 22nd Armd fought under the command alternately of 1st and 7th Armd Divisions. The final phase of the Battle of Gazala began on 12 June, and British tank losses were again heavy. The following day Eighth Army began to withdraw. In a rearguard action 22nd Armd Bde foiled Rommel's attempt to cut the coast road, but the retreat went back to position around [[Mersa Matruh]].<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 238\u201343, 249\u201350.</ref>\n\n===Mersa Matruh and First Alamein===\n1st Armoured Division, including 22nd Armd Bde, was positioned a few miles south west of Mersa Matruh when Rommel began probing the position on the evening of 26 June. 22nd Armoured Bde only had 3rd and 4th CLY in the line, though it was reinforced by the re-equipped [[2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)]] of 2nd Armd Bde on 28 June while the [[Battle of Mersa Matruh]] continued. Rommel got between the Eighth Army's formations and forced them to retreat again, and by 30 June they were back at the [[El Alamein]] position.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 288\u20139, 294\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe Axis advance was halted by the British armoured brigades and artillery on 1\u20132 July in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. By 3 July 22nd Armd Bde was down to 20 Grants, 29 Stuarts and 8 Crusaders, but with [[4th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Armd Bde]] it awaited the enemy attack south of the Ruweisat Ridge and stopped it after a sharp engagement lasting half an hour. Eighth Army was counter-attacking by 15 July, 22nd Armd Bde supporting the [[2nd New Zealand Division]]. In this attack the brigade consisted solely of 3rd CLY, but was joined during the afternoon by the newly-arrived [[Royal Scots Greys]] (RSG) in their first tank action, giving a total of 31 Grants, 21 Stuarts and 23 Crusaders. The fighting died down by the end of July.<ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 341\u20133, 348\u20139, 354.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Alam el Halfa=== \n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E15787.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant-Generals [[Bernard Montgomery]], the new commander of the Eighth Army, and [[Brian Horrocks]], the new GOC XIII Corps, discussing troop dispositions at 22nd Armoured Brigade HQ, 20 August 1942. The brigade commander, Brigadier [[Philip Roberts (British Army officer)|\"Pip\" Roberts]] is on the right (in beret).]]\nBy the time Rommel made a renewed attack on the British positions at [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|Alam el Halfa]] on 30 August, Eighth Army had been reinforced and was under fresh commanders, including [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] at Eighth Army, Lt-Gen [[Brian Horrocks]] at XIII Corps, and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Philip Roberts (British Army officer)|Philip 'Pip' Roberts]], who took command of 22nd Armd Bde on 27 July. The brigade group (operating under [[10th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|10th Armd Division]]) now had four armoured regiments (three of them composite): RSG, 1st/6th Royal Tank Regiment (RTR), 5th RTR/2nd RGH, and 3rd/4th CLY. Each had a light squadron of Stuarts or Crusaders and two heavy squadrons of Grants, totalling 40 Stuarts, 34 Crusaders and 92 Grants. The Grants with their [[75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6|75mm guns]] (known as 'Egypt's last hope') were dug around Point 102 in front of the Alam el Halfa ridge alongside the [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder|6-pounder]] A/T guns of the brigade's motor battalion, 1st [[Rifle Brigade]] (RB). Two squadrons of Crusaders were stationed {{convert|2|mi|km}} to the south, to lure the Afrika Korps onto this line. On the morning of 31 August 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions did not take this bait but headed eastwards past the brigade's position. 22nd Armoured Bde therefore showed some of its tanks, which caused 21st Panzer to swing round and head for 3rd/4th CLY in the centre. A fierce duel began, in which the RSGs, 1st and 104th RHA and [[44th (Home Counties) Division]]'s artillery all joined in. 15th Panzer circled round to threaten 5th RTR/2nd RGH, but darkness was falling and the panzers were running short of fuel after the heavy going. Once Montgomery was satisfied that the Afrika Korps was committed, he launched a limited attack southwards and on 2 September Rommel called off the attack and retreated back to his starting position with severe casualties. 22nd Armoured Bde had only lost five of its Grants destroyed.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Horrocks, pp. 115\u201321.</ref><ref>Montgomery, pp. 107\u201310.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 384\u201391.</ref>\n\n===Second Alamein===\n22nd Armoured Brigade Group now reverted to being a normal armoured brigade as a permanent part of 7th Armoured Division. Its tank strength on the eve of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]  was:<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Joslen, p. 569.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n* Brigade HQ \u2013 4 Crusaders\n* 1st RTR \u201324 Grants, 19 Stuarts\n* 5th RTR \u2013 24 Grants, 18 Crusaders\n* 4th CLY \u2013 9 Grants, 29 Crusaders\nThese included 8 of the new Crusader Mark III equipped with the 6-pdr gun. The Motor Battalion was 1st RB.\n\nMontgomery's plan for Eighth Army's night attack at Alamein ([[Operation Lightfoot]]) on 23/24 October required XIII Corps to penetrate the enemy's two belts of [[Land mine|minefields]] (codenamed 'January' and 'February') and then pass the armoured brigades through. For 22nd Armd Bde this involved an approach march of {{convert|13|mi|km}} and then an advance of {{convert|6000|yd|m}} through four gaps, with its flank covered by [[131st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|131st Infantry Bde]]. The [[Royal Engineers]]' mine-clearing parties moved forward when the artillery barrage began at 21.40 and had cleared the two southern gaps through 'January' by 02.30, but 1st RB's two advance guard companies had to subdue enemy post before the northern gaps could be completed. By 05.00 5th RTR and the two 1st RB companies were through 'January' by one gap or another, but the mine-clearing parties had suffered heavy casualties; they could only attempt two gaps through 'February', and these were frustrated by heavy fire and daylight. 22nd Armoured Brigade's casualties during the night were 200. The following morning the tanks had to sit in open formation under steady shellfire.<ref>Horrocks, p. 136.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 42\u20133.</ref>\n[[File:El_Alamein_1942_-_British_tanks.jpg|thumb|left|Crusader tanks advance through the minefield gaps on 24 October 1942.]]\nHorrocks decided that as 7th Armd Division could not punch a hole through 'February', 131st Bde would have to make a night attack on 24/25 October supported by 22nd Armd Bde. The infantry got through the minefield but were pinned down just beyond it. 22nd Armoured Bde then attempted to pass along the two cleared lanes in bright moonlight but came under heavy A/T fire; 31 tanks were disabled and the attempt was called off. Montgomery then decided to concentrate on the more important attack by XXX Corps and turn XIII Corps over to the defensive. The attacks had achieved their purpose, however, pinning down 21st Panzer Division so that it did not move north to face XXX Corps until 26/27 October.<ref>Horrocks, p. 136\u20137.</ref><ref>Montgomery, p.13.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 44\u20137.</ref>\n\nXIII Corps was then 'milked' to reinforce XXX Corps, so that by 1 November when the second phase of the battle ([[Operation Supercharge (1942)|Operation Supercharge]]) began, 22nd Armd Bde only had 54 Grants, 16 Crusader IIs and 10 Crusader IIIs. Once again, its role was to feint.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 65.</ref>\n\n===Pursuit to Tripoli===\nOnce the rest of Eighth Army had broken through, 7th Armd Division was launched in pursuit of the broken enemy, with 22nd Armd Bde in the lead. On 5 November it covered more than {{convert|50|mi|km}}, but ended the day still {{convert|20|mi|km}} short of its objective, having encountered a dummy minefield and halted until it could be investigated. Moving off at first light next morning the brigade encountered German reconnaissance troops and then 21st Panzer Division, whose tanks were too short of fuel to manouevre. In a series of actions lasting most of 6 November, in heavy rain, the brigade inflicted considerable casualties; in the evening the enemy fled towards Matruh. After waiting for its own fuel, 22nd Armd Bde reached the Libyan frontier near [[Bayda, Libya|El Beida]] on 10 November, ignoring fleeing German tanks as it closed on its objective of [[Fort Capuzzo]]. Next day the enemy were fleeing towards [[Bardia]] too fast to be caught.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 87, 90, 95.</ref>\n\nAfter the victory of Alamein, Eighth Army advanced more slowly towards [[Tripoli]], with 22nd Armd Bde in Army Reserve. Montgomery then decided to 'crash' through to Tripoli itself. On the night of 20/21 January 1943 Eighth Army made a thrust along the coast road towards the city with [[51st (Highland) Division]] and 22nd Armd Bde. The Highlanders were closing on the city on 22 January and 2nd Armd came up 'pell-mell' to take the lead. Tripoli fell without fighting next day.<ref>Montgomery, pp. 152\u20134.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 227, 235\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Tunisia===\nAfter Eighth Army had closed up to [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisia]] 7th Armd Division was in the line when [[Panzer Army Afrika]] attacked XXX Corps at [[Battle of Medenine|Medenine]] on 6 March. 22nd Armoured Bde was deployed in depth behind the division's infantry, but the Germans' clumsy armoured attack was mainly defeated by the British artillery and A/T guns.<ref>Montgomery, p. 159.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 324\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Wadi Akarit]] on 6 April Eighth Army's infantry had to breach a formidable anti-tank obstacle. 51st (Highland) and [[50th (Northumbrian) Division]]s were each supported by a squadron provided by 4th CLY, which was now equipped with 29 [[Sherman tank]]s along with its 21 Crusaders. The assembly of the infantry divisions in the dark was complicated, but 51st (H) achieved its first objective easily. 50th (N) Division had a harder task, but 4th CLY's squadron was ordered round by a gap made by 51st (H) and was able to cut in behind the enemy. For the second phase 51st (H) Division's supporting infantry tanks were gradually picked off, and 4th CLY's squadron had to pass through to help out, but 50th (N) Division's squadron was able to pass its Shermans through its gap by 09.30. XXX Corps then settled down to consolidate the gap that it had made, and the enemy withdrew during the night.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 366\u201375.</ref>\n\nThe final phase of the Tunisian campaign began on 6 May with [[Operations Vulcan and Strike|Operation Strike]] directed towards [[Tunis]]. After the infantry had broken into the Axis defence lines 7th Armoured Division was directed to dash ahead and break through the inner defences before the enemy had time to man them. 22nd Armoured Bde set off at 10.30 after [[4th Indian Division]] had secured a vital knoll, and headed for the high ground. However the advance got slowed up, and by 17.00 7th Armoured had settled into a position about {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the infantry. Next morning 22nd Armd Bde engaged a few scattered tanks and [[Flak 88|88mm guns]] and disposed of them by 14.00. At 15.15 7th Armoured was ordered to close in on Tunis. Armoured car patrols reached the city centre at 15.40, closely followed by 1st RTR with 1/7th Bn [[Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)|Queen's]] from 131st Bde. They quelled any scattered resistance, secured all important building and bridges, and restored order. All remaining Axis forces in Tunisia were rounded up and surrendered unconditionally on 13 May.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 446\u20138, 450, 452, 457\u20139.</ref>\n\n==Italy==\n7th Armoured Division was not involved in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] (Operation Husky), instead it re-equipped and trained at Homs, east of Tripoli, before taking part in the landings at [[Salerno]] on the Italian mainland ([[Operation Avalanche]]). Leading elements of 7th Armd Division landed from the first follow-up convoy on 15 September, six days after the initial assault. 5th RTR accompanied the lorried infantry of 131st Bde in the division's first wave. However, there was still heavy fighting around the beachhead and the brigade group was unable to begin the intended breakout. The bulk of the division had arrived by 28 September when the advance began. 131st Brigade with 5th RTR took the lead through the close country, making slow progress, then after [[Naples]] had fallen to Allied troops 22nd Armd Bde took the lead on 2 October. 1st RTR found a way through the 'mass of rubble and demolitions' at [[Somma Vesuviana]] and over the next two days fought a series of actions with 1st RB to flush the enemy out of a number of towns. Despite all the bridges being blown, 1st RTR forced a crossing of the [[Regi Lagni]] drainage canal and closed up to the [[Volturno|River Volturno]].<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 260, 337\u20138, 342\u20133.</ref><ref>Lindsay & Johnstone, pp. 1\u201311.</ref>\n\nThe Royal Engineers could not find a suitable tank ford over the Volturno, so the infantry of 131st Bde had to force a bridgehead while 22nd Armd Bde waited. As the engineers worked on a bridge, the water level fell, and a suitable ford appeared, so a squadron of 4th CLY shovelled away the river bank and struggled across to support the infantry. However, torrential rain and mud made armoured action impossible off the roads. The Volturno was successfully bridged elsewhere and the Allied advance continued. On 22 October 5th RTR found [[Sparanise]] unoccupied and 1st RB cleared enemy observation posts from the hills above.<ref>Lindsay & Johnstone, pp. 13\u20136.</ref><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 439\u201345.</ref>\n\nAt the end of October, 7th Armoured Division was shifted to the left flank, nearest the sea, which entailed a tedious journey through [[Capua]], where the bridge could only take one tank at a time. 1st Rifle Brigade took over the outpost line in front of the main enemy position on [[Monte Massico]]. If 7th Armoured could get along the coast road towards [[Mondragone]] it would outflank Monte Massico. Reconnaissance revealed a fordable crossing near the beach, so a squadron of 5th RTR advanced by this route on 1 November while the rest of the regiment supported 131st Bde's attack on Mondragone. A few tanks were lost to mines on the beach, but Mondragone was found to be clear and the Massico ridge was occupied at small cost, while the enemy withdrew across the [[Garigliano]] river. Next day the tanks, thogh heavily shelled and hampered by enemy demolitions, worked between the mountain and the sea and captured Cicola after a sharp fight.<ref>Lindsay & Johnstone, pp. 16\u201317.</ref><ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 445\u20137.</ref>\n \nThe brigade had fought its last battle in Italy: shortly afterwards 7th Armd Division was withdrawn to the UK to take part in [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of Normandy. It transferred its equipment to [[5th Canadian Division|5th Canadian Armoured Division]] and the personnel sailed from Naples to [[Glasgow]], docking on 7 January 1944.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Lindsay & Johnstone, pp. 4\u201320.</ref><ref>Molony, Vol V, p. 475.</ref>\n[[File:A_Cromwell_Mk_V_tank_of_4th_County_of_London_Yeomanry,_22nd_Armoured_Brigade,_7th_Armoured_Division,_leads_a_column_of_armour_and_soft-skin_vehicles_inland_from_Gold_Beach,_Normandy,_7_June_1944._B5251.jpg|thumb|left|A Cromwell tank of 4th CLY leads a column inland from Gold Beach, 7 June 1944.]]\n\n==North-West Europe==\n22nd Armoured Bde was re-equipped with [[Cromwell tank]]s and trained in the area round [[Brandon, Suffolk]], to take part in the Allied landings in Normandy.

Ambushed by [[Tiger I]] tanks of [[101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion]], the brigade group lost a large number of tanks of 4th CLY and vehicles of 1st RB in the first 15 minutes.

It was not until 13 January 1945 that the division participated in a major attack ([[Operation Blackcock]]) towards [[Roermond]]. The division then rested and prepared for the crossing of the [[Rhine]], [[Operation Plunder]]. The infantry began their assault crossing on the night of 23/24 March, followed by an airborne landing ([[Operation Varsity]]) next day. By 27 March the engineers had bridged the river and 7th Armd began to cross. At first progress was slow, but on 29 March 22nd Armd Bde fanned out leading  the advance; the division made {{convert|120|mi|km}} by 2 April, only halted by the [[Ems (river)|River Ems]]. 11th Armoured Division having captured a bridge intact, 22nd Armd Bde resumed its advance, now a pursuit.

The brigade was formed on the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 from [[Yeomanry]] mechanised cavalry regiments of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA). It saw a considerable amount of action during the war, beginning with the [[Western Desert Campaign]] where it was engaged in [[Operation Crusader]] and at the Battles of [[Battle of Gazala|Gazala]], [[Battle of Mersa Matruh|Mersa Matruh]], [[First Battle of El Alamein|First Alamein]] and [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|Alam el Halfa]]. It then joined the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] (the 'Desert Rats') for the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. It remained part of 7th Armoured for the rest of the war, including the campaigns in [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisia]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] and [[Western_Front_(World_War_II)#1944\u20131945:_The_Second_Front|North West Europe]]. It continued in the postwar TA until 1956. The brigade's identity was re-established in the [[British Army|Regular Army]] between 1981 and 1993.\n\n==Mobilisation==\n22nd Heavy Armoured Brigade (the 'Heavy' was dropped on 14 April 1940) was formed at the outbreak of [[World War II]] on 3 September 1939 with the mobilisation of three part-time [[Yeomanry]] regiments of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA): [[2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars]] (RGH), [[3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)]] and [[4th County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters)]] (CLY).<ref name = Joslen168>Joslen, pp. 168\u20139.</ref><ref name=Bellis1617>{{harvnb|Bellis|1994|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>{{efn|The 4th CLY was the 2nd Line duplicate of the 3rd CLY formed on 27 September 1939; 2nd RGH was the 2nd Line duplicate of the RGH formed on 24 August 1939.<ref>Frederick, pp. 30, 34.</ref>}} On 15 January 1940 it joined [[2nd Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Armoured Division]] in [[Northern Command (United Kingdom)|Northern Command]]. Because [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]] in France with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) had first call on scarce resources, the equipment of 2nd Armoured Division and its units proceeded slowly during the [[Phoney War]] period.\n\nWhen the [[Battle of France]] was lost and the BEF was being [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated from Dunkirk]] (without its equipment) at the end of May, the incomplete 2nd Armoured Division was the only armoured formation available to Home Forces. It was moved into the area between [[Northampton]] and [[Newmarket, Suffolk]], to be ready to counter-attack in the event of invasion.<ref name = Joslen16>Joslen, p. 16.</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-7.html Collier Chapter VII.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-8.html Collier, Chapter VIII.]</ref><ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Defence-UK/UK-DefenseOfUK-14.html Collier, Chapter 14.]</ref>\n\nAs the threat of invasion of the United Kingdom receded, it became possible to spare more troops and equipment to reinforce [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] facing the Italians. Most of 2nd Armoured Division was sent out on 26 October 1940, but 22nd Armoured Brigade remained in the UK, having been transferred to 1st Armoured Division.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref name = Joslen16/><ref>Playfair, Vol I, pp. 190, 244\u20137.</ref> It adopted the new organisation for an armoured brigade, which included a battalion of motorised infantry (2nd [[Kings Royal Rifle Corps]]).<ref name = Joslen168/> 10th Company [[Royal Army Service Corps]] provided the brigade's transport.<ref>Sutton, p. 136.</ref>\n\n==North Africa==\nBy the summer of 1941 the Italians in [[Italian Libya|Libya]] had been reinforced by General [[Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]] and the tide had turned against the British forces (most of 2nd Armoured Division was captured on 8 April<ref name = Joslen16/>). The Defence Committee of the British [[War_cabinet#Churchill_war_ministry|War Cabinet]] decided to send out 22nd Armoured Brigade as soon as possible. It was recognised that the brigade had been trained in an anti-invasion role and would require a certain amount of preparation on arrival \u2013 in desert navigation, for instance. Its new [[Crusader tank]]s would also require require modification for desert conditions. But the Defence Committee hoped that the brigade would reach [[Egypt#British_protectorate_.281882.E2.80.931952.29|Egypt]] by mid-September and be ready for action by 1 November. In fact, the convoy carrying 22nd Armoured Brigade sailed (without its motor battalion) on 15 August, and after rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]] it finally arrived in Egypt on 2 October. The start of [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]'s counter-offensive ([[Operation Crusader]]) had to be put off until mid-November.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Farndale, pp. 199, 202\u20133.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol II, p. 256.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 4\u20135, 12, 30, 136.</ref>\n\n===Operation Crusader===\n[[File:IWM-E-6724-Crusader-19411126.jpg|thumb|right|Mark I Crusader tanks in the Western Deseret, November 1941.]]\nThe brigade joined [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] for Operation Crusader. Reinforced by C Battery, 4th [[Royal Horse Artillery]] and a Troop of D Battery, [[102nd (Northumberland Hussars) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery]], the brigade's role was to find and destroy the enemy armour. Eighth Army's advance began at dawn on 18 November and had approximately reached its first day's objectives by evening, but mechanical breakdowns had already reduced 22nd Armd Bde's tank strength from 155 to 136 runners. Next day it was reconnoitring forward towards Bir el Gub when the divisional commander arrived and ordered it to attack the Italian [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|Ariete Division]]. The inexperienced Yeomanry attacked impetuously, and after driving in the Italian covering troops came under heavy fire from the prepared positions behind. When it broke off the attack the brigade had lost 25 tanks, but had destroyed 34 Italian medium tanks, damaged 12 others and knocked out 12 guns. On 20 November the Afrika Korps counter-attacked and 22nd Armoured Bde was recalled from Bir el Gub to take part in the imminent armoured battle. It arrived too late to influence the indecisive battle. The garrison of [[Siege of Tobruk|Tobruk]] began its breakout next day, and the Afrika Korps hurried north to prevent this, pursued by Eighth Army's armour, including 22nd Armoured Bde. However the pursuers were held up by rearguards, boggy ground, and the need to refuel. Over the next few days there was confused fighting round Sidi Rezegh airfield that reduced 22nd Armd Bde's fighting strength from 79 to 34 tanks by the end of 22 November. Next day it did its best to hold off a renewed [[Axis powers|Axis]] attack, but lost another third of its tanks. The fighting round Sidi Rezegh ended when Rommel sent the Afrika Korps on a 'Dash to the Wire', driving eastwards behind Eighth Army towards the Egyptian frontier. The crippled British armoured formations could do little about it, though Tobruk was relieved.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Farndale, p. 207, 210\u201311, 214-8, 221.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 37\u201354, 62\u20133.</ref>\n\nBy the time the brigade rejoined the fighting on 22 December it had received fresh tanks: 3rd and 4th CLY had 80 Crusaders between them, while 2nd RGH had 30 [[M3 Stuart]] light tanks. It was now under the direct command of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] (the rest of 1st Armoured Division had now arrived in Egypt but was still training for desert warfare). 22 to 25 December was spent regaining contact with the enemy's new positions. Then on 27 December Gen [[Ludwig Cr\u00fcwell]] commanding the armour of the Afrika Korps noticed a gap between 22nd Armd Bde at Chor es Sufan and [[22nd Guards Brigade]] north of [[Agedabia]]. Rommel approved Cr\u00fcwell's proposal to defeat the British armour in detail, and he attacked the following day with [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th]] and [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Divisions]] comprising 60 tanks (of which 44 were [[Panzer III]]s and [[Panzer IV|IV]]s), against 22nd Armd Bde's 90 available tanks (35 Stuarts, the rest Crusaders). 22nd Armoured Brigade also had under its command [[2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery]] (RHA) (two 8-gun 25-pounder batteries), 102nd (NH) Anti-Tank Regiment (three 12-gun batteries of 2-pounders), [[13th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|122 Light Anti-Aircraft Battery]] (12 x [[Bofors 40 mm gun]]s) and the motorised infantry of [[Tower Hamlets Rifles|9th Battalion Rifle Brigade (Tower Hamlets Rifles)]]. The German attack was a notable success, 22nd Armd Bde being driven back across the Wadi Faregh with the loss of 37 tanks (many to mechanical breakdown) against only seven German tanks knocked out. The brigade with its supporting troops was attacked again on 30 December and was again mauled, losing another 23 tanks. Having won a respite the Germans withdrew to El Agheilia, while 22nd Armd Bde, having lost nearly all its Crusaders, was also withdrawn to refit.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Farndale, p. 229.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 88\u201392, 136.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Gazala===\n[[File:Grant_tanks_of_5th_Royal_Tank_Regiment_on_the_move_in_the_Western_Desert,_17_February_1942._E8467.jpg|thumb|right|Grant tanks of 5th RTR on the move in the Western Desert, 17 February 1942.]]\nOn 4 March 1942 22nd Armd Bde was reorganised as an independent Brigade Group, with supporting artillery, engineer, transport and medical units. It returned to the front on 17 April 1942 under [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]], coming under the command of 1st Armd Division on 23 April.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>PLayfair, Vol III, p. 217.</ref> The [[Battle of Gazala]] began on 26 May when Rommel tried to outflank the Gazala Line of defensive 'boxes'. XXX Corps moved south to give battle the following day. Before 22nd Armd Bde had got far it was attacked by both of the Afrika Korps' Panzer divisions, and it was ordered to fall back to the 'Knightsbridge' box, with the loss of 30 tanks and several guns. From Knightsbridge the brigade was able to attack the Germans' right flank, dealing some sharp blows. 22nd Armoured Bde spent the next day watching the immobile 15th Panzer Division (which was out of fuel). On 29 May the Axis armour began to close in around Knightsbridge, and 22nd Armd Bde sent two regiments to help [[2nd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Armd Bde]] in a fierce armour and artillery action fought in a sandstorm. By evening both sides were battered and exhausted. On 30 May 22nd Armd Bde made unsuccessful attacks on the enemy anti-tank (A/T) screen. By now the battle had become a succession of confused armoured actions in the 'Cauldron' amidst the defensive boxes occupied by the infantry. Eight Army made a new attack on the Cauldon on 4/5 June: 22nd Armd Bde had simultaneously to attack enemy armour and assist [[9th Indian Infantry Brigade|9th Indian Infantry Bde]]. The attack began in moonlight at 02.50 and at first went well, 9th Indian Bde and 107th Rgt RHA of 22nd Armd Bde taking its opening positions, but the Axis positions were further back than realised, and the brigade's armour (156 Crusader, Stuart and [[Grant tank|Grant]] tanks) ran into the concentrated fire of the enemy's artillery and a panzer counter-attack. The tanks could give no aid to 9th Indian Bde, which was pushed off its objectives, and at the end of the day 22nd Armd Bde withdrew to [[Leaguer]] with the loss of some 60 tanks. The following day the infantry and artillery, including 107th Rgt RHA, were overrun in the Cauldron.<ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 223\u201334, Maps 25\u201327.</ref>\n\nReplacing tanks after the Cauldron battle was complicated by the different tank types used by different regiments in the armoured brigades. By 12 June 22nd Armd Bde had 27 Grants, 5 Stuarts and 34 Crusaders. Disruption was also caused by the frequent exchanges of brigades between different armoured division HQs \u2013 22nd Armd fought under the command alternately of 1st and 7th Armd Divisions. The final phase of the Battle of Gazala began on 12 June, and British tank losses were again heavy. The following day Eighth Army began to withdraw. In a rearguard action 22nd Armd Bde foiled Rommel's attempt to cut the coast road, but the retreat went back to position around [[Mersa Matruh]].<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 238\u201343, 249\u201350.</ref>\n\n===Mersa Matruh and First Alamein===\n1st Armoured Division, including 22nd Armd Bde, was positioned a few miles south west of Mersa Matruh when Rommel began probing the position on the evening of 26 June. 22nd Armoured Bde only had 3rd and 4th CLY in the line, though it was reinforced by the re-equipped [[2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays)]] of 2nd Armd Bde on 28 June while the [[Battle of Mersa Matruh]] continued. Rommel got between the Eighth Army's formations and forced them to retreat again, and by 30 June they were back at the [[El Alamein]] position.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 288\u20139, 294\u20135.</ref>\n\nThe Axis advance was halted by the British armoured brigades and artillery on 1\u20132 July in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. By 3 July 22nd Armd Bde was down to 20 Grants, 29 Stuarts and 8 Crusaders, but with [[4th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Armd Bde]] it awaited the enemy attack south of the Ruweisat Ridge and stopped it after a sharp engagement lasting half an hour. Eighth Army was counter-attacking by 15 July, 22nd Armd Bde supporting the [[2nd New Zealand Division]]. In this attack the brigade consisted solely of 3rd CLY, but was joined during the afternoon by the newly-arrived [[Royal Scots Greys]] (RSG) in their first tank action, giving a total of 31 Grants, 21 Stuarts and 23 Crusaders. The fighting died down by the end of July.<ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 341\u20133, 348\u20139, 354.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Alam el Halfa=== \n[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E15787.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant-Generals [[Bernard Montgomery]], the new commander of the Eighth Army, and [[Brian Horrocks]], the new GOC XIII Corps, discussing troop dispositions at 22nd Armoured Brigade HQ, 20 August 1942. The brigade commander, Brigadier [[Philip Roberts (British Army officer)|\"Pip\" Roberts]] is on the right (in beret).]]\nBy the time Rommel made a renewed attack on the British positions at [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|Alam el Halfa]] on 30 August, Eighth Army had been reinforced and was under fresh commanders, including [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] at Eighth Army, Lt-Gen [[Brian Horrocks]] at XIII Corps, and [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[Philip Roberts (British Army officer)|Philip 'Pip' Roberts]], who took command of 22nd Armd Bde on 27 July. The brigade group (operating under [[10th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|10th Armd Division]]) now had four armoured regiments (three of them composite): RSG, 1st/6th Royal Tank Regiment (RTR), 5th RTR/2nd RGH, and 3rd/4th CLY. Each had a light squadron of Stuarts or Crusaders and two heavy squadrons of Grants, totalling 40 Stuarts, 34 Crusaders and 92 Grants. The Grants with their [[75 mm Gun M2/M3/M6|75mm guns]] (known as 'Egypt's last hope') were dug around Point 102 in front of the Alam el Halfa ridge alongside the [[Ordnance QF 6-pounder|6-pounder]] A/T guns of the brigade's motor battalion, 1st [[Rifle Brigade]] (RB). Two squadrons of Crusaders were stationed {{convert|2|mi|km}} to the south, to lure the Afrika Korps onto this line. On the morning of 31 August 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions did not take this bait but headed eastwards past the brigade's position. 22nd Armoured Bde therefore showed some of its tanks, which caused 21st Panzer to swing round and head for 3rd/4th CLY in the centre. A fierce duel began, in which the RSGs, 1st and 104th RHA and [[44th  (Home Counties) Division]]'s artillery all joined in. 15th Panzer circled round to threaten 5th RTR/2nd RGH, but darkness was falling and the panzers were running short of fuel after the heavy going. Once Montgomery was satisfied that the Afrika Korps was committed, he launched a limited attack southwards and on 2 September Rommel called off the attack and retreated back to his starting position with severe casualties. 22nd Armoured Bde had only lost five of its Grants destroyed.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Horrocks, pp. 115\u201321.</ref><ref>Montgomery, pp. 107\u201310.</ref><ref>Playfair, Vol III, pp. 384\u201391.</ref>\n\n===Second Alamein===\n22nd Armoured Brigade Group now reverted to being a normal armoured brigade as a permanent part of 7th Armoured Division. Its tank strength on the eve of the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]  was:<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Joslen, p. 569.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n* Brigade HQ \u2013 4 Crusaders\n* 1st RTR \u201324 Grants, 19 Stuarts\n* 5th RTR \u2013 24 Grants, 18 Crusaders\n* 4th CLY \u2013 9 Grants, 29 Crusaders<br />\nThese included 8 of the new Crusader Mark III equipped with the 6-pdr gun. The Motor Battalion was 1st RB. \n\nMontgomery's plan for Eighth Army's night attack at Alamein ([[Operation  Lightfoot]]) on 23/24 October required XIII Corps to penetrate the enemy's two belts of [[Land mine|minefields]] (codenamed 'January' and 'February') and then pass the armoured brigades through. For 22nd Armd Bde this involved an approach march of {{convert|13|mi|km}} and then an advance of {{convert|6000|yd|m}} through four gaps, with its flank covered by [[131st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|131st Infantry Bde]]. The [[Royal Engineers]]' mine-clearing parties moved forward when the artillery barrage began at 21.40 and had cleared the two southern gaps through 'January' by 02.30, but 1st RB's two advance guard companies had to subdue enemy post before the northern gaps could be completed. By 05.00 5th RTR and the two 1st RB companies were through 'January' by one gap or another, but the mine-clearing parties had suffered heavy casualties; they could only attempt two gaps through 'February', and these were frustrated by heavy fire and daylight. 22nd Armoured Brigade's casualties during the night were 200. The following morning the tanks had to sit in open formation under steady shellfire.<ref>Horrocks, p. 136.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 42\u20133.</ref>\n[[File:El_Alamein_1942_-_British_tanks.jpg|thumb|left|Crusader tanks advance through the minefield gaps on 24 October 1942.]]\nHorrocks decided that as 7th Armd Division could not punch a hole through 'February', 131st Bde would have to make a night attack on 24/25 October supported by 22nd Armd Bde. The infantry got through the minefield but were pinned down just beyond it. 22nd Armoured Bde then attempted to pass along the two cleared lanes in bright moonlight but came under heavy A/T fire; 31 tanks were disabled and the attempt was called off. Montgomery then decided to concentrate on the more important attack by XXX Corps and turn XIII Corps over to the defensive. The attacks had achieved their purpose, however, pinning down 21st Panzer Division so that it did not move north to face XXX Corps until 26/27 October.<ref>Horrocks, p. 136\u20137.</ref><ref>Montgomery, p.13.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 44\u20137.</ref>\n\nXIII Corps was then 'milked' to reinforce XXX Corps, so that by 1 November when the second phase of the battle ([[Operation Supercharge (1942)|Operation Supercharge]]) began, 22nd Armd Bde only had 54 Grants, 16 Crusader IIs and 10 Crusader IIIs. Once again, its role was to feint.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 65.</ref>\n===Pursuit to Tripoli===\nOnce the rest of Eighth Army had broken through, 7th Armd Division was launched in pursuit of the broken enemy, with 22nd Armd Bde in the lead. On 5 November it covered more than {{convert|50|mi|km}}, but ended the day still {{convert|20|mi|km}} short of its objective, having encountered a dummy minefield and halted until it could be investigated. Moving off at first light next morning the brigade encountered German reconnaissance troops and then 21st Panzer Division, whose tanks were too short of fuel to manouevre. In a series of actions lasting most of 6 November, in heavy rain, the brigade inflicted considerable casualties; in the evening the enemy fled towards Matruh. After waiting for its own fuel, 22nd Armd Bde reached the Libyan frontier near [[Bayda, Libya|El Beida]] on 10 November, ignoring fleeing German tanks as it closed on its objective of [[Fort Capuzzo]]. Next day the enemy were fleeing towards [[Bardia]] too fast to be caught.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 87, 90, 95.</ref>\n\nAfter the victory of Alamein, Eighth Army advanced more slowly towards [[Tripoli]], with 22nd Armd Bde in Army Reserve. Montgomery then decided to 'crash' through to Tripoli itself. On the night of 20/21 January 1943 Eighth Army made a thrust along the coast road towards the city with [[51st (Highland) Division]] and 22nd Armd Bde. The Highlanders were closing on the city on 22 January and 2nd Armd came up 'pell-mell' to take the lead. Tripoli fell without fighting next day.<ref>Montgomery, pp. 152\u20134.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 227, 235\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Tunisia===\nAfter Eighth Army had closed up to [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisia]] 7th Armd Division was in the line when [[Panzer Army Afrika]] attacked XXX Corps at [[Battle of Medenine|Medenine]] on 6 March. 22nd Armoured Bde was deployed in depth behind the division's infantry, but the Germans' clumsy armoured attack was mainly defeated by the British artillery and A/T guns.<ref>Montgomery, p. 159.</ref><ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 324\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Wadi Akarit]] on 6 April Eighth Army's infantry had to breach a formidable anti-tank obstacle. 51st (Highland) and [[50th (Northumbrian) Division]]s were each supported by a squadron provided by 4th CLY, which was now equipped with 29 [[Sherman tank]]s along with its 21 Crusaders. The assembly of the infantry divisions in the dark was complicated, but 51st (H) achieved its first objective easily. 50th (N) Division had a harder task, but 4th CLY's squadron was ordered round by a gap made by 51st (H) and was able to cut in behind the enemy. For the second phase 51st (H) Division's supporting infantry tanks were gradually picked off, and 4th CLY's squadron had to pass through to help out, but 50th (N) Division's squadron was able to pass its Shermans through its gap by 09.30. XXX Corps then settled down to consolidate the gap that it had made, and the enemy withdrew during the night.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 366\u201375.</ref> \n\nThe final phase of the Tunisian campaign began on 6 May with [[Operations Vulcan and Strike|Operation Strike]] directed towards [[Tunis]]. After the infantry had broken into the Axis defence lines 7th Armoured Division was directed to dash ahead and break through the inner defences before the enemy had time to man them. 22nd Armoured Bde set off at 10.30 after [[4th Indian Division]] had secured a vital knoll, and headed for the high ground. However the advance got slowed up, and by 17.00 7th Armoured had settled into a position about {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the infantry. Next morning 22nd Armd Bde engaged a few scattered tanks and [[Flak 88|88mm guns]] and disposed of them by 14.00. At 15.15 7th Armoured was ordered to close in on Tunis. Armoured car patrols reached the city centre at 15.40, closely followed by 1st RTR with 1/7th Bn [[Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey)|Queen's]] from 131st Bde. They quelled any scattered resistance, secured all important building and bridges, and restored order. All remaining Axis forces in Tunisia were rounded up and surrendered unconditionally on 13 May.<ref>Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 446\u20138, 450, 452, 457\u20139.</ref>\n\n==Italy==\n7th Armoured Division was not involved in the [[Allied invasion of  Sicily]] (Operation Husky), instead it re-equipped and trained at Homs, east of Tripoli, before taking part in the landings at [[Salerno]] on the Italian mainland ([[Operation Avalanche]]). Leading elements of 7th Armd Division landed from the first follow-up convoy on 15 September, six days after the initial assault. 5th RTR accompanied the lorried infantry of 131st Bde in the division's first wave. However, there was still heavy fighting around the beachhead and the brigade group was unable to begin the intended breakout. The bulk of the division had arrived by 28 September when the advance began. 131st Brigade with 5th RTR took the lead through the close country, making slow progress, then after [[Naples]] had fallen to Allied troops 22nd Armd Bde took the lead on 2 October. 1st RTR found a way through the 'mass of rubble and demolitions' at [[Somma Vesuviana]] and over the next two days fought a series of actions with 1st RB to flush the enemy out of a number of towns. Despite all the bridges being blown, 1st RTR forced a crossing of the [[Regi Lagni]] drainage canal and closed up to the [[Volturno|River Volturno]].<ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 260, 337\u20138, 342\u20133.</ref><ref>Lindsay & Johnstone, pp. 1\u201311.</ref>\n\nThe Royal Engineers could not find a suitable tank ford over the Volturno, so the infantry of 131st Bde had to force a bridgehead while 22nd Armd Bde waited. As the engineers worked on a bridge, the water level fell, and a suitable ford appeared, so a squadron of 4th CLY shovelled away the river bank and struggled across to support the infantry. However, torrential rain and mud made armoured action impossible off the roads. The Volturno was successfully bridged elsewhere and the Allied advance continued. On 22 October 5th RTR found [[Sparanise]] unoccupied and 1st RB cleared enemy observation posts from the hills above.<ref>Lindsay & Johnstone, pp. 13\u20136.</ref> <ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 439\u201345.</ref>\n\nAt the end of October 7th Armd Division was shifted to the left flank, nearest the sea, which entailed a tedious journey through [[Capua]], where the bridge could only take one tank at a time. 1st Rifle Brigade took over the outpost line in front of the main enemy position on [[Monte Massico]]. If 7th Armoured could get along the coast road towards [[Mondragone]] it would outflank Monte Massico. Reconnaissance revealed a fordable crossing near the beach, so a squadron of 5th RTR advanced by this route on 1 November while the rest of the regiment supported 131st Bde's attack on Mondragone. A few tanks were lost to mines on the beach, but Mondragone was found to be clear and the Massico ridge was occupied at small cost, while the enemy withdrew across the [[Garigliano]] river. Next day the tanks, thogh heavily shelled and hampered by enemy demolitions, worked between the mountain and the sea and captured Cicola after a sharp fight.<ref>Lindsay & Johnstone, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> <ref>Molony, Vol V, pp. 445\u20137.</ref>\n \nThe brigade had fought its last battle in Italy: shortly afterwards 7th Armd Division was withdrawn to the UK to take part in [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of Normandy. It transferred its equipment to [[5th Canadian Division|5th Canadian Armoured Division]] and the personnel sailed from Naples to [[Glasgow]], docking on 7 January 1944.<ref name = Joslen168/><ref>Lindsay & Johnstone, pp. 4\u201320.</ref><ref>Molony, Vol V, p. 475.</ref>\n[[File:A_Cromwell_Mk_V_tank_of_4th_County_of_London_Yeomanry,_22nd_Armoured_Brigade,_7th_Armoured_Division,_leads_a_column_of_armour_and_soft-skin_vehicles_inland_from_Gold_Beach,_Normandy,_7_June_1944._B5251.jpg|thumb|left|A Cromwell tank of 4th CLY leads a column inland from Gold Beach, 7 June 1944.]]\n\n==North-West Europe==\n22nd Armoured Bde was re-equipped with [[Cromwell tank]]s and trained in the area round [[Brandon, Suffolk]], to take part in the Allied landings in Normandy.

It was not until 13 January 1945 that the division participated in a major attack ([[Operation Blackcock]]) towards [[Roermond]]. The division then rested and prepared for the crossing of the [[Rhine]], [[Operation Plunder]]. The infantry began their assault crossing on the night of 23/24 March, followed by an airborne landing ([[Operation Varsity]]) next day. By 27 March the engineers had bridged the river and 7th Armd began to cross. At first progress was slow, but on 29 March 22nd Armd Bde fanned out leading  the advance; the division made {{convert|120|mi|km}} by 2 April, only halted by the [[Ems (river)|River Ems]]. 11th Armoured Division having captured a bridge intact, 22nd Armd Bde resumed its advance, now a pursuit.
