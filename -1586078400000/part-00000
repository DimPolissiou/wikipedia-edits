{"title_page": "List of foreign TT Pro League players", "text_new": "{{use Trinidadian English|date=August 2019}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{short description|wikimedia list article}}\n\nThis is a '''list of foreign players''' in the '''TT Pro League''' that began league play in 1999. The following players must meet both of the following two criteria:\n# Have played at least one [[TT Pro League]] game. Players who were signed by Pro League clubs, but only played in lower league, cup and/or international matches, or did not play in any competitive games at all, are not included.\n# Are considered foreign, i.e., outside [[Trinidad and Tobago]], if he is not eligible to play for the Trinidad and Tobago [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|national team]].\n\nMore specifically,\n* If a player has been capped on international level, the national team is used; if he has been capped by more than one country, the highest level (or the most recent) team is used. These include Trinidad and Tobago players with dual citizenship.\n* If a player has not been capped on international level, his country of birth is used, except those who were born abroad from Trinidad and Tobago parents or moved to Trinidad and Tobago at a young age, and those who clearly indicated to have switched his nationality to another nation.\n\nClubs listed are those for which the player has played at least one Pro League game and seasons for those in which the player has played at least one Pro League game. Note that seasons, not calendar years, are used. For example, \"2010\u201313\" indicates that the player has played in every season from 2010\u201311 to 2012\u201313, but not necessarily every calendar year from 2010 to 2013. Therefore, a player beginning with the 2010\u201311 season should always have a listing under at least two years \u2014 for instance, a player making his debut in 2011, during the 2011\u201312 season, will have \"2011\u201312\" after his name.\n\n'''In bold:''' Players who have played at least one Pro League game in the current season ([[2013\u201314 TT Pro League|2013\u201314]]), and the clubs they've played for. They include players who have subsequently left the club, but do not include current players of a Pro League club who have not played a Pro League game in the current season.\n\n:''Details correct as of end of 2013\u201314 season. Next update will remove all players from withdrawn teams and that have left their clubs from '''Bold''' status, and add newly admitted teams' players. This will be undertaken on the first day of the 2014\u201315 season in September 2014.''\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT UPDATE UNTIL PLAYER MAKES A LEAGUE APPEARANCE DURING THE CURRENT SEASON as this causes problems in updating at the end of each season when updated in full. Place the player's name in bold and current team also in bold. Update the years within the league as well. Thank you.\n\nPLAYERS THAT HAVE SIGNED PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTS, BUT HAVE NOT MADE A LEAGUE APPEARANCE (1 August 2013)\n* '''[[Troy Dublin]]''' \u2013 '''[[Central F.C.|Central FC]]''' \u2013 2013\u2013

English|date=August 2019}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{short description|wikimedia list article}}\n\nThis is a '''list of foreign players''' in the '''TT Pro League''' that began league play in 1999. The following players must meet both of the following two criteria:\n# Have played at least one [[TT Pro League]] game. Players who were signed by Pro League clubs, but only played in lower league, cup and/or international matches, or did not play in any competitive games at all, are not included.\n# Are considered foreign, i.e., outside [[Trinidad and Tobago]], if he is not eligible to play for the Trinidad and Tobago [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|national team]].\n\nMore specifically,\n* If a player has been capped on international level, the national team is used; if he has been capped by more than one country, the highest level (or the most recent) team is used. These include Trinidad and Tobago players with dual citizenship.\n* If a player has not been capped on international level, his country of birth is used, except those who were born abroad from Trinidad and Tobago parents or moved to Trinidad and Tobago at a young age, and those who clearly indicated to have switched his nationality to another nation.\n\nClubs listed are those for which the player has played at least one Pro League game and seasons for those in which the player has played at least one Pro League game. Note that seasons, not calendar years, are used. For example, \"2010\u201313\" indicates that the player has played in every season from 2010\u201311 to 2012\u201313, but not necessarily every calendar year from 2010 to 2013. Therefore, a player beginning with the 2010\u201311 season should always have a listing under at least two years \u2014 for instance, a player making his debut in 2011, during the 2011\u201312 season, will have \"2011\u201312\" after his name.\n\n'''In bold:''' Players who have played at least one Pro League game in the current season ([[2013\u201314 TT Pro League|2013\u201314]]), and the clubs they've played for. They include players who have subsequently left the club, but do not include current players of a Pro League club who have not played a Pro League game in the current season.\n\n:''Details correct as of end of 2013\u201314 season. Next update will remove all players from withdrawn teams and that have left their clubs from '''Bold''' status, and add newly admitted teams' players. This will be undertaken on the first day of the 2014\u201315 season in September 2014.''\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT UPDATE UNTIL PLAYER MAKES A LEAGUE APPEARANCE DURING THE CURRENT SEASON as this causes problems in updating at the end of each season when updated in full. Place the player's name in bold and current team also in bold. Update the years within the league as well. Thank you.\n\nPLAYERS THAT HAVE SIGNED PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTS, BUT HAVE NOT MADE A LEAGUE APPEARANCE (1 August 2013)\n* '''[[Troy Dublin]]''' \u2013 '''[[Central F.C.|Central FC]]''' \u2013 2013\u2013

They believed [[Hanja]] was the only legitimate writing system. They also saw the circulation of the Korean alphabet as a threat to their status.<ref name=\"NAKL Back2\" /> However, the Korean alphabet entered [[popular culture]] as King Sejong had intended, used especially by women and writers of popular fiction.<ref name=\"Pratt\">Pratt, Rutt, Hoare, 1999.

However, the Korean alphabet was still taught in Korean-established schools built after the annexation and Korean was written in a mixed Hanja-Hangul script, where most lexical roots were written in Hanja and grammatical forms in the Korean alphabet. Japan banned earlier Korean literature from public schooling, which became [[Compulsory education|mandatory]] for children.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe [[Hangul orthography|orthography of the Korean alphabet]] was partially standardized in 1912, when the vowel ''arae'a'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d}})\u2013which has now disappeared from Korean\u2013was restricted to [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] roots: the [[emphatic consonant]]s were standardized to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u317a, \u317c, \u317d, \u3146, \u317e}} and final consonants restricted to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131, \u3134, \u3139, \u3141, \u3142, \u3145, \u3147, \u313a, \u313b, \u313c}}. [[Long vowels]] were marked by a diacritic dot to the left of the syllable, but this was dropped in 1921.<ref name=\"Pratt\" />\n\nA second colonial reform occurred in 1930. The ''arae-a'' was abolished: the emphatic consonants were changed to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3132, \u3138, \u3143, \u3146, \u3149}} and more final consonants {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137, \u3148, \u314c, \u314a, \u314d, \u3132, \u3133, \u3135, \u313e, \u313f, \u3144}} were allowed, making the orthography more [[morphophonemic]]. The double-consonant {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3146}} was written alone (without a vowel) when it occurred between nouns, and the nominative particle {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|-\uac00}} was introduced after vowels, replacing {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|-\uc774}}.<ref name=\"Pratt\" />\n\n[[Ju Si-gyeong]], the linguist who had coined the term Hangul to replace ''Eonmun'' or \"Vulgar Script\" in 1912, established the Korean Language Research Society (later renamed the [[Hangul Society]]), which further reformed orthography with ''Standardized System of Hangul'' in 1933. The principal change was to make the Korean alphabet as morphophonemically practical as possible given the existing letters.<ref name=\"Pratt\" /> A system for [[Transcription into Korean|transliterating foreign orthographies]] was published in 1940.\n\nJapan banned the Korean language from schools in 1938 as part of a policy of [[cultural assimilation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enc.daum.net/dic100/viewContents.do?&m=all&articleID=b24h2804b |publisher=[[Daum (web portal)|Daum]] / [[Britannica]] |title=Hangul <span lang=\"ko\">\ud55c\uae00</span> |work=The modern and contemporary history of hangul (<span lang=\"ko\">\ud55c\uae00\uc758 \uadfc\u00b7\ud604\ub300\uc0ac</span>)|quote=<span lang=\"ko\">1937\ub144 7\uc6d4 \uc911\uc77c\uc804\uc7c1\uc744 \ub3c4\ubc1c\ud55c \uc77c\ubcf8\uc740 \ud55c\ubbfc\uc871 \ub9d0\uc0b4\uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ub178\uace8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0b4, 1938\ub144 4\uc6d4\uc5d0\ub294 \uc870\uc120\uc5b4\uacfc \ud3d0\uc9c0\uc640 \uc870\uc120\uc5b4 \uae08\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubcf8\uc5b4 \uc0c1\uc6a9\uc744 \uac15\uc694\ud588\ub2e4.</span>|language=Korean|accessdate=2008-05-19 }}</ref> and all Korean-language publications were outlawed in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/krtoc.html|title=Under the Media|date=2011-03-22|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=2012-04-13}}</ref>\n\n=== Further reforms ===\nThe definitive modern Korean alphabet orthography was published in 1946, just after [[Korean independence]] from Japanese rule. In 1948, North Korea attempted to make the script perfectly morphophonemic through the addition of new letters, and in 1953, [[Syngman Rhee]] in South Korea attempted to simplify the orthography by returning to the colonial orthography of 1921, but both reforms were abandoned after only a few years.<ref name=\"Pratt\" />\n\nBoth [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] have used the Korean alphabet or [[Korean mixed script|mixed script]] as their official writing system, with ever-decreasing use of Hanja. Beginning in the 1970s, Hanja began to experience a gradual decline in commercial or unofficial writing in the South due to government intervention, with some South Korean newspapers now only using Hanja as abbreviations or disambiguation of homonyms. There has been widespread debate as to the future of Hanja in South Korea. North Korea instated the Korean alphabet as its exclusive writing system in 1949, and banned the use of Hanja completely.\n\n=== Contemporary use ===\n[[File:State Elementary School Karya Baru.jpg|thumb|right|An elementary school sign in [[Baubau]] written in Latin and Hangul alphabet.]]\n\nWhile both North Korea and South Korea claim 99 percent literacy, a 2003 study found that 25 percent of those in the older generation in the South were not completely literate in the Korean alphabet.<ref>''[[The Hankyoreh]]''.

The alphabetical order of the Korean alphabet does not mix consonants and vowels. Rather, first are [[velar consonant]]s, then [[Coronal consonant|coronals]], [[Labial consonant|labials]], [[sibilant]]s, etc. The vowels come after the consonants.\n\n=== Historical orders ===\nThe order from the ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]'' in 1446 was:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u314b \u3181 \u3137 \u314c \u3134 \u3142 \u314d \u3141 \u3148 \u314a \u3145 \u3186 \u314e \u3147 \u3139 \u317f}} \n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d \u3161 \u3163 \u3157 \u314f \u315c \u3153 \u315b \u3151 \u3160 \u3155}}\n\nIn 1527, [[Choe Sejin]] reorganized the alphabet in [[Hunmongjahoe]]:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3134 \u3137 \u3139 \u3141 \u3142 \u3145 \u3181 \u314b \u314c \u314d \u3148 \u314a \u317f \u3147 \u314e}}\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u318d}}\n\nThis is the basis of the modern alphabetic orders. It was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double letters that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} (') and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} (ng). Thus, when the [[North Korea]]n and [[South Korea]]n governments implemented full use of the Korean alphabet, they ordered these letters differently, with North Korea, placing new letters at the end of the alphabet and South Korea grouping similar letters together.\n\n=== North Korean order ===\nThe new, double, letters are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the ' {{lang|ko|\u3147|nocat=yes}}, so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.\n\n: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3134 \u3137 \u3139 \u3141 \u3142 \u3145 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e \u3132 \u3138 \u3143 \u3146 \u3149 \u3147}}\n: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u3150 \u3152 \u3154 \u3156 \u315a \u315f \u3162 \u3158 \u315d \u3159 \u315e}}\n\nAll digraphs and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s, including the old diphthongs {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}}, are placed after the simple vowels, again maintaining Choe's alphabetic order.\n\nThe order of the final letters is:\n\n:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3133 \u3134 \u3135 \u3136 \u3137 \u3139 \u313a \u313b \u313c \u313d \u313e \u313f \u3140 \u3141 \u3142 \u3144 \u3145 \u3147 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e \u3132 \u3146}}\n\nUnlike when it is initial, this {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} is pronounced, as the nasal {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ng,'' which occurs only as a final in the modern language. The double letters are placed to the very end, as in the initial order, but the combined consonants are ordered immediately after their first element.\n\n=== South Korean order ===\nIn the Southern order, double letters are placed immediately after their single counterparts:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131\u3132\u3134\u3137\u3138\u3139\u3141\u3142\u3143\u3145\u3146\u3147\u3148\u3149\u314a\u314b\u314c\u314d\u314e}}\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3150 \u3151 \u3152 \u3153 \u3154 \u3155 \u3156 \u3157 \u3158 \u3159 \u315a \u315b \u315c \u315d \u315e \u315f \u3160 \u3161 \u3162 \u3163}}\n\nThe modern [[monophthong]]al vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: ''i'' is added first, then [[Iotization|iotized]], then iotized with added ''i''. [[Diphthong]]s beginning with ''w'' are ordered according to their spelling, as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} or {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} plus a second vowel, not as separate [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.\n\nThe order of the final letters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1b\uce68}}) is:\n:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3132 \u3133 \u3134 \u3135 \u3136 \u3137 \u3139 \u313a \u313b \u313c \u313d \u313e \u313f \u3140 \u3141 \u3142 \u3144 \u3145 \u3146 \u3147 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e}}\n\n(\"None\" means there is no final letter.)\n\nEvery syllable begins with a consonant (or the silent \u3147) that is followed by a vowel (e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2e4}}). Some syllables such as \"{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2ec}}\" and \"{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2ed}}\" have a final consonant or final consonant cluster ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1b\uce68}}). Then, 399 combinations are possible for \"two-letter syllables\" and 10,773 possible combinations for syllables with more than two \"letters\" (27 possible final endings), for a total of 11,172 possible combinations of Korean alphabet \"letters\" to form syllables.\n\n==Letter names==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Giyuk.ogg|title=Korean consonants|description=names of the Korean consonant letters (South Korean)\n|filename2=Korean vowels.ogg|title2=Korean vowels|description2=names of the Korean vowel letters\n}}\nLetters in the Korean alphabet were named by Korean linguist [[Choe Sejin]] in 1527. South Korea uses Choe's traditional names, most of which follow the format of ''letter'' + ''i'' + ''eu'' + ''letter''. Choe described these names by listing Hanja characters with similar pronunciations. However, as the syllables {{lang|ko|\uc73d}} ''euk'', {{lang|ko|\uc743}} ''eut'', and {{lang|ko|\uc74f}} ''eut'' did not occur in Hanja, Choe gave those letters the modified names {{lang|ko|\uae30\uc5ed}} ''gi'''yeok''''', {{lang|ko|\ub514\uadff}} ''di'''geut''''', and {{lang|ko|\uc2dc\uc637}} ''si'''ot''''', using Hanja that didn't fit the pattern (for \uae30\uc5ed) or native Korean syllables (for \ub514\uadff and \uc2dc\uc637).\n\nOriginally, Choe gave {{lang|ko|\u3148}}, {{lang|ko|\u314a}}, {{lang|ko|\u314b}}, {{lang|ko|\u314c}}, {{lang|ko|\u314d}}, and {{lang|ko|\u314e}} the irregular one-syllable names of ''ji'', ''chi'', ''\u1e33i'', ''\u1e6di'', ''p\u0323i'', and ''hi'', because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]''. However, after establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which let all consonants be used as finals, the names changed to the present forms.\n\nNorth Korea regularized Choe's original names when it made the Korean alphabet its official orthography.\n\n=== In North Korea ===\nThe chart below shows names used in North Korea for consonants in the Korean alphabet. The letters are arranged in North Korean alphabetic order, and the letter names are romanised with the [[McCune\u2013Reischauer|McCune-Reischauer]] system, which is widely used in North Korea.

The Korean alphabet incorporates aspects of the latter three, grouping sounds into [[syllable]]s, using distinct symbols for [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]], and in some cases using distinct strokes to indicate [[distinctive feature]]s such as [[place of articulation]] ([[labial consonant|labial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[velar consonant|velar]], or [[glottal consonant|glottal]]) and [[manner of articulation]] ([[plosive]], [[nasal stop|nasal]], [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]) for consonants, and [[iotization]] (a preceding ''i-''sound), [[Vowel harmony|harmonic class]] and [[i-mutation]] for vowels.\n\nFor instance, the consonant {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} \u1e6d {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is a plosive, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3186}} ''\u0294'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}} ''g'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3148}} ''j'', which have the same stroke (the last is an [[Affricate consonant|affricate]], a plosive\u2013fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is aspirated, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314e}} ''h'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314b}} ''\u1e33'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314a}} ''ch'', which also have this stroke; and the bottom stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is alveolar, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3134}} ''n'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'', and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3139}} ''l''. (This element is said to represent the shape of the tongue when pronouncing coronal consonants, though this is not certain.) Two consonants, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}, have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements corresponding to these two pronunciations: {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~silence for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} and {{IPA|[m]}}~{{IPA|[w]}} for obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}.\n\nWith vowel letters, a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels that ''can'' be iotized; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel ''is'' iotized. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to, [[yin and yang|\"light\"]] (top or right) or [[yin and yang|\"dark\"]] (bottom or left). In the modern alphabet, an additional vertical stroke indicates [[i-mutation]], deriving {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315a}} {{IPA|[\u00f8]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315f}} {{IPA|[y]}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} {{IPA|[a]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} {{IPA|[o]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} {{IPA|[u]}}. However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally [[diphthong]]s ending in the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Indeed, in many [[Dialects of Korean|Korean dialects]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} including the standard [[Seoul Dialect|dialect of Seoul]], some of these may still be diphthongs. Note: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}} {{IPA|[e]}} as a morpheme is \u3153 combined with \u3163 as a vertical stroke. As a phoneme, its sound is not by i-mutation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} {{IPA|[\u028c]}}.\n\nBeside the letters, the Korean alphabet originally employed [[diacritic mark]]s to indicate [[pitch accent]]. A syllable with a high pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uac70\uc131}}) was marked with a dot (<span lang=\"ko\" style=\"font-family: '\uc740 \uc790\ubaa8 \ubc14\ud0d5', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif\">\u115f\u1160\u302e</span>) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc0c1\uc131}}) was marked with a double dot, like a colon (<span lang=\"ko\" style=\"font-family: '\uc740 \uc790\ubaa8 \ubc14\ud0d5', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif\">\u115f\u1160\u302f</span>).

Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the baseline of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a ''y'' sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153\u314f\u315c\u3157}}.) A preceding ''y'' sound, called \"iotization\", was indicated by doubling this dot: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155\u3151\u3160\u315b}} <small>''yeo, ya, yu, yo''</small>. The three vowels that could not be iotized were written with a single stroke: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u318d\u3163}} <small>''eu, (arae a), i''</small>.\n\n{|class=\"infobox wikitable\" style=\"width:120px;\"\n|-\n!Simple\n!Iotized\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3151}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315b}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3160}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}}\n|\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}}\n|\n|}\n\nThe simple iotized vowels are:\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3151}}&nbsp;<small>''ya''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} &nbsp;<small>''a''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155}}&nbsp;<small>''yeo''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} &nbsp;<small>''eo''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315b}}&nbsp;<small>''yo''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} &nbsp;<small>''o''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3160}}&nbsp;<small>''yu''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} &nbsp;<small>''u''</small>\n\nThere are also two iotized diphthongs:\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3152}}&nbsp;<small>''yae''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} &nbsp;<small>''ae''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3156}}&nbsp;<small>''ye''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}} &nbsp;<small>''e''</small>\n\nThe Korean language of the 15th century had [[vowel harmony]] to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical [[morpheme]]s changed according to their environment, falling into groups that \"harmonized\" with each other. This affected the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of ''yin'' and ''yang'': If a root word had ''yang'' ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have ''yang'' vowels; conversely, if the root had ''yin'' ('dark') vowels, the suffixes had to be ''yin'' as well. There was a third harmonic group called \"mediating\" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either ''yin'' or ''yang'' vowels.\n\nThe Korean neutral vowel was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i''. The ''yin'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u315c\u3153}} ''eu, u, eo''; the dots are in the ''yin'' directions of 'down' and 'left'. The ''yang'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d\u3157\u314f}} ''\u0259, o, a,'' with the dots in the ''yang'' directions of 'up' and 'right'. The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' states that the shapes of the non-dotted letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u318d\u3163}} were chosen to represent the concepts of ''yin'', ''yang'', and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d}} ''\u0259'' is now obsolete except in the Jeju language.)\n\nThe third parameter in designing the vowel letters was choosing {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15th century.\n\nThe uncertainty is primarily with the three letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d\u3153\u314f}}. Some linguists reconstruct these as {{IPA|*a, *\u0264, *e}}, respectively; others as {{IPA|*\u0259, *e, *a}}. A third reconstruction is to make them all middle vowels as {{IPA|*\u028c, *\u0264, *a}}.<ref>[http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/whitman/FrellWhitman.pdf The Japanese/Korean Vowel Correspondences] by Bjarke Frellesvig and John Whitman.

Here, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d}} symbolically stands for the (sun in) heaven, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} stands for the (flat) earth, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} stands for an (upright) human. The original sequence of the Korean vowels, as stated in [[Hunminjeongeum]], listed these three vowels first, followed by various combinations. Thus, the original order of the vowels was: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d \u3161 \u3163 \u3157 \u314f \u315c \u3153 \u315b \u3151 \u3160 \u3155}}.

Professor [[Gari Ledyard]] of Columbia University studied possible connections between Hangul and the Mongol [['Phags-pa script]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. He believed that the role of 'Phags-pa script in the creation of the Korean alphabet was quite limited:\n\n{{quotation|It should be clear to any reader that in the total picture, that ['Phags-pa script's] role was quite limited ... Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: \"According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from ''the Mongol's [[phags-pa script]]''.\"<ref>''The Korean language reform of 1446: the origin, background, and Early History of the Korean Alphabet'', Gari Keith Ledyard.

The rest of the letters were derived internally from these six, essentially as described in the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye''. However, the five borrowed consonants were not the graphically simplest letters considered basic by the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'', but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3148}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3139}}.\n\nThe ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that King Sejong adapted the {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} (''gojeon'', \"''G\u01d4'' Seal Script\") in creating the Korean alphabet. The {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} has never been identified. The primary meaning of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4}} ''g\u01d4'' is \"old\" (\"Old Seal Script\"), frustrating philologists because the Korean alphabet bears no functional similarity to Chinese {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u7bc6\u5b57}} ''zhu\u00e0nz\u00ec'' [[seal script]]s. However, Ledyard believes {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4}} ''g\u01d4'' may be a pun on {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u8499\u53e4}} ''M\u011bngg\u01d4'' \"Mongol\", and that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} is an abbreviation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u8499\u53e4\u7bc6\u5b57}} \"Mongol Seal Script\", that is, the formal variant of the 'Phags-pa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were 'Phags-pa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.\n\nIf this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] China after the fall of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as \"barbarians\".\n\nAccording to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for consonant clusters and left room to add a stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314b\u314c\u314d\u314a}}. But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181 \u3134 \u3141 \u3145}}) were derived by ''removing'' the top of the basic letters. He points out that while it is easy to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} by removing the top, it is not clear how to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} in the traditional account, since the shape of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} is not analogous to those of the other plosives.\n\nThe explanation of the letter ''ng'' also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ''ng'', but by King Sejong's day, initial ''ng'' was either silent or pronounced {{IPA|[\u014b]}} in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of ''ng'' (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}) would have looked almost identical to the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}} was added to the null symbol {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} to create {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} and ''ng'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} was eventually lost.)\n\nAnother letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}, which transcribed the Chinese [[Syllable onset|initial]] {{lang|zh|\u5fae}}. This represented either ''m'' or ''w'' in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} [m] plus {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} (from 'Phags-pa [w]). In 'Phags-pa, a loop under a letter represented ''w'' after vowels, and Ledyard hypothesized that this became the loop at the bottom of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}. In 'Phags-pa the Chinese initial {{lang|zh|\u5fae}} is also transcribed as a compound with ''w'', but in its case the ''w'' is placed under an ''h''. Actually, the Chinese consonant series {{lang|zh|\u5fae\u975e\u6577}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f'' is transcribed in 'Phags-pa by the addition of a ''w'' under three graphic variants of the letter for ''h'', and the Korean alphabet parallels this convention by adding the ''w'' loop to the labial series {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141\u3142\u314d}} ''m'', ''b'', ''p'', producing now-obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171\u3178\u3184}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f.'' (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these consonants were only used to transcribe Chinese.)\n\nAs a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that most of the borrowed Korean letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'' [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the 'Phags-pa {{Phagspa|v|\ua84a|da}} ''d'' [t] did. This lip can be traced back to the Tibetan letter {{bo-textonly|\u0f51}} ''d''.\n\n==Obsolete letters==\n[[File:Hankidoemhanja.png|thumb|''[[Hankido]]'' [<sub>'''H.N-GI-DO'''</sub>], a martial art, using the obsolete vowel ''arae-a'' (top)|alt=|left|180x180px]]\n''Main article:'' [[Historical Chinese phonology]]\n\nNumerous obsolete Korean letters and sequences are no longer used in Korean.

Two modifications of the letter {{lang|ko|\u3139}} were introduced, one for a {{lang|ko|\u3139}}, which is silent finally, and one for a {{lang|ko|\u3139}}, which doubled between vowels. A hybrid {{lang|ko|\u3142-\u315c}} letter was introduced for words that alternated between those two sounds (that is, a {{IPA|/b/}}, which became {{IPA|/w/}} before a vowel).

Instead, letters are grouped into [[syllable|syllabic]] or [[morpheme|morphemic]] blocks of at least two and often three: a consonant or a doubled consonant called the ''initial'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\ucd08\uc131, \u521d\u8072</span> ''choseong'' [[syllable onset]]), a vowel or [[diphthong]] called the ''medial'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\uc911\uc131, \u4e2d\u8072</span> ''jungseong'' [[syllable nucleus]]), and, optionally, a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the ''final'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\uc885\uc131, \u7d42\u8072</span> ''jongseong'' [[syllable coda]]). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the [[zero consonant|null initial]] {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ieung'' is used as a placeholder. (In the modern Korean alphabet, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a block contains a minimum of two letters, an initial and a medial. Although the Korean alphabet had historically been organized into syllables, in the modern orthography it is first organized into morphemes, and only secondarily into syllables within those morphemes, with the exception that single-consonant morphemes may not be written alone.\n\nThe sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ng'' only occurs in final position, while the doubled letters that can occur in final position are limited to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3146}} ''ss'' and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3132}} ''kk''.\n\nNot including obsolete letters, 11,172 blocks are possible in the Korean alphabet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Letter placement within a block ===\n{{Alphabet}}\nThe placement or \"stacking\" of letters in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.\n\nConsonant and vowel sequences such as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3144}} ''bs,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315d}} ''wo,'' or obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3175}} ''bsd,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318b}} ''\u00fcye'' are written left to right.\n\nVowels (medials) are written under the initial consonant, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the vowel has a horizontal axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} ''eu,'' then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i,'' then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3162}} ''ui,'' then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#faa; height:60px;\"|initial||  style=\"background:#afa; width:30px;\"|medial\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:60px; background:#faa; height:30px;\"|initial\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"background:#afa; height:30px;\"|medial\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#faa; height:30px;\"|initial\n|  style=\"background:#afa; width:30px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|med.<br />2\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"background:#afa; height:30px;\"|med.&nbsp;1\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nA final consonant, if present, is always written at the bottom, under the vowel.

Therefore:\n* Syllables with a horizontal medial are written downward: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc74d}} ''eup'';\n* Syllables with a vertical medial and simple final are written clockwise: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc30d}} ''ssang'';\n* Syllables with a wrapping medial switch direction (down-right-down): {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub41c}} ''doen'';\n* Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1f}} ''balp''.\n\n=== Block shape ===\nNormally the resulting block is written within a square of the same size and shape as a Hanja (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the letters to fill the bounds of the block, so someone not familiar with the scripts may mistake the Korean alphabet for Hanja or Chinese.\n\nHowever, some recent fonts (for example Eun,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Korean.html|title=Korean Unicode Fonts|first=Craig|last=Welch|website=www.wazu.jp}}</ref> {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|HY\uae4a\uc740\uc0d8\ubb3cM}}, UnJamo) move towards the European practice of letters whose relative size is fixed, and use whitespace to fill letter positions not used in a particular block, and away from the East Asian tradition of square block characters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u65b9\u5757\u5b57}}). They break one or more of the traditional rules:\n* Do not stretch initial consonant vertically, but leave [[Space (punctuation)|white space]] below if no lower vowel and/or no final consonant.\n* Do not stretch right-hand vowel vertically, but leave white space below if no final consonant.

Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectal variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in multiple ways. Sejong seemed to prefer [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] spelling (representing the underlying root forms) rather than a [[phoneme|phonemic]] one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history the Korean alphabet was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns and later in verbs. The modern Korean alphabet is as morphophonemic as is practical. The difference between phonetic Romanization, phonemic orthography and morpho-phonemic orthography can be illustrated with the phrase ''motaneun sarami'':\n\n<!-- vv These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. vv -->\n{{unordered list\n|1= Phonetic transcription and translation:\n{{block indent|<poem>motaneun sarami\n{{IPA|[mo.t\u02b0a.n\u026fn.sa.\u027ea.mi]}}\n''a person who cannot do it''</poem>}}\n|2= Phonemic transcription:\n{{block indent|<poem>{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubaa8\ud0c0\ub294\uc0ac\ub77c\ubbf8}}\n{{IPA|/mo.t\u02b0a.n\u026fn.sa.la.mi/}}</poem>}}\n|3= Morphophonemic transcription:\n{{block indent|<poem>{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubabb\ud558\ub294\uc0ac\ub78c\uc774}}\n{{IPA|{{!}}mot-ha-n\u026fn-sa.lam-i{{!}}}}</poem>}}\n|4= Morpheme-by-morpheme [[interlinear gloss|gloss]]:\n{{block indent|1=<nowiki/>\n{{(!}}\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubabb\u2013\ud558\u2013\ub294}}{{!!}}{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc0ac\ub78c{{=}}\uc774}}\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}mot-ha-neun{{!!}}saram=i\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}cannot-do-{{bracket|[[attributive verb|attributive]]}}{{!!}}person=[subject]\n{{!)}}}}\n}}\n<!-- ^^ These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. ^^ -->\n\nAfter the [[Gabo Reform]] in 1894, the [[Joseon Dynasty]] and later the [[Korean Empire]] started to write all official documents in the Korean alphabet. Under the government's management, proper usage of the Korean alphabet and Hanja, including orthography, was discussed, until the Korean Empire was [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] by Japan in 1910.\n\nThe [[Government-General of Korea]] popularised a writing style that mixed Hanja and the Korean alphabet, and was used in the later Joseon dynasty. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, to be relatively phonemic. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; There is no source that Imperial Japanese Gov't took any part in revising Korean Orthography. A talk page discussion suggests that this entire paragraph is made-up and has been consistently be here at least since 2007. Rather, the opposite is commonly expressed in Korean documents, for example, Oppression against Korean Language Society. |date=January 2020}}\n\nThe [[Hangul Society]], founded by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for orthography of the Korean alphabet is called ''Hangeul Matchumbeop'', whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.\n\n=== Mixed scripts ===\n[[File:Gardena in mixed Latin-hangul.jpg|thumb|The U.S. city of [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] in the Korean alphabet, with the {{IPA|[\u0261]}} written as Latin {{angle bracket|G}}. (Compare this large {{angle bracket|G}} with the smaller {{angle bracket|G}} in all-Latin ''Gardena'' below: The large {{angle bracket|G}} is fused (at bottom-right) with the Korean alphabet {{angle bracket|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}}} that would normally be used to transcribe ''Gardena''.)]]\nSince the Late Joseon dynasty period, various [[Korean mixed script|Hanja-Hangul mixed systems]] were used. In these systems, Hanja were used for lexical roots, and the Korean alphabet for grammatical words and inflections, much as ''kanji'' and ''kana'' are used in Japanese. Hanja have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms.\n\n[[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system|Indo-Arabic numerals]] are mixed in with the Korean alphabet, e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|2007\ub144 3\uc6d4 22\uc77c}} (22 March 2007).\n\n[[Latin script]] and occasionally other scripts may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated [[loanword]]s. Very occasionally non-Hangul letters may be mixed into Korean syllabic blocks, as {{nobreak|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|G\u314f}}}} ''Ga'' at right.\n\n==Readability==\nBecause of syllable clustering, words are shorter on the page than their linear counterparts would be, and the boundaries between syllables are easily visible (which may aid reading, if segmenting words into syllables is more natural for the reader than dividing them into phonemes).<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=71}}</ref> Because the component parts of the syllable are relatively simple phonemic characters, the number of strokes per character on average is lower than in Chinese characters. Unlike syllabaries, such as Japanese kana, or Chinese logographs, none of which encode the constituent phonemes within a syllable, the graphic complexity of Korean syllabic blocks varies in direct proportion with the phonemic complexity of the syllable.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=73}}</ref> Unlike linear alphabets such as [[Latin-script alphabet|those derived from Latin]], Korean orthography allows the reader to \"utilize both the horizontal and vertical visual fields\".<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=70}}</ref> Finally, since Korean syllables are represented both as collections of phonemes and as unique-looking graphs, they may allow for both visual and aural retrieval of words from the [[lexicon]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Hangul TypeStyles sansPen.svg|150x150px|right]]\nThe Korean alphabet may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is from top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Latin script was promoted by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], and has become overwhelmingly prevalent.\n\nIn ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]]'', the Korean alphabet was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness. This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found in stone carvings (on statues, for example).\n\nOver the centuries, an ink-brush style of [[calligraphy]] developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as traditional Korean calligraphy. This brush style is called ''gungche'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uad81\uccb4 \u5bae\u9ad4}}), which means \"Palace Style\" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants (''gungnyeo,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uad81\ub140 \u5bae\u5973}}) of the court in [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]].\n\nModern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the 20th century. In 1993, new names for both [[Ming (typefaces)|Myeongjo]] ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u660e\u671d}}) and [[East Asian gothic typeface|Gothic]] styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names ''Batang'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc14\ud0d5}}, meaning \"background\") and ''Dotum'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub3cb\uc6c0}}, meaning \"stand out\") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nA sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish ''-eung'' from ''-ung'' even in small or untidy print, as the ''jongseong ieung'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}}) of such fonts usually lacks a [[serif]] that could be mistaken for the short vertical line of the letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} ''(u)''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n* [[Hangul consonant and vowel tables]]\n* [[Hangul orthography]]\n*[[Hangul supremacy|Hangul Scientific Supremacy]] \n* [[Korean phonology]]\n* [[Korean language and computers]]\n* [[Korean mixed script]]\n* [[Korean romanization]]\n** [[McCune-Reischauer]]\n** [[Revised Romanization]]\n** [[Yale Romanization of Korean]]\n* [[Korean braille]]\n* [[Korean manual alphabet]]\n* [[Korean spelling alphabet]]\n* [[Myongjo]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last=Chang | first=Suk-jin | title=Korean |location=Philadelphia | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | year=1996 | isbn=978-1-55619-728-4 | chapter=Scripts and Sounds }} (Volume 4 of the ''London Oriental and African Language Library'').\n* {{cite book |last = Hannas |first = William C. |title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8248-1892-0 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Kim-Renaud |editor-first=Young-Key |title=The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC |year=1997 |publisher=University of Hawai`i Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1723-7 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |first1=Iksop |last1=Lee |first2=Samuel Robert |last2=Ramsey |title=The Korean Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NN-yIdLOkCoC |year=2000 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-9130-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |title=Hangeul Matchumbeop |year=1988 |publisher=The Ministry of Education of South Korea |url = http://www.korean.go.kr/search/grammar/rule/collect_rule.html }}\n* {{cite book |isbn=978-0-8047-1756-4 |title=Writing Systems |first=Geoffrey |last=Sampson |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1990 |ref=Sampson |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/writingsystems00geof }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Silva |first=David J. |title=Western attitudes toward the Korean language: An Overview of Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth-Century Mission Literature |journal=[[Korean Studies (journal)|Korean Studies]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=270\u2013286 |year=2002 |doi=10.1353/ks.2004.0013 |hdl=10106/11257 |url=https://uta-ir.tdl.org/uta-ir/bitstream/10106/11257/1/WesternAttitudesKoreanLanguage-Silva.pdf }}\n* {{cite book |first=Ho-Min |last=Sohn |title=The Korean Language |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Sx6gdJIOcoQC |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-36943-5 |series=Cambridge Language Surveys }}\n* {{cite book |first=Jae Jung |last=Song |title=The Korean Language: Structure, Use and Context |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D36c9l_u0sC |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-203-39082-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Insup |chapter=The Korean writing system: An alphabet?

[[Long vowels]] were marked by a diacritic dot to the left of the syllable, but this was dropped in 1921.<ref name=\"Pratt\" />\n\nA second colonial reform occurred in 1930. The ''arae-a'' was abolished: the emphatic consonants were changed to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3132, \u3138, \u3143, \u3146, \u3149}} and more final consonants {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137, \u3148, \u314c, \u314a, \u314d, \u3132, \u3133, \u3135, \u313e, \u313f, \u3144}} were allowed, making the orthography more [[morphophonemic]]. The double-consonant {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3146}} was written alone (without a vowel) when it occurred between nouns, and the nominative particle {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|-\uac00}} was introduced after vowels, replacing {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|-\uc774}}.<ref name=\"Pratt\" />\n\n[[Ju Si-gyeong]], the linguist who had coined the term Hangul to replace ''Eonmun'' or \"Vulgar Script\" in 1912, established the Korean Language Research Society (later renamed the [[Hangul Society]]), which further reformed orthography with ''Standardized System of Hangul'' in 1933.

The alphabetical order of the Korean alphabet does not mix consonants and vowels. Rather, first are [[velar consonant]]s, then [[Coronal consonant|coronals]], [[Labial consonant|labials]], [[sibilant]]s, etc. The vowels come after the consonants.\n\n=== Historical orders ===\nThe order from the ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]'' in 1446 was:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u314b \u3181 \u3137 \u314c \u3134 \u3142 \u314d \u3141 \u3148 \u314a \u3145 \u3186 \u314e \u3147 \u3139 \u317f}} \n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d \u3161 \u3163 \u3157 \u314f \u315c \u3153 \u315b \u3151 \u3160 \u3155}}\n\nIn 1527, [[Choe Sejin]] reorganized the alphabet in [[Hunmongjahoe]]:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3134 \u3137 \u3139 \u3141 \u3142 \u3145 \u3181 \u314b \u314c \u314d \u3148 \u314a \u317f \u3147 \u314e}}\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u318d}}\n\nThis is the basis of the modern alphabetic orders. It was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double letters that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} (') and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} (ng). Thus, when the [[North Korea]]n and [[South Korea]]n governments implemented full use of the Korean alphabet, they ordered these letters differently, with North Korea, placing new letters at the end of the alphabet and South Korea grouping similar letters together.\n\n=== North Korean order ===\nThe new, double, letters are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the ' {{lang|ko|\u3147|nocat=yes}}, so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.\n\n: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3134 \u3137 \u3139 \u3141 \u3142 \u3145 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e \u3132 \u3138 \u3143 \u3146 \u3149 \u3147}}\n: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u3150 \u3152 \u3154 \u3156 \u315a \u315f \u3162 \u3158 \u315d \u3159 \u315e}}\n\nAll digraphs and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s, including the old diphthongs {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}}, are placed after the simple vowels, again maintaining Choe's alphabetic order.\n\nThe order of the final letters is:\n\n:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3133 \u3134 \u3135 \u3136 \u3137 \u3139 \u313a \u313b \u313c \u313d \u313e \u313f \u3140 \u3141 \u3142 \u3144 \u3145 \u3147 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e \u3132 \u3146}}\n\nUnlike when it is initial, this {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} is pronounced, as the nasal {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ng,'' which occurs only as a final in the modern language. The double letters are placed to the very end, as in the initial order, but the combined consonants are ordered immediately after their first element.\n\n=== South Korean order ===\nIn the Southern order, double letters are placed immediately after their single counterparts:\n\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131\u3132\u3134\u3137\u3138\u3139\u3141\u3142\u3143\u3145\u3146\u3147\u3148\u3149\u314a\u314b\u314c\u314d\u314e}}\n:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f \u3150 \u3151 \u3152 \u3153 \u3154 \u3155 \u3156 \u3157 \u3158 \u3159 \u315a \u315b \u315c \u315d \u315e \u315f \u3160 \u3161 \u3162 \u3163}}\n\nThe modern [[monophthong]]al vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: ''i'' is added first, then [[Iotization|iotized]], then iotized with added ''i''. [[Diphthong]]s beginning with ''w'' are ordered according to their spelling, as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} or {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} plus a second vowel, not as separate [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.\n\nThe order of the final letters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1b\uce68}}) is:\n:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131 \u3132 \u3133 \u3134 \u3135 \u3136 \u3137 \u3139 \u313a \u313b \u313c \u313d \u313e \u313f \u3140 \u3141 \u3142 \u3144 \u3145 \u3146 \u3147 \u3148 \u314a \u314b \u314c \u314d \u314e}}\n\n(\"None\" means there is no final letter.)\n\nEvery syllable begins with a consonant (or the silent \u3147) that is followed by a vowel (e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2e4}}). Some syllables such as \"{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2ec}}\" and \"{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub2ed}}\" have a final consonant or final consonant cluster ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1b\uce68}}). Then, 399 combinations are possible for \"two-letter syllables\" and 10,773 possible combinations for syllables with more than two \"letters\" (27 possible final endings), for a total of 11,172 possible combinations of Korean alphabet \"letters\" to form syllables.\n\n==Letter names==\n{{Listen\n|filename=Giyuk.ogg|title=Korean consonants|description=names of the Korean consonant letters (South Korean)\n|filename2=Korean vowels.ogg|title2=Korean vowels|description2=names of the Korean vowel letters\n}}\nLetters in the Korean alphabet were named by Korean linguist [[Choe Sejin]] in 1527. South Korea uses Choe's traditional names, most of which follow the format of ''letter'' + ''i'' + ''eu'' + ''letter''. Choe described these names by listing Hanja characters with similar pronunciations. However, as the syllables {{lang|ko|\uc73d}} ''euk'', {{lang|ko|\uc743}} ''eut'', and {{lang|ko|\uc74f}} ''eut'' did not occur in Hanja, Choe gave those letters the modified names {{lang|ko|\uae30\uc5ed}} ''gi'''yeok''''', {{lang|ko|\ub514\uadff}} ''di'''geut''''', and {{lang|ko|\uc2dc\uc637}} ''si'''ot''''', using Hanja that didn't fit the pattern (for \uae30\uc5ed) or native Korean syllables (for \ub514\uadff and \uc2dc\uc637).\n\nOriginally, Choe gave {{lang|ko|\u3148}}, {{lang|ko|\u314a}}, {{lang|ko|\u314b}}, {{lang|ko|\u314c}}, {{lang|ko|\u314d}}, and {{lang|ko|\u314e}} the irregular one-syllable names of ''ji'', ''chi'', ''\u1e33i'', ''\u1e6di'', ''p\u0323i'', and ''hi'', because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]''.

The Korean alphabet incorporates aspects of the latter three, grouping sounds into [[syllable]]s, using distinct symbols for [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]], and in some cases using distinct strokes to indicate [[distinctive feature]]s such as [[place of articulation]] ([[labial consonant|labial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[velar consonant|velar]], or [[glottal consonant|glottal]]) and [[manner of articulation]] ([[plosive]], [[nasal stop|nasal]], [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]) for consonants, and [[iotization]] (a preceding ''i-''sound), [[Vowel harmony|harmonic class]] and [[i-mutation]] for vowels.\n\nFor instance, the consonant {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} \u1e6d {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is a plosive, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3186}} ''\u0294'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}} ''g'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3148}} ''j'', which have the same stroke (the last is an [[Affricate consonant|affricate]], a plosive\u2013fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is aspirated, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314e}} ''h'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314b}} ''\u1e33'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314a}} ''ch'', which also have this stroke; and the bottom stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314c}} is alveolar, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3134}} ''n'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'', and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3139}} ''l''. (This element is said to represent the shape of the tongue when pronouncing coronal consonants, though this is not certain.) Two consonants, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}, have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements corresponding to these two pronunciations: {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~silence for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} and {{IPA|[m]}}~{{IPA|[w]}} for obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}.\n\nWith vowel letters, a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels that ''can'' be iotized; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel ''is'' iotized. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to, [[yin and yang|\"light\"]] (top or right) or [[yin and yang|\"dark\"]] (bottom or left). In the modern alphabet, an additional vertical stroke indicates [[i-mutation]], deriving {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} {{IPA|[\u025b]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315a}} {{IPA|[\u00f8]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315f}} {{IPA|[y]}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} {{IPA|[a]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} {{IPA|[o]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} {{IPA|[u]}}. However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally [[diphthong]]s ending in the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Indeed, in many [[Dialects of Korean|Korean dialects]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} including the standard [[Seoul Dialect|dialect of Seoul]], some of these may still be diphthongs. Note: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}} {{IPA|[e]}} as a morpheme is \u3153 combined with \u3163 as a vertical stroke. As a phoneme, its sound is not by i-mutation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} {{IPA|[\u028c]}}.\n\nBeside the letters, the Korean alphabet originally employed [[diacritic mark]]s to indicate [[pitch accent]]. A syllable with a high pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uac70\uc131}}) was marked with a dot (<span lang=\"ko\" style=\"font-family: '\uc740 \uc790\ubaa8 \ubc14\ud0d5', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif\">\u115f\u1160\u302e</span>) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc0c1\uc131}}) was marked with a double dot, like a colon (<span lang=\"ko\" style=\"font-family: '\uc740 \uc790\ubaa8 \ubc14\ud0d5', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif\">\u115f\u1160\u302f</span>).

Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the baseline of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a ''y'' sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153\u314f\u315c\u3157}}.) A preceding ''y'' sound, called \"iotization\", was indicated by doubling this dot: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155\u3151\u3160\u315b}} <small>''yeo, ya, yu, yo''</small>. The three vowels that could not be iotized were written with a single stroke: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u318d\u3163}} <small>''eu, (arae a), i''</small>.\n\n{|class=\"infobox wikitable\" style=\"width:120px;\"\n|-\n!Simple\n!Iotized\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3151}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315b}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}}\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3160}}\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}}\n|\n|-\n|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}}\n|\n|}\n\nThe simple iotized vowels are:\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3151}}&nbsp;<small>''ya''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}} &nbsp;<small>''a''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3155}}&nbsp;<small>''yeo''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} &nbsp;<small>''eo''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315b}}&nbsp;<small>''yo''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}} &nbsp;<small>''o''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3160}}&nbsp;<small>''yu''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} &nbsp;<small>''u''</small>\n\nThere are also two iotized diphthongs:\n\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3152}}&nbsp;<small>''yae''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3150}} &nbsp;<small>''ae''</small>\n* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3156}}&nbsp;<small>''ye''</small> from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3154}} &nbsp;<small>''e''</small>\n\nThe Korean language of the 15th century had [[vowel harmony]] to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical [[morpheme]]s changed according to their environment, falling into groups that \"harmonized\" with each other. This affected the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of ''yin'' and ''yang'': If a root word had ''yang'' ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have ''yang'' vowels; conversely, if the root had ''yin'' ('dark') vowels, the suffixes had to be ''yin'' as well. There was a third harmonic group called \"mediating\" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either ''yin'' or ''yang'' vowels.\n\nThe Korean neutral vowel was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i''. The ''yin'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u315c\u3153}} ''eu, u, eo''; the dots are in the ''yin'' directions of 'down' and 'left'. The ''yang'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d\u3157\u314f}} ''\u0259, o, a,'' with the dots in the ''yang'' directions of 'up' and 'right'. The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' states that the shapes of the non-dotted letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161\u318d\u3163}} were chosen to represent the concepts of ''yin'', ''yang'', and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d}} ''\u0259'' is now obsolete except in the Jeju language.)\n\nThe third parameter in designing the vowel letters was choosing {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3157}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3153}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314f}}. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15th century.\n\nThe uncertainty is primarily with the three letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d\u3153\u314f}}. Some linguists reconstruct these as {{IPA|*a, *\u0264, *e}}, respectively; others as {{IPA|*\u0259, *e, *a}}. A third reconstruction is to make them all middle vowels as {{IPA|*\u028c, *\u0264, *a}}.<ref>[http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/whitman/FrellWhitman.pdf The Japanese/Korean Vowel Correspondences] by Bjarke Frellesvig and John Whitman.

Here, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d}} symbolically stands for the (sun in) heaven, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} stands for the (flat) earth, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} stands for an (upright) human. The original sequence of the Korean vowels, as stated in [[Hunminjeongeum]], listed these three vowels first, followed by various combinations. Thus, the original order of the vowels was: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318d \u3161 \u3163 \u3157 \u314f \u315c \u3153 \u315b \u3151 \u3160 \u3155}}.

Professor [[Gari Ledyard]] of Columbia University studied possible connections between Hangul and the Mongol [['Phags-pa script]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. He believed that the role of 'Phags-pa script in the creation of the Korean alphabet was quite limited:\n\n{{quotation|It should be clear to any reader that in the total picture, that ['Phags-pa script's] role was quite limited ... Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: \"According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from ''the Mongol's [[phags-pa script]]''.\"<ref>''The Korean language reform of 1446: the origin, background, and Early History of the Korean Alphabet'', Gari Keith Ledyard.

The rest of the letters were derived internally from these six, essentially as described in the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye''. However, the five borrowed consonants were not the graphically simplest letters considered basic by the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'', but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3148}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3139}}.\n\nThe ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that King Sejong adapted the {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} (''gojeon'', \"''G\u01d4'' Seal Script\") in creating the Korean alphabet. The {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} has never been identified. The primary meaning of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4}} ''g\u01d4'' is \"old\" (\"Old Seal Script\"), frustrating philologists because the Korean alphabet bears no functional similarity to Chinese {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u7bc6\u5b57}} ''zhu\u00e0nz\u00ec'' [[seal script]]s. However, Ledyard believes {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4}} ''g\u01d4'' may be a pun on {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u8499\u53e4}} ''M\u011bngg\u01d4'' \"Mongol\", and that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u53e4\u7bc6}} is an abbreviation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u8499\u53e4\u7bc6\u5b57}} \"Mongol Seal Script\", that is, the formal variant of the 'Phags-pa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were 'Phags-pa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.\n\nIf this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] China after the fall of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as \"barbarians\".\n\nAccording to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for consonant clusters and left room to add a stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314b\u314c\u314d\u314a}}. But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181 \u3134 \u3141 \u3145}}) were derived by ''removing'' the top of the basic letters. He points out that while it is easy to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} by removing the top, it is not clear how to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} in the traditional account, since the shape of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3142}} is not analogous to those of the other plosives.\n\nThe explanation of the letter ''ng'' also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ''ng'', but by King Sejong's day, initial ''ng'' was either silent or pronounced {{IPA|[\u014b]}} in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of ''ng'' (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}) would have looked almost identical to the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}} was added to the null symbol {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} to create {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} and ''ng'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3181}} was eventually lost.)\n\nAnother letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}, which transcribed the Chinese [[Syllable onset|initial]] {{lang|zh|\u5fae}}. This represented either ''m'' or ''w'' in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141}} [m] plus {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} (from 'Phags-pa [w]). In 'Phags-pa, a loop under a letter represented ''w'' after vowels, and Ledyard hypothesized that this became the loop at the bottom of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171}}. In 'Phags-pa the Chinese initial {{lang|zh|\u5fae}} is also transcribed as a compound with ''w'', but in its case the ''w'' is placed under an ''h''. Actually, the Chinese consonant series {{lang|zh|\u5fae\u975e\u6577}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f'' is transcribed in 'Phags-pa by the addition of a ''w'' under three graphic variants of the letter for ''h'', and the Korean alphabet parallels this convention by adding the ''w'' loop to the labial series {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3141\u3142\u314d}} ''m'', ''b'', ''p'', producing now-obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3171\u3178\u3184}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f.'' (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these consonants were only used to transcribe Chinese.)\n\nAs a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that most of the borrowed Korean letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3137}} ''d'' [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the 'Phags-pa {{Phagspa|v|\ua84a|da}} ''d'' [t] did. This lip can be traced back to the Tibetan letter {{bo-textonly|\u0f51}} ''d''.\n\n==Obsolete letters==\n[[File:Hankidoemhanja.png|thumb|''[[Hankido]]'' [<sub>'''H.N-GI-DO'''</sub>], a martial art, using the obsolete vowel ''arae-a'' (top)|alt=|left|180x180px]]\n''Main article:'' [[Historical Chinese phonology]]\n\nNumerous obsolete Korean letters and sequences are no longer used in Korean.

Two modifications of the letter {{lang|ko|\u3139}} were introduced, one for a {{lang|ko|\u3139}}, which is silent finally, and one for a {{lang|ko|\u3139}}, which doubled between vowels. A hybrid {{lang|ko|\u3142-\u315c}} letter was introduced for words that alternated between those two sounds (that is, a {{IPA|/b/}}, which became {{IPA|/w/}} before a vowel).

Instead, letters are grouped into [[syllable|syllabic]] or [[morpheme|morphemic]] blocks of at least two and often three: a consonant or a doubled consonant called the ''initial'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\ucd08\uc131, \u521d\u8072</span> ''choseong'' [[syllable onset]]), a vowel or [[diphthong]] called the ''medial'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\uc911\uc131, \u4e2d\u8072</span> ''jungseong'' [[syllable nucleus]]), and, optionally, a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the ''final'' (<span lang=\"ko\">\uc885\uc131, \u7d42\u8072</span> ''jongseong'' [[syllable coda]]). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the [[zero consonant|null initial]] {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ieung'' is used as a placeholder. (In the modern Korean alphabet, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a block contains a minimum of two letters, an initial and a medial. Although the Korean alphabet had historically been organized into syllables, in the modern orthography it is first organized into morphemes, and only secondarily into syllables within those morphemes, with the exception that single-consonant morphemes may not be written alone.\n\nThe sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}} ''ng'' only occurs in final position, while the doubled letters that can occur in final position are limited to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3146}} ''ss'' and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3132}} ''kk''.\n\nNot including obsolete letters, 11,172 blocks are possible in the Korean alphabet.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== Letter placement within a block ===\n{{Alphabet}}\nThe placement or \"stacking\" of letters in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.\n\nConsonant and vowel sequences such as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3144}} ''bs,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315d}} ''wo,'' or obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3175}} ''bsd,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u318b}} ''\u00fcye'' are written left to right.\n\nVowels (medials) are written under the initial consonant, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the vowel has a horizontal axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3161}} ''eu,'' then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3163}} ''i,'' then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3162}} ''ui,'' then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#faa; height:60px;\"|initial||  style=\"background:#afa; width:30px;\"|medial\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:60px; background:#faa; height:30px;\"|initial\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"background:#afa; height:30px;\"|medial\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{|\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"width:30px; background:#faa; height:30px;\"|initial\n|  style=\"background:#afa; width:30px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|med.<br />2\n|- align=center\n|  style=\"background:#afa; height:30px;\"|med.&nbsp;1\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nA final consonant, if present, is always written at the bottom, under the vowel.

Therefore:\n* Syllables with a horizontal medial are written downward: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc74d}} ''eup'';\n* Syllables with a vertical medial and simple final are written clockwise: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc30d}} ''ssang'';\n* Syllables with a wrapping medial switch direction (down-right-down): {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub41c}} ''doen'';\n* Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc1f}} ''balp''.\n\n=== Block shape ===\nNormally the resulting block is written within a square of the same size and shape as a Hanja (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the letters to fill the bounds of the block, so someone not familiar with the scripts may mistake the Korean alphabet for Hanja or Chinese.\n\nHowever, some recent fonts (for example Eun,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Korean.html|title=Korean Unicode Fonts|first=Craig|last=Welch|website=www.wazu.jp}}</ref> {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|HY\uae4a\uc740\uc0d8\ubb3cM}}, UnJamo) move towards the European practice of letters whose relative size is fixed, and use whitespace to fill letter positions not used in a particular block, and away from the East Asian tradition of square block characters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u65b9\u5757\u5b57}}). They break one or more of the traditional rules:\n* Do not stretch initial consonant vertically, but leave [[Space (punctuation)|white space]] below if no lower vowel and/or no final consonant.\n* Do not stretch right-hand vowel vertically, but leave white space below if no final consonant.

For example, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u314e\u314f\u3134\u3131\u3161\u3139}} would be written for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ud55c\uae00}} ''(Hangeul).''<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vj8ShHzUxrYC&pg=PA162 |title=Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary - Keith L.

Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectal variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in multiple ways. Sejong seemed to prefer [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] spelling (representing the underlying root forms) rather than a [[phoneme|phonemic]] one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history the Korean alphabet was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns and later in verbs. The modern Korean alphabet is as morphophonemic as is practical. The difference between phonetic Romanization, phonemic orthography and morpho-phonemic orthography can be illustrated with the phrase ''motaneun sarami'':\n\n<!-- vv These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. vv -->\n{{unordered list\n|1= Phonetic transcription and translation:\n{{block indent|<poem>motaneun sarami\n{{IPA|[mo.t\u02b0a.n\u026fn.sa.\u027ea.mi]}}\n''a person who cannot do it''</poem>}}\n|2= Phonemic transcription:\n{{block indent|<poem>{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubaa8\ud0c0\ub294\uc0ac\ub77c\ubbf8}}\n{{IPA|/mo.t\u02b0a.n\u026fn.sa.la.mi/}}</poem>}}\n|3= Morphophonemic transcription:\n{{block indent|<poem>{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubabb\ud558\ub294\uc0ac\ub78c\uc774}}\n{{IPA|{{!}}mot-ha-n\u026fn-sa.lam-i{{!}}}}</poem>}}\n|4= Morpheme-by-morpheme [[interlinear gloss|gloss]]:\n{{block indent|1=<nowiki/>\n{{(!}}\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubabb\u2013\ud558\u2013\ub294}}{{!!}}{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uc0ac\ub78c{{=}}\uc774}}\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}mot-ha-neun{{!!}}saram=i\n{{!-}}\n{{!}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{!!}}cannot-do-{{bracket|[[attributive verb|attributive]]}}{{!!}}person=[subject]\n{{!)}}}}\n}}\n<!-- ^^ These transcriptions are correct; please see the talk page. ^^ -->\n\nAfter the [[Gabo Reform]] in 1894, the [[Joseon Dynasty]] and later the [[Korean Empire]] started to write all official documents in the Korean alphabet. Under the government's management, proper usage of the Korean alphabet and Hanja, including orthography, was discussed, until the Korean Empire was [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] by Japan in 1910.\n\nThe [[Government-General of Korea]] popularised a writing style that mixed Hanja and the Korean alphabet, and was used in the later Joseon dynasty. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, to be relatively phonemic. {{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; There is no source that Imperial Japanese Gov't took any part in revising Korean Orthography. A talk page discussion suggests that this entire paragraph is made-up and has been consistently be here at least since 2007. Rather, the opposite is commonly expressed in Korean documents, for example, Oppression against Korean Language Society. |date=January 2020}}\n\nThe [[Hangul Society]], founded by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for orthography of the Korean alphabet is called ''Hangeul Matchumbeop'', whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.\n\n=== Mixed scripts ===\n[[File:Gardena in mixed Latin-hangul.jpg|thumb|The U.S. city of [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] in the Korean alphabet, with the {{IPA|[\u0261]}} written as Latin {{angle bracket|G}}. (Compare this large {{angle bracket|G}} with the smaller {{angle bracket|G}} in all-Latin ''Gardena'' below: The large {{angle bracket|G}} is fused (at bottom-right) with the Korean alphabet {{angle bracket|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3131}}}} that would normally be used to transcribe ''Gardena''.)]]\nSince the Late Joseon dynasty period, various [[Korean mixed script|Hanja-Hangul mixed systems]] were used. In these systems, Hanja were used for lexical roots, and the Korean alphabet for grammatical words and inflections, much as ''kanji'' and ''kana'' are used in Japanese. Hanja have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms.\n\n[[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system|Indo-Arabic numerals]] are mixed in with the Korean alphabet, e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|2007\ub144 3\uc6d4 22\uc77c}} (22 March 2007).\n\n[[Latin script]] and occasionally other scripts may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated [[loanword]]s. Very occasionally non-Hangul letters may be mixed into Korean syllabic blocks, as {{nobreak|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|G\u314f}}}} ''Ga'' at right.\n\n==Readability==\nBecause of syllable clustering, words are shorter on the page than their linear counterparts would be, and the boundaries between syllables are easily visible (which may aid reading, if segmenting words into syllables is more natural for the reader than dividing them into phonemes).<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=71}}</ref> Because the component parts of the syllable are relatively simple phonemic characters, the number of strokes per character on average is lower than in Chinese characters. Unlike syllabaries, such as Japanese kana, or Chinese logographs, none of which encode the constituent phonemes within a syllable, the graphic complexity of Korean syllabic blocks varies in direct proportion with the phonemic complexity of the syllable.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=73}}</ref> Unlike linear alphabets such as [[Latin-script alphabet|those derived from Latin]], Korean orthography allows the reader to \"utilize both the horizontal and vertical visual fields\".<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=70}}</ref> Finally, since Korean syllables are represented both as collections of phonemes and as unique-looking graphs, they may allow for both visual and aural retrieval of words from the [[lexicon]].\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Hangul TypeStyles sansPen.svg|150x150px|right]]\nThe Korean alphabet may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is from top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Latin script was promoted by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], and has become overwhelmingly prevalent.\n\nIn ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]]'', the Korean alphabet was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness. This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found in stone carvings (on statues, for example).\n\nOver the centuries, an ink-brush style of [[calligraphy]] developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as traditional Korean calligraphy. This brush style is called ''gungche'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uad81\uccb4 \u5bae\u9ad4}}), which means \"Palace Style\" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants (''gungnyeo,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\uad81\ub140 \u5bae\u5973}}) of the court in [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]].\n\nModern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the 20th century. In 1993, new names for both [[Ming (typefaces)|Myeongjo]] ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u660e\u671d}}) and [[East Asian gothic typeface|Gothic]] styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names ''Batang'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ubc14\ud0d5}}, meaning \"background\") and ''Dotum'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\ub3cb\uc6c0}}, meaning \"stand out\") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nA sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish ''-eung'' from ''-ung'' even in small or untidy print, as the ''jongseong ieung'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u3147}}) of such fonts usually lacks a [[serif]] that could be mistaken for the short vertical line of the letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|\u315c}} ''(u)''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n* [[Hangul consonant and vowel tables]]\n* [[Hangul orthography]]\n*[[Hangul supremacy|Hangul Scientific Supremacy]] \n* [[Korean phonology]]\n* [[Korean language and computers]]\n* [[Korean mixed script]]\n* [[Korean romanization]]\n** [[McCune-Reischauer]]\n** [[Revised Romanization]]\n** [[Yale Romanization of Korean]]\n* [[Korean braille]]\n* [[Korean manual alphabet]]\n* [[Korean spelling alphabet]]\n* [[Myongjo]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last=Chang | first=Suk-jin | title=Korean |location=Philadelphia | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | year=1996 | isbn=978-1-55619-728-4 | chapter=Scripts and Sounds }} (Volume 4 of the ''London Oriental and African Language Library'').\n* {{cite book |last = Hannas |first = William C. |title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8248-1892-0 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Kim-Renaud |editor-first=Young-Key |title=The Korean Alphabet: Its History and Structure |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nonRl2cerIgC |year=1997 |publisher=University of Hawai`i Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1723-7 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |first1=Iksop |last1=Lee |first2=Samuel Robert |last2=Ramsey |title=The Korean Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NN-yIdLOkCoC |year=2000 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-9130-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web |title=Hangeul Matchumbeop |year=1988 |publisher=The Ministry of Education of South Korea |url = http://www.korean.go.kr/search/grammar/rule/collect_rule.html }}\n* {{cite book |isbn=978-0-8047-1756-4 |title=Writing Systems |first=Geoffrey |last=Sampson |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1990 |ref=Sampson |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/writingsystems00geof }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Silva |first=David J. |title=Western attitudes toward the Korean language: An Overview of Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth-Century Mission Literature |journal=[[Korean Studies (journal)|Korean Studies]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=270\u2013286 |year=2002 |doi=10.1353/ks.2004.0013 |hdl=10106/11257 |url=https://uta-ir.tdl.org/uta-ir/bitstream/10106/11257/1/WesternAttitudesKoreanLanguage-Silva.pdf }}\n* {{cite book |first=Ho-Min |last=Sohn |title=The Korean Language |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Sx6gdJIOcoQC |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-36943-5 |series=Cambridge Language Surveys }}\n* {{cite book |first=Jae Jung |last=Song |title=The Korean Language: Structure, Use and Context |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3D36c9l_u0sC |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-203-39082-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Insup |chapter=The Korean writing system: An alphabet?
