Following [[Yahya Jammeh]]'s [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in 1994, Sallah and other PDOIS leaders adopted a principled stance in response, with Sallah and Jatta both turning down offers to join the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]].

As the [[United Democratic Party (Gambia)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) had boycotted the election, the PDOIS, with two seats, emerged as the largest opposition party, and Sallah became the Minority Leader in the National Assembly. He also served as a member of the [[Pan-African Parliament]] in this period. In June 2005, he was expelled from the National Assembly along with three other opposition MPs on the grounds of dual party membership. [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development|NADD]], an opposition alliance that the PDOIS had joined earlier that year, had been registered as a political party, and the Supreme Court of the Gambia ruled that holding dual membership was against the Gambian Constitution. Some criticised the ruling, claiming that it was a move to silence parliamentary opposition as there was nothing in the Constitution that regulated political parties. On 29 September, a by-election was held in Serrekunda Central, in which Sallah was re-elected by a \"huge\" margin.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.africansuccess.org/visuFiche.php?lang=en&id=673|title=Biography of Halifa SALLAH|last=|first=|date=|website=African Success|publisher=|access-date=21 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 November 2005, he was arrested along with two other opposition leaders on the grounds of subversion, accused of having collaborated with the [[President of Senegal]].

As the [[United Democratic Party (Gambia)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP) had boycotted the election, the PDOIS, with two seats, emerged as the largest opposition party, and Sallah became the Minority Leader in the National Assembly. He also served as a member of the [[Pan-African Parliament]] in this period. In June 2005, he was expelled from the National Assembly along with three other opposition MPs on the grounds of dual party membership. [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development|NADD]], an opposition alliance that the PDOIS had joined earlier that year, had been registered as a political party, and the Supreme Court of the Gambia ruled that holding dual membership was against the Gambian Constitution. Some criticised the ruling, claiming that it was a move to silence parliamentary opposition as there was nothing in the Constitution that regulated political parties. On 29 September, a by-election was held in Serrekunda Central, in which Sallah was re-elected by a \"huge\" margin.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.africansuccess.org/visuFiche.php?lang=en&id=673|title=Biography of Halifa SALLAH|last=|first=|date=|website=African Success|publisher=|access-date=21 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 November 2005, he was arrested along with two other opposition leaders on the grounds of subversion, accused of having collaborated with the [[President of Senegal]].

Two options were discussed at the hearing. The commission, in response to intense requests from riders on the line, called for the introduction of express service between Atlantic Avenue and Utica Avenue on tracks which had been unused since the line's opening in 1920. It proposed extending half of 4 trains from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue, running express to Utica Avenue. The introduction of express service would have made it possible to run 30 more trains per hour east of Atlantic Avenue (27 trains per hour had been operating), decreasing overcrowding from 325% to 185%. The plan preferred by the IRT was to place 70 cars on the West Side Line for service to Flatbush Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue and New Lots Avenue, and 40 additional cars for service along Eastern Parkway.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35414638/times-union/|title=I.R.T.

The IRT stated that two minutes would not be enough time to turn around trains terminating at Atlantic Avenue while maintaining the headway between trains and that this service pattern would risk train collisions. Operating this service pattern would have required 2 minutes and 45 seconds to turn around trains, which would reduce capacity by 25%. While operating all 4 trains to Utica Avenue would have obviated the problem, the IRT did not have enough cars to run such a service.

The express was expected to save riders 3.5 minutes.

Two options were discussed at the hearing. The commission, in response to intense requests from riders on the line, called for the introduction of express service between Atlantic Avenue and Utica Avenue on tracks which had been unused since the line's opening in 1920. It proposed extending half of '''4''' trains from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue, running express to Utica Avenue. The introduction of express service would have made it possible to run 30 more trains per hour east of Atlantic Avenue (27 trains per hour had been operating), decreasing overcrowding from 325% to 185%. The plan preferred by the IRT was to place 70 cars on the West Side Line for service to Flatbush Avenue, and Pennsylvania Avenue and New Lots Avenue, and 40 additional cars for service along Eastern Parkway.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/35414638/times-union/|title=I.R.T.

The IRT stated that two minutes would not be enough time to turn around trains terminating at Atlantic Avenue while maintaining the headway between trains and that this service pattern would risk train collisions. Operating this service pattern would have required 2 minutes and 45 seconds to turn around trains, which would reduce capacity by 25%. While operating all '''4''' trains to Utica Avenue would have obviated the problem, the IRT did not have enough cars to run such a service.

Later, while Salva meets with Raquel at a cafe, an orange hair from his clown wig was left on his jacket, which catches the eye of Raquel, finally realising that Salva is the Professor.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = \u00bfQu\u00e9 hemos hecho?\n| AltTitle        = What Have We Done?\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar & Alex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Esther Mart\u00ednez Lobato, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, Pablo Roa, Fernando Sancrist\u00f3bal & David Barrocal\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|9|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 1.53<ref name=\"Premiere\" />\n| ShortSummary    = Realising that Salva is the Professor, Raquel takes him into custody and interrogates him at the villa.

Colonel Prieto, Su\u00e1rez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they identify the Professor as Salva (Sergio), who they believe Raquel is co-operating with due to signals made from local cell towers by calls from the Professor to Raquel.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits \u00c1ngel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would ensure her daughter be taken away from her, she finally tells him. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, despite the Professor's desperate calls for him to come. Berlin insistently continues, and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to the empty hideout. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force and that the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown.

Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to [[Guna Yala]], Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], Argentina, and Denver, M\u00f3nica and her baby to [[Java]], Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio.

In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Mart\u00edn, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andr\u00e9s). The Professor and Mart\u00edn (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on ''[[Aikido]]'', a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage.

Given no other option, the robbers detonate the inner vault door inside the flooded main chamber. It works and grants them access to \"the red boxes\"\u2014cases filled with government secrets that were too dangerous to lock anywhere else. Tamayo's assault begins, taking the robbers and the Professor by surprise. To stall for time and prevent bloodshed, Denver runs into the line of fire with a truce flag carrying two of the red cases, which forces Tamayo to stop. He reveals to Sierra the contents of the cases and that the Professor has the advantage\u2014an attack might force the robbers to make the secrets public. However, Sierra is able to unbalance the Professor and Raquel Murillo (now code-named \"Lisbon\"), with psychological taunting.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels of their [[RV]] sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dal\u00ed masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device.

In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by farmers, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]]. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Meanwhile, Sierra uses Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot, and Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Su\u00e1rez and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn. The Professor hears gunshots over Raquel's microphone, and thinking she is executed, becomes distraught. Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares [[DEFCON]] 2. Tokyo and Rio destroy the approaching armoured car with [[RPG-7]]s. Afterwards, it is revealed that Raquel is alive and in custody, with Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap, that Sierra had ordered Su\u00e1rez to fake an execution to elicit a drastic response, stating that \"the war had begun.\"\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=4|c=#295E6E}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Game Over\n| AltTitle        = Game Over\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra\n| WrittenBy       = Esther Morales, Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The gang rushes to save Nairobi's life, but given the risks surrounding the surgery that they must perform on her, she pleads to be released to the police so that she can get proper care. Meanwhile, the Professor, at first distraught at believing Lisbon to be executed, manages to escape the forest after Marseille lures the police away with a tracker they believe to be the Professor escaping. After an argument between gang members develops about the decision to perform surgery on Nairobi, Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], and leads the surgery with the video aid of a surgeon in Pakistan. The Professor develops a truce with Tamayo for 48 hours to assess Nairobi.

With Tokyo in charge, the ego-centric Palermo is about to walk out of the bank before he is restrained to a chair by the gang. Meanwhile, Lisbon is transported to a police tent outside the bank, where she is interrogated by Sierra. Tokyo calls the Professor, who is furious at her coup, however, Tokyo helps him deduce that the police had staged Lisbon's execution and that she is being interrogated inside the police tent. In flashbacks, Marseille, Bogot\u00e1 and the Professor celebrate Berlin's wedding to Tatiana, but the Professor expresses concern to Berlin about marrying since he has a terminal illness. In the present, the Professor and Marseille break into the apartment of Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, but he jumps out of his window into the pool below.

They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Anto\u00f1anzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to [[Mindanao]], Philippines\u2014where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Anto\u00f1anzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team. In the present, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping.

Gand\u00eda later almost kills Helsinki by hanging as he drops a noose around his neck from the ceiling. Bogot\u00e1 and Tokyo save Helsinki. Before Gand\u00eda retreats to a secret [[panic room]], he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gand\u00eda uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack. Anto\u00f1anzas tells the Professor that Gand\u00eda is communicating with the police from a panic room, and as the Professor relays this information to Tokyo, Gand\u00eda knocks her out from behind.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 minutos antes\n| AltTitle        = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra, \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Denver and Moscow ask the Professor if Juan, Moscow's godchild, can join them in the heist, but the Professor is hesitant. In the present, Gand\u00eda restrains Tokyo in the panic room, and announces on the bank's intercom that he has Tokyo, and that Palermo was the one who aided his escape. In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a [[trans woman]] that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gand\u00eda said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the [[foundry]]\u201443.5 tonnes at that point. While in the freight elevator, Bogot\u00e1 and Nairobi kiss passionately and mentions they should marry after the heist. As Rio and Denver enter an elevator, Gand\u00eda throws a grenade into it just as the doors close, and the two rush to muffle the grenade with their bulletproof vests and helmets; they survive the explosion. As a shootout ensues between Gand\u00eda and all members of the gang, with the exception of the restrained Tokyo and wheelchair-bound Nairobi who remains armed in a bathroom, Gand\u00eda escapes through a duct.

Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office\u2014behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Su\u00e1rez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel.

The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame. Meanwhile, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back, but she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. The Professor then nationally broadcasts a video of himself exposing the illegal detainment of Lisbon inside the police tent outside the bank. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]] takes over Lisbon's custody, and removes her from the tent.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = Plan Par\u00eds\n| AltTitle        = The Paris Plan\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Berlin confronts Palermo about his feelings towards him, while also revealing his own feelings for Palermo. They passionately kiss, however, Berlin says they must part ways and give up the plan because their love would interfere too much. In the present, Sierra admits to several damaging acts to the press, including implicating Colonel Tamayo. At a restaurant, Benjam\u00edn and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Anto\u00f1anzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Anto\u00f1anzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjam\u00edn and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gand\u00eda to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gand\u00eda is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Money Heist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Money Heist|Episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n''[[Money Heist]]'' ({{lang-es|La casa de papel}}, {{trans|The House of Paper}}) is a Spanish television series created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]].

Colonel Prieto, Su\u00e1rez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they identify the Professor as Salva (Sergio), who they believe Raquel is co-operating with due to signals made from local cell towers by calls from the Professor to Raquel. With her gun and badge taken away, she takes \u00c1ngel's [[badge]] and starts to conduct her own investigation by looking through surveillance footage of restaurants to determine the route the Professor had taken from his hideout.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits \u00c1ngel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would ensure her daughter be taken away from her, she finally tells him. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, despite the Professor's desperate calls for him to come. Berlin insistently continues, and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to the empty hideout. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force and that the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown. When Raquel notices coordinates on a postcard previously given to her by the Professor, she tracks him down in [[Palawan]], Philippines, and smiles at him.\n| LineColor       = 594022\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019\u201320)===\n{{Episode table |background=#000000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=15 |director=12 |writer=38 |airdate=25 |airdateR=<ref name=\"TFC\">{{cite web |title=Money Heist \u2013 Listings |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/la-casa-de-papel/listings/ |website=[[The Futon Critic]] |accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref> |aux1T=English title |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode table/part|p=3|c=#000000}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 16\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Hemos vuelto\n| AltTitle        = We're Back\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = \u00c1lex Pina, Javier G\u00f3mez Santander\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Over two years after the heist, Arturo gives a talk to a large crowd condemning the fugitive members of the gang who held him and others hostage at the Mint as \"terrorists\". Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to [[Guna Yala]], Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], Argentina, and Denver, M\u00f3nica and her baby to [[Java]], Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio.

In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Mart\u00edn, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andr\u00e9s). The Professor and Mart\u00edn (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on ''[[Aikido]]'', a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage.

The robbers locate accomplices among the hostages who were previously planted in the Bank and go to work on opening the vault, which is rigged to flood with water once tampered with. Bogot\u00e1, uses his expertise in diving and welding to overcome the lock down, granting access to the gold.

Given no other option, the robbers detonate the inner vault door inside the flooded main chamber. It works and grants them access to \"the red boxes\"\u2014cases filled with government secrets that were too dangerous to lock anywhere else. Tamayo's assault begins, taking the robbers and the Professor by surprise. To stall for time and prevent bloodshed, Denver runs into the line of fire with a truce flag carrying two of the red cases, which forces Tamayo to stop. He reveals to Sierra the contents of the cases and that the Professor has the advantage\u2014an attack might force the robbers to make the secrets public. However, Sierra is able to unbalance the Professor and Raquel Murillo (now code-named \"Lisbon\"), with psychological taunting.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels of their [[RV]] sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

At the exchange, Rio is shocked by the massive crowds gathered in support of the robbers, wearing red jumpsuits and Dal\u00ed masks. The exchange proceeds smoothly and he rejoins the robbers. During the reunion, the police and government intelligence team listen in on their conversations, having planted a listening device inside Rio before releasing him. In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device. The police manage to locate the Professor and Lisbon using a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], forcing them to separate and try to escape on foot; the Professor camouflages himself in a tree, while Lisbon is unable, she takes refuge in a barn.\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 23\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = La deriva\n| AltTitle        = Astray\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Javier G\u00f3mez Santander, \u00c1lex Pina, Almudena Ram\u00edrez-Pantanella, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|19|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Tokyo drinks herself into a semi-[[stupor]] as a result of her breakup and insults Rio. In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by farmers, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]]. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Meanwhile, Sierra uses Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot, and Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Su\u00e1rez and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn. The Professor hears gunshots over Raquel's microphone, and thinking she is executed, becomes distraught. Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares [[DEFCON]] 2. Tokyo and Rio destroy the approaching armoured car with [[RPG-7]]s. Afterwards, it is revealed that Raquel is alive and in custody, with Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap, that Sierra had ordered Su\u00e1rez to fake an execution to elicit a drastic response, stating that \"the war had begun.\"\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|p=4|c=#295E6E}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 9\n| Title           = Game Over\n| AltTitle        = Game Over\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra\n| WrittenBy       = Esther Morales, Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The gang rushes to save Nairobi's life, but given the risks surrounding the surgery that they must perform on her, she pleads to be released to the police so that she can get proper care. Meanwhile, the Professor, at first distraught at believing Lisbon to be executed, manages to escape the forest after Marseille lures the police away with a tracker they believe to be the Professor escaping. After an argument between gang members develops about the decision to perform surgery on Nairobi, Tokyo stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], and leads the surgery with the video aid of a surgeon in Pakistan. The Professor develops a truce with Tamayo for 48 hours to assess Nairobi.

With Tokyo in charge, the ego-centric Palermo is about to walk out of the bank before he is restrained to a chair by the gang. Meanwhile, Lisbon is transported to a police tent outside the bank, where she is interrogated by Sierra. Tokyo calls the Professor, who is furious at her coup, however, Tokyo helps him deduce that the police had staged Lisbon's execution and that she is being interrogated inside the police tent. In flashbacks, Marseille, Bogot\u00e1 and the Professor celebrate Berlin's wedding to Tatiana, but the Professor expresses concern to Berlin about marrying since he has a terminal illness. In the present, the Professor and Marseille break into the apartment of Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, but he jumps out of his window into the pool below.

They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Anto\u00f1anzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to [[Mindanao]], Philippines\u2014where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Anto\u00f1anzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team. In the present, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping.

Gand\u00eda later almost kills Helsinki by hanging as he drops a noose around his neck from the ceiling. Bogot\u00e1 and Tokyo save Helsinki. Before Gand\u00eda retreats to a secret [[panic room]], he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gand\u00eda uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack. Anto\u00f1anzas tells the Professor that Gand\u00eda is communicating with the police from a panic room, and as the Professor relays this information to Tokyo, Gand\u00eda knocks her out from behind.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 minutos antes\n| AltTitle        = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra, \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Denver and Moscow ask the Professor if Juan, Moscow's godchild, can join them in the heist, but the Professor is hesitant. In the present, Gand\u00eda restrains Tokyo in the panic room, and announces on the bank's intercom that he has Tokyo, and that Palermo was the one who aided his escape. In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a [[trans woman]] that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gand\u00eda said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the [[foundry]]\u201443.5 tonnes at that point. While in the freight elevator, Bogot\u00e1 and Nairobi kiss passionately and mentions they should marry after the heist. As Rio and Denver enter an elevator, Gand\u00eda throws a grenade into it just as the doors close, and the two rush to muffle the grenade with their bulletproof vests and helmets; they survive the explosion. As a shootout ensues between Gand\u00eda and all members of the gang, with the exception of the restrained Tokyo and wheelchair-bound Nairobi who remains armed in a bathroom, Gand\u00eda escapes through a duct.

Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office\u2014behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Su\u00e1rez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel.

The Professor tells the gang to drill a hole through to the panic room and inject narcotic gas to incapacitate Gand\u00eda before rescuing Tokyo. The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame.

At a restaurant, Benjam\u00edn and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Anto\u00f1anzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Anto\u00f1anzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjam\u00edn and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gand\u00eda to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gand\u00eda is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Money Heist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Money Heist|Episodes]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4066:11b:5bf9:5817:3d74:a414:c1e8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(A total of 38 episodes have aired, but you guys wrote 31.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Money_Heist_episodes"}

The brothers made [[sacrifice]]s to [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]], each of his own produce, but God favored Abel's sacrifice instead of Cain's. Cain then murdered Abel, whereupon God punished Cain by condemning him to a life of wandering. Cain then dwelt in the [[land of Nod]] ({{hebrew|\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3}}, \"wandering\"), where he built a city and fathered the line of descendants beginning with [[Enoch (son of Cain)|Enoch]].\n\nThe narrative never explicitly states Cain's motive for [[Fratricide|murdering his brother]], nor God's reason for rejecting Cain's sacrifice, nor details on the identity of Cain's wife. Some traditional interpretations consider Cain to be the originator of evil, violence, or greed. According to Genesis, Cain was the first human born and Abel was the first to die.\n\n== Genesis narrative ==\n[[File:Cain leadeth abel to death tissot.jpg|thumb|''Cain leadeth Abel to death'', by [[James Tissot]], c. 1900]]\nThe story of Cain's murder of Abel and its consequences is told in Genesis 4:1\u201318 (''Translation and notes from Robert Alter, \"The Five Books of Moses\"''):{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=29}}\n<blockquote>\n<sup>1</sup>And the human knew Eve his woman and she conceived and bore Cain, and she said, \"I have got me a man with the Lord.\" <sup>2</sup>And she bore as well his brother Abel, and Abel became a herder of sheep while Cain was a tiller of the soil. <sup>3</sup>And it happened in the course of time that Cain brought from the fruit of the soil an offering to the Lord. <sup>4</sup>And Abel too had brought from the choice firstlings of his flock, and the Lord regarded Abel and his offering <sup>5</sup>but did not regard Cain and his offering. And Cain was very incensed, and his face fell. <sup>6</sup>And the Lord said to Cain, \n<blockquote>\"Why are you incensed,<br>and why is your face fallen?<br><sup>7</sup>For whether you offer well, <br>or whether you do not,<br>at the tent flap sin crouches<br>and for you is its longing,<br>but you will rule over it.\"</blockquote>\n<sup>8</sup>And Cain said to Abel his brother, \"Let us go out to the field,\" and when they were in the field Cain rose against Abel his brother and killed him. <sup>9</sup>And the Lord said to Cain, \"Where is Abel your brother? And he said, \"I do not know: am I my brother's keeper?\" <sup>10</sup>And He said, \"What have you done? Listen! your brother's blood cries out to me from the soil. <sup>11</sup>And so, cursed shall you be by the soil that gaped with its mouth to take your brother's blood from your hand. <sup>12</sup>If you till the soil, it will no longer give you strength. A restless wanderer shall you be on the earth.\" <sup>13</sup> And Cain said to the Lord, \"My punishment is too great to bear. <sup>14</sup>Now that You have driven me this day from the soil I must hide from Your presence, I shall be a restless wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will kill me.\" <sup>15</sup>And the Lord said to him, \"Therefore whoever kills Cain shall suffer sevenfold vengeance.\" And the Lord set a mark upon Cain so that whoever found him would not slay him. \n<br><sup>16</sup>And Cain went out from the Lord's presence and dwelled in the land of Nod east of Eden. <sup>17</sup>And Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bore Enoch. Then he became the builder of a city and he called the name of the city like his son's name, Enoch.</blockquote>\n\n=== Translation notes ===\n\n* 4:1 \u2013 The Hebrew verb \"knew\" implies intimate or sexual knowledge, along with possession. The name \"Cain\", which means \"smith\", resembles the verb translated as \"gotten\" but also possibly meaning \"to make\".{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=29}}\n* 4:2 \u2013 Abel's name could be associated with \"vapor\" or \"puff of air\".{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=29}}\n* 4:8 \u2013 \"Let us go out to the field\" does not appear in the [[Masoretic Text]], but is found in other versions including the Septuagint and [[Samaritan Pentateuch]].{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=29}}\n* 4:9 \u2013 the phrase traditionally translated \"am I my brother's keeper?\" is Hebrew ''\"H\u0103-\u0161\u014dm\u00ear \u2019\u0101\u1e25\u00ee \u2019\u0101n\u014d\u1e35\u00ee?\"'' \"Keeper\" is from the verb ''shamar'' (\u05e9\u05de\u05e8), \"guard, keep, watch, preserve.\"\n* 4:10\u201312 \u2013 Cain is cursed ''min-ha-adamah'', from the earth, being the same root as \"man\" and Adam.\n\n== Origins ==\n\n[[File:Bouguereau-The First Mourning-1888.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The First Mourning]]'' (Adam and Eve mourn the death of Abel); oil on canvas 1888 painting by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]]]\nCain and Abel are traditional [[transliteration|English]] [[Romanization of Hebrew|renderings]] of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names. It has been proposed that the etymology of their names may be a direct pun on the roles they take in the Genesis narrative. ''Abel'' is thought to derive from a reconstructed word meaning \"herdsman\", with the modern [[Arabic]] [[cognate]] ''ibil'' now specifically referring only to \"camels\". ''Cain'' is thought to be cognate to the mid-1st millennium BCE [[Yemen|South Arabian]] word ''qyn'', meaning \"[[metalsmith]]\". This theory would make the names descriptive of their roles, where Abel works with [[livestock]], and Cain with [[agriculture]]\u2014and would parallel the names Adam (\"man,\" {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd}}) and Eve (\"life-giver,\" {{Hebrew|\u05d7\u05d5\u05d4}} ''Chavah'').{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe oldest known copy of the biblical narrative is from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], and dates to the first century BCE. Cain and Abel also appear in a number of other texts, and the story is the subject of various interpretations. Abel, the first murder victim, is sometimes seen as the first [[martyr]]; while Cain, the first murderer, is sometimes seen as an ancestor of [[evil]].

This reading is evidenced by given human qualities, like a mouth, in the scripture. The ground is also the only subject of an active verb in the verse that states, \"It opens its mouth to take the blood.\" This suggests that the ground reacted to the situation. By that logic, the ground could then potentially be an accomplice to the murder of Abel (Jordstad 708).\n\nThe reaction from the ground raises the question, \"does the intimate connection between humans and the ground mean that the ground mirrors or aids human action, regardless of the nature of that action?\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mari J\u00f8rstad|date=2016|title=The Ground That Opened Its Mouth: The Ground's Response to Human Violence in Genesis 4|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=135|issue=4|page=705|doi=10.15699/jbl.1354.2016.3010}}</ref>\n\n==== Other stories ====\n\nIn [[Jewish tradition]], [[Philo]], [[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]] and the ''[[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]'' asserted that Adam was not the father of Cain.

Cain died at the age of 730, leaving his corrupt descendants spreading evil on earth.<ref>''Pseudo-Philo (Biblical Antiquities of Philo)'', chapter 1</ref> According to the [[Book of Jubilees]], Cain murdered his brother with a stone. Afterwards, Cain was killed by the same instrument he used against his brother; his house fell on him and he was killed by its stones.<ref>Jubilees 4:31</ref> A heavenly law was cited after the narrative of Cain's death saying:\n\n<blockquote>With the instrument with which a man kills his neighbour with the same shall he be killed; after the manner that he wounded him, in like manner shall they deal with him.<ref>Jubilees 4:32</ref></blockquote>\n\nA Talmudic tradition says that after Cain had murdered his brother, God made a horn grow on his head.

Some scholars believed that Cain's motives were plain jealousy and lust. Both Cain and Abel desired to marry Adam's beautiful daughter, [[Aclima]] (''Aqlimia{{'}}'' in Arabic). Seeking to end the dispute between them, Adam suggested that each present an offering before God. The one whose offering God accepted would marry Aclima. Abel, a generous shepherd, offered the fattest of his sheep as an oblation to God. But Cain, a miserly farmer, offered only a bunch of grass and some worthless seeds to him. God accepted Abel's offering and rejected Cain's\u2014an indication that Abel was more righteous than Cain, and thus worthier of Aclima. As a result, it was decided that Abel would marry Aclima. Cain, on the other hand, would marry her less beautiful sister.

After the murder, the devil hurried to [[Eve]] shouting: \"Eve! Cain has murdered Abel!\". Eve did not know what murder was or how death felt like. She asked, bewildered and horrified, \"Woe to you! What is murder?\". \"He [Abel] does not eat. He does not drink. He does not move [That's what murder and death are]\", answered the Devil. Eve burst out into tears and started to wail madly.

This was originated by the popular fantasy of interpreting the [[man in the Moon|shadows on the Moon as a face]]. An example of this belief can be found in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' (XX, 126<ref name=\"Inferno126\">[[Dante]], [[The Divine Comedy]], [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], canto 20, [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&cmd=Search&commentary%5B%5D=0&language=any&cantica=1&canto=20&line=126 line 126] and [http://dante.dartmouth.edu/search_view.php?query=&cmd=Search&commentary%5B%5D=0&language=any&cantica=1&canto=20&line=127 127].

It shows us how brothers can become mortal enemies through the very fact that they worship the same God in the same way. According to the author, the source of religious wars is revealed. It is not the difference in dogma or ritual which is the cause, but the \"pretention to equality\" or \"the negation of hierarchy\".<ref name=\"Meditations on the Tarot\">Anonymous, ''Meditations on the Tarot: A journey into Christian Hermeticism'', translated by Robert Powell 1985, 2002 ed, pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nIn [[Latter-day Saint theology]], Cain is considered to be the quintessential [[Son of perdition (Mormonism)|Son of Perdition]], the father of ''[[Secret combination (Latter Day Saints)|secret combination]]s'' (i.e. secret societies and [[organized crime]]), as well as the first to hold the title [[Master Mahan]] meaning ''master of [the] great secret, that [he] may murder and get gain''.<ref>Moses 5:31</ref>\n\nIn [[Mormon folklore]]\u2014a second-hand account relates that an early Mormon leader, [[David W.

The brothers made [[sacrifice]]s to [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]], each of his own produce, but God favored Abel's sacrifice instead of Cain's. Cain then murdered Abel, whereupon God punished Cain by condemning him to a life of wandering. Cain then dwelt in the [[land of Nod]] ({{hebrew|\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05d3}}, \"wandering\"), where he built a city and fathered the line of descendants beginning with [[Enoch (son of Cain)|Enoch]].\n\nThe narrative never explicitly states Cain's motive for [[Fratricide|murdering his brother]], nor God's reason for rejecting Cain's sacrifice, nor details on the identity of Cain's wife. Some traditional interpretations consider Cain to be the originator of evil, violence, or greed. According to Genesis, Cain was the first human born and Abel was the first to die.\n\n== Genesis narrative ==\n[[File:Cain leadeth abel to death tissot.jpg|thumb|''Cain leadeth Abel to death'', by [[James Tissot]], c. 1900]]\nThe story of Cain's murder of Abel and its consequences is told in Genesis 4:1\u201318 (''Translation and notes from Robert Alter, \"The Five Books of Moses\"''):{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=29}}\n<blockquote>\n<sup>1</sup>And the human knew Eve his woman and she conceived and bore Cain, and she said, \"I have got me a man with the Lord.\" <sup>2</sup>And she bore as well his brother Abel, and Abel became a herder of sheep while Cain was a tiller of the soil. <sup>3</sup>And it happened in the course of time that Cain brought from the fruit of the soil an offering to the Lord. <sup>4</sup>And Abel too had brought from the choice firstlings of his flock, and the Lord regarded Abel and his offering <sup>5</sup>but did not regard Cain and his offering. And Cain was very incensed, and his face fell. <sup>6</sup>And the Lord said to Cain, \n<blockquote>\"Why are you incensed,<br>and why is your face fallen?<br><sup>7</sup>For whether you offer well, <br>or whether you do not,<br>at the tent flap sin crouches<br>and for you is its longing,<br>but you will rule over it.\"</blockquote>\n<sup>8</sup>And Cain said to Abel his brother, \"Let us go out to the field,\" and when they were in the field Cain rose against Abel his brother and killed him. <sup>9</sup>And the Lord said to Cain, \"Where is Abel your brother? And he said, \"I do not know: am I my brother's keeper?\" <sup>10</sup>And He said, \"What have you done? Listen! your brother's blood cries out to me from the soil. <sup>11</sup>And so, cursed shall you be by the soil that gaped with its mouth to take your brother's blood from your hand. <sup>12</sup>If you till the soil, it will no longer give you strength. A restless wanderer shall you be on the earth.\" <sup>13</sup> And Cain said to the Lord, \"My punishment is too great to bear. <sup>14</sup>Now that You have driven me this day from the soil I must hide from Your presence, I shall be a restless wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will kill me.\" <sup>15</sup>And the Lord said to him, \"Therefore whoever kills Cain shall suffer sevenfold vengeance.\" And the Lord set a mark upon Cain so that whoever found him would not slay him. \n<br><sup>16</sup>And Cain went out from the Lord's presence and dwelled in the land of Nod east of Eden. <sup>17</sup>And Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bore Enoch. Then he became the builder of a city and he called the name of the city like his son's name, Enoch.</blockquote>\n\n=== Translation notes ===\n\n* 4:1 \u2013 The Hebrew verb \"knew\" implies intimate or sexual knowledge, along with possession. The name \"Cain\", which means \"smith\", resembles the verb translated as \"gotten\" but also possibly meaning \"to make\".{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=29}}\n* 4:2 \u2013 Abel's name could be associated with \"vapor\" or \"puff of air\".{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=29}}\n* 4:8 \u2013 \"Let us go out to the field\" does not appear in the [[Masoretic Text]], but is found in other versions including the Septuagint and [[Samaritan Pentateuch]].{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=29}}\n* 4:9 \u2013 the phrase traditionally translated \"am I my brother's keeper?\" is Hebrew ''\"H\u0103-\u0161\u014dm\u00ear \u2019\u0101\u1e25\u00ee \u2019\u0101n\u014d\u1e35\u00ee?\"'' \"Keeper\" is from the verb ''shamar'' (\u05e9\u05de\u05e8), \"guard, keep, watch, preserve.\"\n* 4:10\u201312 \u2013 Cain is cursed ''min-ha-adamah'', from the earth, being the same root as \"man\" and Adam.\n\n== Origins ==\n\n[[File:Bouguereau-The First Mourning-1888.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The First Mourning]]'' (Adam and Eve mourn the death of Abel); oil on canvas 1888 painting by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]]]\nCain and Abel are traditional [[transliteration|English]] [[Romanization of Hebrew|renderings]] of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] names. It has been proposed that the etymology of their names may be a direct pun on the roles they take in the Genesis narrative. ''Abel'' is thought to derive from a reconstructed word meaning \"herdsman\", with the modern [[Arabic]] [[cognate]] ''ibil'' now specifically referring only to \"camels\". ''Cain'' is thought to be cognate to the mid-1st millennium BCE [[Yemen|South Arabian]] word ''qyn'', meaning \"[[metalsmith]]\". This theory would make the names descriptive of their roles, where Abel works with [[livestock]], and Cain with [[agriculture]]\u2014and would parallel the names Adam (\"man,\" {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd}}) and Eve (\"life-giver,\" {{Hebrew|\u05d7\u05d5\u05d4}} ''Chavah'').{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe oldest known copy of the biblical narrative is from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], and dates to the first century BCE. Cain and Abel also appear in a number of other texts, and the story is the subject of various interpretations. Abel, the first murder victim, is sometimes seen as the first [[martyr]]; while Cain, the first murderer, is sometimes seen as an ancestor of [[evil]]. Some scholars suggest the [[pericope]] may have been based on a [[Sumer]]ian story representing the conflict between nomadic shepherds and settled farmers. Modern scholars typically view the stories of [[Adam and Eve]] and Cain and Abel to be about the development of civilization during the age of agriculture; not the beginnings of man, but when people first learned [[agriculture]], replacing the ways of the [[hunter-gatherer]].{{sfn|Kugel|1998|pp=54\u201357}}\n\nCain and Abel are likely symbolic rather than real.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=2}} Like almost all of the persons, places and stories in the [[Primeval history]] (the first eleven chapters of Genesis), they are mentioned nowhere else in the [[Hebrew Bible]], a fact that suggests that the History is a late composition attached to Genesis to serve as an introduction.{{sfn|Sailhamer|2010|p=301}} Just how late is a matter for dispute: the history may be as late as the [[Hellenistic period]] (first decades of the 4th century BCE),{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|pp=240\u201341}} but the high level of Babylonian myth behind its stories has led others to date it to the [[Babylonian exile]] (6th century BCE).{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=6}}{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|pp=53\u201354}} A prominent Mesopotamian parallel to Cain and Abel is the [[Sumer]]ian myth of the ''[[Inanna#Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzid|Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzid]]'',{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=6}}{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|pp=53\u201354}}{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=101}} in which the shepherd [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] and the farmer [[Enkimdu]] compete for the affection of the goddess [[Inanna]],{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=101\u201303}} with Dumuzid (the shepherd) winning out.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=103}} Another parallel is ''[[Enlil#Enlil Chooses the Farmer-God|Enlil Chooses the Farmer-God]]'',{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=49}} in which the shepherd-god [[Emesh]] and the farmer-god [[Enten]] bring their dispute over which of them is better to the chief god [[Enlil]],{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=50\u201351}} who rules in favor of Enten (the farmer).{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=51}}\n\n== Jewish and Christian interpretations ==\n\nOne question arising early in the story is why God rejected Cain's sacrifice, since Cain never received instructions about how to sacrifice correctly, nor had he done anything wrong, and why God then admonishes Cain with a warning about sin.

With the earth left cursed to drink Abel's blood, Cain was no longer able to farm the land. Cain is punished as a \"fugitive and wanderer\".

''[http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf The Legends of the Jews Vol I: The Ten Generations \u2013 The Birth of Cain]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.</ref>\nAccording to the ''[[Life of Adam and Eve]]'', Cain fetched his mother a reed (''[[wikt:\u05e7\u05e0\u05d4#Etymology 2|qaneh]]'') which is how he received his name ''Qayin'' (Cain). The symbolism of him fetching a reed may be a nod to his occupation as a farmer, as well as a commentary to his destructive nature. He is also described as \"lustrous\", which may reflect the Gnostic association of Cain with the [[sun]].{{sfn|Byron|2011|pp=15, 16: L.A.E. (''Vita'') 21:3, Trans. by Johnson}}\n\n==== Characteristics ====\n\nCain is described as a city-builder,<ref>{{Bibleref2|Genesis|4:17}}</ref> and the forefather of tent-dwelling pastoralists, all lyre and pipe players, and bronze and iron smiths.<ref>{{Bibleref2 |Genesis|4:19\u201322}}</ref>\n\nIn an alternate translation of Genesis 4:17, endorsed by a minority of modern commentators, Cain's son Enoch builds a city and names it after ''his'' son, [[Irad]]. Such a city could correspond with [[Eridu]], one of the most ancient cities known.<ref>Byron 2011, pp. 124\u201325.</ref> [[Philo]] observes that it makes no sense for Cain, the third human on Earth, to have founded an actual city. Instead, he argues, the city symbolizes an unrighteous philosophy.<ref>[[Philo]], ''[http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book8.html Posterity of Cain]'' lines 49\u201358 (from ''Works of Philo Judaeus'', [https://archive.org/details/worksphilojudaeu01philuoft Vol. 1]); quoted in Byron 2011, pp. 127\u201328.</ref>\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], Cain is cited as an example of unrighteousness in {{Bibleref2|1 John|3:12}} and {{Bibleref2 |Jude|1:11}}. The [[Targumim]], rabbinic sources, and later speculations supplemented background details for the daughters of [[Adam and Eve]].{{sfn|Luttikhuizen|2003|p=vii}} Such [[exegesis]] of Genesis 4 introduced Cain's wife as being his sister, a concept that has been accepted for at least 1,800 years.{{sfn|Byron|2011|p=2}} This can be seen with [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] 4 which narrates that Cain settled down and married his sister [[Awan (religious figure)|Awan]], who bore his first son, the first [[Enoch (son of Cain)|Enoch]], approximately 196 years after the creation of [[Adam]]. Cain then establishes the first city, naming it after his son, builds a house, and lives there until it collapses on him, killing him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3904-cain |title=Cain |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=2014-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==== Relationship with the ground ====\n\n{{Weasel|section|date=December 2018}}\nSpeculation exists that the ground could play a more significant role in relation to early stories of [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]], like [[Adam]], [[Noah]], and Cain.\n\nIn this alternative reading of the text, the ground could be personified as a character. This reading is evidenced by given human qualities, like a mouth, in the scripture.

Some scholars believed that Cain's motives were plain jealousy and lust. Both Cain and Abel desired to marry Adam's beautiful daughter, [[Aclima]] (''Aqlimia{{'}}'' in Arabic). Seeking to end the dispute between them, Adam suggested that each present an offering before God. The one whose offering God accepted would marry Aclima. Abel, a generous shepherd, offered the fattest of his sheep as an oblation to God. But Cain, a miserly farmer, offered only a bunch of grass and some worthless seeds to him. God accepted Abel's offering and rejected Cain's\u2014an indication that Abel was more righteous than Cain, and thus worthier of Aclima. As a result, it was decided that Abel would marry Aclima. Cain, on the other hand, would marry her less beautiful sister.

After the murder, the devil hurried to [[Eve]] shouting: \"Eve! Cain has murdered Abel!\". Eve did not know what murder was or how death felt like. She asked, bewildered and horrified, \"Woe to you! What is murder?\". \"He [Abel] does not eat. He does not drink. He does not move [That's what murder and death are]\", answered the Devil. Eve burst out into tears and started to wail madly.

In the films, Banner is a renowned [[physicist]] who subjected himself to a [[gamma radiation]] experiment designed to replicate a [[World War II]]-era \"super soldier\" program. The experiment failed, and now causes Banner to transform into a green, hulking and gigantic creature, with super-human strength and durability, whenever his [[heart rate]] goes above 200 bpm or if he is placed in mortal danger. The character is one of the central [[protagonist]]s of the MCU, having appeared in eight films of the series and is depicted as one of the most powerful members of the Avengers.\n\nThe Hulk is incredibly strong and throughout most of the films he acts largely on the instinct of self-preservation, attacking anything that he perceives as a threat. Over time, Banner demonstrated an increasing ability to control the transformation, calling the Hulk at will, but was generally not able to recall events during the time he was in that form.

Producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who had played Banner in the 1978 TV series.<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered [[Lou Ferrigno]] the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word.

Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo noted that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name=\"RuffaloApril2015\" /> and reiterated this in October 2015,<ref name=\"RuffaloUSAToday\" /> and July 2017.<ref name=\"RuffaloJuly2017\" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name=\"THRJulyl2015\" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooDec2015\" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, \"We've worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will \u2013 when it\u2019s all added up \u2013 will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" />\n\n=== Characterization ===\nFor ''The Incredible Hulk'', Louis Leterrier stated that Edward Norton's rewrite of the script \"has given Bruce's story real gravitas\", explaining that \"just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]]\".<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> In taking up the character for ''The Avengers'', Mark Ruffalo said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself\u2014the dark and the light\u2014and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities\".<ref name=\"EW1\" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\"<ref name=\"Kimmel\" />\n\nBy ''Age of Ultron'', Ruffalo stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was \"a bit more complex\",<ref name=\"Ruffalo2\" /> with a confrontation brewing between Banner and the Hulk: \"There's a very cool thing happening: Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk.. and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other.\"<ref name=\"Ruffalo3\" /> While filming in [[London]], Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulk's lines.<ref name=\"IGNHulkOct2014\" /> Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulk's dialogue spontaneously, saying, \"What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that you're pretending he's a werewolf when he's a superhero. You want it vice versa... So the question is, how has he progressed? How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does? And that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment.\"<ref name=\"WhedonDec2014\" /> When the character next appears in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', two years have passed since ''Age of Ultron'', and Hulk has become a successful and popular gladiator on Sakaar,<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /><ref name=\"RuffaloTR\" /> having suppressed the Banner side in those years. He is forming the vocabulary \"of a toddler\",<ref name=\"EWSDCC2017\" /> with the level of Hulk's speech being \"a big conversation\" between director Taika Waititi and Marvel since it was taking into account future appearances for the character:<ref name=\"WaititiHulk\" /> ''Ragnarok'' begins an arc for the character that continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"RuffaloHulkArc\" /> Ruffalo felt Hulk had \"a swagger\" in the film, and was \"much more of a character than the green rage machine\" seen in the first two ''Avengers'' films.<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" />\n\nThe Hulk only appears briefly at the beginning of ''Infinity War'', with Bruce Banner spending the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers, and to \"impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is\".<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that \"Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass.\" Russo added that this was \"really reflective of the journey from ''Ragnarok''... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control.\"<ref name=\"RussoHulkScared\" /> The difference between Hulk and Banner is intended to be shown as \"starting to blur a little bit\". Ruffalo described Hulk in ''Infinity War'' as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Despite the lack of further standalone films, \"Bruce and the Hulk have managed to eke out a character arc in the six years since ''The Avengers''\", with ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Infinity War'' highlighting an ongoing battle for control of which persona will manifest, expected to be resolved in ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"ScreenRantHulkArc\" /> In ''Avengers: Endgame'', the Bruce Banner and the Hulk personalities are shown to have reconciled and merged into Professor Hulk, who has the strength of the Hulk but the intelligence of Bruce Banner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/27/avengers-endgame-hulk/|title= Avengers: Endgame explained: The Hulk's closing scene |work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 27, 2019|accessdate=May 1, 2019|first=Anthony|last=Breznican}}</ref><ref name=\"Gizmodo\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/professor-hulk-is-avengers-endgames-gift-to-bruce-bann-1834481486|title=Professor Hulk Is Avengers: Endgame's Gift to Bruce Banner|first=Charles|last=Pulliam-Moore|website=io9|date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Appearance and special effects ===\nIn filming ''The Incredible Hulk'', Leterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard for which he was aiming.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effect company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" />\n\n''The Avengers'' was the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".<ref name=\"NYMag\" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name=\"CastRuffalo1\" /> To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> ILM returned to create the digital Hulk. [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nFor ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ILM had to add much more detail to the character's facial features, due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM \"built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics.\"<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Trivia\" /> Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stunt men would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from ''The Dark World'', resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Taika Waititi also provided additional motion capture for the Hulk after Ruffalo had completed his scenes.<ref name=\"WaititiColliderSep2017\" />\n\nWith respect to Bruce Banner's regular appearance, his fashion sense has been critiqued with the observation that \"in just about every appearance, he's wearing a nondescript suit with a purple button down shirt\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> By contrast, Banner's \"Professor Hulk\" appearance in ''Avengers: Endgame'', including his penchant for knit sweaters, has been described as \"hot\" and \"sexy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/46078093|title=Uh, So, There Are a Lot of People Who Think the Hulk Is Hot Now After Seeing Avengers: Endgame|first=Quinn|last=Keaney|date=May 2, 2019|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n== Marvel Cinematic Universe ==\n=== Feature films ===\n{{Main|The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Thor: Ragnarok|Avengers: Infinity War|Captain Marvel (film)|Avengers: Endgame}}\n* [[Edward Norton]] portrays Bruce Banner in ''The Incredible Hulk'' (2008),<ref>{{cite news|date=August 15, 2007 |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez |title=Signing on to a writing co-op |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et-scriptland15/ |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |page=[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et\u2013scriptland15/2 2] |archivedate=March 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313231243/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et-scriptland15 |url-status=live  }}</ref> with [[Lou Ferrigno]] providing the voice of the Hulk.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 12, 2008 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=''The Incredible Hulk'' (PG-13) |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080612/REVIEWS/848151866 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |archivedate=June 15, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615030724/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080612%2FREVIEWS%2F848151866 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Norton did not return to the role in ''The Avengers'' (2012),<ref>{{cite web|date=July 10, 2010 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/exclusive-marvel-confirms-they-will-hire-new-hulk-for-avengers |title=Exclusive: Marvel confirms they will hire new Hulk for ''The Avengers'' |first=Drew |last=McWeeny |publisher=[[HitFix]] |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712072541/http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/2008-12-6-motion-captured/posts/exclusive-marvel-confirms-they-will-hire-new-hulk-for-avengers |archivedate=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> being replaced by [[Mark Ruffalo]].<ref name=\"RuffaloAvengers\">{{cite web|date=July 23, 2010 |authorlink=Nikki Finke |last=Finke |first=Nikki |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/toldja-marvel-ruffalo-reach-hulk-deal |title=Toldja!

At Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] meets with Dr. Bruce Banner, the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment \u2014 part of a [[World War II]] era \"super soldier\" program that Ross hopes to recreate \u2014 fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200. The Hulk destroys the lab and injures or kills the people inside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.\n\nFive years later,{{efn|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed. The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).}} Banner works at a soda bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the Internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as \"Mr. Blue\", and to whom he is \"Mr. Green\". He also learns [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Ross tracks down Banner, sending a special forces team, led by Russian-born British [[Royal Marine]] [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, but is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, again transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue\u2014cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]\u2014has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. Banner is caught and Blonsky has Stern use Banner's blood to turn him into the Abomination. Blonsky then rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that only the Hulk can stop Blonsky, Banner jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky and flees. Banner soon ends his relationship with Betty, realizing it can no longer work. A month later, in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]], Banner successfully transforms in a controlled manner. Meanwhile, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him [[The Avengers (2012 film)|a team]] is being put together.\n\n=== Joining the Avengers ===\nSeveral months later, in response to an attack by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\", and agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit Banner to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Loki is captured and placed in a cell on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Helicarrier]], but agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, with Hulk falling to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. When the Avengers regroup in New York City, Banner arrives to join the team to battle a Chitauri invasion. Banner reveals he is \"always angry\", and transforms into the Hulk, fights the Chitauri, beats Loki into submission, and saves Stark from crashing into the ground. Banner later forms a close friendship with Stark and works with him closely, even requesting him to build an anti-Hulk armor to stop him in case he loses control and goes on a rampage.\n\nSome years later, the Avengers recover Loki's scepter, and Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron]]\" global defense program. Ultron becomes sentient and recruits the Maximoffs, with [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using haunting visions to cause the Hulk to rampage until Stark stops him with his [[Iron Man's armor|anti-Hulk armor]]<!-- Please note the term \"Hulkbuster\" is not used in the film -->.{{ref|1|1}} The team then travels to a safehouse, where Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and persuades Romanoff and other team members to form a plan to stop Ultron, resulting in Romanoff being captured and taken to Sokovia. Banner finds her there, but she causes him to transform into the Hulk, in order to fight Ultron. After a final battle defeating Ultron in Sokovia, the Hulk departs in a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]] and eventually arrives at the planet Sakaar, where he is abducted by the ruler Grandmaster and eventually becomes  his champion and top-fighter in the Contest of Champions.\n\n=== Travels with Thor ===\nTwo years later, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] crash-lands on Sakaar and is forced to fight Hulk in the Contest of Champions. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard, and then escapes the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of Romanoff makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia where Banner is shocked to learn that he is on an alien planet. Banner expresses fear that if he becomes the Hulk again, he will never be able to return to his human form. Escaping Sakaar, they travel to Asgard, where Banner becomes Hulk again to save the fleeing Asgardians from the giant wolf, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]], while Thor challenges his sister, Hela. As Asgard is destroyed, the Hulk, remaining in that form, accompanies Thor and the Asgardians on a ship bound for Earth.\n\n=== The Infinity War ===\nThanos and his minions intercept the ship to extract the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Space Stone]] from the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. Hulk fights Thanos, but is easily overpowered. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] uses the [[Bifr\u00f6st]] to send Hulk to Earth, and Hulk crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] of [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] and his majordomo [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in New York City, and reverts to Bruce Banner. Banner warns Strange about Thanos, and contacts the other Avengers. When minions of Thanos appear in New York to attack Doctor Strange in pursuit of the Time Stone, Banner tries to become the Hulk, but Hulk refuses to \"come out\", forcing Banner out of the action.\n\nBanner and the other Avengers travel to Wakanda, where he uses Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor|anti-Hulk]] armor to battle the invading army of Thanos, until Thanos himself arrives to retrieve the final Infinity Stone, battling the Avengers and trapping Banner, in Stark's armor, in rock. Thanos activates the Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away, as his plan comes to fruition: people begin disintegrating, while Banner and the other Avengers remain on the Wakandan battlefield.\n\nFollowing his struggles with his Hulk side in ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Banner realizes that the Hulk is not a problem to solve, but the solution. During the five years following ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Banner undergoes gamma experimentation to balance his two sides. He is now permanently in the body of the Hulk but with the mind and voice of Banner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/avengers-endgame-hulk-banner-comics/|title=What's Up with Banner and Hulk in Avengers: Endgame?|first1=Rosie|last1=Knight|work=[[Nerdist]]|date=April 25, 2019|accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref> When the Avengers travel through time to obtain the Infinity Stones, Banner gets the Time Stone from the [[Ancient One]] (to whom he promises to return the Stones to their respective periods in time when the Avengers are done with their mission) in 2012. He then returns to the present along with the others, and is devastated with Natasha Romanoff's death (she had sacrificed herself so that Clint Barton could earn the Soul Stone). After combining the stones with the Iron Gauntlet, Banner, because of his strength, volunteers to activate the Infinity Stones. He does so and reverses the deaths caused by Thanos at the end of ''Infinity War'', though his right arm gets permanently injured in the process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/joe-russo-confirms-hulk-arm-injury/ |title=Avengers Co-Director Confirms Hulk's Post-Endgame Status |date=May 6, 2019 |website=Comic Book Resources |access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref> Banner then takes part in the climactic battle against a 2014 version of Thanos and his forces, who are eventually defeated when Tony Stark uses the Infinity Stones, at the cost of his own life. He later attends Stark's funeral along with others. After, he prepares the time machine so that [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] can return the time-displaced Stones and Mjolnir back to the periods they were found.\n\n== Differences from the comic books ==\nCharles Pulliam-Moore , writing for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', said of the earlier MCU films that \"[w]hile there are a number of storylines from Marvel's comics that delve deeper into the duality of Banner/Hulk's identity... Marvel's movies have forgone those plot lines in favor of trotting Bruce out to babble about science and break things when necessary\".<ref name=\"Gizmodo\" /> One specific difference from the comic books is Banner's involvement in the creation of [[Ultron]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron. The Vision, in the films, is created as a counter to Ultron, who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, Hank Pym.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of freestanding films about the Hulk, the character has been depicted in very few of the storylines shown in the comic books. In particular, the \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" storyline from the comic books is highly condensed and worked into ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''; the comic book storyline has the heroes of Earth intentionally sending the Hulk into space due to his excessively dangerous nature,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #88-91 (Dec 2005-Mar 2006)</ref> while the MCU Hulk leaves Earth of his own accord. The merged Banner/Hulk storyline depicted in ''Avengers: Endgame'' also differs from the comics, where a comparable merger was accomplished by hypnosis performed by superhero psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]].<ref name=\"NewsAramaPg9\">{{cite web|title=Duo Dynamics: The Many Incarnations of HULK-BANNER Bond?

Reviewing ''The Incredible Hulk'', Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> Conversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" />\n\nMark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk in ''The Avengers'' was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"<ref name=\"nydaily2012\" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights\u2014alongside Downey.<ref name=\"newyorker2012\" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"<ref name=\"villagevoice\" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,<ref name=\"rollz\" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses)\".<ref name=\"EW-review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

(arts)|character]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) [[film franchise]] initially portrayed by [[Edward Norton]] and subsequently by [[Mark Ruffalo]]\u2014based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Hulk|character of the same name]]\u2014known commonly by his [[alter ego]], the '''Hulk'''. In the films, Banner is a renowned [[physicist]] who subjected himself to a [[gamma radiation]] experiment designed to replicate a [[World War II]]-era \"super soldier\" program. The experiment failed, and now causes Banner to transform into a green, hulking and gigantic creature, with super-human strength and durability, whenever his [[heart rate]] goes above 200 bpm or if he is placed in mortal danger. The character is one of the central [[protagonist]]s of the MCU, having appeared in eight films of the series and is depicted as one of the most powerful members of the Avengers.\n\nThe Hulk is incredibly strong and throughout most of the films he acts largely on the instinct of self-preservation, attacking anything that he perceives as a threat. Over time, Banner demonstrated an increasing ability to control the transformation, calling the Hulk at will, but was generally not able to recall events during the time he was in that form. The Hulk, conversely, became increasingly aware of Banner and able to stall the transformation back \u2013 one time staying in Hulk form for two years, becoming able to speak with others and control his destructive rage. Eventually, Banner was able to merge with the Hulk, combining Banner's mind and personality with the Hulk's body and strength.\n\n== Concept, creation, and characterization ==\nThe Hulk first appeared as a comic book character in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1962), written by [[Stan Lee]], [[penciller|penciled]] and co-plotted by [[Jack Kirby]],<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 85|isbn =978-0-7566-4123-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage|title=Hulk makes a monster out of gamma rays|publisher=BBC|first= Quentin|last= Cooper|date=May 11, 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161013022820/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage|archivedate= October 13, 2016|url-status= live|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and [[inker|inked]] by [[Paul Reinman]].

Producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who had played Banner in the 1978 TV series.<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered [[Lou Ferrigno]] the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word.

Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo noted that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name=\"RuffaloApril2015\" /> and reiterated this in October 2015,<ref name=\"RuffaloUSAToday\" /> and July 2017.<ref name=\"RuffaloJuly2017\" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name=\"THRJulyl2015\" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooDec2015\" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, \"We've worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will \u2013 when it\u2019s all added up \u2013 will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" />\n\n=== Characterization ===\nFor ''The Incredible Hulk'', Louis Leterrier stated that Edward Norton's rewrite of the script \"has given Bruce's story real gravitas\", explaining that \"just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]]\".<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> In taking up the character for ''The Avengers'', Mark Ruffalo said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself\u2014the dark and the light\u2014and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities\".<ref name=\"EW1\" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\"<ref name=\"Kimmel\" />\n\nBy ''Age of Ultron'', Ruffalo stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was \"a bit more complex\",<ref name=\"Ruffalo2\" /> with a confrontation brewing between Banner and the Hulk: \"There's a very cool thing happening: Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk.. and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other.\"<ref name=\"Ruffalo3\" /> While filming in [[London]], Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulk's lines.<ref name=\"IGNHulkOct2014\" /> Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulk's dialogue spontaneously, saying, \"What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that you're pretending he's a werewolf when he's a superhero. You want it vice versa... So the question is, how has he progressed? How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does? And that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment.\"<ref name=\"WhedonDec2014\" /> When the character next appears in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', two years have passed since ''Age of Ultron'', and Hulk has become a successful and popular gladiator on Sakaar,<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /><ref name=\"RuffaloTR\" /> having suppressed the Banner side in those years. He is forming the vocabulary \"of a toddler\",<ref name=\"EWSDCC2017\" /> with the level of Hulk's speech being \"a big conversation\" between director Taika Waititi and Marvel since it was taking into account future appearances for the character:<ref name=\"WaititiHulk\" /> ''Ragnarok'' begins an arc for the character that continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"RuffaloHulkArc\" /> Ruffalo felt Hulk had \"a swagger\" in the film, and was \"much more of a character than the green rage machine\" seen in the first two ''Avengers'' films.<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" />\n\nThe Hulk only appears briefly at the beginning of ''Infinity War'', with Bruce Banner spending the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers, and to \"impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is\".<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that \"Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass.\" Russo added that this was \"really reflective of the journey from ''Ragnarok''... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control.\"<ref name=\"RussoHulkScared\" /> The difference between Hulk and Banner is intended to be shown as \"starting to blur a little bit\". Ruffalo described Hulk in ''Infinity War'' as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Despite the lack of further standalone films, \"Bruce and the Hulk have managed to eke out a character arc in the six years since ''The Avengers''\", with ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Infinity War'' highlighting an ongoing battle for control of which persona will manifest, expected to be resolved in ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"ScreenRantHulkArc\" /> In ''Avengers: Endgame'', the Bruce Banner and the Hulk personalities are shown to have reconciled and merged into Professor Hulk, who has the strength of the Hulk but the intelligence of Bruce Banner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/27/avengers-endgame-hulk/|title= Avengers: Endgame explained: The Hulk's closing scene |work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 27, 2019|accessdate=May 1, 2019|first=Anthony|last=Breznican}}</ref><ref name=\"Gizmodo\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/professor-hulk-is-avengers-endgames-gift-to-bruce-bann-1834481486|title=Professor Hulk Is Avengers: Endgame's Gift to Bruce Banner|first=Charles|last=Pulliam-Moore|website=io9|date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Appearance and special effects ===\nIn filming ''The Incredible Hulk'', Leterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard for which he was aiming.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effect company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" />\n\n''The Avengers'' was the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".<ref name=\"NYMag\" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name=\"CastRuffalo1\" /> To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> ILM returned to create the digital Hulk. [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nFor ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ILM had to add much more detail to the character's facial features, due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM \"built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics.\"<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Trivia\" /> Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stunt men would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from ''The Dark World'', resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Taika Waititi also provided additional motion capture for the Hulk after Ruffalo had completed his scenes.<ref name=\"WaititiColliderSep2017\" />\n\nWith respect to Bruce Banner's regular appearance, his fashion sense has been critiqued with the observation that \"in just about every appearance, he's wearing a nondescript suit with a purple button down shirt\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> By contrast, Banner's \"Professor Hulk\" appearance in ''Avengers: Endgame'', including his penchant for knit sweaters, has been described as \"hot\" and \"sexy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/46078093|title=Uh, So, There Are a Lot of People Who Think the Hulk Is Hot Now After Seeing Avengers: Endgame|first=Quinn|last=Keaney|date=May 2, 2019|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n== Marvel Cinematic Universe ==\n=== Feature films ===\n{{Main|The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Thor: Ragnarok|Avengers: Infinity War|Captain Marvel (film)|Avengers: Endgame}}\n* [[Edward Norton]] portrays Bruce Banner in ''The Incredible Hulk'' (2008),<ref>{{cite news|date=August 15, 2007 |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez |title=Signing on to a writing co-op |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et-scriptland15/ |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |page=[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et\u2013scriptland15/2 2] |archivedate=March 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313231243/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et-scriptland15 |url-status=live  }}</ref> with [[Lou Ferrigno]] providing the voice of the Hulk.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 12, 2008 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=''The Incredible Hulk'' (PG-13) |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080612/REVIEWS/848151866 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |archivedate=June 15, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615030724/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080612%2FREVIEWS%2F848151866 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Norton did not return to the role in ''The Avengers'' (2012),<ref>{{cite web|date=July 10, 2010 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/exclusive-marvel-confirms-they-will-hire-new-hulk-for-avengers |title=Exclusive: Marvel confirms they will hire new Hulk for ''The Avengers'' |first=Drew |last=McWeeny |publisher=[[HitFix]] |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712072541/http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/2008-12-6-motion-captured/posts/exclusive-marvel-confirms-they-will-hire-new-hulk-for-avengers |archivedate=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> being replaced by [[Mark Ruffalo]].<ref name=\"RuffaloAvengers\">{{cite web|date=July 23, 2010 |authorlink=Nikki Finke |last=Finke |first=Nikki |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/toldja-marvel-ruffalo-reach-hulk-deal |title=Toldja!

At Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] meets with Dr. Bruce Banner, the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment \u2014 part of a [[World War II]] era \"super soldier\" program that Ross hopes to recreate \u2014 fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200. The Hulk destroys the lab and injures or kills the people inside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.\n\nFive years later,{{efn|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed. The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).}} Banner works at a soda bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the Internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as \"Mr. Blue\", and to whom he is \"Mr. Green\". He also learns [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Ross tracks down Banner, sending a special forces team, led by Russian-born British [[Royal Marine]] [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, but is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, again transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue\u2014cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]\u2014has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. Banner is caught and Blonsky has Stern use Banner's blood to turn him into the Abomination. Blonsky then rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that only the Hulk can stop Blonsky, Banner jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky and flees. Banner soon ends his relationship with Betty, realizing it can no longer work. A month later, in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]], Banner successfully transforms in a controlled manner. Meanwhile, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him [[The Avengers (2012 film)|a team]] is being put together.\n\n=== Joining the Avengers ===\nSeveral months later, in response to an attack by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\", and agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit Banner to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Loki is captured and placed in a cell on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Helicarrier]], but agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, with Hulk falling to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. When the Avengers regroup in New York City, Banner arrives to join the team to battle a Chitauri invasion. Banner reveals he is \"always angry\", and transforms into the Hulk, fights the Chitauri, beats Loki into submission, and saves Stark from crashing into the ground. Banner later forms a close friendship with Stark and works with him closely, even requesting him to build an anti-Hulk armor to stop him in case he loses control and goes on a rampage.\n\nSome years later, the Avengers recover Loki's scepter, and Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron]]\" global defense program. Ultron becomes sentient and recruits the Maximoffs, with [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using haunting visions to cause the Hulk to rampage until Stark stops him with his [[Iron Man's armor|anti-Hulk armor]]<!-- Please note the term \"Hulkbuster\" is not used in the film -->.{{ref|1|1}} The team then travels to a safehouse, where Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and persuades Romanoff and other team members to form a plan to stop Ultron, resulting in Romanoff being captured and taken to Sokovia. Banner finds her there, but she causes him to transform into the Hulk, in order to fight Ultron. After a final battle defeating Ultron in Sokovia, the Hulk departs in a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]] and eventually arrives at the planet Sakaar, where he is abducted by the ruler Grandmaster and eventually becomes  his champion and top-fighter in the Contest of Champions.\n\n=== Travels with Thor ===\nTwo years later, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] crash-lands on Sakaar and is forced to fight Hulk in the Contest of Champions. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard, and then escapes the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of Romanoff makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia where Banner is shocked to learn that he is on an alien planet. Banner expresses fear that if he becomes the Hulk again, he will never be able to return to his human form. Escaping Sakaar, they travel to Asgard, where Banner becomes Hulk again to save the fleeing Asgardians from the giant wolf, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]], while Thor challenges his sister, Hela. As Asgard is destroyed, the Hulk, remaining in that form, accompanies Thor and the Asgardians on a ship bound for Earth.\n\n=== The Infinity War ===\nThanos and his minions intercept the ship to extract the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Space Stone]] from the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. Hulk fights Thanos, but is easily overpowered. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] uses the [[Bifr\u00f6st]] to send Hulk to Earth, and Hulk crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] of [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] and his majordomo [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in New York City, and reverts to Bruce Banner. Banner warns Strange about Thanos, and contacts the other Avengers. When minions of Thanos appear in New York to attack Doctor Strange in pursuit of the Time Stone, Banner tries to become the Hulk, but Hulk refuses to \"come out\", forcing Banner out of the action.\n\nBanner and the other Avengers travel to Wakanda, where he uses Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor|anti-Hulk]] armor to battle the invading army of Thanos, until Thanos himself arrives to retrieve the final Infinity Stone, battling the Avengers and trapping Banner, in Stark's armor, in rock. Thanos activates the Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away, as his plan comes to fruition: people begin disintegrating, while Banner and the other Avengers remain on the Wakandan battlefield.\n\nFollowing his struggles with his Hulk side in ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Banner realizes that the Hulk is not a problem to solve, but the solution. During the five years following ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Banner undergoes gamma experimentation to balance his two sides. He is now permanently in the body of the Hulk but with the mind and voice of Banner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/avengers-endgame-hulk-banner-comics/|title=What's Up with Banner and Hulk in Avengers: Endgame?|first1=Rosie|last1=Knight|work=[[Nerdist]]|date=April 25, 2019|accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref> When the Avengers travel through time to obtain the Infinity Stones, Banner gets the Time Stone from the [[Ancient One]] (to whom he promises to return the Stones to their respective periods in time when the Avengers are done with their mission) in 2012. He then returns to the present along with the others, and is devastated with Natasha Romanoff's death (she had sacrificed herself so that Clint Barton could earn the Soul Stone). After combining the stones with the Iron Gauntlet, Banner, because of his strength, volunteers to activate the Infinity Stones. He does so and reverses the deaths caused by Thanos at the end of ''Infinity War'', though his right arm gets permanently injured in the process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/joe-russo-confirms-hulk-arm-injury/ |title=Avengers Co-Director Confirms Hulk's Post-Endgame Status |date=May 6, 2019 |website=Comic Book Resources |access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref> Banner then takes part in the climactic battle against a 2014 version of Thanos and his forces, who are eventually defeated when Tony Stark uses the Infinity Stones, at the cost of his own life. He later attends Stark's funeral along with others. After, he prepares the time machine so that [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] can return the time-displaced Stones and Mjolnir back to the periods they were found.\n\n== Differences from the comic books ==\nCharles Pulliam-Moore , writing for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', said of the earlier MCU films that \"[w]hile there are a number of storylines from Marvel's comics that delve deeper into the duality of Banner/Hulk's identity... Marvel's movies have forgone those plot lines in favor of trotting Bruce out to babble about science and break things when necessary\".<ref name=\"Gizmodo\" /> One specific difference from the comic books is Banner's involvement in the creation of [[Ultron]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron. The Vision, in the films, is created as a counter to Ultron, who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, Hank Pym.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of freestanding films about the Hulk, the character has been depicted in very few of the storylines shown in the comic books. In particular, the \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" storyline from the comic books is highly condensed and worked into ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''; the comic book storyline has the heroes of Earth intentionally sending the Hulk into space due to his excessively dangerous nature,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #88-91 (Dec 2005-Mar 2006)</ref> while the MCU Hulk leaves Earth of his own accord. The merged Banner/Hulk storyline depicted in ''Avengers: Endgame'' also differs from the comics, where a comparable merger was accomplished by hypnosis performed by superhero psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]].<ref name=\"NewsAramaPg9\">{{cite web|title=Duo Dynamics: The Many Incarnations of HULK-BANNER Bond?

Reviewing ''The Incredible Hulk'', Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> Conversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" />\n\nMark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk in ''The Avengers'' was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"<ref name=\"nydaily2012\" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights\u2014alongside Downey.<ref name=\"newyorker2012\" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"<ref name=\"villagevoice\" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,<ref name=\"rollz\" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses)\".<ref name=\"EW-review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder . This pushing force is transformed, by a [[connecting rod]] and [[flywheel]], into [[rotation]]al force for [[work (physics)|work]]. The term \"steam engine\" is generally applied only to [[reciprocating engine]]s as just described, not to the [[steam turbine]].\n\nSteam engines are [[external combustion engine]]s,<ref name=miffin>{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|url=https://archive.org/details/americanheritage0000unse_a1o7|url-access=registration|edition=Fourth|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}</ref> where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products. The ideal [[thermodynamic]] cycle used to analyze this process is called the [[Rankine cycle]].\n\nIn general usage, the term ''steam engine'' can refer to either complete steam plants (including [[boilers]] etc.) such as railway [[steam locomotive]]s and [[portable engine]]s, or may refer to the [[piston]] or turbine machinery alone, as in the [[beam engine]] and [[stationary steam engine]].\n\nSteam-driven devices were known as early as the [[aeolipile]] in the first century AD, with a few other uses recorded in the 16th and 17th century. [[Thomas Savery]]'s dewatering pump used steam pressure operating directly on the water. The first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was developed in 1712 by [[Thomas Newcomen]]. [[James Watt]] made a critical improvement by removing spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation, greatly improving the amount of work obtained per unit of fuel consumed. By the 19th century, stationary steam engines powered the factories of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Steam engines replaced sail for ships, and steam locomotives operated on the railways.\n\nReciprocating piston type steam engines were the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines in commercial usage. Steam turbines replaced reciprocating engines in power generation, due to lower cost, higher operating speed, and higher efficiency.<ref Name=\"Wiser\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the steam engine}}\n\n=== Early experiments ===\n\nThe first recorded rudimentary steam-powered \"engine\" was the [[aeolipile]] described by [[Hero of Alexandria]], a mathematician and engineer in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] in the first century AD.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-45691 turbine].\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2007.

Thereafter, technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques (partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source) resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller, faster, or more powerful, depending on the intended application.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}}\n\nThe [[Cornish engine]] was developed by Trevithick and others in the 1810s.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|pp=601\u2013628}} It was a compound cycle engine that used high-pressure steam expansively, then condensed the low-pressure steam, making it relatively efficient. The Cornish engine had irregular motion and torque though the cycle, limiting it mainly to pumping. Cornish engines were used in mines and for water supply until the late 19th century.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=601}}\n\n=== Horizontal stationary engine ===\n{{Main|Stationary steam engine}}\n\nEarly builders of stationary steam engines considered that horizontal cylinders would be subject to excessive wear. Their engines were therefore arranged with the piston axis vertical. In time the horizontal arrangement became more popular, allowing compact, but powerful engines to be fitted in smaller spaces.\n\nThe acme of the horizontal engine was the [[Corliss steam engine]], patented in 1849, which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff. When Corliss was given the [[Rumford Medal]], the committee said that \"no one invention since Watt's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine\".<ref name=\"NE Manufacturers 1879\">{{cite book\n  |title=New England Manufacturers and Manufactories\n  |author=Van Slyck, J.D.\n  |others=volume 1\n  |series=New England Manufacturers and Manufactories\n  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAs4AQAAMAAJ\n  |year=1879\n  |publisher=Van Slyck\n  |page=198}}</ref> In addition to using 30% less steam, it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off, making it well suited to manufacturing, especially cotton spinning.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}}<ref name=\"Thomson 2009\" />\n\n=== Road vehicles ===\n{{Main|History of steam road vehicles}}\n[[File:Steam powered road-locomotive from England.png|thumb|Steam powered road-locomotive from England]]\nThe first experimental road-going steam-powered vehicles were built in the late 18th century, but it was not until after [[Richard Trevithick]] had developed the use of high-pressure steam, around 1800, that mobile steam engines became a practical proposition. The first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design, and by the 1850s it was becoming viable to produce them on a commercial basis. This progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use of steam-powered vehicles on roads. Improvements in vehicle technology continued from the 1860s to the 1920s. Steam road vehicles were used for many applications. In the 20th century, the rapid development of [[internal combustion engine]] technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis, with relatively few remaining in use beyond the [[Second World War]]. Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation, and numerous examples are still in existence. In the 1960s, the air pollution problems in California gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam-powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution. Apart from interest by steam enthusiasts, the occasional replica vehicle, and experimental technology, no steam vehicles are in production at present.\n\n=== Marine engines ===\n\n[[File:Triple expansion marine steam engine.jpg|thumb|right|A triple-expansion [[marine steam engine]] on the 1907 oceangoing tug [[Hercules (1907)|''Hercules'']]]]\n\n{{Main|Marine steam engine}}\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, compound engines came into widespread use. [[Compound steam engine|Compound engines]] exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}} Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}}<ref Name=\"Wiser\"/>\n\n=== Steam locomotives ===\n{{Main|Steam locomotive|Traction engine|Steam tractor}}\n[[File:Vintage image of steam train.jpg|thumb|Vintage image of steam train]]\nAs the development of steam engines progressed through the 18th century, various attempts were made to apply them to road and railway use.{{sfn|Payton|2004}}<!--Cugnot is probably ''not'' relevant here.

The company Energiprojekt AB in [[Sweden]] has made progress in using modern materials for harnessing the power of steam. The efficiency of Energiprojekt's steam engine reaches some 27\u201330% on high-pressure engines.

[[Stationary steam engine]]s in fixed buildings may have the boiler and engine in separate buildings some distance apart. For portable or mobile use, such as [[steam locomotive]]s, the two are mounted together.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=495\u201396}} Description of the Colt portable engine</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=}} See description of steam locomotives</ref>\n\nThe widely used reciprocating engine typically consisted of a cast-iron cylinder, piston, connecting rod and beam or a crank and flywheel, and miscellaneous linkages. Steam was alternately supplied and exhausted by one or more valves. Speed control was either automatic, using a governor, or by a manual valve. The cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports.\n\nEngines equipped with a condenser are a separate type than those that exhaust to the atmosphere.\n\nOther components are often present; pumps (such as an [[injector]]) to supply water to the boiler during operation, condensers to recirculate the water and recover the [[latent heat]] of vaporisation, and [[superheater]]s to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point, and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes. When coal is used, a chain or screw stoking mechanism and its drive engine or motor may be included to move the fuel from a supply bin (bunker) to the firebox.<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 = Jerome\n | first1 = Harry\n | title = Mechanization in Industry, National Bureau of Economic Research\n | year = 1934\n | url = https://www.nber.org/chapters/c5238.pdf\n |pages=166\u201367\n | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n=== Heat source ===\nThe heat required for boiling the water and raising the temperature of the steam can be derived from various sources, most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space (e.g., [[combustion chamber]], [[firebox (steam engine)|firebox]], [[furnace]]).  In the case of [[model steam engine|model or toy steam engines]], the heat source can be an [[heating element|electric heating element]].\n\n=== Boilers ===\n{{Main|Boiler (steam generator)}}\n\n[[File:Dampfkessel f\u00fcr eine Station\u00e4rdampfmaschine im Textilmuseum Bocholt.jpg|thumb|right|An industrial boiler used for a [[stationary steam engine]]]]\n\nBoilers are [[pressure vessel]]s that contain water to be boiled, and features that [[heat exchanger|transfer the heat to the water]] as effectively as possible.\n\nThe two most common types are:\n# [[water-tube boiler]] \u2013 water is passed through tubes surrounded by hot gas\n# [[fire-tube boiler]] \u2013 hot gas is passed through tubes immersed in water, the same water also circulates in a water jacket surrounding the firebox and, in high-output locomotive boilers, also passes through tubes in the firebox itself (thermic syphons and security circulators)\n\nFire-tube boilers were the main type used for early high-pressure steam (typical steam locomotive practice), but they were to a large extent displaced by more economical water tube boilers in the late 19th century for marine propulsion and large stationary applications.\n\nMany boilers raise the temperature of the steam after it has left that part of the boiler where it is in contact with the water. Known as [[superheating]] it turns '[[wet steam]]' into '[[superheated steam]]'. It avoids the steam condensing in the engine cylinders, and gives a significantly higher [[Heat engine#Efficiency|efficiency]].{{sfn|Hills|1989|p=248}}{{sfn|Peabody|1893|p=384}}\n\n=== Motor units ===\n{{details|#Types of motor units}}\n\nIn a steam engine, a piston or steam turbine or any other similar device for doing mechanical work takes a supply of steam at high pressure and temperature and gives out a supply of steam at lower pressure and temperature, using as much of the difference in steam energy as possible to do mechanical work.\n\nThese \"motor units\" are often called 'steam engines' in their own right. Engines using compressed air or other gases differ from steam engines only in details that depend on the nature of the gas although [[compressed air]] has been used in steam engines without change.{{sfn |Peabody|1893|p=384}}\n\n=== Cold sink ===\nAs with all heat engines, the majority of [[primary energy]] must be emitted as [[waste heat]] at relatively low temperature.<ref name=\"energy.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |title=Fossil Energy: How Turbine Power Plants Work |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |accessdate=2011-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812012523/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe simplest cold sink is to vent the steam to the environment. This is often used on [[steam locomotive]]s to avoid the weight and bulk of condensers. Some of the released steam is vented up the chimney so as to increase the draw on the fire, which greatly increases engine power, but reduces efficiency.\n\nSometimes the waste heat from the engine is useful itself, and in those cases, very high overall efficiency can be obtained.\n\nSteam engines in stationary power plants use [[surface condenser]]s as a cold sink. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by [[cooling tower]]s which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water (''condensate''), is then pumped back up to pressure and sent back to the boiler. A dry-type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Waste heat can also be ejected by evaporative (wet) cooling towers, which use a secondary external water circuit that evaporates some of flow to the air.\n\nRiver boats initially used a [[jet condenser]] in which cold water from the river is injected into the exhaust steam from the engine. Cooling water and condensate mix.  While this was also applied for sea-going vessels, generally after only a few days of operation the boiler would become coated with deposited salt, reducing performance and increasing the risk of a boiler explosion.  Starting about 1834, the use of surface condensers on ships eliminated fouling of the boilers, and improved engine efficiency.<ref>Nick Robins, ''The Coming of the Comet: The Rise and Fall of the Paddle Steamer'', Seaforth Publishing, 2012, {{ISBN|1-4738-1328-X}}, Chapter 4</ref>\n\nEvaporated water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas river water can be re-used. In all cases, the steam plant boiler feed water, which must be kept pure, is kept separate from the cooling water or air.\n\n[[File:Boiler Feed Injector Diagram.svg|thumb|right|An [[injector]] uses a jet of steam to force water into the boiler. Injectors are inefficient but simple enough to be suitable for use on locomotives.]]\n\n=== Water pump ===\n\nThe Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water, so that they may be run continuously. Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage [[centrifugal pump]]s; however, other types are used. Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an [[injector]], which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler. Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used, except in applications such as steam locomotives.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|pp=341\u201343}} It is the pressurization of the water that circulates through the steam boiler that allows the water to be raised to temperatures well above {{convert|100|C}} boiling point of water at one atmospheric pressure, and by that means to increase the efficiency of the steam cycle.\n\n=== Monitoring and control ===\n\n[[File:Steam indicator (Steam and the Steam Engine - Land and Marine, 1875).jpg|thumb|right|Richard's indicator instrument of 1875.

The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1979|pp=}}</ref> The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off, good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.\n\n== Engine configuration ==\n{{Anchor|Engine cycles}}\n\n=== Simple engine ===\nIn a simple engine, or \"single expansion engine\" the charge of steam passes through the entire expansion process in an individual cylinder, although a simple engine may have one or more individual cylinders.<ref>Basic Mechanical Engineering by Mohan Sen p. 266</ref> It is then exhausted directly into the atmosphere or into a condenser. As steam expands in passing through a high-pressure engine, its temperature drops because no heat is being added to the system; this is known as [[adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]] and results in steam entering the cylinder at high temperature and leaving at lower temperature. This causes a cycle of heating and cooling of the cylinder with every stroke, which is a source of inefficiency.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=445}}\n{{anchor|High pressure cylinder}}\n{{anchor|Low pressure cylinder}}\n<!--''High pressure cylinder'' and ''Low pressure cylinder'' both redirect here, hence the bolding of these terms-->\n\nThe dominant efficiency loss in reciprocating steam engines is cylinder condensation and re-evaporation. The steam cylinder and adjacent metal parts/ports operate at a temperature about halfway between the steam admission saturation temperature and the saturation temperature corresponding to the exhaust pressure.  As high-pressure steam is admitted into the working cylinder, much of the high-temperature steam is condensed as water droplets onto the metal surfaces, significantly reducing the steam available for expansive work.  When the expanding steam reaches low pressure (especially during the exhaust stroke), the previously deposited water droplets that had just been formed within the cylinder/ports now boil away (re-evaporation) and this steam does no further work in the cylinder.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThere are practical limits on the expansion ratio of a steam engine cylinder, as increasing cylinder surface area tends to exacerbate the cylinder condensation and re-evaporation issues.  This negates the theoretical advantages associated with a high ratio of expansion in an individual cylinder.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Compound engines ===\n{{Main|Compound engine}}\n\nA method to lessen the magnitude of energy loss to a very long cylinder was invented in 1804 by British engineer [[Arthur Woolf]], who patented his ''Woolf high-pressure '''compound engine''''' in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a '''high-pressure (HP) cylinder''' and then enters one or more subsequent '''lower-pressure (LP) cylinders'''. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders, with the overall temperature drop within each cylinder reduced considerably.  By expanding the steam in steps with smaller temperature range (within each cylinder) the condensation and re-evaporation efficiency issue (described above) is reduced. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, variations of torque can be reduced.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}} To derive equal work from lower-pressure cylinder requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and in rare cases the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders, resulting in larger cylinders.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}}\n\nDouble-expansion (usually known as '''compound''') engines expanded the steam in two stages. The pairs may be duplicated or the work of the large low-pressure cylinder can be split with one high-pressure cylinder exhausting into one or the other, giving a three-cylinder layout where cylinder and piston diameter are about the same, making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}}\n\nTwo-cylinder compounds can be arranged as:\n* '''Cross compounds''': The cylinders are side by side.\n* '''Tandem compounds''': The cylinders are end to end, driving a common [[connecting rod]]\n* '''Angle compounds''': The cylinders are arranged in a V (usually at a 90\u00b0 angle) and drive a common crank.\n\nWith two-cylinder compounds used in railway work, the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90\u00b0 out of phase with each other (''quartered''). When the double-expansion group is duplicated, producing a four-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180\u00b0, the groups being set at 90\u00b0 to each other. In one case (the first type of [[Vauclain compound]]), the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank, again set at 90\u00b0 as for a two-cylinder engine. With the three-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90\u00b0 with the HP one at 135\u00b0 to the other two, or in some cases, all three cranks were set at 120\u00b0.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated. This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the [[loading gauge]] (particularly in Britain, where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930). However, although never in the majority, it was popular in many other countries.<ref name=\"van Riemsdijk, Compound Locomotives\" />\n\n=== Multiple-expansion engines ===\n<!-- Triple expansion steam engine redirects here -->\n{{Anchor|Multiple expansion engines|Triple-expansion steam engine}}<!-- This keeps from having to update redirects to this section should its title change (again). -->\n{{Main|Compound engine}}\n[[File:Triple expansion engine animation.gif|thumb|An animation of a simplified triple-expansion engine. High-pressure steam (red) enters from the boiler and passes through the engine, exhausting as low-pressure steam (blue), usually to a condenser.]]\n\nIt is a logical extension of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the '''multiple-expansion engine'''. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as ''triple-'' and ''quadruple-expansion engines'' respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double-expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing \"system\" was used on some [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|marine triple-expansion engines]]. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the four-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the [[Olympic class ocean liner|''Olympic'' class]]), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free [[Steam engine#Turbine engines|turbine engine]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is noted, however, that triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines were used to drive the World War II [[Liberty ship]]s, by far the largest number of identical ships ever built. Over 2700 ships were built, in the United States, from a British original design. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe image in this section shows an animation of a triple-expansion engine.

Prior to and during [[World War I]], the expansion engine dominated marine applications, where high vessel speed was not essential. It was, however, superseded by the British invention [[steam turbine]] where speed was required, for instance in warships, such as the [[dreadnought battleship]]s, and [[ocean liner]]s. {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.<ref>Brooks, John.

See: Monitoring and control (above)]]\n\nIn most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the same end of the cylinder. The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four ''events'' \u2013 admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a ''steam chest'' adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ''ports'' communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by [[valve gear]], of which there are many types.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction. Many however have a reversing [[Machine|mechanism]] which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually \"shortening the [[cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]]\" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression (''\"kick back\"'').<ref>\"Backfiring\" in ''The Tractor Field Book: With Power Farm Equipment Specifications'' (Chicago: Farm Implement News Company, 1928), 108-109. https://books.google.com/books?id=pFEfAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA108</ref>\n\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff [[expansion valve (steam engine)|expansion valve]] riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide ''lap'' by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler [[Stephenson valve gear|Stephenson]], [[Joy valve gear|Joy]] and [[Walschaerts valve gear|Walschaerts]] motions. [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss]], and later, [[poppet valve]] gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by [[trip valve|trip mechanisms]] or [[cam]]s profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.<ref name=\"van Riemsdijk, Compound Locomotives\">{{cite book|last=van Riemsdijk| first=John|year=1994|title=Compound Locomotives |location=Penrhyn, UK|publisher=Atlantic Transport Publishers|isbn=978-0-906899-61-8|pages=2\u20133|ref=van Riemsdijk, Compound locomotives}}</ref>{{sfn|Chapelon|2000|pp=56\u201372, 120-}}\n\n==== Compression ====\nBefore the exhaust phase is quite complete, the exhaust side of the valve closes, shutting a portion of the exhaust steam inside the cylinder. This determines the compression phase where a cushion of steam is formed against which the piston does work whilst its velocity is rapidly decreasing; it moreover obviates the pressure and temperature shock, which would otherwise be caused by the sudden admission of the high-pressure steam at the beginning of the following cycle.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==== Lead ====\nThe above effects are further enhanced by providing ''lead'': as was later discovered with the [[internal combustion engine]], it has been found advantageous since the late 1830s to advance the admission phase, giving the valve ''lead'' so that admission occurs a little before the end of the exhaust stroke in order to fill the ''clearance volume'' comprising the ports and the cylinder ends (not part of the piston-swept volume) before the steam begins to exert effort on the piston.<ref name=\"Bel, Locomotives\">{{cite book|last=Bell|first=A.M.|title=Locomotives|publisher=Virtue and Company|year=1950|location=London|pages=61\u201363}}</ref>\n\n=== Uniflow (or unaflow) engine ===\n\n[[File:Uniflow steam engine.gif|thumb|upright=2.25|Schematic animation of a [[uniflow steam engine]].<br />The [[poppet valves]] are controlled by the rotating [[camshaft]] at the top.

The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction. By this means, the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance, and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower. However, the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}.\n\n=== Turbine engines ===\n[[File:Dampfturbine Laeufer01.jpg|thumb|right|A rotor of a modern [[steam turbine]], used in a [[power plant]]]]\n\n{{Main|Steam turbine}}\n\nA steam turbine consists of one or more ''[[Steam turbine#Reaction turbines|rotors]]'' (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of ''[[Steam turbine#Reaction turbines|stators]]'' (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a [[surface condenser]] that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the United States with 60 Hertz power, and 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications, the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSteam turbines provide direct rotational force and therefore do not require a linkage mechanism to convert reciprocating to rotary motion. Thus, they produce smoother rotational forces on the output shaft. This contributes to a lower maintenance requirement and less wear on the machinery they power than a comparable reciprocating engine.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Turbinia At Speed.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Turbinia]]'' \u2013 the first [[steam turbine]]-powered ship]]\n\nThe main use for steam turbines is in [[electricity generation]] (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines)<ref Name=\"Wiser\" /> however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the ''[[Turbinia]]''), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines. In recent decades, reciprocating Diesel engines, and gas turbines, have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nVirtually all [[nuclear power]] plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an [[electrical generator]]. [[Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear-powered ships and submarines]] either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion, with generators providing auxiliary power, or else employ [[turbo-electric transmission]], where the steam drives a [[turbo generator]] set with propulsion provided by electric motors. A limited number of [[steam turbine locomotive|steam turbine railroad locomotives]] were manufactured. Some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in [[Sweden]] and for [[LMS Turbomotive|express passenger work in Britain]], but were not repeated. Elsewhere, notably in the United States, more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally, but not reproduced. It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Oscillating cylinder.svg|thumb|right|Operation of a simple [[oscillating cylinder steam engine]]]]\n\n=== Oscillating cylinder steam engines ===\n{{Main|Oscillating cylinder steam engine}}\n\nAn oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require [[valve gear|valves]] to direct steam into and out of the cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting ([[trunnion]]). These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full-size working engines, mainly on [[Marine steam engine#Oscillating|ships]] where their compactness is valued.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== Rotary steam engines ===\nIt is possible to use a mechanism based on a [[pistonless rotary engine]] such as the [[Wankel engine]] in place of the cylinders and [[valve gear]] of a conventional reciprocating steam engine. Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details. The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and [[thermal expansion]]; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient. Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the [[cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]], is also a serious problem with many such designs.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nBy the 1840s, it was clear that the concept had inherent problems and rotary engines were treated with some derision in the technical press. However, the arrival of electricity on the scene, and the obvious advantages of driving a dynamo directly from a high-speed engine, led to something of a revival in interest in the 1880s and 1890s, and a few designs had some limited success.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}.\n\nOf the few designs that were manufactured in quantity, those of the Hult Brothers Rotary Steam Engine Company of Stockholm, Sweden, and the spherical engine of [[Beauchamp Tower]] are notable. Tower's engines were used by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] to drive lighting dynamos on their locomotives, and by the [[Admiralty]] for driving dynamos on board the ships of the [[Royal Navy]]. They were eventually replaced in these niche applications by steam turbines.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|upright=0.5|alt=Line drawing of a sphere suspended between two uprights forming a horizontal axis.

Steam rocketry works by filling a pressure vessel with hot water at high pressure and opening a valve leading to a suitable nozzle. The drop in pressure immediately boils some of the water and the steam leaves through a nozzle, creating a propulsive force.<ref>[http://www.tecaeromex.com/ingles/vapori.html Steam Rockets] Tecaeromax</ref>\n\n== Safety ==\nSteam engines possess boilers and other components that are [[pressure vessel]]s that contain a great deal of potential energy. Steam escapes and [[boiler explosion]]s (typically [[BLEVE]]s) can and have in the past caused great loss of life. While variations in standards may exist in different countries, stringent legal, testing, training, care with manufacture, operation and certification is applied to ensure safety.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nFailure modes may include:\n* over-pressurisation of the boiler\n* insufficient water in the boiler causing overheating and vessel failure\n* buildup of sediment and scale which cause local hot spots, especially in riverboats using dirty feed water\n* pressure vessel failure of the boiler due to inadequate construction or maintenance.\n* escape of steam from pipework/boiler causing scalding\n\nSteam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe. Such [[safety valve]]s traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal is illegally broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nLead [[fusible plug]]s may be present in the crown of the boiler's firebox. If the water level drops, such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly, the [[lead]] melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire. Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire. The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler. If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Steam cycle ==\n{{Main|Rankine cycle}}\n{{See also|Thermodynamics|Heat transfer}}\n\n[[File:Rankine cycle layout.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Flow diagram of the four main devices used in the [[Rankine cycle]]. 1). Feedwater pump 2). Boiler or steam generator 3). Turbine or engine 4). Condenser; where ''Q''=heat and ''W''=work. Most of the heat is rejected as waste.]]\nThe Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all [[solar thermal|solar]], [[biomass]], [[Coal power|coal]] and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] [[power plant]]s. It is named after [[William John Macquorn Rankine]], a Scottish [[polymath]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical [[Carnot cycle]] because, when an efficient turbine is used, the [[TS diagram]] begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and [[Isothermal process|isothermal]] (constant [[temperature]]) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle, a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the [[Carnot cycle]]).<!-- check-the source was too ambiguous--> The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=445}}\n\nThe working fluid in a Rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system, where the working fluid is recycled continuously, or may be an \"open loop\" system, where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere, and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied. Normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties, such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry, abundance, low cost, and its [[Properties of water#Heat capacity and heats of vaporization and fusion|thermodynamic properties]]. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is the working fluid in the [[mercury vapor turbine]]. Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a [[binary cycle]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam. The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. Watt independently discovered [[latent heat]], which was confirmed by the original discoverer [[Joseph Black]], who also advised Watt on experimental procedures. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature.{{sfn|Landes|1969|p=}} The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Efficiency ==\n{{Main|Thermal efficiency}}\n{{See also|Engine efficiency#Steam engine}}\n\nThe efficiency of an engine cycle can be calculated by dividing the energy output of mechanical work that the engine produces by the energy put into the engine by the burning fuel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its \"duty\". The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen designs]]. Duty is the number of [[foot-pounds]] of [[work (physics)|work]] delivered by burning one [[bushel]] (94 pounds) of coal. The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design. Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million.<ref>John Enys, [https://books.google.com/books?id=blhqAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA457 \"Remarks on the Duty of the Steam Engines employed in the Mines of Cornwall at different periods\"], ''Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers'', Volume 3 (14 January 1840), p. 457</ref>\n\nNo heat engine can be more efficient than the [[Carnot cycle]], in which heat is moved from a high-temperature reservoir to one at a low temperature, and the efficiency depends on the temperature difference. For the greatest efficiency, steam engines should be operated at the highest steam temperature possible ([[superheater|superheated steam]]), and release the waste heat at the lowest temperature possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe efficiency of a Rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid. Without the pressure reaching [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|supercritical]] levels for the working fluid, the temperature range over which the cycle can operate is small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565&nbsp;\u00b0C (the [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. This gives a theoretical [[Carnot efficiency]] of about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station. This low turbine entry temperature (compared with a [[gas turbine]]) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in [[Combined cycle|combined-cycle gas turbine]] power stations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nOne principal advantage the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point. By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine (or reciprocating engine) power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. [[Gas turbine]]s, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500&nbsp;\u00b0C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern simple cycle gas turbines are fairly well matched.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn practice, a reciprocating steam engine cycle exhausting the steam to atmosphere will typically have an efficiency (including the boiler) in the range of 1\u201310%, but with the addition of a condenser, Corliss valves, multiple expansion, and high steam pressure/temperature, it may be greatly improved, historically into the range of 10\u201320%, and very rarely slightly higher.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nA modern, large electrical power station (producing several hundred megawatts of electrical output) with [[steam reheat]], [[economizer]] etc. will achieve efficiency in the mid 40% range, with the most efficient units approaching 50% thermal efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt is also possible to capture the waste heat using [[cogeneration]] in which the waste heat is used for heating a lower boiling point working fluid or as a heat source for district heating via saturated low-pressure steam.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:GNR N2 1744 at Weybourne - geograph.org.uk - 1479849.jpg|A steam locomotive \u2013 a [[GNR Class N2|GNR N2 Class]] No.1744 at Weybourne nr.

The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force is transformed, by a [[connecting rod]] and [[flywheel]], into [[rotation]]al force for [[work (physics)|work]]. The term \"steam engine\" is generally applied only to [[reciprocating engine]]s as just described, not to the [[steam turbine]].\n\nSteam engines are [[external combustion engine]]s,<ref name=miffin>{{cite book|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|url=https://archive.org/details/americanheritage0000unse_a1o7|url-access=registration|edition=Fourth|year=2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company}}</ref> where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products. The ideal [[thermodynamic]] cycle used to analyze this process is called the [[Rankine cycle]].\n\nIn general usage, the term ''steam engine'' can refer to either complete steam plants (including [[boilers]] etc.) such as railway [[steam locomotive]]s and [[portable engine]]s, or may refer to the [[piston]] or turbine machinery alone, as in the [[beam engine]] and [[stationary steam engine]].\n\nSteam-driven devices were known as early as the [[aeolipile]] in the first century AD, with a few other uses recorded in the 16th and 17th century. [[Thomas Savery]]'s dewatering pump used steam pressure operating directly on the water. The first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was developed in 1712 by [[Thomas Newcomen]]. [[James Watt]] made a critical improvement by removing spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation, greatly improving the amount of work obtained per unit of fuel consumed. By the 19th century, stationary steam engines powered the factories of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Steam engines replaced sail for ships, and steam locomotives operated on the railways.\n\nReciprocating piston type steam engines were the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines in commercial usage. Steam turbines replaced reciprocating engines in power generation, due to lower cost, higher operating speed, and higher efficiency.<ref Name=\"Wiser\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the steam engine}}\n\n=== Early experiments ===\n\nThe first recorded rudimentary steam-powered \"engine\" was the [[aeolipile]] described by [[Hero of Alexandria]], a mathematician and engineer in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] in the first century AD.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-45691 turbine].\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2007.

The first half of the 19th century saw great progress in steam vehicle design, and by the 1850s it was becoming viable to produce them on a commercial basis. This progress was dampened by legislation which limited or prohibited the use of steam-powered vehicles on roads. Improvements in vehicle technology continued from the 1860s to the 1920s. Steam road vehicles were used for many applications. In the 20th century, the rapid development of [[internal combustion engine]] technology led to the demise of the steam engine as a source of propulsion of vehicles on a commercial basis, with relatively few remaining in use beyond the [[Second World War]]. Many of these vehicles were acquired by enthusiasts for preservation, and numerous examples are still in existence. In the 1960s, the air pollution problems in California gave rise to a brief period of interest in developing and studying steam-powered vehicles as a possible means of reducing the pollution. Apart from interest by steam enthusiasts, the occasional replica vehicle, and experimental technology, no steam vehicles are in production at present.\n\n=== Marine engines ===\n\n[[File:Triple expansion marine steam engine.jpg|thumb|right|A triple-expansion [[marine steam engine]] on the 1907 oceangoing tug [[Hercules (1907)|''Hercules'']]]]\n\n{{Main|Marine steam engine}}\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, compound engines came into widespread use.

[[Stationary steam engine]]s in fixed buildings may have the boiler and engine in separate buildings some distance apart. For portable or mobile use, such as [[steam locomotive]]s, the two are mounted together.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=495\u201396}} Description of the Colt portable engine</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|McNeil|1990|pp=}} See description of steam locomotives</ref>\n\nThe widely used reciprocating engine typically consisted of a cast-iron cylinder, piston, connecting rod and beam or a crank and flywheel, and miscellaneous linkages. Steam was alternately supplied and exhausted by one or more valves. Speed control was either automatic, using a governor, or by a manual valve. The cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports.\n\nEngines equipped with a condenser are a separate type than those that exhaust to the atmosphere.\n\nOther components are often present; pumps (such as an [[injector]]) to supply water to the boiler during operation, condensers to recirculate the water and recover the [[latent heat]] of vaporisation, and [[superheater]]s to raise the temperature of the steam above its saturated vapour point, and various mechanisms to increase the draft for fireboxes.

In the case of [[model steam engine|model or toy steam engines]], the heat source can be an [[heating element|electric heating element]].\n\n=== Boilers ===\n{{Main|Boiler (steam generator)}}\n\n[[File:Dampfkessel f\u00fcr eine Station\u00e4rdampfmaschine im Textilmuseum Bocholt.jpg|thumb|right|An industrial boiler used for a [[stationary steam engine]]]]\n\nBoilers are [[pressure vessel]]s that contain water to be boiled, and features that [[heat exchanger|transfer the heat to the water]] as effectively as possible.\n\nThe two most common types are:\n# [[water-tube boiler]] \u2013 water is passed through tubes surrounded by hot gas\n# [[fire-tube boiler]] \u2013 hot gas is passed through tubes immersed in water, the same water also circulates in a water jacket surrounding the firebox and, in high-output locomotive boilers, also passes through tubes in the firebox itself (thermic syphons and security circulators)\n\nFire-tube boilers were the main type used for early high-pressure steam (typical steam locomotive practice), but they were to a large extent displaced by more economical water tube boilers in the late 19th century for marine propulsion and large stationary applications.\n\nMany boilers raise the temperature of the steam after it has left that part of the boiler where it is in contact with the water. Known as [[superheating]] it turns '[[wet steam]]' into '[[superheated steam]]'. It avoids the steam condensing in the engine cylinders, and gives a significantly higher [[Heat engine#Efficiency|efficiency]].{{sfn|Hills|1989|p=248}}{{sfn|Peabody|1893|p=384}}\n\n=== Motor units ===\n{{details|#Types of motor units}}\n\nIn a steam engine, a piston or steam turbine or any other similar device for doing mechanical work takes a supply of steam at high pressure and temperature and gives out a supply of steam at lower pressure and temperature, using as much of the difference in steam energy as possible to do mechanical work.\n\nThese \"motor units\" are often called 'steam engines' in their own right. Engines using compressed air or other gases differ from steam engines only in details that depend on the nature of the gas although [[compressed air]] has been used in steam engines without change.{{sfn |Peabody|1893|p=384}}\n\n=== Cold sink ===\nAs with all heat engines, the majority of [[primary energy]] must be emitted as [[waste heat]] at relatively low temperature.<ref name=\"energy.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |title=Fossil Energy: How Turbine Power Plants Work |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |accessdate=2011-09-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812012523/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe simplest cold sink is to vent the steam to the environment. This is often used on [[steam locomotive]]s to avoid the weight and bulk of condensers. Some of the released steam is vented up the chimney so as to increase the draw on the fire, which greatly increases engine power, but reduces efficiency.\n\nSometimes the waste heat from the engine is useful itself, and in those cases, very high overall efficiency can be obtained.\n\nSteam engines in stationary power plants use [[surface condenser]]s as a cold sink. The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by [[cooling tower]]s which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. The resulting condensed hot water (''condensate''), is then pumped back up to pressure and sent back to the boiler. A dry-type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Waste heat can also be ejected by evaporative (wet) cooling towers, which use a secondary external water circuit that evaporates some of flow to the air.\n\nRiver boats initially used a [[jet condenser]] in which cold water from the river is injected into the exhaust steam from the engine. Cooling water and condensate mix.  While this was also applied for sea-going vessels, generally after only a few days of operation the boiler would become coated with deposited salt, reducing performance and increasing the risk of a boiler explosion.  Starting about 1834, the use of surface condensers on ships eliminated fouling of the boilers, and improved engine efficiency.<ref>Nick Robins, ''The Coming of the Comet: The Rise and Fall of the Paddle Steamer'', Seaforth Publishing, 2012, {{ISBN|1-4738-1328-X}}, Chapter 4</ref>\n\nEvaporated water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas river water can be re-used. In all cases, the steam plant boiler feed water, which must be kept pure, is kept separate from the cooling water or air.\n\n[[File:Boiler Feed Injector Diagram.svg|thumb|right|An [[injector]] uses a jet of steam to force water into the boiler. Injectors are inefficient but simple enough to be suitable for use on locomotives.]]\n\n=== Water pump ===\n\nThe Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water, so that they may be run continuously. Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage [[centrifugal pump]]s; however, other types are used. Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an [[injector]], which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler.

The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1979|pp=}}</ref> The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off, good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.\n\n== Engine configuration ==\n{{Anchor|Engine cycles}}\n\n=== Simple engine ===\nIn a simple engine, or \"single expansion engine\" the charge of steam passes through the entire expansion process in an individual cylinder, although a simple engine may have one or more individual cylinders.<ref>Basic Mechanical Engineering by Mohan Sen p. 266</ref> It is then exhausted directly into the atmosphere or into a condenser. As steam expands in passing through a high-pressure engine, its temperature drops because no heat is being added to the system; this is known as [[adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]] and results in steam entering the cylinder at high temperature and leaving at lower temperature. This causes a cycle of heating and cooling of the cylinder with every stroke, which is a source of inefficiency.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=445}}\n{{anchor|High pressure cylinder}}\n{{anchor|Low pressure cylinder}}\n<!--''High pressure cylinder'' and ''Low pressure cylinder'' both redirect here, hence the bolding of these terms-->\n\nThe dominant efficiency loss in reciprocating steam engines is cylinder condensation and re-evaporation. The steam cylinder and adjacent metal parts/ports operate at a temperature about halfway between the steam admission saturation temperature and the saturation temperature corresponding to the exhaust pressure.  As high-pressure steam is admitted into the working cylinder, much of the high-temperature steam is condensed as water droplets onto the metal surfaces, significantly reducing the steam available for expansive work.  When the expanding steam reaches low pressure (especially during the exhaust stroke), the previously deposited water droplets that had just been formed within the cylinder/ports now boil away (re-evaporation) and this steam does no further work in the cylinder.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThere are practical limits on the expansion ratio of a steam engine cylinder, as increasing cylinder surface area tends to exacerbate the cylinder condensation and re-evaporation issues.  This negates the theoretical advantages associated with a high ratio of expansion in an individual cylinder.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n=== Compound engines ===\n{{Main|Compound engine}}\n\nA method to lessen the magnitude of energy loss to a very long cylinder was invented in 1804 by British engineer [[Arthur Woolf]], who patented his ''Woolf high-pressure '''compound engine''''' in 1805. In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a '''high-pressure (HP) cylinder''' and then enters one or more subsequent '''lower-pressure (LP) cylinders'''. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders, with the overall temperature drop within each cylinder reduced considerably.  By expanding the steam in steps with smaller temperature range (within each cylinder) the condensation and re-evaporation efficiency issue (described above) is reduced. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, variations of torque can be reduced.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}} To derive equal work from lower-pressure cylinder requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and in rare cases the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders, resulting in larger cylinders.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}}\n\nDouble-expansion (usually known as '''compound''') engines expanded the steam in two stages. The pairs may be duplicated or the work of the large low-pressure cylinder can be split with one high-pressure cylinder exhausting into one or the other, giving a three-cylinder layout where cylinder and piston diameter are about the same, making the reciprocating masses easier to balance.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=}}\n\nTwo-cylinder compounds can be arranged as:\n* '''Cross compounds''': The cylinders are side by side.\n* '''Tandem compounds''': The cylinders are end to end, driving a common [[connecting rod]]\n* '''Angle compounds''': The cylinders are arranged in a V (usually at a 90\u00b0 angle) and drive a common crank.\n\nWith two-cylinder compounds used in railway work, the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90\u00b0 out of phase with each other (''quartered''). When the double-expansion group is duplicated, producing a four-cylinder compound, the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180\u00b0, the groups being set at 90\u00b0 to each other. In one case (the first type of [[Vauclain compound]]), the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common crosshead and crank, again set at 90\u00b0 as for a two-cylinder engine. With the three-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90\u00b0 with the HP one at 135\u00b0 to the other two, or in some cases, all three cranks were set at 120\u00b0.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated. This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the [[loading gauge]] (particularly in Britain, where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930). However, although never in the majority, it was popular in many other countries.<ref name=\"van Riemsdijk, Compound Locomotives\" />\n\n=== Multiple-expansion engines ===\n<!-- Triple expansion steam engine redirects here -->\n{{Anchor|Multiple expansion engines|Triple-expansion steam engine}}<!-- This keeps from having to update redirects to this section should its title change (again). -->\n{{Main|Compound engine}}\n[[File:Triple expansion engine animation.gif|thumb|An animation of a simplified triple-expansion engine. High-pressure steam (red) enters from the boiler and passes through the engine, exhausting as low-pressure steam (blue), usually to a condenser.]]\n\nIt is a logical extension of the compound engine (described above) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency. The result is the '''multiple-expansion engine'''. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as ''triple-'' and ''quadruple-expansion engines'' respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double-expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple-expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing \"system\" was used on some [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|marine triple-expansion engines]]. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the four-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the [[Olympic class ocean liner|''Olympic'' class]]), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free [[Steam engine#Turbine engines|turbine engine]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} It is noted, however, that triple-expansion reciprocating steam engines were used to drive the World War II [[Liberty ship]]s, by far the largest number of identical ships ever built. Over 2700 ships were built, in the United States, from a British original design. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe image in this section shows an animation of a triple-expansion engine. The steam travels through the engine from left to right.

Prior to and during [[World War I]], the expansion engine dominated marine applications, where high vessel speed was not essential. It was, however, superseded by the British invention [[steam turbine]] where speed was required, for instance in warships, such as the [[dreadnought battleship]]s, and [[ocean liner]]s. {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} of 1905 was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then-novel steam turbine.<ref>Brooks, John.

See: Monitoring and control (above)]]\n\nIn most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the same end of the cylinder. The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes; the cycle also comprises four ''events'' \u2013 admission, expansion, exhaust, compression. These events are controlled by valves often working inside a ''steam chest'' adjacent to the cylinder; the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ''ports'' communicating with the cylinder end(s) and are driven by [[valve gear]], of which there are many types.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction. Many however have a reversing [[Machine|mechanism]] which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually \"shortening the [[cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]]\" or rather, shortening the admission event; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period. However, as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows, a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant; if the exhaust event is too brief, the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression (''\"kick back\"'').<ref>\"Backfiring\" in ''The Tractor Field Book: With Power Farm Equipment Specifications'' (Chicago: Farm Implement News Company, 1928), 108-109. https://books.google.com/books?id=pFEfAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA108</ref>\n\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable cutoff [[expansion valve (steam engine)|expansion valve]] riding on the back of the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide ''lap'' by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler [[Stephenson valve gear|Stephenson]], [[Joy valve gear|Joy]] and [[Walschaerts valve gear|Walschaerts]] motions. [[Corliss steam engine|Corliss]], and later, [[poppet valve]] gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by [[trip valve|trip mechanisms]] or [[cam]]s profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.<ref name=\"van Riemsdijk, Compound Locomotives\">{{cite book|last=van Riemsdijk| first=John|year=1994|title=Compound Locomotives |location=Penrhyn, UK|publisher=Atlantic Transport Publishers|isbn=978-0-906899-61-8|pages=2\u20133|ref=van Riemsdijk, Compound locomotives}}</ref>{{sfn|Chapelon|2000|pp=56\u201372, 120-}}\n\n==== Compression ====\nBefore the exhaust phase is quite complete, the exhaust side of the valve closes, shutting a portion of the exhaust steam inside the cylinder. This determines the compression phase where a cushion of steam is formed against which the piston does work whilst its velocity is rapidly decreasing; it moreover obviates the pressure and temperature shock, which would otherwise be caused by the sudden admission of the high-pressure steam at the beginning of the following cycle.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n==== Lead ====\nThe above effects are further enhanced by providing ''lead'': as was later discovered with the [[internal combustion engine]], it has been found advantageous since the late 1830s to advance the admission phase, giving the valve ''lead'' so that admission occurs a little before the end of the exhaust stroke in order to fill the ''clearance volume'' comprising the ports and the cylinder ends (not part of the piston-swept volume) before the steam begins to exert effort on the piston.<ref name=\"Bel, Locomotives\">{{cite book|last=Bell|first=A.M.|title=Locomotives|publisher=Virtue and Company|year=1950|location=London|pages=61\u201363}}</ref>\n\n=== Uniflow (or unaflow) engine ===\n\n[[File:Uniflow steam engine.gif|thumb|upright=2.25|Schematic animation of a [[uniflow steam engine]].<br />The [[poppet valves]] are controlled by the rotating [[camshaft]] at the top.

The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction. By this means, the simple-expansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior part-load performance, and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower. However, the thermal expansion gradient uniflow engines produce along the cylinder wall gives practical difficulties.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}.\n\n=== Turbine engines ===\n[[File:Dampfturbine Laeufer01.jpg|thumb|right|A rotor of a modern [[steam turbine]], used in a [[power plant]]]]\n\n{{Main|Steam turbine}}\n\nA steam turbine consists of one or more ''[[Steam turbine#Reaction turbines|rotors]]'' (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of ''[[Steam turbine#Reaction turbines|stators]]'' (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a [[surface condenser]] that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the United States with 60 Hertz power, and 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications, the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSteam turbines provide direct rotational force and therefore do not require a linkage mechanism to convert reciprocating to rotary motion. Thus, they produce smoother rotational forces on the output shaft. This contributes to a lower maintenance requirement and less wear on the machinery they power than a comparable reciprocating engine.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Turbinia At Speed.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Turbinia]]'' \u2013 the first [[steam turbine]]-powered ship]]\n\nThe main use for steam turbines is in [[electricity generation]] (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines)<ref Name=\"Wiser\" /> however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the ''[[Turbinia]]''), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines. In recent decades, reciprocating Diesel engines, and gas turbines, have almost entirely supplanted steam propulsion for marine applications.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nVirtually all [[nuclear power]] plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an [[electrical generator]]. [[Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear-powered ships and submarines]] either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion, with generators providing auxiliary power, or else employ [[turbo-electric transmission]], where the steam drives a [[turbo generator]] set with propulsion provided by electric motors. A limited number of [[steam turbine locomotive|steam turbine railroad locomotives]] were manufactured. Some non-condensing direct-drive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in [[Sweden]] and for [[LMS Turbomotive|express passenger work in Britain]], but were not repeated. Elsewhere, notably in the United States, more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally, but not reproduced. It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Oscillating cylinder.svg|thumb|right|Operation of a simple [[oscillating cylinder steam engine]]]]\n\n=== Oscillating cylinder steam engines ===\n{{Main|Oscillating cylinder steam engine}}\n\nAn oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require [[valve gear|valves]] to direct steam into and out of the cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting ([[trunnion]]). These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full-size working engines, mainly on [[Marine steam engine#Oscillating|ships]] where their compactness is valued.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n=== Rotary steam engines ===\nIt is possible to use a mechanism based on a [[pistonless rotary engine]] such as the [[Wankel engine]] in place of the cylinders and [[valve gear]] of a conventional reciprocating steam engine. Many such engines have been designed, from the time of James Watt to the present day, but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production; see link at bottom of article for more details. The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and [[thermal expansion]]; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient. Lack of expansive working, or any means of control of the [[cutoff (steam engine)|cutoff]], is also a serious problem with many such designs.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nBy the 1840s, it was clear that the concept had inherent problems and rotary engines were treated with some derision in the technical press. However, the arrival of electricity on the scene, and the obvious advantages of driving a dynamo directly from a high-speed engine, led to something of a revival in interest in the 1880s and 1890s, and a few designs had some limited success.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}.\n\nOf the few designs that were manufactured in quantity, those of the Hult Brothers Rotary Steam Engine Company of Stockholm, Sweden, and the spherical engine of [[Beauchamp Tower]] are notable. Tower's engines were used by the [[Great Eastern Railway]] to drive lighting dynamos on their locomotives, and by the [[Admiralty]] for driving dynamos on board the ships of the [[Royal Navy]]. They were eventually replaced in these niche applications by steam turbines.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Aeolipile illustration.png|thumb|upright=0.5|alt=Line drawing of a sphere suspended between two uprights forming a horizontal axis.

Steam escapes and [[boiler explosion]]s (typically [[BLEVE]]s) can and have in the past caused great loss of life. While variations in standards may exist in different countries, stringent legal, testing, training, care with manufacture, operation and certification is applied to ensure safety.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nFailure modes may include:\n* over-pressurisation of the boiler\n* insufficient water in the boiler causing overheating and vessel failure\n* buildup of sediment and scale which cause local hot spots, especially in riverboats using dirty feed water\n* pressure vessel failure of the boiler due to inadequate construction or maintenance.\n* escape of steam from pipework/boiler causing scalding\n\nSteam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe. Such [[safety valve]]s traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal is illegally broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nLead [[fusible plug]]s may be present in the crown of the boiler's firebox. If the water level drops, such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly, the [[lead]] melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire. Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire. The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler. If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n== Steam cycle ==\n{{Main|Rankine cycle}}\n{{See also|Thermodynamics|Heat transfer}}\n\n[[File:Rankine cycle layout.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Flow diagram of the four main devices used in the [[Rankine cycle]]. 1).

The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all [[solar thermal|solar]], [[biomass]], [[Coal power|coal]] and [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] [[power plant]]s. It is named after [[William John Macquorn Rankine]], a Scottish [[polymath]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical [[Carnot cycle]] because, when an efficient turbine is used, the [[TS diagram]] begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are [[Isobaric process|isobaric]] (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and [[Isothermal process|isothermal]] (constant [[temperature]]) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle, a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the [[Carnot cycle]]).<!-- check-the source was too ambiguous--> The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.{{sfn|Hunter|1985|p=445}}\n\nThe working fluid in a Rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system, where the working fluid is recycled continuously, or may be an \"open loop\" system, where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere, and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied. Normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties, such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry, abundance, low cost, and its [[Properties of water#Heat capacity and heats of vaporization and fusion|thermodynamic properties]]. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] is the working fluid in the [[mercury vapor turbine]]. Low boiling hydrocarbons can be used in a [[binary cycle]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory; however, the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam. The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser. Watt independently discovered [[latent heat]], which was confirmed by the original discoverer [[Joseph Black]], who also advised Watt on experimental procedures. Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure. Otherwise, the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature.{{sfn|Landes|1969|p=}} The thermodynamic concepts of the Rankine cycle did give engineers the understanding needed to calculate efficiency which aided the development of modern high-pressure and -temperature boilers and the steam turbine.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Efficiency ==\n{{Main|Thermal efficiency}}\n{{See also|Engine efficiency#Steam engine}}\n\nThe efficiency of an engine cycle can be calculated by dividing the energy output of mechanical work that the engine produces by the energy put into the engine by the burning fuel.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe historical measure of a steam engine's energy efficiency was its \"duty\". The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomen designs]]. Duty is the number of [[foot-pounds]] of [[work (physics)|work]] delivered by burning one [[bushel]] (94 pounds) of coal. The best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement over the average Newcomen design. Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressure steam improved this to 65 million.<ref>John Enys, [https://books.google.com/books?id=blhqAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA457 \"Remarks on the Duty of the Steam Engines employed in the Mines of Cornwall at different periods\"], ''Transactions of the Institution of Civil Engineers'', Volume 3 (14 January 1840), p. 457</ref>\n\nNo heat engine can be more efficient than the [[Carnot cycle]], in which heat is moved from a high-temperature reservoir to one at a low temperature, and the efficiency depends on the temperature difference. For the greatest efficiency, steam engines should be operated at the highest steam temperature possible ([[superheater|superheated steam]]), and release the waste heat at the lowest temperature possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe efficiency of a Rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid. Without the pressure reaching [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|supercritical]] levels for the working fluid, the temperature range over which the cycle can operate is small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565&nbsp;\u00b0C (the [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. This gives a theoretical [[Carnot efficiency]] of about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station. This low turbine entry temperature (compared with a [[gas turbine]]) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in [[Combined cycle|combined-cycle gas turbine]] power stations.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nOne principal advantage the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point. By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine (or reciprocating engine) power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. [[Gas turbine]]s, for instance, have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500&nbsp;\u00b0C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern simple cycle gas turbines are fairly well matched.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn practice, a reciprocating steam engine cycle exhausting the steam to atmosphere will typically have an efficiency (including the boiler) in the range of 1\u201310%, but with the addition of a condenser, Corliss valves, multiple expansion, and high steam pressure/temperature, it may be greatly improved, historically into the range of 10\u201320%, and very rarely slightly higher.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nA modern, large electrical power station (producing several hundred megawatts of electrical output) with [[steam reheat]], [[economizer]] etc. will achieve efficiency in the mid 40% range, with the most efficient units approaching 50% thermal efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt is also possible to capture the waste heat using [[cogeneration]] in which the waste heat is used for heating a lower boiling point working fluid or as a heat source for district heating via saturated low-pressure steam.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:GNR N2 1744 at Weybourne - geograph.org.uk - 1479849.jpg|A steam locomotive \u2013 a [[GNR Class N2|GNR N2 Class]] No.1744 at Weybourne nr.
