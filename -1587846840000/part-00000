Rivas was the third player from Puerto Rico to play in the [[NBA]] (after [[Butch Lee]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ortiz (basketball player)|Jos\u00e9 Ortiz]]), and half of the first duo of Puerto Ricans to be active in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] simultaneously (with Ortiz). Rivas has played in the NBA, [[NCAA Division I]], and in the [[National Superior Basketball League of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican National Superior League]] (BSN), with the [[Gigantes de Carolina (basketball)|Carolina Giants]].\n\nRivas also played internationally, in Spain, Greece, and Italy. Rivas was also a member of the senior [[Puerto Rican National Basketball Team]] for several years.  He represented Puerto Rico at the following tournaments: the [[1986 FIBA World Championship]], in M\u00e1laga, Spain; the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympic Games]], in Seoul, South Korea; the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]], in Buenos Aires, Argentina; the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympic Games]], in Barcelona, Spain; and the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Summer Olympics]], in Atlanta, United States.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nAs a youngster, Rivas played at The San Juan [[Y.M.C.A]], for Millin Romero. He progressed through Carolina's minor basketball tournaments, becoming one of the best [[center (basketball)|centers]] in Puerto Rico, while he played for [[Levittown, Puerto Rico|Levittown's]] Pedro Albizu Campos [[high school|High School]]'s team. Flor Melendez took note of his progress, and signed him to play for the [[Gigantes de Carolina (basketball)|Carolina Giants]], of Puerto Rico's top-tier level league, the [[Baloncesto Superior Nacional|BSN]]. That year he was selected BSN Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe changes on the Carolina Giants were evident, when Rivas joined the team: From being one of the worst teams in the league, during the 1983 tournament, they got better every year. In 1987, the team almost reached the BSN playoffs, and, in 1988, the team finally reached the BSN playoffs, for the first time, having the best record in the regular season ('''1989 Regular Season''': PPG.'''24.4''', Reb.'''17.4''' in '''30''' games).\n\n==College career==\nRivas attended [[Temple University]], where he played [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]] with the [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple Owls]], from 1984 to 1988, going on four occasions to the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA post season tournament]]. He was [[basketball coach|coached]] by [[List of coaches in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[head coach]] [[John Chaney (basketball, born 1932)|John Chaney]]. Temple was ranked 1st in the nation in his senior year, with a record of 34 wins and 2 losses. Playing with the Owls helped him gain experience, and improve his game in the [[NCAA]]. He became well-known in the United States, as a [[center (basketball)|center]] who could score points, and rebound in double figures, and was a respected player among his peers.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Signed by the NBA===\nThanks to his notable [[NCAA Division I]] [[college basketball]] career, the [[Boston Celtics]] announced that they would sign Rivas for a full season, towards the end of the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympic Games]], in [[Seoul]]. Having coincided with [[Jos\u00e9 Ortiz (basketball player)|Jos\u00e9 Ortiz]]'s signing by the [[Utah Jazz]] two weeks prior, Rivas' signing by the Celtics was a cause of great celebration for Puerto Ricans, many of whom felt their efforts in basketball were finally being recognized by the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].\n\nWith the Celtics, Rivas had the opportunity to share playing time alongside [[Larry Bird]], [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], [[Dennis Johnson]], [[Robert Parish]], [[Reggie Lewis]], and [[Brian Shaw]], among others. The Celtics reached the playoffs, by beating the [[Washington Bullets]] by two games, for the eighth and final playoff spot in the NBA east that year, but were swept in three games, by the eventual champion [[Detroit Pistons]], in the playoffs' first round.\n\nBecause of his height, Rivas had to change playing positions when he arrived to the Celtics, going from playing [[center (basketball)|center]] in [[Puerto Rico]], to [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] in Boston.\n\nAfter that season with the Celtics, he came back to Puerto Rico, and received his first Puerto Rican League MVP honor, while playing for the [[Gigantes de Carolina (men's basketball)|Carolina Giants]]. That summer, he was signed by a basketball club in Spain, called [[Saski Baskonia|Taugr\u00e9s]], which became his home for the next 7 years.\n\n===Europe===\nRivas played for [[Saski Baskonia|Taugr\u00e9s]] in the [[Liga ACB|Spanish League]] from 1989 until 1996, winning the [[Spanish Basketball King's Cup|Spanish King's Cup]] in [[1995 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto|1995]]. He arrived with the Vitorian team to the [[FIBA Saporta Cup|FIBA European Cup]] (later called FIBA Saporta Cup) Finals in three consecutive years ([[1993\u201394 FIBA European Cup|1994]], [[1994\u201395 FIBA European Cup|1995]], [[1995\u201396 FIBA European Cup|1996]]) finally winning it in the [[1995\u201396 FIBA European Cup|1995\u201396]] season, against [[Peja Stojakovi\u0107]]'s team [[P.A.O.K. B.C.|PAOK]], and becoming [[FIBA Saporta Cup Finals MVP|the Finals MVP]], with 32 points and 15 rebounds. In the 1996\u201397 season, he won the [[Liga ACB|Spanish league]] with [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|FC Barcelona]] and also finished runner-up of the [[1996\u201397 FIBA EuroLeague]], losing to [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] from [[Greek Basket League]]. The following season went to [[Athens]] to play for [[AEK B.C.|AEK]] of [[Giannis Ioannidis]], one of the biggest clubs in Greece, and played in another [[1998 EuroLeague Final Four|EuroLeague Final]] ([[1997\u201398 FIBA EuroLeague]]) against [[Ettore Messina]]'s [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Kinder Bologna]]. In 1998, he went back to Spain, for his final year with the club [[C\u00e1ceres CB|C\u00e1ceres]]. In 1999, he played in Italy for the club [[Fabriano Basket|Fabriano]].\n\n==National team career==\nRivas represented Puerto Rico, as a member of the senior [[Puerto Rican national basketball team]], at the [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympic Games]], in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympic Games]], held at [[Barcelona]], Spain, and the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996 Summer Olympic Games]], held in Atlanta. He also won the gold medal at the [[Basketball at the 1991 Pan American Games|1991 Pan American Games]], and he also played at the [[1986 FIBA World Championship]], and the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]].\n\n==Sports commentator==\nRivas worked for the [[Orlando Magic]] for 9 years, as a [[color commentator|sports broadcasting color analyst]], and for 5 years, for [[Fox Sports (Latin America)|Fox Sports in Spanish]]. He worked as a [[TV]] sports color analyst at the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Summer Olympic Games of Beijing 2008]], and the [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|Summer Olympic Games of London 2012]], next to Edgar Lopez, for [[NBC Telemundo]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.acb.com/jugador.php?id=AFC acb.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126031808/http://www.baskonia.com/web/1000_partidos_rev.asp baskonia.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050307172543/http://www.nba.com/magic/espanol/Meet_Your_Staff-126682-66.html nba.com]\n*[http://www.basketballreference.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=RIVASRA01 basketballreference.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061011201607/http://www.basket-stats.info/olympic-games/1996/teams/puerto-rico.htm basket-stats.info]\n*[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1989.html basketball-reference.com]\n*[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2002/vol6n30/PRSportsBeat0630-en.shtml puertorico-herald.org]\n\n{{FIBA Saporta Cup Finals MVP}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rivas, Ramon}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:AEK B.C. players]]\n[[Category:Baloncesto Superior Nacional players]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 1988 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 1992 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Boston Celtics players]]\n[[Category:Centers (basketball)]]\n[[Category:Liga ACB players]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Olympic basketball players of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:People from Carolina, Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Power forwards (basketball)]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rico men's national basketball team players]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican expatriate sportspeople in Spain]]\n[[Category:Saski Baskonia players]]\n[[Category:Spanish men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Temple Owls men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Undrafted National Basketball Association players]]\n[[Category:1986 FIBA World Championship players]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Puerto Rican basketball player}}\n{{BLP sources|date=July 2011}}\n{{Infobox basketball biography\n| name = Ram\u00f3n Rivas\n| image =\n| caption =\n| league = \n| team = \n| number = 45\n| height_ft = 6\n| height_in = 10\n| weight_lb =  260\n| position = [[Power forward (basketball)|Power forward]] / [[Center (basketball)|Center]]\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1966|6|3}}\n| birth_place = [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]]\n| high_school = Pedro Albizu Campos<br>(Carolina, Puerto Rico)\n| college = [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple]] (1985\u20131988)\n| nationality = Puerto Rican / Spanish\n| draft_year = 1988\n| career_start = 1988\n| career_end = 1999\n| years1 = {{nbay|1988|full=y}}\n| team1 = [[Boston Celtics]]\n| years2 = 1989\u20131996\n| team2 = [[Saski Baskonia|Taugr\u00e9s]]\n| years3 = 1996\u20131997\n| team3 = [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|FC Barcelona]]\n| years4 = 1997\u20131998\n| team4 = [[AEK B.C.|AEK]]\n| years5 = 1998\n| team5 = [[C\u00e1ceres CB|C\u00e1ceres]]\n| years6 = 1998\u20131999\n| team6 = [[Fabriano Basket|Zara Imballaggi Fabriano]]\n| highlights = \n* [[Liga ACB|Spanish League]] champion ([[1996\u201397 ACB season#Championship Playoffs|1997]]) \n* [[Spanish Basketball King's Cup|Spanish Cup]] winner ([[1995 Copa del Rey de Baloncesto|1995]])\n* [[FIBA Saporta Cup|European Cup (FIBA Saporta Cup)]] champion ([[1995\u201396 FIBA European Cup|1996]])\n* [[FIBA Saporta Cup Finals MVP]] (1996)\n* [[BSN Most Valuable Player Award|BSN Most Valuable Player]] (1989)\n* [[Baloncesto Superior Nacional|BSN Rookie of the Year]] (1984)\n| bbr = rivasra01 \n}}\n\n'''Juan Ram\u00f3n Rivas Contreras''' (born March 16, 1966<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rivasra01.html Ram\u00f3n Rivas]. basketball-reference.com</ref>) is a Puerto Rican retired professional [[basketball]] player, and [[color commentator|sports color commentator]].

The group's core consisted of singer and guitarist Milan Mladenovi\u0107, keyboardist [[Margita Stefanovi\u0107]] and bassist [[Bojan Pe\u010dar]], with other members mostly remaining for comparatively shorter periods.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Post-punk years (1982\u20131986) ===\n====Katarina II====\nIn February 1982, following the disbandment of [[\u0160arlo Akrobata]], 24-year-old guitarist and vocalist [[Milan Mladenovi\u0107]] decided to form a new band with an old friend \u2014 22-year-old guitarist [[Dragomir Mihajlovi\u0107|Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107]]. Playing music together again after being bandmates a few years earlier at Limunovo Drvo, Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107 decided to name their new band Katarina II after Mihajlovi\u0107's unrequited love \u2014 a girl named Katarina. Rounding out Katarina II's inaugural lineup were Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 (another former Limunovo Drvo member) on drums and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 on bass guitar. \n\nDuring late 1982, after their performance at the Top\u010diderska zvezda cinema, the band was joined by the 23-year-old classically trained pianist [[Margita Stefanovi\u0107]]. Shortly after, the rhythm section left with Radomirovi\u0107 joining [[Du Du A]] and Dejanovi\u0107 going over to heated rivals [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]].\n\nThe vacant drummer position was filled by Branko \"Mango\" Ku\u0161trin (formerly of [[Grupa I]]), but after he left within a month, Milan's former bandmate from \u0160arlo Akrobata [[Ivan Vdovi\u0107|Ivan \"VD\" Vdovi\u0107]] became the new drummer. At the same time, in early 1983, [[Bojan Pe\u010dar]] (former [[VIA Talas]] bassist) joined on bass. In spring 1983, the band took part in [[Zagreb]] Biennale, receiving positive reviews. Their material for the debut album material was recorded soon after, featuring guest appearance by actor [[Svetislav Gonci\u0107]] on [[tin whistle]]s. The recording sessions for the material were completed in [[Enco Lesi\u0107]]'s Druga Maca studio, however, the material was unusable due to a variety of reasons, most of them having to do with the studio's inferior technical equipment.\n\nThe following year, the band took the offer from fellow musician and [[Radio-Television Slovenia|RTV Ljubljana]]'s musical director [[Sr\u0111an Marjanovi\u0107]] of re-recording their debut album material in the state-owned media company's studios. Katarina II's [[Katarina II (album)|eponymous debut album]] was thus released in 1984 by RTV Ljubljana's in-house record label [[ZKP RTLJ]]. Mostly featuring Mladenovi\u0107's lyrics, except for the Mihajlovi\u0107-written tracks \"Vrt\" (\"The Garden\") and \"Platforme\" (\"The Platforms\"), while the music was a collaboration between the two, the material was produced by \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 featuring guest appearances by Mario \u010celik on congas and [[Film (band)|Film]] member Jurij \"Kuzma Videosex\" Novoseli\u0107 on saxophone. Only 3,000 copies of the album were released, indicative of label's low commercial expectations.<ref name=\"eunet1\">{{cite web|url=http://solair.eunet.rs/~gabriel/intervju9.htm |title=Intervju #9 |publisher=Solair.eunet.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref> Though it got good reviews, receiving praise for successfully linking Mladenovi\u0107's descriptive lyrical sensibility with the energetic new wave sound on tracks like \"Aut\" (\"Out\"), \"Jesen\" (\"Autumn\"), \"Radostan dan\" (\"A Joyful Day\"), \"Treba da se \u010disti\" (\"It Ought To Be Cleaned\"), \"Ja znam\" (\"I Know\"), ''Katarina II'' album was not a commercial success. In a 1985 interview Mladenovi\u0107 complained about the album's poor sound quality, as well as what he felt to be lack of support from the label.<ref name=\"eunet1\">{{cite web|url=http://solair.eunet.rs/~gabriel/intervju9.htm |title=Intervju #9 |publisher=Solair.eunet.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref>\n\nSoon after their debut album, the band went through more lineup changes amid disagreements and personality clashes between Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107. Mihajlovi\u0107 also ran afoul of the law \u2014 a transgression that got him a jail stint \u2014 and after serving the punishment got informed by the rest of the band he was no longer a Katarina II member. However, since Mihajlovi\u0107 claimed rights to the \"Katarina II\" name, he forced the band into using another one. Later he collaborated with [[Vlada Divljan]] before moving to the [[United States]] where he has been residing ever since. Additionally, drummer Vdovi\u0107 left due to drug abuse problems, later joining [[Du Du A]] and the band [[Heroji (band)|Heroji]], being replaced by the former [[Luna (Serbian band)|Luna]] drummer [[Ivan Fece|Ivan \"Firchie\" Fece]]. The remaining members continued working as Ekatarina Velika, after [[Catherine II of Russia]], or EKV for short. Due to constant [[SFR Yugoslavia]]-wide touring, with frequent stops in [[Belgrade]], [[Zagreb]] and [[Ljubljana]], and occasional TV spots, the band's popularity had gradually grown.\n\n====Ekatarina Velika====\nIn early 1985, the band recorded their second studio album at [[SIM studio]] in Zagreb. Produced by Vladimir Smolec featuring guest appearances by [[Massimo Savi\u0107]] as well as Karlowy Wary member and SIM studio co-owner [[Tomo in der M\u00fchlen]], ''[[Ekatarina Velika (album)|Ekatarina Velika]]'' gave the band with its first bona fide hits, \"O\u010di boje meda\" (\"Honey Colored Eyes\"), \"Modro i zeleno\" (\"Indigo and Green\") and \"Tattoo\". In keeping with the theme of the \"Tattoo\" track, the album cover arranged by [[Du\u0161an Gerzi\u0107]] features the band members painted in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ritual body art. After the album release on 22 March 1985, they played outside of Yugoslavia for the first time, making a positive impression at Culture Days in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. Another memorable concert took place in Zagreb as part of ''Bolje vas na\u0161li'' Belgrade-Zagreb band exchange.\n\nTowards the end of 1985, Fece left the band to serve his mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army]] service, later joining [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], and was replaced by Ivan \"Raka\" Rankovi\u0107 from the band [[Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i]]. The following year, the new lineup released the third studio album ''[[S vetrom uz lice (album)|S vetrom uz lice]]'' (''Faced Against the Wind''), proving to be the breakthrough album that turned them into bona fide stars. The album was produced by Milan Mladenovi\u0107, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 and Dragan \u010ca\u010dinovi\u0107, extensively using the [[E-mu Emulator II]] 8-bit sampler. With the hits \"Budi sam na ulici\" (\"Be Alone on the Street\"), \"Ti si sav moj bol\" (\"You Are All My Anguish\"), \"Novac u rukama\" (\"Money in the Hands\"), and \"Kao da je bilo nekad\" (\"As If It Had Once Been\") came some lukewarm reviews from the critics complaining about the similarities to the works of the [[Simple Minds]].\n\nAfter the album release, the band toured extensively all over former Yugoslavia, and the recording of one of the five sold-out performances at the Zagreb club [[Kulu\u0161i\u0107]], made on 2 November 1986, was released in early 1987 on the live album ''[[19LIVE86]]''. The band promoted the release of the live album in Belgrade during January 1987 and triumphed at [[Dom omladine Beograda|Dom Omladine]] with six sold-out shows. During spring of the same year, Ivan Rankovi\u0107 decided to leave EKV in order to form a new group Ulica Od Meseca with his old bandmates from Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i. Rankovi\u0107 was replaced by the actor [[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]], a former [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]] member, as  drummer, playing his first show on 9 April 1987 at the New Rock festival held at the La Locomotive club in [[Paris]]. On autumn of the same year, the band got the Sedam Sekretara SKOJa award for the achievements on the second and third studio album.\n\n=== Alternative rock years (1987\u20131991) ===\nDuring the summer of 1987, the band released the album ''[[Ljubav (Ekatarina Velika album)|Ljubav]]'' (''Love''), co-produced by the band with the [[Australia]]n musician Theodore Yanni. It displayed a more guitar-oriented sound, along with stylized sleeve done by Margita and artist [[Vuk Vidor]]. Prominent tracks from the album include \"Zemlja\" (\"Earth\"), \"7 Dana\" (\"7 Days\"), \"Pored mene\" (\"Beside Me\"), \"Ljudi iz gradova\" (\"People From The Cities\"), and \"Ljubav\" (\"Love\"). It had also shown the first signs of Milan's depressive lyrics, as exemplified by song \"Tonemo\" (\"We Are Sinking\"). The album had also confirmed their live attraction status with two consecutive sold out shows at Belgrade's [[Pionir Hall]] sports arena. New extensive tour commenced in early 1988, and EKV enlisted help from [[Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107]] of [[Oktobar 1864]] and [[Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107]] from [[Van Gogh (band)|Van Gogh]] to appear as backing live musicians. Fece had also promptly rejoined the band on tour, shortly replacing Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 before moving away to [[New York City]] in May 1988.\n\nIn January 1989, the band finished the recording sessions for the album ''[[Samo par godina za nas (album)|Samo par godina za nas]]'' (''Only a Few Years for Us''), released during the same year, featuring guest appearances by [[Mitar Suboti\u0107]] (guitar, album production) and Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 (backing vocals). The critics regarded this album as a mere of the concept from the previous album. Several hits from the album include \"Krug\" (\"The Circle\"), \"Par godina za nas\" (\"A Few Years for Us\"), and \"Srce\" (\"Heart\"). Despite the mixed critics, the band were at their peak performing at the EBU-UER rock festival in [[Novi Sad]], the 1990 [[Midem]] festival in [[Cannes]] and the first [[Europe]]an rock music Bienalle held in [[Toulouse]]. After the tour, Todorovi\u0107 left the band, focusing on his acting career. Bojan Pe\u010dar also decided to leave the band moving to [[London]]. The new members became the former [[VIA Talas]], [[D' Boys]] and [[Piloti]] member Mi\u0161ko Petrovi\u0107 \"Plavi\" on bass and the former [[U \u0160kripcu]] member [[Marko Milivojevi\u0107]] on drums.\n\nThe sixth studio album ''[[Dum Dum (Ekatarina Velika album)|Dum dum]]'' (''Bang Bang''), released in 1991, featured the [[Plejboj]] member Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107 and session musician Bata Bo\u017eani\u0107 as bass players, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 on backing vocals, Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 on guitar and Mitar Suboti\u0107 on keyboards and machines. The album, produced by Theodore Yanni, featured the prominent songs \"Zabranjujem\" (\"I Forbid\"), \"Idemo\" (\"Let's Go\"), \"Dum dum\" (\"Bang Bang\") and \"Bledo\" (\"Pale\"), inspired by the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and the general political and economic situation in the country. The following year, Mladenovi\u0107 participated in the antiwar project [[Rimtutituki]], also featuring [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] and [[Partibrejkers]] members, releasing the single \"Slu\u0161aj 'vamo\" (\"Listen Up\").\n\n=== Mainstream rock years (1992\u20131994) ===\nDuring the middle of 1992 the band toured with the new bassist Dragi\u0161a Uskokovi\u0107 \"\u0106ima\", with whom they recorded the final studio album ''[[Neko nas posmatra (album)|Neko nas posmatra]]'' (''Somebody Is Watching Us''), released in May 1993. The album featured a more accessible and communicative sound especially present in the songs \"Ponos\" (\"Pride\"), \"Jadransko more\" (\"The [[Adriatic Sea]]\"), \"Just Let Me Play Some Modern R'n'R Music\" and \"Zajedno\" (\"Together\"). For the first time, the band had included a cover song on and album, \"Istina Ma\u0161ina\" (\"Truth Machine\"), originally performed by the [[SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene|Yugoslav rock]] band [[Time (rock band)|Time]]. The album was produced by Mladenovi\u0107 and featured Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 and a childer choir as guest performers.\n\nAfter the album release, in September of the same year, Ekatarina Velika, [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]], [[Partibrejkers]] and the [[Zagreb]] band [[Vje\u0161tice]] performed in [[Prague]] and [[Berlin]] on the concerts entitled ''Ko to tamo pjeva'' (''[[Who's That Singing Over There]]''). At the time, Mladenovi\u0107 and Stefanovi\u0107 held occasional [[Acoustic music|unplugged]] club performances, often featuring guest appearances by the Partibrejkers guitarist [[Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107|Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107 \"Anton\"]] and various jazz musicians, until Milan's departure to [[Brazil]], where he worked on a project called Angel's Breath, together with Mitar Suboti\u0107 and a line-up of Brazilian musicians. The two started recording the material partially written in 1985 when, with the guitarist [[Goran Vejvoda]], they had several live appearances under the moniker Dah An\u0111ela (''Angel's Breath'').\n\n=== Breakup and post-breakup ===\nThe band resumed their activities when Mladenovi\u0107 returned to Yugoslavia. There were plans to make a new album, tentatively titled ''Ponovo zajedno'' (''Together Again''), but the idea was shelved because of Milan's health problems. EKV played what would turn out to be their last ever show on 24 August 1994 in [[Budva]] at the [[Pjesma Mediterana]] festival. The very next day Milan was held in a hospital, and it was soon discovered that he had [[pancreatic cancer]]. Barely a few months later, on 5 November 1994, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died in Belgrade, at the age of 36, thus Ekatarina Velika ceased to exist.\n\nMargita Stefanovi\u0107 continued working as a musician, for a short period of time performing with the cover band Kurajberi. In 1995, with Vladimir Stojanovi\u0107, as an [[ambiental music]] duo EQV, she released the album ''Ti si sav moj bol'' (''You Are All My Anguish''), released by the [[Austria]]n record label Coop Arts Crafts Unltd. In October of the same year, EQV appeared at the [[Vienna]] Talkit festival. She had also made occasional live appearances with the bands [[Direktori]], Glisers and Zion Banda, and appeared as guest on the albums of several Belgrade rock bands. In 1996, she appeared on the [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] unplugged live album ''[[\u017divo i akusti\u010dno]]'' (''Live and Acoustic''), and in 1998, on the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] signing, she appeared in [[Pula]] with Zoran Stojanovi\u0107, the leader of the [[Zagreb]] band Veliki Bijeli Slon, being, along with [[Rambo Amadeus]], the first Serbian musician to play in [[Croatia]] after the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nDuring the early 1997, a posthumous live album entitled ''Live '88'' was released, featuring the recordings of the performances from Zagreb and Novi Sad held during the 1988 tour. The Zagreb recordings, made at the Kulu\u0161i\u0107 club, were announced by the rock critic [[Dra\u017een Vrdoljak]] and featured Theodore Yanni on guest guitar. The live recordings were owned by Fece who initiated the album release. During the same year, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 founded the record label EKV Records and started reissuing EKV studio album with bonus material. The ''Ljubav'' reissue featured live bonus material made at the Belgrade Dom Omladine on 13 November 1991 and the 1988 Novi Sad SNP performance, ''Samo par godina za nas'' featured the live bonus tracks from the Avala fest held in September 1990 and ''Dum dum'' featured alternate and demo recordings and the 1991 Dom Omladine live tracks.\n\n[[PGP RTS]] also contributed the CD reissuing by releasing the compilation album ''Kao nada, kao govor, kao more...'' (''Like Hope, Like Speech, Like the Sea...'') in 1997, featuring selected material from the latter four studio albums. During 2001 and 2002, EKV Records and IPS music reissued the rest of the band's catalog, also featuring bonus live material. The label also released the live album ''Kao u snu - EKV live 1991'' (''As If in a Dream - EKV Live 1991'') featuring the Belgrade Dom Omladine 1991 performance. During the same year, a tribute album ''Kao da je bilo nekad... (Posve\u0107eno Milanu Mladenovi\u0107u)'' (''As If It Had Once Been'') was released. The following year, a live tribute album ''Jako dobar tattoo - Tribute to EKV'' (''A Very Good Tatto - Tribute to EKV'') was released.\n\nIn 2017, Mascom Records released the double live album ''Krug'' (''The Circle''), featuring the recording of Mladenovi\u0107's and Stefanovi\u0107's unplugged performance held in [[Pri\u0161tina]] in May 1994, only half a year before Mladenovi\u0107's death.<ref>[http://www.rockomotiva.com/fresh/albumi/nikada-objavljeni-snimak-ekatarine-velike-zatvaranje-kruga/ \"Nikada objavljeni snimak Ekatarine Velike: Zatvaranje \u2018Kruga\u2019\", Rockomotiva.com]</ref>\n\nIvan Vdovi\u0107 died of [[AIDS]] on 25 September 1992 at age 31. Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died of pancreatic cancer on 5 November 1994 at age 36. Bojan Pe\u010dar died of a heart attack on 13 October 1998 at age 38. Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 died of AIDS on 16 November 2000. On 18 September 2002 Margita Stefanovi\u0107 died at age 43, being the fifth band member to die prematurely.\n\n== Legacy ==\nEkatarina Velika is considered one of the top and most influential acts of the [[yu rock|former Yugoslav rock scene]].

Another band highly inspired by EKV is the alternative rock band [[Block Out (band)|Block Out]]. The band's work was also praised by Yugoslav rock icons like Rambo Amadeus and Dado Topic\n\nIn 2003, a tribute album to Mladenovi\u0107 entitled ''[[Kao da je bilo nekad...

The group's core consisted of singer and guitarist Milan Mladenovi\u0107, keyboardist [[Margita Stefanovi\u0107]] and bassist [[Bojan Pe\u010dar]], with other members mostly remaining for comparatively shorter periods.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Post-punk years (1982\u20131986) ===\n====Katarina II====\nIn February 1982, following the disbandment of [[\u0160arlo Akrobata]], 24-year-old guitarist and vocalist [[Milan Mladenovi\u0107]] decided to form a new band with an old friend \u2014 22-year-old guitarist [[Dragomir Mihajlovi\u0107|Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107]]. Playing music together again after being bandmates a few years earlier at Limunovo Drvo, Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107 decided to name their new band Katarina II after Mihajlovi\u0107's unrequited love \u2014 a girl named Katarina. Rounding out Katarina II's inaugural lineup were Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 (another former Limunovo Drvo member) on drums and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 on bass guitar. \n\nDuring late 1982, after their performance at the Top\u010diderska zvezda cinema, the band was joined by the 23-year-old classically trained pianist [[Margita Stefanovi\u0107]]. Shortly after, the rhythm section left with Radomirovi\u0107 joining [[Du Du A]] and Dejanovi\u0107 going over to heated rivals [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]].\n\nThe vacant drummer position was filled by Branko \"Mango\" Ku\u0161trin (formerly of [[Grupa I]]), but after he left within a month, Milan's former bandmate from \u0160arlo Akrobata [[Ivan Vdovi\u0107|Ivan \"VD\" Vdovi\u0107]] became the new drummer. At the same time, in early 1983, [[Bojan Pe\u010dar]] (former [[VIA Talas]] bassist) joined on bass. In spring 1983, the band took part in [[Zagreb]] Biennale, receiving positive reviews. Their material for the debut album material was recorded soon after, featuring guest appearance by actor [[Svetislav Gonci\u0107]] on [[tin whistle]]s. The recording sessions for the material were completed in [[Enco Lesi\u0107]]'s Druga Maca studio, however, the material was unusable due to a variety of reasons, most of them having to do with the studio's inferior technical equipment.\n\nThe following year, the band took the offer from fellow musician and [[Radio-Television Slovenia|RTV Ljubljana]]'s musical director [[Sr\u0111an Marjanovi\u0107]] of re-recording their debut album material in the state-owned media company's studios. Katarina II's [[Katarina II (album)|eponymous debut album]] was thus released in 1984 by RTV Ljubljana's in-house record label [[ZKP RTLJ]]. Mostly featuring Mladenovi\u0107's lyrics, except for the Mihajlovi\u0107-written tracks \"Vrt\" (\"The Garden\") and \"Platforme\" (\"The Platforms\"), while the music was a collaboration between the two, the material was produced by \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 featuring guest appearances by Mario \u010celik on congas and [[Film (band)|Film]] member Jurij \"Kuzma Videosex\" Novoseli\u0107 on saxophone. Only 3,000 copies of the album were released, indicative of label's low commercial expectations.<ref name=\"eunet1\">{{cite web|url=http://solair.eunet.rs/~gabriel/intervju9.htm |title=Intervju #9 |publisher=Solair.eunet.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref> Though it got good reviews, receiving praise for successfully linking Mladenovi\u0107's descriptive lyrical sensibility with the energetic new wave sound on tracks like \"Aut\" (\"Out\"), \"Jesen\" (\"Autumn\"), \"Radostan dan\" (\"A Joyful Day\"), \"Treba da se \u010disti\" (\"It Ought To Be Cleaned\"), \"Ja znam\" (\"I Know\"), ''Katarina II'' album was not a commercial success. In a 1985 interview Mladenovi\u0107 complained about the album's poor sound quality, as well as what he felt to be lack of support from the label.<ref name=\"eunet1\">{{cite web|url=http://solair.eunet.rs/~gabriel/intervju9.htm |title=Intervju #9 |publisher=Solair.eunet.rs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref>\n\nSoon after their debut album, the band went through more lineup changes amid disagreements and personality clashes between Mladenovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107. Mihajlovi\u0107 also ran afoul of the law \u2014 a transgression that got him a jail stint \u2014 and after serving the punishment got informed by the rest of the band he was no longer a Katarina II member. However, since Mihajlovi\u0107 claimed rights to the \"Katarina II\" name, he forced the band into using another one. Later he collaborated with [[Vlada Divljan]] before moving to the [[United States]] where he has been residing ever since. Additionally, drummer Vdovi\u0107 left due to drug abuse problems, later joining [[Du Du A]] and the band [[Heroji (band)|Heroji]], being replaced by the former [[Luna (Serbian band)|Luna]] drummer [[Ivan Fece|Ivan \"Firchie\" Fece]]. The remaining members continued working as Ekatarina Velika, after [[Catherine II of Russia]], or EKV for short. Due to constant [[SFR Yugoslavia]]-wide touring, with frequent stops in [[Belgrade]], [[Zagreb]] and [[Ljubljana]], and occasional TV spots, the band's popularity had gradually grown.\n\n====Ekatarina Velika====\nIn early 1985, the band recorded their second studio album at [[SIM studio]] in Zagreb. Produced by Vladimir Smolec featuring guest appearances by [[Massimo Savi\u0107]] as well as Karlowy Wary member and SIM studio co-owner [[Tomo in der M\u00fchlen]], ''[[Ekatarina Velika (album)|Ekatarina Velika]]'' gave the band with its first bona fide hits, \"O\u010di boje meda\" (\"Honey Colored Eyes\"), \"Modro i zeleno\" (\"Indigo and Green\") and \"Tattoo\". In keeping with the theme of the \"Tattoo\" track, the album cover arranged by [[Du\u0161an Gerzi\u0107]] features the band members painted in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ritual body art. After the album release on 22 March 1985, they played outside of Yugoslavia for the first time, making a positive impression at Culture Days in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. Another memorable concert took place in Zagreb as part of ''Bolje vas na\u0161li'' Belgrade-Zagreb band exchange.\n\nTowards the end of 1985, Fece left the band to serve his mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army]] service, later joining [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], and was replaced by Ivan \"Raka\" Rankovi\u0107 from the band [[Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i]]. The following year, the new lineup released the third studio album ''[[S vetrom uz lice (album)|S vetrom uz lice]]'' (''Faced Against the Wind''), proving to be the breakthrough album that turned them into bona fide stars. The album was produced by Milan Mladenovi\u0107, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 and Dragan \u010ca\u010dinovi\u0107, extensively using the [[E-mu Emulator II]] 8-bit sampler. With the hits \"Budi sam na ulici\" (\"Be Alone on the Street\"), \"Ti si sav moj bol\" (\"You Are All My Anguish\"), \"Novac u rukama\" (\"Money in the Hands\"), and \"Kao da je bilo nekad\" (\"As If It Had Once Been\") came some lukewarm reviews from the critics complaining about the similarities to the works of the [[Simple Minds]].\n\nAfter the album release, the band toured extensively all over former Yugoslavia, and the recording of one of the five sold-out performances at the Zagreb club [[Kulu\u0161i\u0107]], made on 2 November 1986, was released in early 1987 on the live album ''[[19LIVE86]]''. The band promoted the release of the live album in Belgrade during January 1987 and triumphed at [[Dom omladine Beograda|Dom Omladine]] with six sold-out shows. During spring of the same year, Ivan Rankovi\u0107 decided to leave EKV in order to form a new group Ulica Od Meseca with his old bandmates from Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i. Rankovi\u0107 was replaced by the actor [[Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107]], a former [[Disciplina Ki\u010dme]] member, as  drummer, playing his first show on 9 April 1987 at the New Rock festival held at the La Locomotive club in [[Paris]]. On autumn of the same year, the band got the Sedam Sekretara SKOJa award for the achievements on the second and third studio album.\n\n=== Alternative rock years (1987\u20131991) ===\nDuring the summer of 1987, the band released the album ''[[Ljubav (Ekatarina Velika album)|Ljubav]]'' (''Love''), co-produced by the band with the [[Australia]]n musician Theodore Yanni. It displayed a more guitar-oriented sound, along with stylized sleeve done by Margita and artist [[Vuk Vidor]]. Prominent tracks from the album include \"Zemlja\" (\"Earth\"), \"7 Dana\" (\"7 Days\"), \"Pored mene\" (\"Beside Me\"), \"Ljudi iz gradova\" (\"People From The Cities\"), and \"Ljubav\" (\"Love\"). It had also shown the first signs of Milan's depressive lyrics, as exemplified by song \"Tonemo\" (\"We Are Sinking\"). The album had also confirmed their live attraction status with two consecutive sold out shows at Belgrade's [[Pionir Hall]] sports arena. New extensive tour commenced in early 1988, and EKV enlisted help from [[Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107]] of [[Oktobar 1864]] and [[Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107]] from [[Van Gogh (band)|Van Gogh]] to appear as backing live musicians. Fece had also promptly rejoined the band on tour, shortly replacing Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 before moving away to [[New York City]] in May 1988.\n\nIn January 1989, the band finished the recording sessions for the album ''[[Samo par godina za nas (album)|Samo par godina za nas]]'' (''Only a Few Years for Us''), released during the same year, featuring guest appearances by [[Mitar Suboti\u0107]] (guitar, album production) and Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 (backing vocals). The critics regarded this album as a mere of the concept from the previous album. Several hits from the album include \"Krug\" (\"The Circle\"), \"Par godina za nas\" (\"A Few Years for Us\"), and \"Srce\" (\"Heart\"). Despite the mixed critics, the band were at their peak performing at the EBU-UER rock festival in [[Novi Sad]], the 1990 [[Midem]] festival in [[Cannes]] and the first [[Europe]]an rock music bienalle held in [[Toulouse]]. After the tour, Todorovi\u0107 left the band, focusing on his acting career. Bojan Pe\u010dar also decided to leave the band moving to [[London]]. The new members became the former [[VIA Talas]], [[D' Boys]] and [[Piloti]] member Mi\u0161ko Petrovi\u0107 \"Plavi\" on bass and the former [[U \u0160kripcu]] member [[Marko Milivojevi\u0107]] on drums.\n\nThe sixth studio album ''[[Dum Dum (Ekatarina Velika album)|Dum dum]]'' (''Bang Bang''), released in 1991, featured the [[Plejboj]] member Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107 and session musician Bata Bo\u017eani\u0107 as bass players, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 on backing vocals, Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 on guitar and Mitar Suboti\u0107 on keyboards and machines. The album, produced by Theodore Yanni, featured the prominent songs \"Zabranjujem\" (\"I Forbid\"), \"Idemo\" (\"Let's Go\"), \"Dum dum\" (\"Bang Bang\") and \"Bledo\" (\"Pale\"), inspired by the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and the general political and economic situation in the country. The following year, Mladenovi\u0107 participated in the antiwar project [[Rimtutituki]], also featuring [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] and [[Partibrejkers]] members, releasing the single \"Slu\u0161aj 'vamo\" (\"Listen Up\").\n\n=== Mainstream rock years (1992\u20131994) ===\nDuring the middle of 1992 the band toured with the new bassist Dragi\u0161a Uskokovi\u0107 \"\u0106ima\", with whom they recorded the final studio album ''[[Neko nas posmatra (album)|Neko nas posmatra]]'' (''Somebody Is Watching Us''), released in May 1993. The album featured a more accessible and communicative sound especially present in the songs \"Ponos\" (\"Pride\"), \"Jadransko more\" (\"The [[Adriatic Sea]]\"), \"Just Let Me Play Some Modern R'n'R Music\" and \"Zajedno\" (\"Together\"). For the first time, the band had included a cover song on and album, \"Istina Ma\u0161ina\" (\"Truth Machine\"), originally performed by the [[SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene|Yugoslav rock]] band [[Time (rock band)|Time]]. The album was produced by Mladenovi\u0107 and featured Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 and a childer choir as guest performers.\n\nAfter the album release, in September of the same year, Ekatarina Velika, [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]], [[Partibrejkers]] and the [[Zagreb]] band [[Vje\u0161tice]] performed in [[Prague]] and [[Berlin]] on the concerts entitled ''Ko to tamo pjeva'' (''[[Who's That Singing Over There]]''). At the time, Mladenovi\u0107 and Stefanovi\u0107 held occasional [[Acoustic music|unplugged]] club performances, often featuring guest appearances by the Partibrejkers guitarist [[Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107|Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107 \"Anton\"]] and various jazz musicians, until Milan's departure to [[Brazil]], where he worked on a project called Angel's Breath, together with Mitar Suboti\u0107 and a line-up of Brazilian musicians. The two started recording the material partially written in 1985 when, with the guitarist [[Goran Vejvoda]], they had several live appearances under the moniker Dah An\u0111ela (''Angel's Breath'').\n\n=== Breakup and post-breakup ===\nThe band resumed their activities when Mladenovi\u0107 returned to Yugoslavia. There were plans to make a new album, tentatively titled ''Ponovo zajedno'' (''Together Again''), but the idea was shelved because of Milan's health problems. EKV played what would turn out to be their last ever show on 24 August 1994 in [[Budva]] at the [[Pjesma Mediterana]] festival. The very next day Milan was held in a hospital, and it was soon discovered that he had [[pancreatic cancer]]. Barely a few months later, on 5 November 1994, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died in Belgrade, at the age of 36, thus Ekatarina Velika ceased to exist.\n\nMargita Stefanovi\u0107 continued working as a musician, for a short period of time performing with the cover band Kurajberi. In 1995, with Vladimir Stojanovi\u0107, as an [[ambiental music]] duo EQV, she released the album ''Ti si sav moj bol'' (''You Are All My Anguish''), released by the [[Austria]]n record label Coop Arts Crafts Unltd. In October of the same year, EQV appeared at the [[Vienna]] Talkit festival. She had also made occasional live appearances with the bands [[Direktori]], Glisers and Zion Banda, and appeared as guest on the albums of several Belgrade rock bands. In 1996, she appeared on the [[Elektri\u010dni Orgazam]] unplugged live album ''[[\u017divo i akusti\u010dno]]'' (''Live and Acoustic''), and in 1998, on the fiftieth anniversary of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] signing, she appeared in [[Pula]] with Zoran Stojanovi\u0107, the leader of the [[Zagreb]] band Veliki Bijeli Slon, being, along with [[Rambo Amadeus]], the first Serbian musician to play in [[Croatia]] after the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nDuring the early 1997, a posthumous live album entitled ''Live '88'' was released, featuring the recordings of the performances from Zagreb and Novi Sad held during the 1988 tour. The Zagreb recordings, made at the Kulu\u0161i\u0107 club, were announced by the rock critic [[Dra\u017een Vrdoljak]] and featured Theodore Yanni on guest guitar. The live recordings were owned by Fece who initiated the album release. During the same year, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 founded the record label EKV Records and started reissuing EKV studio album with bonus material. The ''Ljubav'' reissue featured live bonus material made at the Belgrade Dom Omladine on 13 November 1991 and the 1988 Novi Sad SNP performance, ''Samo par godina za nas'' featured the live bonus tracks from the Avala fest held in September 1990 and ''Dum dum'' featured alternate and demo recordings and the 1991 Dom Omladine live tracks.\n\n[[PGP RTS]] also contributed the CD reissuing by releasing the compilation album ''Kao nada, kao govor, kao more...'' (''Like Hope, Like Speech, Like the Sea...'') in 1997, featuring selected material from the latter four studio albums. During 2001 and 2002, EKV Records and IPS music reissued the rest of the band's catalog, also featuring bonus live material. The label also released the live album ''Kao u snu - EKV live 1991'' (''As If in a Dream - EKV Live 1991'') featuring the Belgrade Dom Omladine 1991 performance. During the same year, a tribute album ''Kao da je bilo nekad... (Posve\u0107eno Milanu Mladenovi\u0107u)'' (''As If It Had Once Been'') was released. The following year, a live tribute album ''Jako dobar tattoo - Tribute to EKV'' (''A Very Good Tatto - Tribute to EKV'') was released.\n\nIn 2017, Mascom Records released the double live album ''Krug'' (''The Circle''), featuring the recording of Mladenovi\u0107's and Stefanovi\u0107's unplugged performance held in [[Pri\u0161tina]] in May 1994, only half a year before Mladenovi\u0107's death.<ref>[http://www.rockomotiva.com/fresh/albumi/nikada-objavljeni-snimak-ekatarine-velike-zatvaranje-kruga/ \"Nikada objavljeni snimak Ekatarine Velike: Zatvaranje \u2018Kruga\u2019\", Rockomotiva.com]</ref>\n\nIvan Vdovi\u0107 died of [[AIDS]] on 25 September 1992 at age 31. Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died of pancreatic cancer on 5 November 1994 at age 36. Bojan Pe\u010dar died of a heart attack on 13 October 1998 at age 38.

The town was repopulated by Poles, most of whom were themselves expelled from the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|former eastern territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]].\n\nNumerous pre-war [[Pomeranian Wall|ruins of German fortifications and bunkers]] are found in woods surrounding Wa\u0142cz, especially in proximity to the lakes.

Lake Radu\u0144 is spanned by a [[suspension bridge]]. Next to the bridge in a beechwood forest is an Olympic Training Facility, the 'Bukowina'. Immediately after [[World War II]], Winand Osi\u0144ski and Olympic coach Jan Mulak founded the training centre and began training with the Polish track and field teams who represented Poland during the 50s and 60s. Poland's Olympic [[kayak]] team trains here to this day.\n\nOn this lake is also the City Centre for Sport and Recreation (MOSiR - Miejski O\u015brodek Sportu i Rekreacji) which makes a wide range of sporting equipment available, including motor boats, kayaks, water bikes and the leisure boat ''Delfin''. The centre also serves as a starting point for numerous walking and biking trails as well as kayak excursions. The so-called ''P\u0119tla Wa\u0142ecka'', a kayaking route that traverses six lakes begins here and ends at Lake Byty\u0144 Wielki.\n\nSituated on the shores of the lakes are numerous beaches, swimming areas, camping spots and sporting equipment rentals.\n\nWithin a short distance of the city are several equally attractive lakes including Chmiel Du\u017cy, Chmiel Ma\u0142y, Radu\u0144 Ma\u0142y, Ostrowiec Wielki, \u0141ubianka, \u0141ab\u0119dzie.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n==Architecture==\n{{multiple image |align=right |perrow=2 |total_width=350 |header=Architecture of Wa\u0142cz (examples)\n| image1=Walcz kosciol sw Mikolaja (1).jpg\n| image2=Bank PeKao SA.jpg\n| image3=Wa\u0142cz, Gimnazjum nr 2 01.JPG\n| image4=Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.

Deutsch Krone, having a predominantly German population, remained part of [[Weimar Germany]] and was part of the [[Posen\u2013West Prussia|Grenzmark Posen\u2013Westpreussen]] until 1938 and then was assigned to [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pommern]].

After the end of [[World War II]], the town was put under Polish administration according to the [[Potsdam Conference]] and [[Commission for the Determination of Place Names|renamed]] to its historic name ''Wa\u0142cz''. Also in accordance to the [[Potsdam Agreement]], its German inhabitants were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]]. The town was repopulated by Poles, most of whom were themselves expelled from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]].\n\nNumerous pre-war [[Pomeranian Wall|ruins of German fortifications and bunkers]] are found in woods surrounding Wa\u0142cz, especially in proximity to the lakes. Most of them however are inaccessible \u2014 blown up or filled with soil, to prevent accidents with careless tourists.\n\nThe lack of heavy industry in Wa\u0142cz and the surrounding areas has helped the city to maintain relative ecological cleanliness and is an excellent location for rest and relaxation. It has a post office that was built during the reign of Napoleon in Europe\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:walcz most.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Suspension bridge on Radu\u0144 in winter]]\n[[File:walcz radun.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Lake Radu\u0144 view from beechwood forest]]\n[[File:walcz zamkowe.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Lake Zamkowe, city park]]\n\nThere are two large lakes within city limits: Radu\u0144 (area - {{convert|227.10|ha|km2 sqmi|2}}, length - {{convert|6050|m|ft|abbr=on}}, shoreline - over {{convert|19000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, maximum depth - {{convert|25.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, average depth - {{convert|10.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and Zamkowe (area - {{convert|129.57|ha|km2 sqmi|2}}, length - {{convert|3350|m|ft|abbr=on}}, shoreline - over {{convert|10950|m|ft|abbr=on}}, maximum depth - {{convert|41|m|ft|abbr=on}}, average depth - {{convert|12.9|m|ft|abbr=on}}). Lake Radu\u0144 is spanned by a [[suspension bridge]]. Next to the bridge in a beechwood forest is an Olympic Training Facility, the 'Bukowina'. Immediately after [[World War II]], Winand Osi\u0144ski and Olympic coach Jan Mulak founded the training centre and began training with the Polish track and field teams who represented Poland during the 50s and 60s. Poland's Olympic [[kayak]] team trains here to this day.\n\nOn this lake is also the City Centre for Sport and Recreation (MOSiR - Miejski O\u015brodek Sportu i Rekreacji) which makes a wide range of sporting equipment available, including motor boats, kayaks, water bikes and the leisure boat ''Delfin''. The centre also serves as a starting point for numerous walking and biking trails as well as kayak excursions. The so-called ''P\u0119tla Wa\u0142ecka'', a kayaking route that traverses six lakes begins here and ends at Lake Byty\u0144 Wielki.\n\nSituated on the shores of the lakes are numerous beaches, swimming areas, camping spots and sporting equipment rentals.\n\nWithin a short distance of the city are several equally attractive lakes including Chmiel Du\u017cy, Chmiel Ma\u0142y, Radu\u0144 Ma\u0142y, Ostrowiec Wielki, \u0141ubianka, \u0141ab\u0119dzie.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n==Architecture==\n{{multiple image |align=right |perrow=2 |total_width=350 |header=Architecture of Wa\u0142cz (examples)\n| image1=Walcz kosciol sw Mikolaja (1).jpg\n| image2=Bank PeKao SA.jpg\n| image3=Wa\u0142cz, Gimnazjum nr 2 01.JPG\n| image4=Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.
