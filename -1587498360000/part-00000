It is the traditional centre of the densely-forested [[Bosanska Krajina]] region of northwestern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. {{As of|2013||alt=According to the 2013 census|df=}}, the city proper has a population of 138,963, while its administrative area comprises a total of 185,042 inhabitants.\n\nThe city is home to the [[University of Banja Luka]] as well as numerous state and entity institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The city lies on the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas River]] and is well known in the countries of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] for being full of tree-lined avenues, boulevards, gardens, and parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|title=\u0410\u0421\u0411\u041b >> General information|website=www.banjaluka.rs.ba|access-date=2 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815215526/http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|archive-date=15 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe name 'Banja Luka' was first mentioned in a document dated to 6 February 1494 by [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Ladislaus II of Hungary]]. The name is interpreted as the 'Ban's meadow', from the words ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' (a mediaeval noble title), and ''luka'' ('valley' or 'meadow'). The identity of the ban and the meadow in question remain uncertain, and [[popular etymology]] combines the modern words ''banja'' ('bath' or 'spa'), or ''bajna'' ('marvelous') and ''luka'' ('port'). A different interpretation is suggested by the Hungarian name ''Luk\u00e1csb\u00e1nya'', in English 'Luke's Mine',  which is also the meaning of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''ba\u0148a Luka''. In modern usage, the name is pronounced and usually [[declension|declined]] (''u Banjaluci'') as one word, and often written as such. The citizens reportedly prefer the form with inflected adjective (''u Banjoj Luci'').<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&reportid=151 Ivan Lovrenovi\u0107, \" \u2018Serb\u2019 towns in Bosnia\"], BH Dani, 20 July 2001</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Overview===\nBanja Luka covers some {{convert|96.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is situated on either bank of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] in the Banja Luka valley, which is characteristically flat within the otherwise hilly region. Banja Luka's centre lies {{convert|163|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\nThe source of the Vrbas River is about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to the south at the [[Vranica]] mountain. Its tributaries\u2014the Suturlija, the Crkvena, and the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja]]\u2014flow into the Vrbas at various points in the city. A number of springs can be found nearby.\n\nThe area around Banja Luka is mostly woodland, although there are mountains further from the city. The most notable of these mountains are Manja\u010da (1,214 m), \u010cemernica (1,338 m), and Tisovac. These are all part of the [[Dinaric Alps]] mountain range.\n\n=== Settlements ===\nThe city of Banja Luka (aside from city proper) includes the following settlements:\n{{flatlist|\n* [[Agino Selo]]\n* [[Barlovci]]\n* [[Bastasi, Banja Luka|Bastasi]]\n* [[Bistrica, Banja Luka|Bistrica]]\n* [[Bo\u010dac]]\n* [[Borkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Bronzani Majdan]]\n* [[Cerici]]\n* [[\u010cokori]]\n* [[Debeljaci]]\n* [[Dobrnja, Banja Luka|Dobrnja]]\n* [[Drago\u010daj]]\n* [[Drakuli\u0107, Banja Luka|Drakuli\u0107]]\n* [[Dujakovci]]\n* [[Gole\u0161i]]\n* [[Jagare]]\n* [[Kme\u0107ani]]\n* [[Kola, Banja Luka|Kola]]\n* [[Kola Donja]]\n* [[Krmine]]\n* [[Krupa na Vrbasu]]\n* [[Kuljani]]\n* [[Lokvari]]\n* [[Lusi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ljuba\u010devo]]\n* [[Melina, Banja Luka|Melina]]\n* [[Motike, Banja Luka|Motike]]\n* [[Obrovac, Banja Luka|Obrovac]]\n* [[Pavi\u0107i]]\n* [[Pavlovac, Banja Luka|Pavlovac]]\n* [[Pervan Donji]]\n* [[Pervan Gornji]]\n* [[Piskavica, Banja Luka|Piskavica]]\n* [[Ponir]]\n* [[Potkozarje, Banja Luka|Potkozarje]]\n* [[Prijakovci]]\n* [[Prije\u010dani]]\n* [[Prnjavor Mali, Banja Luka|Prnjavor Mali]]\n* [[Radmani\u0107i]]\n* [[Radosavska]]\n* [[Rami\u0107i, Banja Luka|Rami\u0107i]]\n* [[Rekavice]]\n* [[Slavi\u0107ka]]\n* [[Stratinska]]\n* [[Stri\u010di\u0107i]]\n* [[Subotica, Banja Luka|Subotica]]\n* [[\u0160argovac]]\n* [[\u0160imi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0160ljivno, Banja Luka|\u0160ljivno]]\n* [[Veri\u0107i]]\n* [[Vilusi, Banja Luka|Vilusi]]\n* [[Zalu\u017eani]]\n* [[Zelenci, Banja Luka|Zelenci]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nBanja Luka has a moderate [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild winters, frequent frosts, and warm summers. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of {{convert|22.8|C}}. The coldest month of the year is January, when temperatures average around {{convert|1.7|C}}.\n\nThe annual precipitation for the city is about {{convert|1037.2|mm|0|abbr=off}}. Banja Luka has an average of 104 rainy days a year. Due to the city's relatively high latitude and inland location, it snows in Banja Luka almost every year. Strong winds come from the north and northeast.

The area comprising Banja Luka was entirely in the kingdom of Illyria and then a part of the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], which split into provinces of [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia]] of which Castra became a part.

It was also the central sanjak in the Bosnia Eyalet. In 1688, the city was burned down by the [[Austria]]n army, but it quickly recovered. Later periodic intrusions by the Austrian army stimulated military developments in Banja Luka, which made it into a strategic military centre. Orthodox churches and monasteries near Banja Luka were built in the 19th century. Also, [[Sephardic Jew]]s and [[Trappists]] migrated to the city in the 19th century and contributed to the early industrialisation of the region by building mills, breweries, brick factories, textile factories and other important structures.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe [[Mariastern Abbey, Banja Luka|Trappist monastery]] built in the 19th century lent its name to the neighbourhood of ''Trapisti'' and has left a large legacy in the area through its famous [[Trappista cheese|Trappist cheese]] and its beer production.\n\nIn 1835 and 1836, during Ottoman administration, numerous people from Banja Luka emigrated to [[Le\u0161nica, Serbia|Le\u0161nica]], [[Lipnica (Loznica)|Lipnica]] and [[Loznica]], the villages around Loznica, and to [[\u0160abac]].<ref>Jovan Cviji\u0107, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju\u017enoslovenske zemlje /Balkan Peninsula and South Slav Countries/ (Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud\u017ebenika, 1966), pp. 151-152.</ref>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\nDespite its leading position in the region, Banja Luka as a city was not modernised until [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]] in the late 19th century. Railroads, schools, factories, and infrastructure appeared, and were developed, which turned Banja Luka into a modern city.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nAfter World War I, the town became the capital of the [[Vrbas Banovina]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\nThe provincial capital owed its rapid progress to the first Ban Svetislav Milosavljevi\u0107. During that time, the Banski dvor and its twin sister, the Administration building, the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, a theatre and a museum were built, the Grammar School was renovated, the Teachers College enlarged, a city bridge was built and the park renovated.\n125 elementary schools were functioning in Banja Luka in 1930. The revolutionary ideas of the time were incubated by the \"Pelagi\u0107\" association and the Students' Club.

Banja Luka is the centre of the government for the Municipality of Banja Luka. A number of entity and state institutions are seated in the city. The Republika Srpska Government and the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]] are based in Banja Luka.\n\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina State Agencies based in the city include the Indirect Taxation (VAT) Authority, the Deposit Insurance Agency as well as a branch of the [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (formerly the National Bank of Republika Srpska). [[Austria]], Croatia, France, Germany, [[Serbia]], the United Kingdom and the United States maintain diplomatic representation through [[Consul (representative)|consulates-general]] in Banja Luka.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. In this period Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established [[Banja Luka Stock Exchange]]. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as [[Telekom Srpske]], Rafinerija ulja Modri\u010da, [[Banjalu\u010dka Pivara]] and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Serbia]], now include a number of investment funds from the EU, and from [[Norway]], the United States, Japan and China.\n\nA number of financial services regulators, such as the [[Republika Srpska Securities Commission]] and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n;Economic preview\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The three football teams from Banja Luka are [[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]] (2010/2011 season champions of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), [[FK BSK Banja Luka|BSK Banja Luka]], and [[FK Omladinac Banja Luka|Omladinac Banja Luka]] (both in the [[First League of the Republika Srpska]]), FK Naprijed Banja Luka and FK Vrbas Banja Luka\n\n[[FK Borac Banja Luka]] is the most popular football club in the Republika Srpska. The club has won several major trophies in its history such as trophies as a champion of [[Mitropa Cup]], [[Yugoslav Cup]], [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup]], [[2007\u201308 First League of the Republika Srpska|First League of the Republika Srpska]], [[Republika Srpska Cup|Republic Srpska Cup]]. They have participated in [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]].\n\nThe city has a long tradition of handball. [[RK Borac Banja Luka]] was the European Champion in 1976, the European Vice-Champion in 1975 and the winner of the IHF Cup in 1991.\n\nRecently, tennis has taken on a bigger role in the city. The local tennis tournament, [[Banja Luka Challenger|\"Memorijal Trive Vuji\u0107a\"]], has become professional and has been awarded [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] status in 2001, with the rank of a [[ATP Challenger Series|Challenger]]. The Banja Luka Challenger takes place in September each year. In 2005, the European Championships in [[Rafting]] were held on the Vrbas river.  In 2006, the [[Davis Cup]] matches of the Europe/Africa Zone Group III took place in the city. Since 2015, the city hosts the Banjaluka Half-marathon.\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:TranzitBL.jpg|thumb|right|Banja Luka west transit road]]\n[[File:Isto\u010dni tranzit, Banja Luka.jpg|thumb|Banja Luka east transit road]]\n[[File:BH Airlines - Banja Luka airport - Aug-10 v1.jpg|thumb|right|B&H Airlines [[ATR 72]] at Banja Luka airport preparing for the flight to Z\u00fcrich, August 2010]]\n\nPublic transportation within Banja Luka is exclusively operated by the bus services. Over thirty bus lines connect downtown with the rest of the city and its suburbs. The oldest bus link in the city is line No 1. Taxis are also readily available. The expressway E-661 (locally known as M-16) leads north to [[Croatia]] from Banja Luka by way of [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi\u0161ka]], near the Bosnian/Croatian border. A wide range of bus services are available to most neighbouring and larger towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to regional and European destinations such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, France, Italy, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia.\n\nBanja Luka is the hub of the railway services of [[Republika Srpska Railways|\u017deljeznice Republike Srpske]], comprising one half of the railway network of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Services operate to most northern Bosnian towns, and two modern air-conditioned 'Talgo' trains run to [[Sarajevo]] every day. However, services are relatively slow and infrequent compared with neighbouring countries.\n\n[[Banja Luka International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: BNX, [[ICAO]]: LQBK) is located {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Banja Luka. The airport is served by [[Air Serbia]], which operates flights to [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport|Belgrade]] and summer charters to [[Antalya Airport|Antalya]] and [[Athens International Airport|Athens]], while [[Ryanair]] operates flights to [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport|Brussels]], [[Memmingen Airport|Memmingen]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Berlin]] and [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Stockholm]]. There is also [[Banja Luka Zalu\u017eani Airfield]], a small airstrip.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n===Twin towns

The city lies on the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas River]] and is well known in the countries of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] for being full of tree-lined avenues, boulevards, gardens, and parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|title=\u0410\u0421\u0411\u041b >> General information|website=www.banjaluka.rs.ba|access-date=2 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815215526/http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|archive-date=15 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe name 'Banja Luka' was first mentioned in a document dated to 6 February 1494 by [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Ladislaus II of Hungary]]. The name is interpreted as the 'Ban's meadow', from the words ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' (a mediaeval noble title), and ''luka'' ('valley' or 'meadow'). The identity of the ban and the meadow in question remain uncertain, and [[popular etymology]] combines the modern words ''banja'' ('bath' or 'spa'), or ''bajna'' ('marvelous') and ''luka'' ('port'). A different interpretation is suggested by the Hungarian name ''Luk\u00e1csb\u00e1nya'', in English 'Luke's Mine',  which is also the meaning of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''ba\u0148a Luka''. In modern usage, the name is pronounced and usually [[declension|declined]] (''u Banjaluci'') as one word, and often written as such. The citizens reportedly prefer the form with inflected adjective (''u Banjoj Luci'').<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&reportid=151 Ivan Lovrenovi\u0107, \" \u2018Serb\u2019 towns in Bosnia\"], BH Dani, 20 July 2001</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Overview===\nBanja Luka covers some {{convert|96.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is situated on either bank of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] in the Banja Luka valley, which is characteristically flat within the otherwise hilly region. Banja Luka's centre lies {{convert|163|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\nThe source of the Vrbas River is about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to the south at the [[Vranica]] mountain. Its tributaries\u2014the Suturlija, the Crkvena, and the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja]]\u2014flow into the Vrbas at various points in the city. A number of springs can be found nearby.\n\nThe area around Banja Luka is mostly woodland, although there are mountains further from the city. The most notable of these mountains are Manja\u010da (1,214 m), \u010cemernica (1,338 m), and Tisovac. These are all part of the [[Dinaric Alps]] mountain range.\n\n=== Settlements ===\nThe city of Banja Luka (aside from city proper) includes the following settlements:\n{{flatlist|\n* [[Agino Selo]]\n* [[Barlovci]]\n* [[Bastasi, Banja Luka|Bastasi]]\n* [[Bistrica, Banja Luka|Bistrica]]\n* [[Bo\u010dac]]\n* [[Borkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Bronzani Majdan]]\n* [[Cerici]]\n* [[\u010cokori]]\n* [[Debeljaci]]\n* [[Dobrnja, Banja Luka|Dobrnja]]\n* [[Drago\u010daj]]\n* [[Drakuli\u0107, Banja Luka|Drakuli\u0107]]\n* [[Dujakovci]]\n* [[Gole\u0161i]]\n* [[Jagare]]\n* [[Kme\u0107ani]]\n* [[Kola, Banja Luka|Kola]]\n* [[Kola Donja]]\n* [[Krmine]]\n* [[Krupa na Vrbasu]]\n* [[Kuljani]]\n* [[Lokvari]]\n* [[Lusi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ljuba\u010devo]]\n* [[Melina, Banja Luka|Melina]]\n* [[Motike, Banja Luka|Motike]]\n* [[Obrovac, Banja Luka|Obrovac]]\n* [[Pavi\u0107i]]\n* [[Pavlovac, Banja Luka|Pavlovac]]\n* [[Pervan Donji]]\n* [[Pervan Gornji]]\n* [[Piskavica, Banja Luka|Piskavica]]\n* [[Ponir]]\n* [[Potkozarje, Banja Luka|Potkozarje]]\n* [[Prijakovci]]\n* [[Prije\u010dani]]\n* [[Prnjavor Mali, Banja Luka|Prnjavor Mali]]\n* [[Radmani\u0107i]]\n* [[Radosavska]]\n* [[Rami\u0107i, Banja Luka|Rami\u0107i]]\n* [[Rekavice]]\n* [[Slavi\u0107ka]]\n* [[Stratinska]]\n* [[Stri\u010di\u0107i]]\n* [[Subotica, Banja Luka|Subotica]]\n* [[\u0160argovac]]\n* [[\u0160imi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0160ljivno, Banja Luka|\u0160ljivno]]\n* [[Veri\u0107i]]\n* [[Vilusi, Banja Luka|Vilusi]]\n* [[Zalu\u017eani]]\n* [[Zelenci, Banja Luka|Zelenci]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nBanja Luka has a moderate [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild winters, frequent frosts, and warm summers.

Banja Luka has an average of 104 rainy days a year. Due to the city's relatively high latitude and inland location, it snows in Banja Luka almost every year. Strong winds come from the north and northeast.

The area comprising Banja Luka was entirely in the kingdom of Illyria and then a part of the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], which split into provinces of [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia]] of which Castra became a part.

It was also the central sanjak in the Bosnia Eyalet. In 1688, the city was burned down by the [[Austria]]n army, but it quickly recovered. Later periodic intrusions by the Austrian army stimulated military developments in Banja Luka, which made it into a strategic military centre. Orthodox churches and monasteries near Banja Luka were built in the 19th century. Also, [[Sephardic Jew]]s and [[Trappists]] migrated to the city in the 19th century and contributed to the early industrialisation of the region by building mills, breweries, brick factories, textile factories and other important structures.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe [[Mariastern Abbey, Banja Luka|Trappist monastery]] built in the 19th century lent its name to the neighbourhood of ''Trapisti'' and has left a large legacy in the area through its famous [[Trappista cheese|Trappist cheese]] and its beer production.\n\nIn 1835 and 1836, during Ottoman administration, numerous people from Banja Luka emigrated to [[Le\u0161nica, Serbia|Le\u0161nica]], [[Lipnica (Loznica)|Lipnica]] and [[Loznica]], the villages around Loznica, and to [[\u0160abac]].<ref>Jovan Cviji\u0107, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju\u017enoslovenske zemlje /Balkan Peninsula and South Slav Countries/ (Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud\u017ebenika, 1966), pp. 151-152.</ref>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\nDespite its leading position in the region, Banja Luka as a city was not modernised until [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]] in the late 19th century. Railroads, schools, factories, and infrastructure appeared, and were developed, which turned Banja Luka into a modern city.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nAfter World War I, the town became the capital of the [[Vrbas Banovina]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\nThe provincial capital owed its rapid progress to the first Ban Svetislav Milosavljevi\u0107. During that time, the Banski dvor and its twin sister, the Administration building, the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, a theatre and a museum were built, the Grammar School was renovated, the Teachers College enlarged, a city bridge was built and the park renovated.\n125 elementary schools were functioning in Banja Luka in 1930. The revolutionary ideas of the time were incubated by the \"Pelagi\u0107\" association and the Students' Club.

Banja Luka is the centre of the government for the Municipality of Banja Luka. A number of entity and state institutions are seated in the city. The Republika Srpska Government and the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]] are based in Banja Luka.\n\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina State Agencies based in the city include the Indirect Taxation (VAT) Authority, the Deposit Insurance Agency as well as a branch of the [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (formerly the National Bank of Republika Srpska). [[Austria]], Croatia, France, Germany, [[Serbia]], the United Kingdom and the United States maintain diplomatic representation through [[Consul (representative)|consulates-general]] in Banja Luka.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. In this period Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established [[Banja Luka Stock Exchange]]. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as [[Telekom Srpske]], Rafinerija ulja Modri\u010da, [[Banjalu\u010dka Pivara]] and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Serbia]], now include a number of investment funds from the EU, and from [[Norway]], the United States, Japan and China.\n\nA number of financial services regulators, such as the [[Republika Srpska Securities Commission]] and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n;Economic preview\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The three football teams from Banja Luka are [[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]] (2010/2011 season champions of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), [[FK BSK Banja Luka|BSK Banja Luka]], and [[FK Omladinac Banja Luka|Omladinac Banja Luka]] (both in the [[First League of the Republika Srpska]]), FK Naprijed Banja Luka and FK Vrbas Banja Luka\n\n[[FK Borac Banja Luka]] is the most popular football club in the Republika Srpska. The club has won several major trophies in its history such as trophies as a champion of [[Mitropa Cup]], [[Yugoslav Cup]], [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup]], [[2007\u201308 First League of the Republika Srpska|First League of the Republika Srpska]], [[Republika Srpska Cup|Republic Srpska Cup]]. They have participated in [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]].\n\nThe city has a long tradition of handball. [[RK Borac Banja Luka]] was the European Champion in 1976, the European Vice-Champion in 1975 and the winner of the IHF Cup in 1991.\n\nRecently, tennis has taken on a bigger role in the city. The local tennis tournament, [[Banja Luka Challenger|\"Memorijal Trive Vuji\u0107a\"]], has become professional and has been awarded [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] status in 2001, with the rank of a [[ATP Challenger Series|Challenger]]. The Banja Luka Challenger takes place in September each year. In 2005, the European Championships in [[Rafting]] were held on the Vrbas river.  In 2006, the [[Davis Cup]] matches of the Europe/Africa Zone Group III took place in the city. Since 2015, the city hosts the Banjaluka Half-marathon.\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:TranzitBL.jpg|thumb|right|Banja Luka west transit road]]\n[[File:Isto\u010dni tranzit, Banja Luka.jpg|thumb|Banja Luka east transit road]]\n[[File:BH Airlines - Banja Luka airport - Aug-10 v1.jpg|thumb|right|B&H Airlines [[ATR 72]] at Banja Luka airport preparing for the flight to Z\u00fcrich, August 2010]]\n\nPublic transportation within Banja Luka is exclusively operated by the bus services. Over thirty bus lines connect downtown with the rest of the city and its suburbs. The oldest bus link in the city is line No 1. Taxis are also readily available. The expressway E-661 (locally known as M-16) leads north to [[Croatia]] from Banja Luka by way of [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi\u0161ka]], near the Bosnian/Croatian border. A wide range of bus services are available to most neighbouring and larger towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to regional and European destinations such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, France, Italy, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia.\n\nBanja Luka is the hub of the railway services of [[Republika Srpska Railways|\u017deljeznice Republike Srpske]], comprising one half of the railway network of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Services operate to most northern Bosnian towns, and two modern air-conditioned 'Talgo' trains run to [[Sarajevo]] every day. However, services are relatively slow and infrequent compared with neighbouring countries.\n\n[[Banja Luka International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: BNX, [[ICAO]]: LQBK) is located {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Banja Luka. The airport is served by [[Air Serbia]], which operates flights to [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport|Belgrade]] and summer charters to [[Antalya Airport|Antalya]] and [[Athens International Airport|Athens]], while [[Ryanair]] operates flights to [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport|Brussels]], [[Memmingen Airport|Memmingen]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Berlin]] and [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Stockholm]]. There is also [[Banja Luka Zalu\u017eani Airfield]], a small airstrip.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities===\nBanja Luka is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with the following cities:<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/64/|script-title=sr:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0438|accessdate=2013-08-09|work=Administrative Office of the City of Banja Luka|language=Serbian|trans-title=City of Banja Luka - Partner cities|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917132032/http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/64/|archivedate=2011-09-17}}</ref>\n{{colbegin}}\n* {{flagicon|SRB}} [[Belgrade]], Serbia, since 2003<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|SRB}} [[Novi Sad]], Serbia, since 2006<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|SRB}} [[Sremska Mitrovica]], Serbia<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|GRE}} [[Patras]], Greece, since 1995<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/><ref>[https://archive.is/20120730030515/http://www.e-patras.gr/portal/web/pressoffice/367 e-patras.gr \u2013 \u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c7\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2]{{gr}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|RUS}} [[Moscow]], Russia, since 2003<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|GER}} [[Kaiserslautern]], Germany, since 2003<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|UKR}} [[Lviv]], Ukraine<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|SVN}} [[Kranj]], Slovenia, since 1965<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Campobasso]], Italy<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Bari]], Italy<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Bitonto]], Italy<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|ISR}} [[Modiin|Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut]], Israel, since 2010<ref name=\"Banja Luka twinnings\"/>\n* {{flagicon|AUT}} [[Graz]], Austria\n* {{flagicon|SWE}} [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], Sweden, since 1969\n* {{flagicon|SRB}} [[Zemun]], Serbia\n* {{flagicon|ROU}} [[Foc\u0219ani]], Romania, since 2012\n{{colend}}\n\n==People==\n* [[Petar Ko\u010di\u0107]], Bosnian Serb writer\n* [[Ivan Franjo Juki\u0107]], Bosnian writer\n* [[Marijan Bene\u0161]], boxer and poet, European amateur champion\n* [[Anton Josipovi\u0107]], boxer, Olympic champion\n* [[Adem \u010cejvan]], actor\n* [[Ivan Merz]], Catholic lay academic;

It developed a reputation for poor customer service and delays.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} It also endured hijackings and suffered seven accidents between 1974 and 1983. The most notorious was the 1974 crash of [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]], when an aircraft design flaw led to a faulty cargo door breaking off in flight near [[Ermenonville]], [[France]], resulting in the deaths of 346 people.\n\nA new government came to power in 1983 which recognized THY's importance as Turkey's gateway to the world, beginning the airline's makeover into a modern operation. It would go on to maintain one of the youngest fleets in the world. Security was intensified, causing one shipper to compare it to Israel's [[El Al]], at least in terms of delays.<ref name=\"Turkish Airlines Inc.\" />\n\nTHY built a new, state-of-the-art technical center at [[Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport|Ye\u015filk\u00f6y Airport]] in 1984. The airline was capable of both light and heavy maintenance on many different aircraft types. Technical staff then made up one-quarter of the airline's 6,000 employees, according to [[Air Transport World]]. In 1984, the company's capital was raised to 60&nbsp;billion TL as it was classified as a state economic enterprise. Three years later, the capital was raised again, to 150&nbsp;billion TL.\n[[File:Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-400; TC-JDY@ZRH;02.10.1995 (8353903774).jpg|thumb|Turkish Airlines [[Boeing 737]] at [[Zurich Airport]] in 1995.]]\nBy the mid-1980s, THY had a fleet of 30 aircraft. It was flying approximately three million passengers a year to 16 domestic destinations and three dozen international ones. The airline was Turkey's largest source of foreign currency. Turkish Airlines began operating [[Airbus A310]]s in 1985, allowing the addition of flights to Singapore in 1986. A route to [[New York City]] via [[Brussels]] was added in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe company posted losses in 1987 and 1988, largely due to high payments on its dozen new Airbus A310s, according to Air Transport World. The fleet also included 11 [[Boeing 727]]s and nine Douglas DC-9s. THY ended the decade with 8,500 employees.<ref name=\"Turkish Airlines Inc.\" />\n\nThe company suffered in the global aviation crisis following the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and would not [[break-even]] again until 1994. However, the business was again booming in the mid-1990s, with the greatest growth coming from [[North America]]n destinations. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} THY launched a nonstop flight to New York City in July 1994.\n\nThe company's capital continued to be raised, reaching 10&nbsp;trillion TL in 1995. During that year, the airline also converted three of its Boeing 727s to dedicated freighters. The DC-9s had been sold off. The company posted a $6&nbsp;million profit on revenues of $1&nbsp;billion for the year. While profitable, THY had to contend with Turkey's exorbitant inflation, making capital improvements difficult.\n\nThe domestic market was deregulated in 1996, allowing new scheduled competition from charter airlines. At the same time, larger international carriers were providing stiff competition on routes to Western Europe. THY entered into marketing agreements with other international airlines to enhance their competitiveness. The company teamed with [[Japan Airlines]] to offer service to [[Osaka]] and [[Tokyo]] in 1997 and 1998. Other jointly operated flights soon followed with Austrian Airlines, Swissair, and Croatia Airlines.<ref name=\"Turkish Airlines Inc.\" />\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\n[[File:Thy fcb new aircraft borak.jpg|thumb|left|A Turkish Airlines [[Boeing 777#777-300ER|Boeing 777-300ER]] with the [[FC Barcelona]] colours in 2012; the airline was the official sponsor and carrier of the club between 2010 and 2013.<ref name=Barcelona>{{cite press release |url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-INT/press-releases/4396/turkish-airlines-signs-sponsorship-deal-with-barcelona-%E2%80%A6.aspx |title=Turkish Airlines signs sponsorship deal with Barcelona |publisher=Turkish Airlines |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=20 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716083639/http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-INT/press-releases/4396/turkish-airlines-signs-sponsorship-deal-with-barcelona-%E2%80%A6.aspx |archivedate=16 July 2011  }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 FIBA Karakas.jpg|thumb|A Turkish Airlines [[Boeing 737-800]] in [[2010 FIBA World Championship]] livery at [[Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport]].]]\n[[File:Istanbul Airport Turkish-Airlines 2013-11-18.JPG|thumb|left|[[Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport]], November 2013.]]\n[[File:TC-JRO (6949763841) (2).jpg|thumb|A Turkish Airlines [[Airbus A321|Airbus A321-200]] in [[Euroleague Basketball|Turkish Airlines Euroleague]] livery.

Turkish Daily News credited the airline's survival to entrepreneurial management, which was quick to get rid of loss-making routes at home and abroad.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 2003, the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] prompted Turkish Airlines to close some routes in the Persian Gulf, while flights to Asia were suspended during the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemic. However, the airline soon recovered, increasing traffic on existing routes and adding service to [[Delhi]] after an 11-year lapse.\n\nAnother fleet expansion program kicked off in 2004, helping THY maintain one of the youngest fleets in Europe. In July that year, the airline announced a massive $2.8&nbsp;billion order of 36 jets from [[Airbus]], plus an order for 15 Boeing 737s.\n\nTHY was not just ordering new planes. It was planning to spend $350&nbsp;million on a new technical and training facility at Istanbul's underutilized [[Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport]]. The airline had built up a significant technical services operation, maintaining not just their aircraft but those of third parties. [[Turkish Technic]] employed 2,700 workers and was planning to hire another 2,000 by 2010. THY also had three flight simulators and offered flight training services.\n\nThe airline faced the entry of new competitors into the liberalizing Turkish aviation market. However, tourism was booming, with 20 million people expected to visit the country in 2005 versus 12&nbsp;million in 2003. THY divested its 50% holding in [[Cyprus Turkish Airlines]] (''K\u0131br\u0131s T\u00fcrk Hava Yollar\u0131'') in 2005.\n\nAlthough the company was publicly traded at this time, the government owned 98% of its shares. The privatization program was revived in 2004 with a public offering of 20% of shares on the [[Borsa Istanbul|Istanbul Stock Exchange]]. The Turkish government owned 75% of shares after the offering, which raised $170&nbsp;million. Currently, the Republic of Turkey's Prime Ministry Privatization Administration owns a 49.12% interest in THY, while 50.88% of shares are publicly traded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-INT/corporate/investor_relations/organization.aspx |title=Investor Relations |publisher=Turkish Airlines |date= |accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2008, Turkish Airlines joined the [[Star Alliance]] after an 18-month integration process beginning in December 2006, becoming the seventh European airline in the 20-member alliance.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Turkish Airlines to join Star Alliance, Star Alliance board approves membership application |publisher=Star Alliance |date=9 December 2006 |url=http://www.staralliance.es/de/press/starallianceturkishairlines-prp/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130213091212/http://www.staralliance.es/de/press/starallianceturkishairlines-prp/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2013 |accessdate=4 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2010, ''TURKISH'' replaced ''TURKAIR'' as the new [[call sign]] for Turkish Airlines.\n\nIn December 2011, the Turkish government unveiled plans to modernize the [[Aden Adde International Airport]] in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]], which became one of the newest flight destinations of the carrier in 2012. The rehabilitation project is part of Turkey's broader engagement in the local post-conflict reconstruction process. Among the scheduled renovations are new airport systems and infrastructure, including a modern control tower to monitor the airspace.<ref name=\"Skawraoim\">{{cite web|url=http://news.cheapflighthouse.co.uk/2011/01/01/ska-will-run-airport-operations-in-mogadishu/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119074802/http://news.cheapflighthouse.co.uk/2011/01/01/ska-will-run-airport-operations-in-mogadishu/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 January 2012 |title=SKA will run airport operations in Mogadishu |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}</ref> In March 2012, Turkish Airlines became the first international carrier to resume flights to Somalia since the start of that country's [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] in the early 1990s.\n\nBy the end of 2013, Turkish Airlines had increased their number of flight points to 241 destinations worldwide (199 international and 42 domestic).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/corporate/press-room/about-turkish-airlines/destinations-and-frequencies |title=Turkish Airlines \u2013 Destinations and Frequencies |website=Turkishairlines.com |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of the [[2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]], the [[Federal Aviation Authority]] temporarily banned flights between Turkey and the [[United States]].

It developed a reputation for poor customer service and delays.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} It also endured hijackings and suffered seven accidents between 1974 and 1983. The most notorious was the 1974 crash of [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]], when an aircraft design flaw led to a faulty cargo door breaking off in flight near [[Ermenonville]], [[France]], resulting in the deaths of 346 people.\n\nA new government came to power in 1983 which recognized THY's importance as Turkey's gateway to the world, beginning the airline's makeover into a modern operation. It would go on to maintain one of the youngest fleets in the world. Security was intensified, causing one shipper to compare it to Israel's [[El Al]], at least in terms of delays.<ref name=\"Turkish Airlines Inc.\" />\n\nTHY built a new, state-of-the-art technical center at [[Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport|Ye\u015filk\u00f6y Airport]] in 1984. The airline was capable of both light and heavy maintenance on many different aircraft types. Technical staff then made up one-quarter of the airline's 6,000 employees, according to [[Air Transport World]]. In 1984, the company's capital was raised to 60&nbsp;billion TL as it was classified as a state economic enterprise. Three years later, the capital was raised again, to 150&nbsp;billion TL.\n[[File:Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-400; TC-JDY@ZRH;02.10.1995 (8353903774).jpg|thumb|Turkish Airlines [[Boeing 737]] at [[Zurich Airport]] in 1995.]]\nBy the mid-1980s, THY had a fleet of 30 aircraft. It was flying approximately three million passengers a year to 16 domestic destinations and three dozen international ones. The airline was Turkey's largest source of foreign currency. Turkish Airlines began operating [[Airbus A310]]s in 1985, allowing the addition of flights to Singapore in 1986. A route to [[New York City]] via [[Brussels]] was added in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe company posted losses in 1987 and 1988, largely due to high payments on its dozen new Airbus A310s, according to Air Transport World. The fleet also included 11 [[Boeing 727]]s and nine Douglas DC-9s. THY ended the decade with 8,500 employees.<ref name=\"Turkish Airlines Inc.\" />\n\nThe company suffered in the global aviation crisis following the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] and would not [[break-even]] again until 1994. However, the business was again booming in the mid-1990s, with the greatest growth coming from [[North America]]n destinations. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} THY launched a nonstop flight to New York City in July 1994.\n\nThe company's capital continued to be raised, reaching 10&nbsp;trillion TL in 1995. During that year, the airline also converted three of its Boeing 727s to dedicated freighters. The DC-9s had been sold off. The company posted a $6&nbsp;million profit on revenues of $1&nbsp;billion for the year. While profitable, THY had to contend with Turkey's exorbitant inflation, making capital improvements difficult.\n\nThe domestic market was deregulated in 1996, allowing new scheduled competition from charter airlines. At the same time, larger international carriers were providing stiff competition on routes to Western Europe. THY entered into marketing agreements with other international airlines to enhance their competitiveness. The company teamed with [[Japan Airlines]] to offer service to [[Osaka]] and [[Tokyo]] in 1997 and 1998.

Turkish Airlines continued to extend their international reach, forging marketing agreements with [[Asiana Airlines]], [[American Airlines]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[LOT Polish Airlines]], [[Czech Airlines]] and [[Cathay Pacific]] in 2000. On October 29, 2000, THY withdrew from the [[Swissair]]-led [[Qualiflyer]] alliance to help attract a strategic investor for their privatization.<ref name=\"Turkish Airlines Inc.\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://bigpara.hurriyet.com.tr/haberler/genel-haberler/thyao-qualiflyer-ozel-yolcu-programi-ndan-ayrildi_ID339154/|title=THYAO, Qualiflyer \u00d6zel Yolcu Program\u0131`ndan Ayr\u0131ld\u0131|last=|first=|date=2000-10-27|website=H\u00fcrriyet|language=tr|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016175335/http://bigpara.hurriyet.com.tr/haberler/genel-haberler/thyao-qualiflyer-ozel-yolcu-programi-ndan-ayrildi_ID339154/|archive-date=2019-10-16|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> The airline had been part of the alliance's frequent-flyer program since November 1998.<ref name=\":5\" /> An Antalya-Frankfurt route was added in 2001 through a code-sharing agreement with [[SunExpress|Sun Express]].\n\nTurkey underwent [[2001 Turkish economic crisis|an economic crisis]] throughout most of 2001, leading to a reduction in traffic on domestic routes in particular. THY managed to survive after the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States without a government bailout or mass layoffs, although 300 middle management positions were eliminated, 400 part-timers were laid off and wages were cut 10 percent. Turkish Daily News credited the airline's survival to entrepreneurial management, which was quick to get rid of loss-making routes at home and abroad.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 2003, the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] prompted Turkish Airlines to close some routes in the Persian Gulf, while flights to Asia were suspended during the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemic. However, the airline soon recovered, increasing traffic on existing routes and adding service to [[Delhi]] after an 11-year lapse.\n\nAnother fleet expansion program kicked off in 2004, helping THY maintain one of the youngest fleets in Europe. In July that year, the airline announced a massive $2.8&nbsp;billion order of 36 jets from [[Airbus]], plus an order for 15 Boeing 737s.\n\nTHY was not just ordering new planes. It was planning to spend $350&nbsp;million on a new technical and training facility at Istanbul's underutilized [[Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport]]. The airline had built up a significant technical services operation, maintaining not just their aircraft but those of third parties. [[Turkish Technic]] employed 2,700 workers and was planning to hire another 2,000 by 2010. THY also had three flight simulators and offered flight training services.\n\nThe airline faced the entry of new competitors into the liberalizing Turkish aviation market. However, tourism was booming, with 20 million people expected to visit the country in 2005 versus 12&nbsp;million in 2003. THY divested its 50% holding in [[Cyprus Turkish Airlines]] (''K\u0131br\u0131s T\u00fcrk Hava Yollar\u0131'') in 2005.\n\nAlthough the company was publicly traded at this time, the government owned 98% of its shares. The privatization program was revived in 2004 with a public offering of 20% of shares on the [[Borsa Istanbul|Istanbul Stock Exchange]]. The Turkish government owned 75% of shares after the offering, which raised $170&nbsp;million. Currently, the Republic of Turkey's Prime Ministry Privatization Administration owns a 49.12% interest in THY, while 50.88% of shares are publicly traded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-INT/corporate/investor_relations/organization.aspx |title=Investor Relations |publisher=Turkish Airlines |date= |accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2008, Turkish Airlines joined the [[Star Alliance]] after an 18-month integration process beginning in December 2006, becoming the seventh European airline in the 20-member alliance.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Turkish Airlines to join Star Alliance, Star Alliance board approves membership application |publisher=Star Alliance |date=9 December 2006 |url=http://www.staralliance.es/de/press/starallianceturkishairlines-prp/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130213091212/http://www.staralliance.es/de/press/starallianceturkishairlines-prp/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2013 |accessdate=4 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2010, ''TURKISH'' replaced ''TURKAIR'' as the new [[call sign]] for Turkish Airlines.\n\nIn December 2011, the Turkish government unveiled plans to modernize the [[Aden Adde International Airport]] in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]], which became one of the newest flight destinations of the carrier in 2012.

They entered the season as the defending [[Super Bowl]] champions, after winning [[Super Bowl LIII]], and as three-time defending [[American Football Conference|AFC]] champions. The Patriots won the [[AFC East]] for the 11th straight season, and improved on their 11\u20135 record from [[2018 New England Patriots season|the previous season]], but they were [[Upset (sports)|upset]] by the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nCatalyzed by their defense's historically dominant play, the Patriots started the season extremely well at 8\u20130 for the third time in franchise history, and early on there was conversation as to if they could repeat the undefeated [[2007 New England Patriots|2007 regular season]]. However, their winning streak would soon end as a result of their Week 9 loss to the [[2019 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], which was also their first loss to the Ravens since the January 20, 2013 AFC Championship Game.

The first drives ended in punts for both teams, but on the Patriots' second possession, they managed to race down the field on a seven-play, 82-yard drive that ended with a touchdown pass to [[Josh Gordon]], in which he broke two tackles after the catch. After forcing the Steelers to go three-and-out, due in part to a holding call on [[Alejandro Villanueva (American football)|Alejandro Villanueva]], the Patriots marched down the field, only for the drive to stall at the Pittsburgh 7-yard line, and the Patriots were forced to settle for a field goal, now leading 10\u20130 in the second quarter. New England went three-and-out on their following drive but scored on a 25-yard pass to [[Phillip Dorsett]] thereafter. In the Patriots' last possession of the first half, even with good field position, they failed to capitalize with a touchdown, settling for another field goal. Beginning the second half, the Patriots led 20\u20130. This lasted only briefly, as their defense gave up three points on the Steelers' first drive of the third quarter. [[Tom Brady]] and the offense responded quickly with a 58-yard pass to Dorsett, his second touchdown catch of the game. On their subsequent possessions, the Patriots scored field goals. Meanwhile, [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]]. In Pittsburgh's final drive, they managed to advance 50 yards down the field, but failed to score with time running out.

After forcing the Dolphins to go three-and-out, the Patriots countered with a drive in which [[Tom Brady]] targeted newly acquired [[wide receiver]] [[Antonio Brown]] three times for gains of 18, 10, and 8 yards. They finished the possession with a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Sony Michel]]. The next three drives ended in punts. Though, on the first, [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] was sacked by [[Adam Butler (American football)|Adam Butler]] on third down just after reaching midfield. On the Patriots' ensuing possession, they drove to the Dolphins 30 but [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed the first of a number of field goals that day. Despite the offense's lack of scoring, the New England defense played stoutly, forcing Miami to go three-and-out on their next two drives. The Patriots scored on a 65-yard possession that ended with a 20-yard pass from Tom Brady to Antonio Brown. Gostkowski missed the extra point and the Patriots led 13\u20130. In the second half, the New England offense failed to advance on their first drive. Meanwhile, Ryan Fitzpatrick was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]]. Now, with great field position, at the Miami 36, the Patriots failed to take advantage and were forced to settle for a field goal. The Dolphins' offense was unable to make anything of their next two drives going three-and-out on both while obtaining \u22122 yards and \u221211 yards on their first and second respectively. The Patriots offense made the best of their defense's solid play, marching down the field on an eight-play, 65-yard possession which ended with a 1-yard QB sneak by Brady. Later, New England's defense continued its sensational performance by forcing Miami to go three-and-out yet again. Upon entering the third quarter, Miami's offense had amassed a mere 28 yards. The Patriots' offense struggled, however, being unable to obtain a first-down. This proved irrelevant as the New England defense had pick-sixes on back-to-back drives: [[Stephon Gilmore]] returned the first 54-yards after a bad decision by Fitzpatrick and [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] returned the second 69-yards after a dropped pass. The Patriots now led 37\u20130. Ryan Fitzpatrick was replaced by backup [[Josh Rosen]] on the ensuing drive. The Patriots scored another touchdown on a 10-yard reception by [[James White (running back)|James White]]. On Miami's final possession, they marched 67-yards to the New England 8 but failed to score due to an interception by Jamie Collins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127862 |title=Patriots vs. Dolphins \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 15, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Patriots' first win in Miami since Week 17 of the [[2016 New England Patriots season|2016 season]], and their first shutout since Week 3 of that same season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goss |first1=Nick |title=Bill Belichick sums up Patriots' shutout win vs. Dolphins with classic line |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/bill-belichick-sums-patriots-shutout-win-vs-dolphins-classic-line |website=NBCSports.com |accessdate=September 15, 2019|date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, New England's defense held the Dolphins' offense to just 184 yards and forced four turnovers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=401127862 |title=Patriots vs. Dolphins \u2013 Team Statistics \u2013 September 15, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref> By holding the Dolphins to 0 points and the Steelers to 3 points a week prior, the defense made history, in fact, it tied the record for fewest points allowed through two games during the Super Bowl era.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Camenker |first1=James |title=Patriots defense make NFL history with performance through two games |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/patriots-defense-make-nfl-history-performance-through-two-games |website=NBCSports.com |publisher=NBC Sports |accessdate=September 20, 2019|date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> After much speculation over whether [[Antonio Brown]] would debut against the Dolphins as a result of his rape lawsuit, he indeed started and had four receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchmasser |first1=Bernd |title=Patriots vs Dolphins snap count report: Joe Thuney's iron man streak comes to an end; Antonio Brown plays 23 snaps |url=https://www.patspulpit.com/2019/9/16/20868097/new-england-patriots-miami-dolphins-snap-count-report-joe-thuney-iron-man-streak-comes-to-an-end |website=PatsPulpit.com |publisher=Pats Pulpit |accessdate=September 16, 2019|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> This proved to be to Brown's sole game with the Patriots as he was released days later on September 20, as a result of his response to further allegations.<ref name=\"ABrownRelease\" />\n\n====Week 3: vs. New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Three: New York Jets at New England Patriots&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 22\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n|road=Jets\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=7|R4=7\n|home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=13|H2=7|H3=10|H4=0\n|stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|attendance=65,878\n|weather=Sunny and warm, {{convert|81|F|C}}\n|referee=[[Carl Cheffers]]\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Jim Natz ]], [[Tony Romo]] and [[Jay Feeley ]] and Tracy Wolfson\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019092206/2019/REG3/jets@patriots Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57939/NE_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*NE \u2013 [[Sony Michel]] 5-yard run (kick failed, wide right), 7:55.

They faced a Jets team that was greatly hindered by numerous starters missing.

Continuing his struggles on [[special teams]], [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed his third extra-point of the year. On the Jets\u2019 ensuing drive, they went three-and-out as a result of a sack by [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]]. Meanwhile, New Englands\u2019 offense would score yet another touchdown, this time on a 25-yard catch-and-run by [[Phillip Dorsett]]. New York's offense failed to obtain any first-downs for the rest of the first half, and the Patriots would score an additional touchdown on a 3-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] to [[Julian Edelman]]. Although, the rest of their drives ended in punts. Entering the second half, New England led 20\u20130. The Patriots started with the ball but were unable to reach midfield and were forced to punt. On the following drive, Luke Falk threw an underthrown [[interception]] to [[Devin McCourty]] which was returned 24-yards to the New York 17. Unfortunately, the Patriots were unable to take advantage and settled for a 37-yard field goal. The defense would still play stoutly, forcing the Jets to go three-and-out on their ensuing drive, caused, in part, by a holding penalty on [[Kelechi Osemele]]. The Patriots countered with a 10-play, 60-yard drive which ended with a 2-yard rush touchdown by [[Rex Burkhead]], leading 30\u20130. Notably, [[Josh Gordon]] caught a spectacular 28-yard reception on third and 22, saving the drive from stalling and entering the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]]. On New York's next drive, they managed the reach near midfield but the drive was halted by a sack by [[Dont'a Hightower]] and [[Adam Butler (American football)|Adam Butler]]. The punt would prove disastrous for New England as [[rookie]] [[Gunner Olszewski]] muffed the ball and [[Arthur Maulet]], of the Jets, recovered it in the [[end zone]] for a touchdown: this was the first touchdown the Patriots had allowed all season. The ensuing two drives ended in punts. Although, on the Patriots' subsequent possession thereafter, Tom Brady was substituted by rookie [[Jarrett Stidham]] with 8:41 left in the fourth. Stidham threw a badly missed pass which was intercepted by [[Jamal Adams]] and returned 61 yards for a touchdown.

The Patriots began with the ball and started well with a 15-yard rush by [[Sony Michel]] on the first play. Though the drive faltered thereafter and they were forced to punt. In contrast, the defense maintained its tremendous play by intercepting [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] on the Bills' first drive; [[Devin McCourty]] claimed his fourth pick of the season. Taking advantage of the turnover, New England's offense marched 50 yards down the field for a 4-yard touchdown run by [[Brandon Bolden]]. Tom Brady also threw a catch-and-run pass to [[James White (running back)|James White]] for 26 yards despite great coverage by [[Matt Milano]]. On the extra point attempt, [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed yet another extra point, his fourth of the season. On the ensuing possession, the Bills struggled to obtain yards and went three-and-out. On the resulting punt, [[J. C. Jackson]] blocked [[Corey Bojorquez]]'s kick which was recovered and returned by [[Matthew Slater]] for a touchdown to put the Patriots up 13\u20130. Both teams' offenses failed to reach midfield and punted on the next two drives. However, on the possession after that, Josh Allen threw another pick, which was intercepted by J. C. Jackson. Without much momentum and at their own 25, New England went three-and-out, although Buffalo went three-and-out as well. Now at their own 5-yard line, the Patriots offense finally managed an effective drive for once. They drove 93 yards to the Buffalo 2-yard line, but the drive stalled and Brady threw a terrible pick to [[Micah Hyde (American football)|Micah Hyde]] in the endzone. Buffalo capitalized with a 46-yard field goal by [[Stephen Hauschka]]. Unable to counter, New England went three-and-out once more and the Bills drove to the New England 31 but failed to score as Hauschka missed a 49-yard field goal with time running out in the first half. Entering the second half, the Patriots led 13\u20133. The Bills' first drive was very effective as they marched 75 yards down the field and scored on a 1-yard QB sneak by Allen. This was the first touchdown allowed by the Patriots' defense all season. On the subsequent three possessions, both offenses only experienced only three-and-outs. Afterward, J. C. Jackson intercepted Josh Allen for his second pick of the day. Even with great field position at the Buffalo 42, the Patriots only managed to reach the Buffalo 4-yard line where they settled for a field goal. Josh Allen was concussed from a hit by [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] on the ensuing drive while he attempted to scramble for a first down. Allen would be replaced by backup [[Matt Barkley]] who continued to lead the offense to the New England 3-yard line where the Bills failed to score on 4th-and-goal. Both teams' offenses were unable to create any effective drives after this point. Nonetheless, Buffalo's offense managed to reach midfield on their final possession but Matt Barkley threw an easy interception to [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] as a result of pressure from [[Kyle Van Noy]]. This pick clinched the game for New England and they won 16\u201310.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patriots vs. Bills \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 29, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127866 |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Patriots overcame the Bills, this proved to be an extremely sloppy game for their offense, as [[Tom Brady]] recorded his first interception of the year at the Buffalo 2-yard line and a completion rate under 50%, having gone 18 of 39. New England's offense went a mere 5/18 on third down conversions and only obtained 11 first-downs. The defense, however, recorded four interceptions (three on [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] and one on [[Matt Barkley]]) as well as five sacks but also allowed 109 yards of rushing from [[Frank Gore]] and 23 first-downs.

Initially, both teams traded punts, but on the succeeding possession, Patriots' defenders missed numerous tackles and Washington scored on a 65-yard run by [[Steven Sims]]. This was the first time the Patriots had trailed all season. However, New England responded quickly with a no-huddle offense and marched 75 yards, scoring on a 6-yard catch by [[Julian Edelman]]. On the extra-point, newly signed [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Mike Nugent]] missed the kick, his first as a Patriot. Washington's next drive was halted by a sack from [[Danny Shelton]]. Neither team could reach midfield on any of the remaining possessions of the first quarter. With the Patriots' first drive in the second, they raced down the field to the Washington 19, but were stalled and forced to settle for a 37-yard field goal. Both teams went three-and-out on their next drives. Although, on the possession thereafter, [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] forced a fumble on [[Trey Quinn]] and [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] recovered. New England's offense failed to score despite being in the redzone, as [[Tom Brady]] threw an awful interception to [[Montae Nicholson]]. Even with this turnover, the Redskins offense lacked momentum and failed to advance. On the next Washington possession, [[Colt McCoy]] was picked by [[Jason McCourty]]. At the Washington 11-yard line, the Patriots went three-and-out and settled for a field goal with the score being 12\u20137 at the end of the first half. With the passing game being mostly unreliable, New England's offense began relying on and utilizing its running game far more. This proved vital as the Patriots advanced rapidly behind [[Sony Michel]]'s rushing attack and they scored on a 29-yard pass to [[Brandon Bolden]]. On the ensuing New England drive, they would score on a 14-yard run by Michel. Both teams exchanged punts for the rest of the game and the Patriots would score an additional touchdown on a 10-yard pass to [[Ryan Izzo]] in a 10-play, 58-yard possession.

Unlike last time, [[Sam Darnold]] returned from his injury and was healthy to start the game. New England started with the ball and scored on a 3-yard run by [[Sony Michel]] in a 16 play, 78 yard drive that drained 8:47 off the clock. The Jets sought to respond with a score but Darnold threw a hurried pass due to the blitz and was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]], his fifth this season. After failing to obtain a first down, New England settled for a 34-yard field goal. On the ensuing drive, New York went three-and-out and the Patriots took advantage by scoring on a 26-yard pass to [[Phillip Dorsett]]. With this touchdown, New England was up 17\u20130. [[John Simon (linebacker)|John Simon]] had a strip sack on Darnold and [[Kyle Van Noy]] recovered. The Patriots would score off another turnover, this time on another run by Sony Michel. New York finally gained momentum on a drive, reaching the Patriots 19, but Darnold made another ill-advised decision on a pass that was intercepted by [[Duron Harmon]]. Starting at their own 1, the Pariots' offense went three-and-out. Although the defense managed to make another stop on New York's struggling offense. Neither team scored for the rest of the half and the Patriots led 24\u20130 entering the second half. On the Jets' very first drive, Darnold was picked by [[Stephon Gilmore]]. New England failed to capitalize off the turnover but the defense recorded a safety after a high snap by Jets center [[Ryan Kalil]]. Unfortunately for the Patriots, Tom Brady was hit while trying to throw the ball and was intercepted by [[Trumaine Johnson (cornerback)|Trumaine Johnson]]. Despite being at the New England 33, the Jets failed to score as Darnold was picked off for the fourth time, this time by [[Terrence Brooks]]. For much of the remainder of the mathchup, both teams only punted.

Starting with the ball, New England had a slow start on offense. [[Sony Michel]] rushed for 10-yards on the first play, but the drive would soon stall. Cleveland went three-and-out on their first possession; and on the ensuing Patriots possession, they reached the Browns' 2 but were forced to settle for a field goal. They would score again after [[Kyle Van Noy]] returned 26-yard fumble \u2013 in which [[Nick Chubb]] lost the ball after his own lineman's foot knocked it loose -for a touchdown. Notably during the kickoff, [[rookie]] [[Punter (football)|punter]] [[Jake Bailey]] completed his first kick as the replacement for the recently injured [[Stephen Gostkowski]]. Surprisingly, Chubb, on the Browns' next drive, would fumble again after rushing past New England defenders to the Patriots 16 and [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] striking the ball out. The Patriots would soon punt after gaining possession. On Cleveland's first play, [[Baker Mayfield]] threw a shovel pass pick to [[Lawrence Guy]] who returned it to the Browns' 11. [[Tom Brady]] would hit [[Julian Edelman]] on an 8-yard touchdown, two plays later. Finally ending their streak of turnovers, the Browns reached midfield and punted. New England would go three-and-out on the next possession, and the Browns responded with a 21-yard touchdown pass to [[Demetrius Harris]] in an 8 play, 54 yard drive. Seeking to counter, New England attempted a field goal at the Browns 11, but it was blocked by [[Denzel Ward]]. Entering the second half, the Patriots were leading 17\u20137. On the first possession, Cleveland marched to the New England 11, however, a [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] sack halted their advance. The Patriots answered with a touchdown. During the drive, [[James White (running back)|James White]] recorded a 59-yard catch-and-run on a screen and Brady connected with Edelman for their second touchdown of the day. Both teams traded punts for the rest of the third quarter. New England would manage to reach the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] once again, but yet another possession was hampered, and they obtained a field goal. After a series of sacks and penalties on Cleveland, their drive lost momentum immediately and they failed to convert on 4th and 16 at their own 19. The Patriots sought to capitalize off the stop, but [[Mike Nugent]] missed his field goal wide left in what was his last game as a Patriots; he was cut from the team just days later. The Browns would score a field goal on the following possession and neither team would gain anything in particular thereafter.

In the first drive of the game, the Ravens converted twice on 3rd down. 7 of the Ravens plays in the first drive were runs by Lamar Jackson, Mark Ingram, and Gus Edwards. On 3rd down the Patriots seemingly held the Ravens to a field goal attempt, but a neutral zone infraction by Shilque Calhoun gave the Ravens a first down which then led to a 3-yard rushing touchdown by quarterback Lamar Jackson. On the Patriots' first possession Tom Brady threw 3 straight incomplete passes which led to a punt. The next drive, the Patriots defense showed improvement, holding the Ravens to a field goal. The Patriots, however, did not improve offensively as they had to punt after a 9-yard sack by Patrick Onwuasor. After the first quarter the Ravens led 10\u20130\n\nThe next drive was highlighted by a 53-yard run by Mark Ingram, and finished with a 12-yard rushing touchdown by Gus Edwards pushing the Ravens lead to 17\u20130. The Patriots once again failed to score after another three-and-out, but caught a break after former Patriot Cyrus Jones muffed a punt by Jake Bailey (recovered by newly- acquired special teamer Justin Bethel at the Baltimore 20 yard line). This led to a touchdown by newly-acquired receiver Mohammed Sanu, who become the 74th player to catch a touchdown pass from Tom Brady. After a three-and-out by the Ravens, the Patriots sustained a drive only to have a holding panalty on Marshall Newhouse and an intentional grounding call leading to a punt. The Patriots were set up in good field position after a fumble recovered by Lawrence Guy at the Ravens 19 yard line; however, the drive stalled at the 4 yard line.  The resulting field goal closed the score to 17-10. After a Ravens punt, the Patriots reached the Baltimore 1 yard line after a touchdown by James White was reversed on replay. Controversially, Patriots coach Belichick chose to kick a field goal on 4th and Goal at the 1, leaving the game 17-13  at the half.\n\nAt the start of the 3rd quarter the Patriots advanced to the Baltimore 30 led by receptions of 11 and 15 yards by Mohammed Sanu. A fumble by Julian Edelman was then returned 70 yards by Marlon Humphrey for a touchdown, widening the Ravens' lead to 24\u201313. The Patriots scored on their next drive on a 4-yard rushing touchdown on 3rd and 3 by James White. However, on the next drive the Ravens scored (taking 8:09 off the clock, in 14 plays), with 16 and 18 yard receptions by Marquise Brown and Mark Andrews. The drive climaxed in a 5-yard pass to Nick Boyle to make the lead 30\u201320 (the PAT missed by Justin Tucker).\n\nIn the 4th quarter, down two scores, Brady threw an interception to Earl Thomas which ultimately killed any chance of winning for the Patriots.  Lamar Jackson ran for a 1-yard touchdown after a 14 play drive, icing the game at 37\u201320. The game was viewed as an impressive win by the Ravens, with Lamar Jackson becoming a front runner for MVP.\n\nThis was the Patriots' first loss since December 16, 2018 against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. It was also their first loss to Baltimore since the 2012 AFC Championship Game.\n\n====Week 11: at Philadelphia Eagles====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Eleven: New England Patriots at Philadelphia Eagles&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=November 17\n|time=4:25&nbsp;p.m. EST\n|road='''Patriots'''\n|R1=0|R2=9|R3=8|R4=0\n|home=Eagles\n|H1=3|H2=7|H3=0|H4=0\n|stadium=[[Lincoln Financial Field]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n|attendance=69,796\n|weather=Cloudy, {{convert|42|F|C}}\n|referee=Bill Vinovich\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=Jim Nantz, Tony Romo and Tracy Wolfson\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019111710/2019/REG11/patriots@eagles Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/58059/PHI_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*PHI \u2013 [[Jake Elliott]] 42-yard field goal, 13:38.

They entered the season as the defending [[Super Bowl]] champions, after winning [[Super Bowl LIII]], and as three-time defending [[American Football Conference|AFC]] champions. The Patriots won the [[AFC East]] for the 11th straight season, and improved on their 11\u20135 record from [[2018 New England Patriots season|the previous season]], but they were [[Upset (sports)|upset]] by the [[Tennessee Titans]] in the Wild Card game.\n\nCatalyzed by their defense's historically dominant play, the Patriots started the season extremely well at 8\u20130 for the third time in franchise history, and early on there was conversation as to if they could repeat the undefeated [[2007 New England Patriots|2007 regular season]]. However, their winning streak would soon end as a result of their Week 9 loss to the [[2019 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]], which was also their first loss to the Ravens since the January 20, 2013 AFC Championship Game. In Week 12, the Patriots set a new NFL record with their 17th consecutive 10-win season, surpassing the [[San Francisco 49ers]], who set the original record of 16 consecutive 10-win seasons from 1983\u20131998.\n\nFor the first time since [[2009 New England Patriots season|2009]], [[Rob Gronkowski]], the team's former starting [[tight end]], was not on the active roster as he announced his retirement on March 24, 2019.<ref name=\"Bergman\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001024012/article/patriots-te-rob-gronkowski-announces-retirement |title=Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski announces retirement |first=Jeremy |last=Bergman |website=NFL.com |date=March 24, 2019 |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref> Also, for the first time since [[2010 New England Patriots season|2010]], the Patriots had a different kicker on the regular season roster as the struggling [[Stephen Gostkowski]] was placed on [[Injured reserve|IR]]; he was replaced by midseason signings [[Mike Nugent]],<ref name=\"MnugG\">{{cite web|last=Ulrich|first=Logan|url=https://nfltraderumors.co/patriots-signing-k-mike-nugent/|title=Patriots Signing K Mike Nugent|accessdate=October 3, 2019|date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> [[Nick Folk]],<ref name=\"FolKNic\">{{cite web |title=Report: Patriots Sign Nick Folk As New Kicker |url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2019/10/29/patriots-news-nick-folk-kicker-signing/ |website=Boston.CBSLocal.com |publisher=CBS Boston |accessdate=October 29, 2019|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref> and [[Kai Forbath]].\n\nWith their win over the [[2019 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] in Week 16, the Patriots clinched the AFC East for the 11th consecutive year.

The first drives ended in punts for both teams, but on the Patriots' second possession, they managed to race down the field on a seven-play, 82-yard drive that ended with a touchdown pass to [[Josh Gordon]], in which he broke two tackles after the catch. After forcing the Steelers to go three-and-out, due in part to a holding call on [[Alejandro Villanueva (American football)|Alejandro Villanueva]], the Patriots marched down the field, only for the drive to stall at the Pittsburgh 7-yard line, and the Patriots were forced to settle for a field goal, now leading 10\u20130 in the second quarter. New England went three-and-out on their following drive but scored on a 25-yard pass to [[Phillip Dorsett]] thereafter. In the Patriots' last possession of the first half, even with good field position, they failed to capitalize with a touchdown, settling for another field goal. Beginning the second half, the Patriots led 20\u20130. This lasted only briefly, as their defense gave up three points on the Steelers' first drive of the third quarter. [[Tom Brady]] and the offense responded quickly with a 58-yard pass to Dorsett, his second touchdown catch of the game. On their subsequent possessions, the Patriots scored field goals. Meanwhile, [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]]. In Pittsburgh's final drive, they managed to advance 50 yards down the field, but failed to score with time running out.

After forcing the Dolphins to go three-and-out, the Patriots countered with a drive in which [[Tom Brady]] targeted newly acquired [[wide receiver]] [[Antonio Brown]] three times for gains of 18, 10, and 8 yards. They finished the possession with a 1-yard touchdown run by [[Sony Michel]]. The next three drives ended in punts. Though, on the first, [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] was sacked by [[Adam Butler (American football)|Adam Butler]] on third down just after reaching midfield. On the Patriots' ensuing possession, they drove to the Dolphins 30 but [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed the first of a number of field goals that day. Despite the offense's lack of scoring, the New England defense played stoutly, forcing Miami to go three-and-out on their next two drives. The Patriots scored on a 65-yard possession that ended with a 20-yard pass from Tom Brady to Antonio Brown. Gostkowski missed the extra point and the Patriots led 13\u20130. In the second half, the New England offense failed to advance on their first drive. Meanwhile, Ryan Fitzpatrick was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]]. Now, with great field position, at the Miami 36, the Patriots failed to take advantage and were forced to settle for a field goal. The Dolphins' offense was unable to make anything of their next two drives going three-and-out on both while obtaining \u22122 yards and \u221211 yards on their first and second respectively. The Patriots offense made the best of their defense's solid play, marching down the field on an eight-play, 65-yard possession which ended with a 1-yard QB sneak by Brady. Later, New England's defense continued its sensational performance by forcing Miami to go three-and-out yet again. Upon entering the third quarter, Miami's offense had amassed a mere 28 yards. The Patriots' offense struggled, however, being unable to obtain a first-down. This proved irrelevant as the New England defense had pick-sixes on back-to-back drives: [[Stephon Gilmore]] returned the first 54-yards after a bad decision by Fitzpatrick and [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] returned the second 69-yards after a dropped pass. The Patriots now led 37\u20130. Ryan Fitzpatrick was replaced by backup [[Josh Rosen]] on the ensuing drive. The Patriots scored another touchdown on a 10-yard reception by [[James White (running back)|James White]]. On Miami's final possession, they marched 67-yards to the New England 8 but failed to score due to an interception by Jamie Collins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127862 |title=Patriots vs. Dolphins \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 15, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis was the Patriots' first win in Miami since Week 17 of the [[2016 New England Patriots season|2016 season]], and their first shutout since Week 3 of that same season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goss |first1=Nick |title=Bill Belichick sums up Patriots' shutout win vs. Dolphins with classic line |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/bill-belichick-sums-patriots-shutout-win-vs-dolphins-classic-line |website=NBCSports.com |accessdate=September 15, 2019|date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> Additionally, New England's defense held the Dolphins' offense to just 184 yards and forced four turnovers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/matchup?gameId=401127862 |title=Patriots vs. Dolphins \u2013 Team Statistics \u2013 September 15, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=September 20, 2019}}</ref> By holding the Dolphins to 0 points and the Steelers to 3 points a week prior, the defense made history, in fact, it tied the record for fewest points allowed through two games during the Super Bowl era.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Camenker |first1=James |title=Patriots defense make NFL history with performance through two games |url=https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/patriots-defense-make-nfl-history-performance-through-two-games |website=NBCSports.com |publisher=NBC Sports |accessdate=September 20, 2019|date=September 20, 2019}}</ref> After much speculation over whether [[Antonio Brown]] would debut against the Dolphins as a result of his rape lawsuit, he indeed started and had four receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buchmasser |first1=Bernd |title=Patriots vs Dolphins snap count report: Joe Thuney's iron man streak comes to an end; Antonio Brown plays 23 snaps |url=https://www.patspulpit.com/2019/9/16/20868097/new-england-patriots-miami-dolphins-snap-count-report-joe-thuney-iron-man-streak-comes-to-an-end |website=PatsPulpit.com |publisher=Pats Pulpit |accessdate=September 16, 2019|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> This proved to be to Brown's sole game with the Patriots as he was released days later on September 20, as a result of his response to further allegations.<ref name=\"ABrownRelease\" />\n\n====Week 3: vs. New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Three: New York Jets at New England Patriots&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=September 22\n|time=1:00&nbsp;p.m. EDT\n|road=Jets\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=7|R4=7\n|home='''Patriots'''\n|H1=13|H2=7|H3=10|H4=0\n|stadium=Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts\n|attendance=65,878\n|weather=Sunny and warm, {{convert|81|F|C}}\n|referee=[[Carl Cheffers]]\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kevin Harlan]], [[Rich Gannon]] and [[Dana Jacobson]]\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019092206/2019/REG3/jets@patriots Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57939/NE_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*NE \u2013 [[Sony Michel]] 5-yard run (kick failed, wide right), 7:55.

Continuing his struggles on [[special teams]], [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed his third extra-point of the year. On the Jets\u2019 ensuing drive, they went three-and-out as a result of a sack by [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]]. Meanwhile, New Englands\u2019 offense would score yet another touchdown, this time on a 25-yard catch-and-run by [[Phillip Dorsett]]. New York's offense failed to obtain any first-downs for the rest of the first half, and the Patriots would score an additional touchdown on a 3-yard pass from [[Tom Brady]] to [[Julian Edelman]]. Although, the rest of their drives ended in punts. Entering the second half, New England led 20\u20130. The Patriots started with the ball but were unable to reach midfield and were forced to punt. On the following drive, Luke Falk threw an underthrown [[interception]] to [[Devin McCourty]] which was returned 24-yards to the New York 17. Unfortunately, the Patriots were unable to take advantage and settled for a 37-yard field goal. The defense would still play stoutly, forcing the Jets to go three-and-out on their ensuing drive, caused, in part, by a holding penalty on [[Kelechi Osemele]]. The Patriots countered with a 10-play, 60-yard drive which ended with a 2-yard rush touchdown by [[Rex Burkhead]], leading 30\u20130. Notably, [[Josh Gordon]] caught a spectacular 28-yard reception on third and 22, saving the drive from stalling and entering the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]]. On New York's next drive, they managed the reach near midfield but the drive was halted by a sack by [[Dont'a Hightower]] and [[Adam Butler (American football)|Adam Butler]]. The punt would prove disastrous for New England as [[rookie]] [[Gunner Olszewski]] muffed the ball and [[Arthur Maulet]], of the Jets, recovered it in the [[end zone]] for a touchdown: this was the first touchdown the Patriots had allowed all season. The ensuing two drives ended in punts. Although, on the Patriots' subsequent possession thereafter, Tom Brady was substituted by rookie [[Jarrett Stidham]] with 8:41 left in the fourth. Stidham threw a badly missed pass which was intercepted by [[Jamal Adams]] and returned 61 yards for a touchdown.

The Patriots began with the ball and started well with a 15-yard rush by [[Sony Michel]] on the first play. Though the drive faltered thereafter and they were forced to punt. In contrast, the defense maintained its tremendous play by intercepting [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] on the Bills' first drive; [[Devin McCourty]] claimed his fourth pick of the season. Taking advantage of the turnover, New England's offense marched 50 yards down the field for a 4-yard touchdown run by [[Brandon Bolden]]. Tom Brady also threw a catch-and-run pass to [[James White (running back)|James White]] for 26 yards despite great coverage by [[Matt Milano]]. On the extra point attempt, [[Stephen Gostkowski]] missed yet another extra point, his fourth of the season. On the ensuing possession, the Bills struggled to obtain yards and went three-and-out. On the resulting punt, [[J. C. Jackson]] blocked [[Corey Bojorquez]]'s kick which was recovered and returned by [[Matthew Slater]] for a touchdown to put the Patriots up 13\u20130. Both teams' offenses failed to reach midfield and punted on the next two drives. However, on the possession after that, Josh Allen threw another pick, which was intercepted by J. C. Jackson. Without much momentum and at their own 25, New England went three-and-out, although Buffalo went three-and-out as well. Now at their own 5-yard line, the Patriots offense finally managed an effective drive for once. They drove 93 yards to the Buffalo 2-yard line, but the drive stalled and Brady threw a terrible pick to [[Micah Hyde (American football)|Micah Hyde]] in the endzone. Buffalo capitalized with a 46-yard field goal by [[Stephen Hauschka]]. Unable to counter, New England went three-and-out once more and the Bills drove to the New England 31 but failed to score as Hauschka missed a 49-yard field goal with time running out in the first half. Entering the second half, the Patriots led 13\u20133. The Bills' first drive was very effective as they marched 75 yards down the field and scored on a 1-yard QB sneak by Allen. This was the first touchdown allowed by the Patriots' defense all season. On the subsequent three possessions, both offenses only experienced only three-and-outs. Afterward, J. C. Jackson intercepted Josh Allen for his second pick of the day. Even with great field position at the Buffalo 42, the Patriots only managed to reach the Buffalo 4-yard line where they settled for a field goal. Josh Allen was concussed from a hit by [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] on the ensuing drive while he attempted to scramble for a first down. Allen would be replaced by backup [[Matt Barkley]] who continued to lead the offense to the New England 3-yard line where the Bills failed to score on 4th-and-goal. Both teams' offenses were unable to create any effective drives after this point. Nonetheless, Buffalo's offense managed to reach midfield on their final possession but Matt Barkley threw an easy interception to [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] as a result of pressure from [[Kyle Van Noy]]. This pick clinched the game for New England and they won 16\u201310.<ref>{{cite web |title=Patriots vs. Bills \u2013 Play-By-Play \u2013 September 29, 2019 \u2013 ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=401127866 |website=ESPN.com |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Patriots overcame the Bills, this proved to be an extremely sloppy game for their offense, as [[Tom Brady]] recorded his first interception of the year at the Buffalo 2-yard line and a completion rate under 50%, having gone 18 of 39. New England's offense went a mere 5/18 on third down conversions and only obtained 11 first-downs. The defense, however, recorded four interceptions (three on [[Josh Allen (quarterback)|Josh Allen]] and one on [[Matt Barkley]]) as well as five sacks but also allowed 109 yards of rushing from [[Frank Gore]] and 23 first-downs.

Initially, both teams traded punts, but on the succeeding possession, Patriots' defenders missed numerous tackles and Washington scored on a 65-yard run by [[Steven Sims]]. This was the first time the Patriots had trailed all season. However, New England responded quickly with a no-huddle offense and marched 75 yards, scoring on a 6-yard catch by [[Julian Edelman]]. On the extra-point, newly signed [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Mike Nugent]] missed the kick, his first as a Patriot. Washington's next drive was halted by a sack from [[Danny Shelton]]. Neither team could reach midfield on any of the remaining possessions of the first quarter. With the Patriots' first drive in the second, they raced down the field to the Washington 19, but were stalled and forced to settle for a 37-yard field goal. Both teams went three-and-out on their next drives. Although, on the possession thereafter, [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] forced a fumble on [[Trey Quinn]] and [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] recovered. New England's offense failed to score despite being in the redzone, as [[Tom Brady]] threw an awful interception to [[Montae Nicholson]]. Even with this turnover, the Redskins offense lacked momentum and failed to advance. On the next Washington possession, [[Colt McCoy]] was picked by [[Jason McCourty]]. At the Washington 11-yard line, the Patriots went three-and-out and settled for a field goal with the score being 12\u20137 at the end of the first half. With the passing game being mostly unreliable, New England's offense began relying on and utilizing its running game far more. This proved vital as the Patriots advanced rapidly behind [[Sony Michel]]'s rushing attack and they scored on a 29-yard pass to [[Brandon Bolden]]. On the ensuing New England drive, they would score on a 14-yard run by Michel. Both teams exchanged punts for the rest of the game and the Patriots would score an additional touchdown on a 10-yard pass to [[Ryan Izzo]] in a 10-play, 58-yard possession.

Unlike last time, [[Sam Darnold]] returned from his injury and was healthy to start the game. New England started with the ball and scored on a 3-yard run by [[Sony Michel]] in a 16 play, 78 yard drive that drained 8:47 off the clock. The Jets sought to respond with a score but Darnold threw a hurried pass due to the blitz and was intercepted by [[Devin McCourty]], his fifth this season. After failing to obtain a first down, New England settled for a 34-yard field goal. On the ensuing drive, New York went three-and-out and the Patriots took advantage by scoring on a 26-yard pass to [[Phillip Dorsett]]. With this touchdown, New England was up 17\u20130. [[John Simon (linebacker)|John Simon]] had a strip sack on Darnold and [[Kyle Van Noy]] recovered. The Patriots would score off another turnover, this time on another run by Sony Michel. New York finally gained momentum on a drive, reaching the Patriots 19, but Darnold made another ill-advised decision on a pass that was intercepted by [[Duron Harmon]]. Starting at their own 1, the Pariots' offense went three-and-out. Although the defense managed to make another stop on New York's struggling offense. Neither team scored for the rest of the half and the Patriots led 24\u20130 entering the second half. On the Jets' very first drive, Darnold was picked by [[Stephon Gilmore]]. New England failed to capitalize off the turnover but the defense recorded a safety after a high snap by Jets center [[Ryan Kalil]]. Unfortunately for the Patriots, Tom Brady was hit while trying to throw the ball and was intercepted by [[Trumaine Johnson (cornerback)|Trumaine Johnson]]. Despite being at the New England 33, the Jets failed to score as Darnold was picked off for the fourth time, this time by [[Terrence Brooks]]. For much of the remainder of the mathchup, both teams only punted.

Starting with the ball, New England had a slow start on offense. [[Sony Michel]] rushed for 10-yards on the first play, but the drive would soon stall. Cleveland went three-and-out on their first possession; and on the ensuing Patriots possession, they reached the Browns' 2 but were forced to settle for a field goal. They would score again after [[Kyle Van Noy]] returned 26-yard fumble \u2013 in which [[Nick Chubb]] lost the ball after his own lineman's foot knocked it loose -for a touchdown. Notably during the kickoff, [[rookie]] [[Punter (football)|punter]] [[Jake Bailey]] completed his first kick as the replacement for the recently injured [[Stephen Gostkowski]]. Surprisingly, Chubb, on the Browns' next drive, would fumble again after rushing past New England defenders to the Patriots 16 and [[Jonathan Jones (American football)|Jonathan Jones]] striking the ball out. The Patriots would soon punt after gaining possession. On Cleveland's first play, [[Baker Mayfield]] threw a shovel pass pick to [[Lawrence Guy]] who returned it to the Browns' 11. [[Tom Brady]] would hit [[Julian Edelman]] on an 8-yard touchdown, two plays later. Finally ending their streak of turnovers, the Browns reached midfield and punted. New England would go three-and-out on the next possession, and the Browns responded with a 21-yard touchdown pass to [[Demetrius Harris]] in an 8 play, 54 yard drive. Seeking to counter, New England attempted a field goal at the Browns 11, but it was blocked by [[Denzel Ward]]. Entering the second half, the Patriots were leading 17\u20137. On the first possession, Cleveland marched to the New England 11, however, a [[Jamie Collins (American football)|Jamie Collins]] sack halted their advance. The Patriots answered with a touchdown. During the drive, [[James White (running back)|James White]] recorded a 59-yard catch-and-run on a screen and Brady connected with Edelman for their second touchdown of the day. Both teams traded punts for the rest of the third quarter. New England would manage to reach the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] once again, but yet another possession was hampered, and they obtained a field goal. After a series of sacks and penalties on Cleveland, their drive lost momentum immediately and they failed to convert on 4th and 16 at their own 19. The Patriots sought to capitalize off the stop, but [[Mike Nugent]] missed his field goal wide left in what was his last game as a Patriots; he was cut from the team just days later. The Browns would score a field goal on the following possession and neither team would gain anything in particular thereafter.

In the first drive of the game, the Ravens converted twice on 3rd down. 7 of the Ravens plays in the first drive were runs by Lamar Jackson, Mark Ingram, and Gus Edwards. On 3rd down the Patriots seemingly held the Ravens to a field goal attempt, but a neutral zone infraction by Shilque Calhoun gave the Ravens a first down which then led to a 3-yard rushing touchdown by quarterback Lamar Jackson. On the Patriots' first possession Tom Brady threw 3 straight incomplete passes which led to a punt. The next drive, the Patriots defense showed improvement, holding the Ravens to a field goal. The Patriots, however, did not improve offensively as they had to punt after a 9-yard sack by Patrick Onwuasor. After the first quarter the Ravens led 10\u20130\n\nThe next drive was highlighted by a 53-yard run by Mark Ingram, and finished with a 12-yard rushing touchdown by Gus Edwards pushing the Ravens lead to 17\u20130. The Patriots once again failed to score after another three-and-out, but caught a break after former Patriot Cyrus Jones muffed a punt by Jake Bailey (recovered by newly- acquired special teamer Justin Bethel at the Baltimore 20 yard line). This led to a touchdown by newly-acquired receiver Mohammed Sanu, who become the 74th player to catch a touchdown pass from Tom Brady. After a three-and-out by the Ravens, the Patriots sustained a drive only to have a holding panalty on Marshall Newhouse and an intentional grounding call leading to a punt. The Patriots were set up in good field position after a fumble recovered by Lawrence Guy at the Ravens 19 yard line; however, the drive stalled at the 4 yard line.  The resulting field goal closed the score to 17-10. After a Ravens punt, the Patriots reached the Baltimore 1 yard line after a touchdown by James White was reversed on replay. Controversially, Patriots coach Belichick chose to kick a field goal on 4th and Goal at the 1, leaving the game 17-13  at the half.\n\nAt the start of the 3rd quarter the Patriots advanced to the Baltimore 30 led by receptions of 11 and 15 yards by Mohammed Sanu. A fumble by Julian Edelman was then returned 70 yards by Marlon Humphrey for a touchdown, widening the Ravens' lead to 24\u201313. The Patriots scored on their next drive on a 4-yard rushing touchdown on 3rd and 3 by James White. However, on the next drive the Ravens scored (taking 8:09 off the clock, in 14 plays), with 16 and 18 yard receptions by Marquise Brown and Mark Andrews. The drive climaxed in a 5-yard pass to Nick Boyle to make the lead 30\u201320 (the PAT missed by Justin Tucker).\n\nIn the 4th quarter, down two scores, Brady threw an interception to Earl Thomas which ultimately killed any chance of winning for the Patriots.  Lamar Jackson ran for a 1-yard touchdown after a 14 play drive, icing the game at 37\u201320. The game was viewed as an impressive win by the Ravens, with Lamar Jackson becoming a front runner for MVP.\n\nThis was the Patriots' first loss since December 16, 2018 against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. It was also their first loss to Baltimore since the 2012 AFC Championship Game.\n\n====Week 11: at Philadelphia Eagles====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|New England Patriots|year=2019|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Week Eleven: New England Patriots at Philadelphia Eagles&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date=November 17\n|time=4:25&nbsp;p.m. EST\n|road='''Patriots'''\n|R1=0|R2=9|R3=8|R4=0\n|home=Eagles\n|H1=3|H2=7|H3=0|H4=0\n|stadium=[[Lincoln Financial Field]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n|attendance=69,796\n|weather=Cloudy, {{convert|42|F|C}}\n|referee=Bill Vinovich\n|TV=CBS\n|TVAnnouncers=Jim Nantz, Tony Romo and Tracy Wolfson\n|reference=[https://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2019111710/2019/REG11/patriots@eagles Recap], [https://nflcdns.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/58059/PHI_Gamebook.pdf Game Book]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*PHI \u2013 [[Jake Elliott]] 42-yard field goal, 13:38.
