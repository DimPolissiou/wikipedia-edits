But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The \"average\" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would not reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by ''Pollster.com'': if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or [[Local regression|LOESS]].\n\nHowever, while adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from \"similar\" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his [[PECOTA|baseball forecasting]]: using [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor analysis]] he first identified \"most similar states\" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from \"similar states\". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.\n\nFurthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2008 Democratic party primary elections]] was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in [[2008 North Carolina Democratic primary|North Carolina]] and [[2008 Indiana Democratic primary|Indiana]], for example.<ref name=\"Poblano Model\" /> Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and \"similar states,\" Silver estimated a \"538 [[Regression analysis|regression]]\" using historical voting information along with [[demography|demographic]] characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.\n\nIn July 2008, the site began to report regular updates of projections of 2008 U.S. Senate races. Special procedures were developed relying on both polls and [[demographic analysis]].

But especially in the early months of the election season polling in many states is sparse and episodic. The \"average\" of polls over an extended period (perhaps several weeks) would not reveal the true state of voter preferences at the present time, nor provide an accurate forecast of the future. One approach to this problem was followed by ''Pollster.com'': if enough polls were available, it computed a locally weighted moving average or [[Local regression|LOESS]].\n\nHowever, while adopting such an approach in his own analysis, Silver reasoned that there was additional information available in polls from \"similar\" states that might help to fill the gaps in information about the trends in a given state. Accordingly, he adapted an approach that he had previously used in his [[PECOTA|baseball forecasting]]: using [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor analysis]] he first identified \"most similar states\" and then factored into his electoral projections for a given state the polling information from \"similar states\". He carried this approach one step further by also factoring national polling trends into the estimates for a given state. Thus, his projections were not simply based on the polling trends in a given state.\n\nFurthermore, a basic intuition that Silver drew from his analysis of the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2008 Democratic party primary elections]] was that the voting history of a state or Congressional district provided clues to current voting. This is what allowed him to beat all the pollsters in his forecasts in the Democratic primaries in [[2008 North Carolina Democratic primary|North Carolina]] and [[2008 Indiana Democratic primary|Indiana]], for example.<ref name=\"Poblano Model\" /> Using such information allowed Silver to come up with estimates of the vote preferences even in states for which there were few if any polls. For his general election projections for each state, in addition to relying on the available polls in a given state and \"similar states,\" Silver estimated a \"538 [[Regression analysis|regression]]\" using historical voting information along with [[demography|demographic]] characteristics of the states to create an estimate that he treated as a separate poll (equivalent to the actually available polls from that state). This approach helped to stabilize his projections, because if there were few if any polls in a given state, the state forecast was largely determined by the 538 regression estimate.\n\nIn July 2008, the site began to report regular updates of projections of 2008 U.S. Senate races. Special procedures were developed relying on both polls and [[demographic analysis]]. The projections were updated on a weekly basis.<ref group=\"538\">{{cite web|last1=Silver|first1=Nate|authorlink1=Nate Silver|title=Senate Forecast, 7/18: Republican Outlook Improves with Focus on Likely Voter Polls|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/search/label/senate%20rankings|publisher=FiveThirtyEight|accessdate=March 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123084638/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/search/label/senate%20rankings|archivedate=January 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Final projections of 2008 elections===\nIn the final update of his presidential forecast model at midday of November 4, 2008, Silver projected a popular vote victory by 6.1 percentage points for [[Barack Obama]] and electoral vote totals of 349 (based on a probabilistic projection) or 353 (based on fixed projections of each state).<ref group=538>{{cite web|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/todays-polls-and-final-election.html|title=Today's Polls and Final Election Projection: Obama 349, McCain 189|work=FiveThirtyEight|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204075833/http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/todays-polls-and-final-election.html|archivedate=December 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Obama won with 365 electoral college votes. Silver's predictions matched the actual results everywhere except in [[Indiana]] and the 2nd congressional district of [[Nebraska]], which awards an electoral vote separately from the rest of the state. His projected [[2008 United States presidential election|national popular vote differential]] was below the actual figure of 7.2 points.\n\nThe forecasts for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] proved to be correct for every race. But the near stalemate in [[Minnesota]] led to a recount that was settled only on June 30, 2009. In [[Alaska]], after a protracted counting of ballots, on November 19 Republican incumbent [[Ted Stevens]] conceded the seat to Democrat [[Mark Begich]], an outcome that Silver had forecast on election day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/18/alaska.senate.race/index.html|title=Stevens concedes Alaska Senate race|publisher=}}</ref> And in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a run-off election on December 2 led to the re-election of Republican [[Saxby Chambliss]], a result that was also consistent with Silver's original projection.\n\n==After the 2008 U.S. election==\n\n===Focus===\nDuring the first two months after the election, no major innovations in content were introduced.
