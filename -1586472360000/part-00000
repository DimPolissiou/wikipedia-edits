He is recognized as the [[Fast bowling|fastest bowler]] in the history of [[cricket]], delivering a world record top speed of 161.3{{nbsp}}km/h (100.23{{nbsp}}mph) in a pool match against England during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/fastest-bowl-of-a-cricket-ball/|title=Fastest delivery of a cricket ball (male)|author=|date=|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref> Akhtar was nicknamed \"Rawalpindi Express\" and \"Tiger\" as a tribute to his hometown and fast bowling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/25921/shoaib-akhtar-the-legend-the-sensation-the-enigma/|title=Shoaib Akhtar \u2013 the legend, the sensation, the enigma|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://purbat.com/most-feared-fast-bowlers-cricket/|title=10 Most feared fast bowlers in Cricket history - Purbat.com|date=1 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref> He is also the first bowler to break the 100&nbsp;mph barrier, doing so twice in his career.\n\nAkhtar made his [[Test cricket|Test]] debut in November 1997 as an opening [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] and played his first [[One Day International]] three months later. Akhtar has been involved in several controversies during his career, often accused of unsportsmanlike conduct, despite his commendations for significantly impacting games in Pakistan's favour. Akhtar was sent home during a Test match series in Australia in 2005 for alleged poor attitude. A year later, he was embroiled in a drug scandal after testing positive for the performance-enhancing substance [[nandrolone]]. However, the ban imposed on him was lifted on appeal.

His father, Mohammad Akhtar, \"from a hardworking economically unprivileged family of the [[Gujjar]] community\", who worked as a night watchman at a petrol station belonging to the [[Attock Refinery Limited|Attock oil refinery]], married his mother, Hameeda [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]], when she was still a teenager, and they had five children: four sons, Shoaib being the fourth after Shahid, Tahir and Obaid, followed by a daughter, Shumaila.<ref>Shoaib Akhtar; Anshu Dogra, ''Controversially yours'', [[HarperCollins]] (2011), p. 6</ref>\n\nHe married Rubab Khan on 11 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Haripur: Shoaib Akhtar tie the knot with Rubbabb|url=http://dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Cricket/226712-Haripur-Shoaib-Akhtar-tie-the-knot-with-Rubab|publisher=dunyanews.tv|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Shoaib Akhtar secretly marries 20-year old Rubab Khan|url=http://www.india.com/sports/shoaib-akhtar-secretly-marries-20-year-old-rubab-khan-84313/|publisher=india.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629102747/http://www.india.com/sports/shoaib-akhtar-secretly-marries-20-year-old-rubab-khan-84313/|archivedate=29 June 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nA good student, Akhtar was admitted to the [[Government College Asghar Mall Rawalpindi|Asghar Mall College]], but disrupted his studies to attend trials for the [[Pakistan International Airlines cricket team|PIA team]]'s Karachi division to be held in Lahore. Lacking the money for a bus ticket, he waited for the bus to start and got onto the roof.<ref>Shoaib Akhtar; Anshu Dogra, ''Controversially yours'', [[HarperCollins]] (2011), pp. 42-43</ref> After some struggle, starting his [[List A]] career during the 1993/1994 season and his [[First-class cricket|First-class]] career during the 1994/1995 one, he caught the eye of [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]], then the chief executive of the [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]], and after a good performance for the [[Pakistan A]] team's tour of England, in 1996, he was rewarded his maiden Test cap against the West Indies, in 1997.<ref>Shoaib Akhtar; Anshu Dogra, ''Controversially yours'', [[HarperCollins]] (2011), pp. 58-59</ref>\n\n==International career==\nConsidering his subsequent high profile in cricket, Akhtar's test career started rather modestly. He was first picked to play on his home ground in Rawalpindi during the 2nd Test of the West Indies 1997/98 tour of Pakistan. He was subsequently included in the tour of South Africa during the winter of 1998, where he played in all three Tests. He was notably the spearhead of a depleted Pakistani bowling attack in the Peshawar Test against the visiting Australians later in 1998, where Mark Taylor scored his famous unbeaten 334 in Australia's first innings. Subsequently, after 8 tests and 16 innings, Akhtar had accumulated only 18 wickets.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/42655.html |title=Player profile: Shoaib Akhtar |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAkhtar's run of average performances started in 1999, during a pre-World Cup series against India. It was followed by high-class bowling performances in [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] and later in the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]].\n\nIn 2002, he was selected for the Pakistan team against [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and achieved  a small amount of success. However he performed poorly during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] and after the tournament he was dropped from the Pakistan squad. \nHe was selected back into the Pakistan squad as they had no choice in the 2004 Test match series against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]], but struggled in a losing Test series against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 2004. The series ended with a controversy when he left the field citing an injury leading to suspicions by former Pakistan captain, [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], about his commitment to the team. As a result, his relationship with [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] and former Pakistan coach [[Bob Woolmer]] deteriorated. A medical panel was set up by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] to investigate the nature of his injury, however Pakistan officials dispelled all suspicions.<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/140776.html | title = Bone scan puts Akhtar in the clear | accessdate = 10 April 2006 }}</ref>\n[[File:Shoaib Akhtar2.jpg|thumb]]\nIn 2005, Akhtar regained his reputation as a fast bowler for his side. Playing in a three Test home series against [[England cricket team|England]], he made a series of impressive bowling performances. His effective use of slower deliveries proved to be unplayable by the English batsmen. Akhtar emerged as the highest wicket taker of the series with seventeen wickets. His comeback was also remarkable as prior to his return, he had been criticised from all corners; such as by the Worcestershire chairman John Elliot for his celebrity attitude and lack of commitment to the team. His performance was also acknowledged by the English captain [[Michael Vaughan]], who remarked \"I thought he (Shoaib) was a big difference between the two teams\".<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/228332.html | title = Vaughan \u2013 Batsmen to blame | accessdate = 10 April 2006 }}</ref> He is also known as one of only three bowlers to have ever broken the 100&nbsp;mph barrier in cricket history, with a delivery of 100.2&nbsp;mph, during a one-day international against England in World cup 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149874.html|title=Blink and you'll miss it|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Struggle for form and consistent injuries (2007\u20132009)===\nOn 29 October 2007, Akhtar made his return to cricket, from his 13 match ban and performed well, taking 4 wickets for 43 runs against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] in the fifth and deciding One Day International series in Lahore in Pakistan. Subsequently, he was included in the 16-man Pakistan squad for the [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 2007\u201308|2007 tour of India]].\n\n===Rehabilitation and final years (2010\u20132011)===\nAkhtar made a return to international cricket albeit in the shorter format of the game. In May 2010, PCB named him in a list of 35 probables for the [[2010 Asia Cup|Asia Cup]]. On 15 June 2010, Akhtar made his return, taking 3 wickets for 28 runs in the first match of the Asia Cup against Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ravindran|first=Siddarth|title=Shoaib Akhtar makes a respectable return|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/asia2010/content/story/463287.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=15 June 2010}}</ref> He narrowly missed out a spot in the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]] in place of the injured Umar Gul.\n\nIn July 2010, he was selected for the Twenty20 [[Australian cricket team against Pakistan in England in 2010|series against Australia]] but the selectors decided not to play him in the Test squad so that he would not get injured.

He did achieve his moments of success, such as taking 5 wickets for 35 runs for Durham against Somerset in the [[National League (cricket)|National League]] in 2003 and claiming 6 wickets for 16 runs in the same competition for Worcestershire against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] two years later, but he suffered from fitness problems, as well as a perception that he was less than interested in his task.

After a poor performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he got involved in a verbal conflict with former Pakistan captain and fast bowler [[Waqar Younis]]. Later on Akhtar was sacked along with other players, including Younis. In a triangular series in 2003 held in Sri Lanka, he was caught [[ball tampering]] making him the second player in cricket to be banned on ball tampering charges. The same year he was banned for one Test match and two One Day International matches for abusing South African spin bowler [[Paul Adams (cricketer)|Paul Adams]], during a match against South Africa. In the 2004 home series with India, he struggled with wrist and back injuries, which raised questions about his commitment to the team.\n\nHe was sent back from the 2005 Australia tour with a hamstring injury amid rumours of indiscipline, lack of commitment and attitudinal complaints.

Akhtar has been involved in several controversies during his career, often accused of unsportsmanlike conduct, despite his commendations for significantly impacting games in Pakistan's favour.

Lacking the money for a bus ticket, he waited for the bus to start and got onto the roof.<ref>Shoaib Akhtar; Anshu Dogra, ''Controversially yours'', [[HarperCollins]] (2011), pp. 42-43</ref> After some struggle, starting his [[List A]] career during the 1993/1994 season and his [[First-class cricket|First-class]] career during the 1994/1995 one, he caught the eye of [[Majid Khan (cricketer, born 1946)|Majid Khan]], then the chief executive of the [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]], and after a good performance for the [[Pakistan A]] team's tour of England, in 1996, he was rewarded his maiden Test cap against the West Indies, in 1997.<ref>Shoaib Akhtar; Anshu Dogra, ''Controversially yours'', [[HarperCollins]] (2011), pp. 58-59</ref>\n\n==International career==\nConsidering his subsequent high profile in cricket, Akhtar's test career started rather modestly. He was first picked to play on his home ground in Rawalpindi during the 2nd Test of the West Indies 1997/98 tour of Pakistan. He was subsequently included in the tour of South Africa during the winter of 1998, where he played in all three Tests. He was notably the spearhead of a depleted Pakistani bowling attack in the Peshawar Test against the visiting Australians later in 1998, where Mark Taylor scored his famous unbeaten 334 in Australia's first innings. Subsequently, after 8 tests and 16 innings, Akhtar had accumulated only 18 wickets.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/42655.html |title=Player profile: Shoaib Akhtar |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nAkhtar's run of average performances started in 1999, during a pre-World Cup series against India. It was followed by high-class bowling performances in [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] and later in the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]].\n\nIn 2002, he was selected for the Pakistan team against [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] and achieved  a small amount of success. However he performed poorly during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] and after the tournament he was dropped from the Pakistan squad. \nHe was selected back into the Pakistan squad as they had no choice in the 2004 Test match series against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]], but struggled in a losing Test series against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 2004. The series ended with a controversy when he left the field citing an injury leading to suspicions by former Pakistan captain, [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], about his commitment to the team. As a result, his relationship with [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] and former Pakistan coach [[Bob Woolmer]] deteriorated. A medical panel was set up by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] to investigate the nature of his injury, however Pakistan officials dispelled all suspicions.<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/140776.html | title = Bone scan puts Akhtar in the clear | accessdate = 10 April 2006 }}</ref>\n[[File:Shoaib Akhtar2.jpg|thumb]]\nIn 2005, Akhtar regained his reputation as a fast bowler for his side. Playing in a three Test home series against [[England cricket team|England]], he made a series of impressive bowling performances. His effective use of slower deliveries proved to be unplayable by the English batsmen. Akhtar emerged as the highest wicket taker of the series with seventeen wickets. His comeback was also remarkable as prior to his return, he had been criticised from all corners; such as by the Worcestershire chairman John Elliot for his celebrity attitude and lack of commitment to the team. His performance was also acknowledged by the English captain [[Michael Vaughan]], who remarked \"I thought he (Shoaib) was a big difference between the two teams\".<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/228332.html | title = Vaughan \u2013 Batsmen to blame | accessdate = 10 April 2006 }}</ref> He is also known as one of only three bowlers to have ever broken the 100&nbsp;mph barrier in cricket history, with a delivery of 100.2&nbsp;mph, during a one-day international against England in World cup 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/149874.html|title=Blink and you'll miss it|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Struggle for form and consistent injuries (2007\u20132009)===\nOn 29 October 2007, Akhtar made his return to cricket, from his 13 match ban and performed well, taking 4 wickets for 43 runs against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] in the fifth and deciding One Day International series in Lahore in Pakistan. Subsequently, he was included in the 16-man Pakistan squad for the [[Pakistani cricket team in India in 2007\u201308|2007 tour of India]].\n\n===Rehabilitation and final years (2010\u20132011)===\nAkhtar made a return to international cricket albeit in the shorter format of the game. In May 2010, PCB named him in a list of 35 probables for the [[2010 Asia Cup|Asia Cup]].

After a poor performance in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he got involved in a verbal conflict with former Pakistan captain and fast bowler [[Waqar Younis]]. Later on Akhtar was sacked along with other players, including Younis. In a triangular series in 2003 held in Sri Lanka, he was caught [[ball tampering]] making him the second player in cricket to be banned on ball tampering charges. The same year he was banned for one Test match and two One Day International matches for abusing South African spin bowler [[Paul Adams (cricketer)|Paul Adams]], during a match against South Africa.

White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for lead single \"[[This Is England (song)|This Is England]]\"; by the album's release, the band members were so discouraged that they did not turn up for the first day's shoot. Strummer moved to Spain, in part due to family issues, but also to escape the backlash.\n\nThe album was poorly received upon release, and is still generally regarded as the band's worst album; Strummer performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash\u2019s compilations and box sets. Some retrospective assessments have been more sympathetic; a number of critics and writers have praised Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance, and Rhode's production, especially on the tracks \"This Is England\", \"Dirty Punk\" and \"Three Card Trick\".\n\n==Background==\n[[The Clash]]'s internal difficulties during 1983 led to two of its core members being fired: guitarist [[Mick Jones (The Clash guitarist)|Mick Jones]] was seen as adopting rock star posturing that vocalist [[Joe Strummer]] considered anathema to what the band stood for, and drummer [[Topper Headon]] had developed a [[heroin]] addiction which left him unreliable.<ref name=\"e103\">Egan (2014), p. 103</ref> After the band undertook rehearsals in London during June 1983,<ref>Gilbert (2014), pp. 336\u2013337</ref> interpersonal tensions reemerged.

''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', 24 November 1985</ref>\n\n''Cut the Crap'' has been favourably reevaluated in some retrospective reviews, many praising Strummer's songwriting and vocal performance. For example, the writer [[Jon Savage]] praised the album in his influential 1991 book on the history of punk, ''England's Dreaming'',<ref name=\"k123\" />  highlighting the \"innovative use of rap rhythm and atmosphere\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Savage |first1=Jon |title=England's Dreaming |date=2005 |publisher=Faber & Faber |location=London |isbn=0571227201 |page=590 |edition=Main}}</ref> Yet its reputation as a failure, or at least as a lost opportunity, has endured. In 2002, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] described \"This Is England\" as \"surprisingly nervy\" on a record that, in his view, is otherwise \"formulaic, tired punk rock that doesn't have the aggression or purpose of early Clash records\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Joe-Strummer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Strummer in concert, supporting [[the Pogues]], Japan, 1992]]\nStrummer was depressed by both the album's sound and critical appraisal. Asked in 1986 how the reviews affected him, he replied: \"Sure I read [them] but I didn't need them to tell me.

The album was not mentioned in the Clash documentary ''[[The Clash: Westway to the World]]'' (2000) and was acknowledged only briefly in the official illustrated biography ''The Clash'' (2008), not receiving an overview as the first five albums had.

During production, Rhodes took charge of the [[arrangement]]s, track sequencing and the final [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]]. His production choices, which rely heavily on Strummer's preference for [[synthesizers|synthetic]] drum sounds and Rhodes' own inclusion of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]], were widely derided.

White's and Sheppard's contributions are almost entirely absent in the final mix, and Howard was replaced by an electronic drum machine. Epic Records hoped the album would advance the Clash's success in the United States, and planned an expensive video for lead single \"[[This Is England (song)|This Is England]]\"; by the album's release, the band members were so discouraged that they did not turn up for the first day's shoot. Strummer moved to Spain, in part due to family issues, but also to escape the backlash.\n\nThe album was poorly received upon release, and is still generally regarded as the band's worst album; Strummer performed only one song from the album live during his solo career, and the album has been excluded altogether from most of the Clash\u2019s compilations and box sets.

Rudolf, Simon Sullivan and Kevin Whyte, each of whom are credited on the sleeve.<ref name=\"p211\" />\n\nStrummer and Rhodes disagreed on the direction of the recordings almost from the outset. Rhodes, credited on the sleeve under the pseudonym \"Jose Unidos\",<ref name=\"NME\" /> had no previous experience with either songwriting or record production. While Strummer had been pleased with his demo versions, he fought against his manager over the album's production.<ref name=\"NME\" /> Rhodes's believed he had discovered a new genre, seeking to mix [[electro (music)|electro]], [[hip hop]] and [[cut-up technique]].<ref name=\"GaCTC\" /> He replaced live musicians with synthetic sounds and layered the tracks with audio from TV programs.<ref name=\"vul\" />\n\nHoward was given vague instructions, such as to play like he was throwing the drum kit down some stairs.<ref name=\"grdrum\">Garcia (2012), Drum Machine, 2276</ref> White recalled working with Strummer for extended period on guitar parts, which Rhodes would later refuse to include; he remembered that Strummer had at times stood up to the producer, but \"not nearly enough\".

White believed Rhodes used such tactics to wear him down, and he was eventually dismissed from the studio by his manager.<ref name=\"A9\" />\n\n[[File:PaulSimonon1980.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Paul Simonon]] at the Tower Theater in 1980.

Rhodes would begin recording sessions by asking the drummer to play what he wanted, but would inevitably respond to Howard's parts by saying \"no, not that\", or \"no, not that either\".<ref name=\"grdrum\" /> In one incident, Rhodes appeared in the recording room and began to \"smash the drum kit up\", at which point Howard stood up and left.<ref name=\"A9\" /> Fayne shared White's view that these incidents were a ploy by Rhodes to force the new recruits out of the band. He said, \"Bernie didn't want any connection with the past{{nbsp}}...

They were in part inspired by the communal [[sing-along]]s the Clash performed during their busking tour the previous year, and thus evoked memories of a less tense period in their career. The massed vocals were provided by several dozen of their friends and families, and several of the inner team remembered those sessions as the only enjoyable period during the album's recording.<ref name=\"A9\" /> The only other aspect that the musicians agreed on was the quality and commercial potential of \"This is England\", a song into which Rhodes allowed the musicians significant creative input.<ref name=\"A9\" />\n\nRhodes suddenly ended the recordings and took the [[Audio mastering|master tapes]] from the studio, after which he added further synthesizer parts.<ref name=\"Louder\" /><ref name=\"A9\" /> Although Jones's use of synthesizers and samplers was one of the main reasons behind his dismissal, those instruments brought him critical and public acclaim with his next band [[Big Audio Dynamite]].<ref name=\"br\" /> When asked at the time for his opinion on [[This Is Big Audio Dynamite|the debut B.A.D. album]], Strummer described it as one of the \"worst pieces of shit I have ever heard.\"<ref name=\"A9\" /> In 1986, Strummer said that he had liked a few of the tunes but \"really I hated it{{nbsp}}...

'the spokesman for your generation and you fucked it up', I say yeah, but we tried.\"<ref>D'Ambrosio (2012)</ref> He admitted that he had undertaken the project in part to prove that Jones hadn't been the Clash's only songwriter.<ref name=\"j332\">Jucha (2016), p. 332</ref> White believes the album's commercial failure was caused by a combination of Strummer's hubris and Rhodes's ambitions, both of which led to apathy and discontent with the band.<ref name=\"j334\" /> The Clash's standing did not fully recover until Strummer's work with [[the Pogues]] on the ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' soundtrack in 1987.<ref name=\"e199\">Egan (2014), p. 199</ref>\n\nEpic Records intended a tour shortly after the release, but there were practical issues that made this impossible. Foremost, Strummer was in exile in Spain and refusing to partake in promoting the record; he had even threatened to take legal action to prevent its release.<ref name=\"NME\" /><ref>Egan (2014), p. 116</ref> After their treatment during the album's recording, White and Howard were bitter, demotivated and reluctant to engage with the material. Finally, given that Rhodes had so heavily revised the original songs and utilised so many samples and studio effects, he and Strummer disagreed on how the tracks should be played live.<ref name=\"A9\" /> Epic had planned a highly produced and expensive [[music video|video]] for \"This is England\", with a view for a still more expensive version to promote its US release. The idea was shelved when neither Strummer nor Simonon turned up for the shooting.<ref name=\"A10\" />\n\nStrummer dissolved the band that October, giving each of the remaining members a thousand pounds each as [[Severance package|severance payments]]. Howard told him, somewhat bitterly, that \"this is where it got you\" for following Bernie's lead\u2014a statement to which he agreed.<ref name=\"Louder\" /> White suggested that he either publish an open letter of retraction in the weekly music press and [[tabloid journalism|tabloids]],{{refn|Howard said that Strummer took his advice and wrote up a press release titled \"Crap Cutting Commencing\", detailing in wartime language how the band had been hoodwinked by a political dictator, i.e., Rhodes.

Now, how to take that idea to the next level!\"{{refn|[[Vic Godard]] believes that Rhodes was by then trying to take over the Clash's brand name, and would \"have a version out there now touring\" many years after Strummer left, if he could have legally managed it.<ref name=\"GSA\" />|group=n}} They briefly considered the possibility, Rhodes suggesting Simonon, a position the bassist resolutely refused<ref name=\"GSA\">Garcia (2012), Singer Auditions, 2491</ref> until Strummer officially disbanded the group.<ref name=\"A10\" /> Having disowned the album, \"Three Card Trick\" was the only track Strummer played live during his solo career.<ref name=\"j332\" />\n\n''Cut the Crap'' was remastered and re-released in Europe in the mid-2000s, with the bonus track \"Do It Now\". The reissue was unannounced and not promoted. It came after the rest of the band's catalogue had been reissued between December 1999 and January 2000 in the US. The album was not mentioned in the Clash documentary ''[[The Clash: Westway to the World]]'' (2000) and was acknowledged only briefly in the official illustrated biography ''The Clash'' (2008), not receiving an overview as the first five albums had. The album has been omitted from many Clash compilations, box sets and reissues, including ''[[The Story of the Clash, Volume 1|The Story of the Clash]]'' (1988), ''[[Clash on Broadway]]'' (1991), ''[[The Singles (1991 The Clash album)|The Singles]]'' (1991), ''[[Sound System (album)|Sound System]]'' (2013) and ''[[5 Album Studio Set]]'' (2013).{{refn|\"This Is England\" was included in ''[[The Essential Clash]]'' (2003) and [[The Singles (2007 The Clash album)|the 2007 box set reissue of ''The Singles'']]''.|group=n}}<ref name=\"Kott\">Kott, Crispin. \"[https://www.popmatters.com/120558-i-found-a-reason-the-velvet-undergrounds-lost-chapter-2496163399.html The Velvet Underground's Lost Chapter]\".

The three characters have since fallen into the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 2008, the online [[superhero fiction]] site [[Metahuman Press]] debuted the series ''[[Living Legends (fiction)|Living Legends]]'' which featured the first Black Owl as part of its cast. The second Black Owl appeared briefly in ''[[Fantastic Comics]]'' #24, the first issue of the [[Next Issue Project]]. In issue #6 of ''[[Project Superpowers]]'', the Black Owl and Yank & Doodle were included in a two-page layout of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] character sketches; In the one-shot ''Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude'', it was stated that the three of them would appear in the second volume of this comic title, and that the Black Owl (which one is not yet known) would be transformed into a living [[black hole]].\n\n==Fictional biography==\n\n===Doug Danville===\nIn 1940, Doug Danville, being a bored and wealthy playboy, decided to add meaning to his seemingly pointless life by fighting the criminal element hand to hand. Originally calling himself \u201cK the Unknown,\u201d he quickly changed his identity to that of the Black Owl. His original outfit was a [[tuxedo]] and an [[owl]] mask, but he soon switched to a blue and red costume.\n\nAt one point during his career, the Black Owl fought alongside The [[Green Lama]], [[Yank & Doodle]], and several other heroes to defeat [[Frankenstein's monster]].\n\nFinally, after more than three years of crimefighting, Danville decided to do something even more meaningful with his life; he joined the [[United States Army|army]] and fought in [[World War II]]. Before leaving, he passed on the costume and identity of the Black Owl to Walt Walters. Whatever became of Danville after the war is not yet known.\n\n===Walt Walters===\nWalt Walters was already indirectly connected to superheroing; his twin sons, Rick and Dick, were the costumed heroes Yank & Doodle. After Walt took up the mantle of the Black Owl in 1943, he and his sons worked as a team, with Rick and Dick essentially being his sidekicks.\n\nIn 1947, Walt suffered a bullet wound and found himself reconsidering being an active superhero; from that point on, he simply served as an adviser to Yank & Doodle.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/blackowl.htm The Black Owl] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

The first issue featured \u201cK the Unknown,\u201d whose name was changed to the Black Owl in issue #2 (April 1940).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |title=The Black Owl |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/blackowl.htm |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn issues #7-9, the Black Owl stories were written and drawn by legends-to-be [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mendryk |first1=Harry |title=Simon and Kirby's Black Owl |url=https://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/simonandkirby/archives/2468 |website=The Kirby Museum |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> This was Kirby's first superhero feature.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |pages=76-77 |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/76 |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn issue #24 (Oct. 1942), the Black Owl was part of a large, one-time crossover story called \"Utter Failure!!\" in which a group of heroes, including [[Yank & Doodle]], Doctor Frost and the [[Green Lama]], fought together against [[Frankenstein's monster]]. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Glut |first1=Donald F. |title=The Frankenstein Archive Essays on the Monster, the Myth, the Movies, and More |date=2015 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786480692 |page=171 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Frankenstein_Archive/RLeJCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=the%20black%20owl |chapter=Frankenstein in Four Colors |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn issue #34 (Sept. 1943), the identity of the Black Owl was passed on from Doug Danville to Walt Walters, a character who was already established as the father of [[Yank & Doodle]]; the two series were merged.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=262 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/American_Comic_Book_Chronicles_1940_1944/S12mDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22the%20Black%20Owl%22 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> In issue #64 (June 1947), the father was sidelined by means of a bullet, and the focus was almost entirely on Yank & Doodle.\n\nWith issue #69 (April 1948), ''Prize Comics'' became ''Prize Comics Western'', and everything that didn't fit the new [[Western (genre)|Western]] format \u2014 including Yank, Doodle, and the Black Owl \u2014 was discarded. The three characters have since fallen into the [[public domain]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 2008, the online [[superhero fiction]] site [[Metahuman Press]] debuted the series ''[[Living Legends (fiction)|Living Legends]]'' which featured the first Black Owl as part of its cast. The second Black Owl appeared briefly in ''[[Fantastic Comics]]'' #24, the first issue of the [[Next Issue Project]]. In issue #6 of ''[[Project Superpowers]]'', the Black Owl and Yank & Doodle were included in a two-page layout of [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] character sketches; In the one-shot ''Project Superpowers: Chapter Two Prelude'', it was stated that the three of them would appear in the second volume of this comic title, and that the Black Owl (which one is not yet known) would be transformed into a living [[black hole]].\n\n==Fictional biography==\n\n===Doug Danville===\nIn 1940, Doug Danville, being a bored and wealthy playboy, decided to add meaning to his seemingly pointless life by fighting the criminal element hand to hand. Originally calling himself \u201cK the Unknown,\u201d he quickly changed his identity to that of the Black Owl. His original outfit was a [[tuxedo]] and an [[owl]] mask, but he soon switched to a blue and red costume.\n\nAt one point during his career, the Black Owl fought alongside The [[Green Lama]], [[Yank & Doodle]], and several other heroes to defeat [[Frankenstein's monster]].\n\nFinally, after more than three years of crimefighting, Danville decided to do something even more meaningful with his life; he joined the [[United States Army|army]] and fought in [[World War II]]. Before leaving, he passed on the costume and identity of the Black Owl to Walt Walters. Whatever became of Danville after the war is not yet known.\n\n===Walt Walters===\nWalt Walters was already indirectly connected to superheroing; his twin sons, Rick and Dick, were the costumed heroes Yank & Doodle. After Walt took up the mantle of the Black Owl in 1943, he and his sons worked as a team, with Rick and Dick essentially being his sidekicks.\n\nIn 1947, Walt suffered a bullet wound and found himself reconsidering being an active superhero; from that point on, he simply served as an adviser to Yank & Doodle.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/blackowl.htm The Black Owl] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

Convinced of his abilities as an undercover agent, he is summoned by Lt. Col. Castro to assist in unmasking the head of a big and vicious syndicate.\n\nIn Manila, he is able to track down the warehouse where the syndicate drops off their illicit goods, but a firefight ensues. Razul survives and his anonymity still maintained, but is left wounded. Fortunately for Razul, two young boys (Christopher Paloma and Michael Roberts) found him and, along with their grandfather ([[Max Alvarado]]) and Razul's landlady (Vivian Foz), nurse him back to health.\n\nAfter ascertaining the identity of one of the syndicate's high-ranking official, Frankie ([[Paquito Diaz]]), he applies for work as a hired hand in the syndicate. However, before Razul could begin work, he was exposed as an undercover agent and the roles are suddenly reversed - Razul now becoming the hunted instead of the hunter. Lt. Col. Castro advices him to return to Mindanao, but the syndicate would rather have him dead as he has already caused considerable damage to be let go scot free. Failing to silence him, they turned their ire on the two kids that helped him. They kill the two boys.\n\nThe killing strikes a sensitive chord in Razul, the Muslim in him surfaces and vows revenge on all the remaining members of the gang. He picks apart the members of the gang one by one until all that is left is Frankie. With the barrel of the eponymous [[.357 Magnum|Magnum .357]] pointed at him, Frankie reveals the stronghold of the syndicate in  [[Sta. Cruz, Manila]]. While surveiling the area, Razul discovers that the syndicate's protector is a senior official in the Philippine Constabulary, Capt. Rios ([[Eddie Garcia]]), who has up to that point assumed the leadership of the syndicate after eliminating the syndicate's former head ([[Jaime Fabregas|Jimmy Fabregas]]). Another firefight ensues which ends in a showdown between Razul and Rios, with the former emerging the survivor.

His narrative fiction has received several distinguished awards. He received encouraging praise for his early novels, Los bogavantes (1970) and La boca del tigre (1971), for which he was awarded the Honour Sash of the SADE (Argentine Society of Writers) and third prize of the National Prize of Argentine Literature respectively. Worldwide acclaim came later for his \u201cTrilogy of the Discovery of America\u201d when he was recognised as one of the masters of  Latin America's \u201cNew Historical Novel\u201d. The first installment is Daimon (1978), a finalist of the R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Prize in 1982, which he was to win in 1987 for the sequel titled The dogs of paradise (1983). The last installment of the trilogy,  El largo atardecer del caminante (1992) was honoured with the Premio Internacional Extremadura-America \u201992 of the Spanish Commission for the Fifth Centenary of the Discovery of America. Posse has been the recipient of the Premio Internacional de Novela Diana-Novedades (Mexico) for El viajero de Agartha  (1989) and the Literature Prize of the Argentine Academy of Letters (2002) for El inquietante dia de la vida (2001). Abel Posse's novels have been translated into 16 languages.  In November 2012 he became an numbered member of the Argentine Academy of Letters.\n\nAbel Parentini Posse carried out uninterrupted diplomatic duties for the Argentine Foreign Service from 1966 until 2004. After his studies in Law at the University of Buenos Aires and political sciences at La Sorbonne in Paris, Posse returned to Buenos Aires where he worked as a lawyer for several years. He entered the Foreign Service through entrance exams in 1965. His initial postings were to the Argentine embassy in Moscow (1966\u20131969) and Lima (1969-1970); he was later Consul General in Venice (1973\u20131979) and then director of the Argentine Cultural Centre in Paris (1981\u20131985), and then posted to the embassy in Tel-Aviv (1985\u20131988). President Carlos Saul Menem conferred him the title of Ambassador in 1990, which he carried out in Czechoslovakia (1990\u20131992), the Czech Republic (1992\u20131996), Peru (1998\u20132000), Denmark (2000\u20132002), at UNESCO (2002) and Spain (2002\u20132004). In 1994 he was honoured with the Konex-Prize Merit Diploma.\n\nAbel Posse is a regular contributor to the liberal-conservative daily La Naci\u00f3n in Buenos Aires, as well as other Argentine dailies (Perfil, La Gaceta de Tucum\u00e1n) and Spanish papers (ABC, El Mundo and El Pa\u00eds). He has also been editor in chief of the Revista Argentina de Estudios Estrat\u00e9gicos (Argentine Journal of Strategic Studies). His journalistic publications include some 400 articles, many have been published in his collection of socio-political essays, such as, Argentina, el gran viraje (2000), El eclipse argentino. De la enfermedad colectiva al renacimiento (2003) and La santa locura de los Argentina (2006), Sobrevivir Argentina (2014) and  R\u00e9quiem por la pol\u00edtica (2015). His literary and more strictly philosophical reflections have been collected in En letra grande (2005). In many of these texts Posse celebrates the glorious past of Argentina where he expounds on his desire that in the 21st century his country may resume its destiny as a great nation in the continental and international sphere, and that it take a greater role in Mercosur and in wider projects of regional integration. As a Peronist, Posse has worked with Eduardo Duhalde in the consolidation of Mercosur.\n\nSince his retirement from the Argentine Foreign Service and his return to Argentina in 2004, Posse became an ardent critic of the policies of Nestor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, former President of Argentina, both in his opinion pieces in the press as well as in political activities. In 2007 he backed the presidential candidature of Eduardo Duhalde, while in the same year he was a candidate in the senate ticket of Roberto Lavagna for the City of Buenos Aires. Toward the end of 2009, he was named Minister of Education of the City of Buenos Aires by Mauricio Macri (newly elected President of the country), replacing Mariano Narodwski. His posting caused a scandal due to a controversial piece he published on 10 December in La Naci\u00f3n (1). In this article, not only did he judge the Kirchner policies as inefficient in relation to law and order issues, but Posse also accused the Kirchners of ideological closeness to the armed left-wing militants of the 1970s (an ideology he has rejected in many of his texts) and of only telling one side of the story of the last military dictatorship. This text ignited a wave of protests in broad sectors of the left, including union and student organizations, as well as in social media, and in various newspaper outlets such as P\u00e1gina 12, who insisted that part of his diplomatic career had been under the watch of the previous military dictatorship. Given the intensity of these protests, Posse resigned from this post 11 days after his appointment.\n\n==Childhood and youth==\n\nAbel Parentini Posse was born on 7 January 1934, in the Argentine city of C\u00f3rdoba where he only lived the first two years of his life.<ref>[Sobre sus recuerdos de este per\u00edodo, leer Antonio L\u00f3pez Ortega, \u00abConversaci\u00f3n con Abel Posse\u00bb, Imagen, Caracas, 10/1987, n.\u00ba 100, p.3-6.</ref> Two years after birth the family moved to the capital city of  Buenos Aires due to his father's work commitments. His mother, Elba Alicia Posse, belonged to the creole landed oligarchy of Galician descent who held vast sugar mill estates in the North West province of Tucuman. Amongst the influential members of the Posse clan in the 19th  century, the liberal Julio Argentino Roca stands out, twice president of the republic from 1880 to 1886 and also 1898 to 1904 (3). Posse fictionalized 19th century Tucuman in his novel El inquietante d\u00eda de la vida (2001), where two distant family relatives are the protagonists; his maternal great-grandfather, Felipe Segundo Posse, and Julio Victor Posse, patron of the arts in the sugar producing province until the 1940s.\n\nThe novelist's father, Ernesto Parentini, a porte\u00f1o of Italian parents, was one of the founders of Artistas Argentinos Asociados and was the producer of the legendary feature film La guerra gaucha (1942), based on the text by the poet Leopoldo Lugones. The young Abel Posse grew up in the Argentine capital near Rivadavia street, and given his father's profession was exposed to the artistic and cultural milieu this most sophisticated of the South American capitals had to offer. The \u201cQueen of the River Plate\u201d, as Buenos Aires came to be known, fascinated the young man, (4) and his memories are evoked in his novel Los demonios ocultos (1987).\nHe was able to mingle with the glamorous stars of Argentine show business, like Chas de Cruz, Pierina Dealessi, Ulises Petit de Murat, Mu\u00f1oz Azpiri, the writer of radioplays which were performed by Eva Duarte (de Per\u00f3n), as well as the tango composers An\u00edbal Troilo and Homero Manzi. Such were the family connections to show business that one of his aunts, Esmeralda Leiva de Heredia, better known as \u201cLa Jard\u00edn\u201d, was an actress friend of Eva Duarte. (5) Growing up in this environment enabled him to obtain an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of the tango repertoire and its culture, (6) which imbues his novel La reina del Plata (1988).\n\nThe imagination of the young Posse was awakened and nurtured by the father's personal library. (7) When he was eight he wrote and illustrated little books he would sell to his grandmother, who lived in the same apartment complex. (8) He undertook his primary education at the Colegio La Salle (9) and his secondary education between 1946 and 1952 at the prestigious Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. (10) During these formative years in his intellectual development he began close friendships with people who would usher him into Buenos Aires literary circles, such as Rogelio Baz\u00e1n, the translator of Georg Trakl. Posse would later dedicate a poetic tribute to the German bard.\n\nAmongst his teachers, the orientalist philosopher Vicente Fatone stands out as an  influential figure,  awakening in Posse an interest in esoteric philosophy which is evident in several of his novels, especially in Los demonios ocultos  and  El viajero de Agartha. In 1943, at age 13, Posse launched himself into his first literary project (never completed), a novel set in imperial Rome. (11)\n\n== The fiesta of the \u201cQueen of the River Plate\u201d == \nPosse studied at the Law Faculty in Buenos Aires until 1958. Apart from his studies \u201clectured by fascist-Peronist professors\u201d (12) who bored him, he lived the \u201cnight life\u201d fiesta of Buenos Aires, a city which in those days was home to the most important publishing houses in the Spanish speaking world and also to exiled writers and intellectuals of the Spanish Civil War. According to Posse, his night time meetings and conversations in Buenos Aires caf\u00e9s allowed him to deepen his knowledge of Russian and French literature, German philosophy and oriental spiritualism. In this rich bohemian environment he met [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Eduardo Mallea]], [[Ezequiel Mart\u00ednez Estrada]], [[Ricardo Molinari]], [[Manuel Mujica Lainez]], [[Ram\u00f3n Gomez de la Serna]] and [[Rafael Alberti]] (13). He became close friends with the poets [[Conrado Nal\u00e9 Roxlo]] and [[Carlos Mastronardi]], as well as Borges, who opened the doors for him of the SADE and who would later help him to publish his first short stories and poems in the daily El Mundo. \nIn those years Posse became attracted to [[Peronist]] ideas. Although he had been born into an anti-Peronist family, the huge public demonstration of 17 October 1945 had left a lasting impression (14), as had the strength of Evita and her ability to bring life into the movement, together with the open public grieving aroused by her funeral in 1952. These years of university life and above all of the night life in Buenos Aires are depicted by Posse as a true \u201cgolden age\u201d which he recreates in certain passages of La reina del Plata (1988) and La pasi\u00f3n segun Eva (1994), a fictional biography which conveys the last days of Eva Per\u00f3n. After having undertaken his military service in 1955, during the anti-Peronist Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora, Posse completed his university studies in 1958. That same year, he wrote a screenplay, \u201cLa cumparsa\u201d (The troupe), which was given an award by the National Institute of Cinematography; set in Patagonia, the troupe is composed of a group of sheep shearers who turn out to be a veritable court of miracles. (15)\n\n==Voyage to Europe==\nAfter graduating, Posse decided to travel to Europe. Thanks to a university scholarship, he undertook doctoral studies in Political Sciences at La Sorbonne in Paris. A few months prior to his travels, he published his first poem, \u201cInvocaci\u00f3n al fantasma de mi infancia muerta\u201d, in the literary supplement of El Mundo (16). While in Europe, he crossed the Alps on motorbike in order to visit his sister in Italy. \nIn this period he deepened his knowledge of the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin, Rilke and Trakl (17). During his stay in Paris he listened to Sartre, he had as professors eminent French political scientists of the time (Duverger, Hauriou, Rivarol) and also met Pablo Neruda (18). During his stay in the \u201cCity of Light\u201d he fell in love with a German student, Wienke Sabine Langenheim, his future wife, who would play an important role in his literary formation, guiding  his readings of German literature and philosophy which infuse his works. In 1961 he spent two semesters in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, the home of H\u00f6lderlin. That same year, his poem, \u201cEn la tumba de Georg Trakl\u201d, the first ever text signed as Abel Posse, was awarded the Rene Bastianini prize of the SADE in Buenos Aires. During his stay in T\u00fcbingen he read H\u00f6lderlin, Nietzsche and Heidegger (19). It was also here that he began writing his first novel, Los bogavantes, which he would finish in 1967.\n\n==From Buenos Aires to the Foreign Service==\nPosse returned to Buenos Aires in 1962. After a competitive selection process, he taught as an assistant in constitutional law under professor Carlos Fayt at the University of Buenos Aires. With little enthusiasm he also began to work as a lawyer. Sabine travelled to Argentina and a while later they were married. In 1965 he was admitted to the Argentine Foreign Service after a public selection process (20).Until 2004 he would live most of his life abroad, as such most of his works were written outside of Argentina, although he has always defended his Argentine identity, his literary production has been well served by Ricardo G\u00fciraldes\u2019 adage, \u201cdistance reveals\u201d (21).\n\n==Moscow (1966\u20131969)==\nAbel Posse's only son, Ivan, was born in Moscow in January 1967. At this time in the Russian capital he also finished writing his first novel, Los bogavantes, set in Paris and Seville, centered on a trio of characters, two of whom are students and one a Foreign Service employee, embodying the ideological tensions of the early 1960s. This neo-realist novel played an important part in his literary career. Under the pseudonym of Arnaut Daniel, Posse submitted it to the 1968 Planeta Prize. It featured amongst the four finalists, and although it had been virtually declared the winner by the judges Jos\u00e9 Manuel de Lara and Baltasar Porcel, under Francoist pressure the judges had to overturn their decision, due to some charged erotic scenes, but above all because of its critical and ironical references to the regime's military. Once it had been published in 1970 by  Editorial Br\u00fajula in Argentina, thanks to the support of Ernesto Sabato and Posse's father, and after it received the Sash of Honour of the SADE, Los bogavantes was later published in Barcelona in 1975 where it was the object of Francoist censorship. All 5000 copies were purged of two pages which ridiculed the masculinity of army officers. This singular publishing episode (22) brought him under the attention of those who were the leading literary publishers of the time, Carlos Barral and Carmen Balcells; the latter would become his literary agent.\n\n==Lima (1969\u20131971)==\nAbel Posse was posted to Peru in 1969 and appointed cultural secretary of the embassy in Lima. For him Peru represented the discovery of Inca culture, the \u201crevelation of the Americas\u201d (23) which compelled him to identify himself with his creole roots of North-Western Argentina (24). A visit to [[Machu Picchu]] inspired a long poem of 240 verses, Celebraci\u00f3n de Machu Picchu, which he wrote in Cuzco in 1970 and published much later in Venice in 1977. Also in 1970 he wrote his most ambitious poetical piece, Celebraci\u00f3n del desamparo, which was amongst the finalists of the Maldoror Poetry Prize although Posse decided against publishing it. In those years he read Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas and the great Cuban stylists: Alejo Carpentier, Lezama Lima and Severo Sarduy. He also researched the life of Argentina's national independence hero, General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, and in 1971 was admitted to the Instituto Sanmartiniano de Lima. In Peru he also wrote his second novel, La boca del tigre (1971), inspired by his personal experiences in the Soviet Union. This novel, clearly influenced by Ernesto Sabato's neo-realist style of fiction, helped the author to articulate his distrust of the overbearing ideologies of the time, in order to criticize the exercise of power in the contemporary world and to reflect on the place of the individual in that historical juncture. This thematic concern foreshadowed the ideas about history in his later novel Daimon. La boca del tigre, which received the third National Prize of Argentine Literature, hints at his initial musings on the notion of Amerincaness (americanidad). (25) The influence that the Argentine philosopher and anthropologist [[Rodolfo G\u00fcnther Kusch]] would have on Posse's fiction and indeed his own worldview after his encounter with him and his readings of La seducci\u00f3n de la babarie (1953) and Am\u00e9rica profunda (1962). Consequently, Kusch's thought on the fundamental ontological and cultural antagonism between the West's homo faber with the americano \u201cman of being\u201d and the symbiotic relationship of Amerindians with the Cosmos (\u201cthe Open\u201d) was to become a leitmotif in Posse's work, and particularly in his \u201cTrilogy of the Discovery of America\u201d.\n\n==Venice (1973\u20131979)==\nPosse was named Consul General for [[Venice]] in 1973, where he lived for 6 years. It was here that he wrote Daimon (1978), between October 1973 and August 1977, the novel which began the \u201cTrilogy of the Discovery of America\u201d. This novel has as its protagonist a fictional avatar of the Spanish conquistador Lope de Aguirre (1510\u20131561). In this text, the conqueror, known for his cruelty which is depicted by chroniclers as the archetypal madman and traitor, raises from his ashes eleven years after his death together with the ghosts of his Mara\u00f1ones. Thus begins the \u201cJornada de Am\u00e9rica\u201d, through four centuries of painful Latin American history, on which he casts a disillusioned gaze, by seeing it as an \u201cEternal-Return-of-the-Same\u201d; that is the eternal annihilation of man's liberty against which Lope de Aguirre's rebelliousness is powerless to arrest. This fruitless trans-historical rebellion drives him to an ambiguous death in the mid-1970s in Latin America, a condition which bears a resemblance to the death of Ernesto Che Guevara's revolutionary venture in Bolivia. Several scenes of torture suffered by the protagonist clearly resemble the atrocities committed by the Argentine military during the country's last military dictatorship. (26) This novel constitutes a milestone in Posse's poetics, as it is enthused with Rabelaisian  elements in a baroque style, by continually resorting to the use of humour and ambiguity, to parody, intertextuality, anachronism, the grotesque, and a continuous paratextual dialogue with the reader, characteristics which would reach their highest intensity in the subsequent novel, The dogs of paradise (1983). Daimon was shortlisted for the prestigious Romulo Gallegos Prize in 1982.\n\nThe Venetian sojourn was where he received the recognition of his peers; he was visited by friends such as Ernesto Sabato, Carlos Barral, Manuel Scorza, Victor Massuh, Antonio Requeni, Manuel Mujica Lainez, Jorge Luis Borges, Antonio Di Benedetto and Juan Rulfo. (27) He also met in Venice, Alejo Carpentier, who was writing his Concierto barroco (1974), as well as Italo Calvino, Alberto Moravia and Giorgio Bassani. During his years in Venice, Posse reflected on the Heideggerian concept of \u201cthe Open\u201d (Das Offene) and Kusch's ideas concerning \u2018being\u2019. (29) In 1973 he visited the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (30), and in 1979 together with his wife Sabine  published a Spanish translation of Der feldweg. (31) After a brief trip to Buenos Aires in 1975, and on his return to Venice, he wrote between April and June the same year a dark novel reflecting the murderous political violence being played out in Argentina at the time, titled Momento de morir, but which he did not publish until 1979. Its protagonist, Medardo Rabagliatti, a rather mediocre and irresolute suburban solicitor, is witness to the unfolding armed violence perpetrated by groups of youngsters depicted as fanatics and a sadistic military. Against all odds, the story's denouement sees the vacillating Medardo kill the murderous military leader responsible for the repression, and later oversees the re-establishment of democratic political institutions in the country. The historical reading proposed by the author (various characters are clearly fictional avatars of Mario Firmenich and Hector J. Campora) condemns without a doubt the ERP (Ejercito Revolucionario del Pueblo), the Monotoneros and the military repression, thus underlining the \u201cthesis of two evils\u201d; a thesis the author holds in the prologue he added to the 1997 edition. (32)\n\n'''Paris (1981\u20131985)'''\nIn 1981 Posse was appointed director of the Argentine Cultural Centre in Paris. It was there where he wrote The dogs of paradise (1983), second part of his \u201cTrilogy\u201d, with Christopher Columbus as its protagonist, and for which he was awarded the 1987 R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Prize. This novel, translated into many languages, confirmed Posse, according to many literary scholars, as one of the leading exponents of Latin American's \u201cNew Historical Novel\u201d. As in Daimon, the novel questions the validity of the official historiography of the conquest of the Americas, undermines the laws governing space and time, and anachronism is systematic, as is intertextuality, the pastiche, parody, while the work harbours, like Daimon, a profound reflection on the Latin American condition and its identity.  The dogs of paradise explores the motivations of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] and Columbus, as well as the aftermath of the clash of cultures triggers by the arrival of the Spaniards through the dialogical testimony of  the defeated.  \nBetween 1982 and 1985 Posse edited a bilingual collection (Spanish and French) of 15 Argentine poets titled Nadir, which included: Leopoldo Lugones, Enrique Molina, H\u00e9ctor Antonio Murena, Juan L. Ortiza, Ricardo Molinari, Conrado Nal\u00e9 Roxlo, Baldomero Fernandez Moreno, Alejandra Pizarnik, Oliverio Girondo, Manuel J. Castilla, Alberto Girri, Raul G. Aguirre, Juan Rodolfo Wilcock, Ezequiel Mart\u00ednez Estrada and Leopoldo Marechal. This project was carried out with the assistance of Argentine and French poets, academics and translators. The volumes were gifted and distributed to French libraries and universities, with the aim of increasing the interest of these works internationally. The project was no doubt inspired by Roger Caillois who, with his collection La Croix du Sud, made a major contribution to the international recognition of Jorge Luis Borges\u2019 work. (34)\nIn January 1983 at age 15, Ivan, Posse's only son committed suicide at the family's apartment in Paris, a tragedy which the author would chronicle many years later in Cuando muere el hijo  (2009), an autobiographical account presented as a \u201creal chronicle\u201d. \nWhen The dogs of paradise appeared in bookshops he announced the forthcoming publication of the third sequel of the \u201cTrilogy\u201d, titled Sobre las misiones jesu\u00edticas, to be set in the Jesuit missions of Paraguay. (35)  While its appearance was announced in 1986, with a different title, Los heraldos negros, it is as yet unpublished. (36) \nIn November 1983, alongside the Paris Autumn Festival, Posse organised  with Claudio Segovia a tango festival called Tango argentin, where Roberto Goyeneche participated and which was destined, as it were in his own words: \u201cto bring to life the real tango, the primitive tango of the origins\u201d as against the \u201ctango for export\u201d of Astor Piazzola. (37)\n\n '''Israel (1985\u20131988)'''\nAfter the death of his son, Posse could no longer live in Paris and he was appointed Plenipotentiary Minister at the Argentine embassy in Tel-Aviv. He returned to writing there, and wrote three novels, quite different to his previous ones. He wrote two novels on Nazism,  Los demonios ocultos (1987) and El viajero de Agartha (1989). Los demonios ocultos was a literary project Posse had begun much earlier in 1971, after having met several Nazis in Buenos Aires during his university days. The protagonist of the novels, cast in a neorealist style, is a young Argentine, Alberto Lorca, who goes in search of his father, Walther Werner, a German scientist specialized in Oriental esoterism, who was sent by the Third Reich on a mission to Central Asia. The plot takes place in two temporal spaces, the Second World War and the Argentina of the last military dictatorship.  El viajero de Agartha (1989, Premio Internacional Diana-Novedades,  Mexico) is a true adventure espionage novel. Walter Werner as protagonist narrates the story in a diary recovered by his son, which recounts his mission in Tibet in his search for the mythical city of Agartha. The third novel, La reina del Plata  (1988),  as the title indicates is a homage to the Argentine capital and the period of splendour it once knew. The novel takes place in a futuristic Buenos Aires, whose society is polarized between \u201cInsiders\u201d and \u201cOutsiders\u201d, where the \u201cOutsider\u201d Guillermo Aguirre ruminates on his own identity. The plot is narrated in fragments comprises ninety short chapters, while the action takes place in the typically Buenos Aires atmosphere of cafes and streets inhabited by the tango, the deep musical expression of the port city, where its characters muse about the past and present of the country.\n\n'''Prague (1990\u20131996)'''\nIn 1990 Posse is promoted to Ambassador by President Carlos S. Menem and is posted to Prague for six years. His stay in the Czech capital is quite productive. Here he composes his literary essay Biblioteca essential which he publishes in 1991, where he proposes the most important 101 works of universal literature and his own cannon of the literature of the River Plate. Posse also wrote in the Czech capital El largo atardecer del caminante, the novel which closes the \u201cTrilogy of the Discovery of America\u201d, and which was crowned with the Premio Internacional Extremadura-America V Centenario 1992, where 180 novels had entered. In this work, the baroque style of Daimon and The dogs of paradise give way to a more sombre and reflective style. The protagonist in this work is the conqueror Alvar Nu\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca (1490\u20131558), who lives the last years of his life in a humble abode in Seville, where he reminisces about his \u2018true\u2019 American adventure  through an autobiographical and sincere retelling of his exploits by filling in the blanks and the silences left by his chronicles titled Castaways and Commentaries. Posse's Cabeza de Vaca assumes his americanidad, his hybrid identity, by announcing his maxim, \u201conly faith can cure, only kindness heals\u201d as a way the conquest should have taken place. This introspective and autobiographical style is continued in his next work, La pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan Eva (1994). This is a biographical novel (fictionalised biography) with a polyphonic text which sees an ailing Eva Per\u00f3n living her last nine months of her life while casting a retrospective gaze over her life. At the same time, Posse collects and recovers the testimony of people who knew her, illustrating and readjusting Eva's own account. Although the text has a clear empathy with its subject, the novel's stated aim is to provide a deeper understanding of this powerful woman than given by previous biographies, taking her life out of the ideological straitjacket and transforming it into a destined life.\n\n'''Lima (1998\u20132000)'''\nDuring his posting as ambassador to Lima, Peru, Posse wrote another biographical novel, Los cuadernos de Praga (1998), which also has as its protagonist another memorable 20th century Argentine, Ernesto \u2018Che\u201d Guevara Lynch. As with several of his earlier novels, the author was inspired by personal experience; Posse was informed during his stay in Prague that Che Guevara lived undercover in the city for almost a year after his defeat in the Congo. Like in La pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan Eva, the motive of the personal diary is the trigger for the autobiographical account, an account which converses with the research the author has carried out. Similarly to the previous novel, the objective of the author is not to simply recount the life of the historical person, but based on \u201csolid foundations\u201d, rescue his destiny in order to give account of his life beyond the ideological.  (38) \nOn his return to Latin America after his European postings Posse increased his journalistic opinion pieces in El Excelsior (Mexico), El Nacional  (Caracas), ABC  and El Mundo (Madrid), Linea and La Naci\u00f3n (Buenos Aires). Posse arrived in Peru when there was still a tense relationship with Ecuador over the war of El Condor, and in the aftermath of the kidnapping of hostages at the Japanese embassy by the MRTA (1997). Posse spoke highly of the Alberto Fujimori's war against the MRTA at the same time he expressed his opposition to the trials by Baltasar Garz\u00f3n against Augusto Pinochet and the International Human Rights Court, measures which he attributed to meddling into the internal affairs of Latin American countries. His opinion pieces also underscored the role Argentina could play in the consolidation of MERCOSUR and highlighted the natural resources of the country for the benefit of the next millennium, by appealing to the patriotism of its citizens and calling on them to imitate the example of Julio Argentino Roca, Hip\u00f6lito Yrigoyen and Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n. Many of these articles were brought together in the first collection of political essays he published in Argentina, el gran viraje (200). His return to Peru renewed his interest in the national hero, Jose de San Martin, which inspired the short story \u201cPaz en guerra\u201d (2000).\n\n'''Copenhagen (2001\u20132002)'''\nIn 2001 Posse published El inquietante d\u00eda de la vida, which received the Literary Prize of the Argentine Academy of Letters for the period 1998-2001. The protagonist is Felipe Segundo Posse, based on a real life ancestor of his who was heir to a vast estate of sugar mills in Tucuman province in the late 19th century. The story begins when he is diagnosed with tuberculosis and decides to abandon his family by travelling to Buenos Aires and then on to Egypt in search of the poet Rimbaud. The novel also fictionalizes historical characters like Domingo F. Sarmiento, Julio A. Roca and Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda while celebrating Argentina's development at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.\n\n'''Madrid (2002\u20132004)'''\nAfter a brief posting at UNESCO in Paris, Posse was appointed by President Duhalde Argentine ambassador to Spain. This was a hugely important posting, particularly due to the aftermath of the 2001 Argentine financial collapse, as this country was the main destination of Argentine migrants of Spanish descent. At the time Posse witnessed the deadly terrorist attacks in the Spanish capital on 11 March 2004. Deeply concerned by the crisis facing Argentina, Posse increased his opinion pieces in La Naci\u00f3n, defending regional integration, national sovereignty, and appealing to national reconstruction by evoking the memory of national figures such as Sarmiento and Evita. In 2003 he published another collection of political articles, El eclipse argentino. De la enfermedad colectiva al renacimiento, a work which attempts to outlay a blueprint for a national project. Once N\u00e9stor Kirchner assumed power, several media outlets pronounced Posse as the preferred candidate as foreign affairs minister, given his diplomatic experience, his age and his key posting in Spain. The journalist and former Montonero militant Miguel Bonasso published an opinion piece and participated in a TV program where he appealed to the president to put aside Posse's candidature, whom he accused of  having a benevolent attitude toward the previous military dictatorship for not having abandoned his diplomatic duties, and for his support of the Fujimori regime. (39) The president appointed Rafael Bielsa as foreign affairs minister, while Posse continued his appointment at the embassy in Madrid until his retirement in 2004 when he returned to Argentina.\n\n'''Buenos Aires (since 2004)'''\nAfter his retirement, Posse's commitment to the anti-Kirchner opposition increased. In very critical and controversial newspaper columns he linked the president and his supporters to extreme left wing militant movements of the 1970s, and he also opposed the restart of trials against the military, and the government's policy of collective memory which he labelled as incomplete. He increased his round of conferences on the state of the nation, and he supported the presidential candidacy of Eduardo Duhalde in 2007, when he was also senate candidate for the City of Buenos Aires in Roberto Lavagna's ticket. In 2005 his published En letra grande, a collection of literary essays and reflections on intellectuals close to him and who he considers as influential. He also published in 2006 a series of political essays under the title, La santa locura de los argentinos, which was a best-seller, where he attempts to map the Argentine question by focusing his analysis from colonial times to the last century in order to make a call for a citizen lead national consensus. In October 2009 he published Cuando muere el hijo, a testimonial novel where the narrators A and S experience the suicide of Ivan, and they try to come to terms with their son's decision. Later they undertake a journey of internal and external initiation when they travel from Paris to Tel-Aviv, and make a stop-over in Miletus, the city of the pre-Socratic philosopher Anaximander of Miletus. \nToward the end of 2009 Posse accepted the appointment of Minister of Education of the City of Buenos Aires offered by Mauricio Macri, which had been left vacant by Mariano Narodowski. Posse took office a day after having published a controversial article in the daily La Naci\u00f3n, titled \u201cCriminality and cowardice\u201d, where he declared that rock music dumbed down the young, and he judged as ineffective  law and order measures of the President, while demanding stronger measures against criminals. He also rejected the reopening of trials against members of the military regime, and reiterated his accusations against Kirchner for his ideological proximity to the 1970s militant left-wing movements. (40) His appointment and this opinion piece triggered a wave of protests by unions and students, from the rock-music scene and web based social networks, to sections of the media, such as P\u00e1gina 12, who accused Posse of having had close ties with previous dictatorship and of asserting that most of his diplomatic career had taken place during the last military junta, which had been first aired by Miguel Bonasso in his 2003 column referred to earlier. In fact, one of the most notorious henchmen of the military who coincidentally was on trial during those days, Benjamin Menendez, paraphrased a few sentences from Posse's article which was taken up by the media tarnishing Posse's image even further. Given such circumstances, Posse resigned 11 days into his new posting.\nIn 2011 he published Noche de lobos, based on the written account of a Montonero female leader who had been held captive and tortured at the ESMA (Navy School of Mechanics) and who had fallen in love with her torturer. This work delves into the conflicts between the urban guerrillas and the military, and both are portrayed as the protagonists of murderous acts of savagery. It recounts the acts of torture suffered by this woman in this clandestine detention centre, and how she falls prey to the so-called \u201cStockholm syndrome\u201d, where tortured and torturer fall in love with each other. This novel also has an autobiographical focus, as it reveals how this female guerrilla fighter while she was a captive at the hands of the military had given her typed account to Posse of her story in the early 1980s while he was in the Argentine embassy in Paris. (42)\nSince his resignation as Minister of Education of Buenos Aires, Abel Posse continues to live in this city, where he gives conferences, especially on Sarmiento's education legacy, and where he publishes frequently in Perfil and La Naci\u00f3n. He remains critical of the Kirchner policies and concerned about the future of the country. Since November 2012, Abel Posse is an elected numbered member of the Argentine Academy of Letters (43), having taken the place of the late Rafael Obligado.

His narrative fiction has received several distinguished awards. He received encouraging praise for his early novels, Los bogavantes (1970) and La boca del tigre (1971), for which he was awarded the Honour Sash of the SADE (Argentine Society of Writers) and third prize of the National Prize of Argentine Literature respectively. Worldwide acclaim came later for his \u201cTrilogy of the Discovery of America\u201d when he was recognised as one of the masters of  Latin America's \u201cNew Historical Novel\u201d. The first installment is Daimon (1978), a finalist of the R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Prize in 1982, which he was to win in 1987 for the sequel titled The dogs of paradise (1983). The last installment of the trilogy,  El largo atardecer del caminante (1992) was honoured with the Premio Internacional Extremadura-America \u201992 of the Spanish Commission for the Fifth Centenary of the Discovery of America. Posse has been the recipient of the Premio Internacional de Novela Diana-Novedades (Mexico) for El viajero de Agartha  (1989) and the Literature Prize of the Argentine Academy of Letters (2002) for El inquietante dia de la vida (2001). Abel Posse's novels have been translated into 16 languages.  In November 2012 he became an numbered member of the Argentine Academy of Letters.\n\nAbel Parentini Posse carried out uninterrupted diplomatic duties for the Argentine Foreign Service from 1966 until 2004. After his studies in Law at the University of Buenos Aires and political sciences at La Sorbonne in Paris, Posse returned to Buenos Aires where he worked as a lawyer for several years. He entered the Foreign Service through entrance exams in 1965. His initial postings were to the Argentine embassy in Moscow (1966\u20131969) and Lima (1969-1970); he was later Consul General in Venice (1973\u20131979) and then director of the Argentine Cultural Centre in Paris (1981\u20131985), and then posted to the embassy in Tel-Aviv (1985\u20131988). President Carlos Saul Menem conferred him the title of Ambassador in 1990, which he carried out in Czechoslovakia (1990\u20131992), the Czech Republic (1992\u20131996), Peru (1998\u20132000), Denmark (2000\u20132002), at UNESCO (2002) and Spain (2002\u20132004). In 1994 he was honoured with the Konex-Prize Merit Diploma.\n\nAbel Posse is a regular contributor to the liberal-conservative daily La Naci\u00f3n in Buenos Aires, as well as other Argentine dailies (Perfil, La Gaceta de Tucum\u00e1n) and Spanish papers (ABC, El Mundo and El Pa\u00eds). He has also been editor in chief of the Revista Argentina de Estudios Estrat\u00e9gicos (Argentine Journal of Strategic Studies). His journalistic publications include some 400 articles, many have been published in his collection of socio-political essays, such as, Argentina, el gran viraje (2000), El eclipse argentino. De la enfermedad colectiva al renacimiento (2003) and La santa locura de los Argentina (2006), Sobrevivir Argentina (2014) and  R\u00e9quiem por la pol\u00edtica (2015). His literary and more strictly philosophical reflections have been collected in En letra grande (2005). In many of these texts Posse celebrates the glorious past of Argentina where he expounds on his desire that in the 21st century his country may resume its destiny as a great nation in the continental and international sphere, and that it take a greater role in Mercosur and in wider projects of regional integration. As a Peronist, Posse has worked with Eduardo Duhalde in the consolidation of Mercosur.\n\nSince his retirement from the Argentine Foreign Service and his return to Argentina in 2004, Posse became an ardent critic of the policies of Nestor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, former President of Argentina, both in his opinion pieces in the press as well as in political activities. In 2007 he backed the presidential candidature of Eduardo Duhalde, while in the same year he was a candidate in the senate ticket of Roberto Lavagna for the City of Buenos Aires. Toward the end of 2009, he was named Minister of Education of the City of Buenos Aires by Mauricio Macri (newly elected President of the country), replacing Mariano Narodwski. His posting caused a scandal due to a controversial piece he published on 10 December in La Naci\u00f3n (1). In this article, not only did he judge the Kirchner policies as inefficient in relation to law and order issues, but Posse also accused the Kirchners of ideological closeness to the armed left-wing militants of the 1970s (an ideology he has rejected in many of his texts) and of only telling one side of the story of the last military dictatorship. This text ignited a wave of protests in broad sectors of the left, including union and student organizations, as well as in social media, and in various newspaper outlets such as P\u00e1gina 12, who insisted that part of his diplomatic career had been under the watch of the previous military dictatorship. Given the intensity of these protests, Posse resigned from this post 11 days after his appointment.\n\n==Childhood and youth==\n\nAbel Parentini Posse was born on 7 January 1934, in the Argentine city of C\u00f3rdoba where he only lived the first two years of his life.<ref>[Sobre sus recuerdos de este per\u00edodo, leer Antonio L\u00f3pez Ortega, \u00abConversaci\u00f3n con Abel Posse\u00bb, Imagen, Caracas, 10/1987, n.\u00ba 100, p.3-6.</ref> Two years after birth the family moved to the capital city of  Buenos Aires due to his father's work commitments. His mother, Elba Alicia Posse, belonged to the creole landed oligarchy of Galician descent who held vast sugar mill estates in the North West province of Tucuman. Amongst the influential members of the Posse clan in the 19th  century, the liberal Julio Argentino Roca stands out, twice president of the republic from 1880 to 1886 and also 1898 to 1904 (3). Posse fictionalized 19th century Tucuman in his novel El inquietante d\u00eda de la vida (2001), where two distant family relatives are the protagonists; his maternal great-grandfather, Felipe Segundo Posse, and Julio Victor Posse, patron of the arts in the sugar producing province until the 1940s.\n\nThe novelist's father, Ernesto Parentini, a porte\u00f1o of Italian parents, was one of the founders of Artistas Argentinos Asociados and was the producer of the legendary feature film La guerra gaucha (1942), based on the text by the poet Leopoldo Lugones. The young Abel Posse grew up in the Argentine capital near Rivadavia street, and given his father's profession was exposed to the artistic and cultural milieu this most sophisticated of the South American capitals had to offer. The \u201cQueen of the River Plate\u201d, as Buenos Aires came to be known, fascinated the young man, (4) and his memories are evoked in his novel Los demonios ocultos (1987).\nHe was able to mingle with the glamorous stars of Argentine show business, like Chas de Cruz, Pierina Dealessi, Ulises Petit de Murat, Mu\u00f1oz Azpiri, the writer of radioplays which were performed by Eva Duarte (de Per\u00f3n), as well as the tango composers An\u00edbal Troilo and Homero Manzi. Such were the family connections to show business that one of his aunts, Esmeralda Leiva de Heredia, better known as \u201cLa Jard\u00edn\u201d, was an actress friend of Eva Duarte. (5) Growing up in this environment enabled him to obtain an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of the tango repertoire and its culture, (6) which imbues his novel La reina del Plata (1988).\n\nThe imagination of the young Posse was awakened and nurtured by the father's personal library. (7) When he was eight he wrote and illustrated little books he would sell to his grandmother, who lived in the same apartment complex. (8) He undertook his primary education at the Colegio La Salle (9) and his secondary education between 1946 and 1952 at the prestigious Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. (10) During these formative years in his intellectual development he began close friendships with people who would usher him into Buenos Aires literary circles, such as Rogelio Baz\u00e1n, the translator of Georg Trakl. Posse would later dedicate a poetic tribute to the German bard.\n\nAmongst his teachers, the orientalist philosopher Vicente Fatone stands out as an  influential figure,  awakening in Posse an interest in esoteric philosophy which is evident in several of his novels, especially in Los demonios ocultos  and  El viajero de Agartha. In 1943, at age 13, Posse launched himself into his first literary project (never completed), a novel set in imperial Rome. (11)\n\n== The fiesta of the \u201cQueen of the River Plate\u201d == \nPosse studied at the Law Faculty in Buenos Aires until 1958. Apart from his studies \u201clectured by fascist-Peronist professors\u201d (12) who bored him, he lived the \u201cnight life\u201d fiesta of Buenos Aires, a city which in those days was home to the most important publishing houses in the Spanish speaking world and also to exiled writers and intellectuals of the Spanish Civil War. According to Posse, his night time meetings and conversations in Buenos Aires caf\u00e9s allowed him to deepen his knowledge of Russian and French literature, German philosophy and oriental spiritualism. In this rich bohemian environment he met [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Eduardo Mallea]], [[Ezequiel Mart\u00ednez Estrada]], [[Ricardo Molinari]], [[Manuel Mujica Lainez]], [[Ram\u00f3n Gomez de la Serna]] and [[Rafael Alberti]] (13). He became close friends with the poets [[Conrado Nal\u00e9 Roxlo]] and [[Carlos Mastronardi]], as well as Borges, who opened the doors for him of the SADE and who would later help him to publish his first short stories and poems in the daily El Mundo. \nIn those years Posse became attracted to [[Peronist]] ideas. Although he had been born into an anti-Peronist family, the huge public demonstration of 17 October 1945 had left a lasting impression (14), as had the strength of Evita and her ability to bring life into the movement, together with the open public grieving aroused by her funeral in 1952. These years of university life and above all of the night life in Buenos Aires are depicted by Posse as a true \u201cgolden age\u201d which he recreates in certain passages of La reina del Plata (1988) and La pasi\u00f3n segun Eva (1994), a fictional biography which conveys the last days of Eva Per\u00f3n. After having undertaken his military service in 1955, during the anti-Peronist Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora, Posse completed his university studies in 1958. That same year, he wrote a screenplay, \u201cLa cumparsa\u201d (The troupe), which was given an award by the National Institute of Cinematography; set in Patagonia, the troupe is composed of a group of sheep shearers who turn out to be a veritable court of miracles. (15)\n\n==Voyage to Europe==\nAfter graduating, Posse decided to travel to Europe. Thanks to a university scholarship, he undertook doctoral studies in Political Sciences at La Sorbonne in Paris. A few months prior to his travels, he published his first poem, \u201cInvocaci\u00f3n al fantasma de mi infancia muerta\u201d, in the literary supplement of El Mundo (16). While in Europe, he crossed the Alps on motorbike in order to visit his sister in Italy. \nIn this period he deepened his knowledge of the poetry of H\u00f6lderlin, Rilke and Trakl (17). During his stay in Paris he listened to Sartre, he had as professors eminent French political scientists of the time (Duverger, Hauriou, Rivarol) and also met Pablo Neruda (18). During his stay in the \u201cCity of Light\u201d he fell in love with a German student, Wienke Sabine Langenheim, his future wife, who would play an important role in his literary formation, guiding  his readings of German literature and philosophy which infuse his works. In 1961 he spent two semesters in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, the home of H\u00f6lderlin. That same year, his poem, \u201cEn la tumba de Georg Trakl\u201d, the first ever text signed as Abel Posse, was awarded the Rene Bastianini prize of the SADE in Buenos Aires. During his stay in T\u00fcbingen he read H\u00f6lderlin, Nietzsche and Heidegger (19). It was also here that he began writing his first novel, Los bogavantes, which he would finish in 1967.\n\n==From Buenos Aires to the Foreign Service==\nPosse returned to Buenos Aires in 1962. After a competitive selection process, he taught as an assistant in constitutional law under professor Carlos Fayt at the University of Buenos Aires. With little enthusiasm he also began to work as a lawyer. Sabine travelled to Argentina and a while later they were married. In 1965 he was admitted to the Argentine Foreign Service after a public selection process (20).Until 2004 he would live most of his life abroad, as such most of his works were written outside of Argentina, although he has always defended his Argentine identity, his literary production has been well served by Ricardo G\u00fciraldes\u2019 adage, \u201cdistance reveals\u201d (21).\n\n==Moscow (1966\u20131969)==\nAbel Posse's only son, Ivan, was born in Moscow in January 1967. At this time in the Russian capital he also finished writing his first novel, Los bogavantes, set in Paris and Seville, centered on a trio of characters, two of whom are students and one a Foreign Service employee, embodying the ideological tensions of the early 1960s. This neo-realist novel played an important part in his literary career. Under the pseudonym of Arnaut Daniel, Posse submitted it to the 1968 Planeta Prize. It featured amongst the four finalists, and although it had been virtually declared the winner by the judges Jos\u00e9 Manuel de Lara and Baltasar Porcel, under Francoist pressure the judges had to overturn their decision, due to some charged erotic scenes, but above all because of its critical and ironical references to the regime's military. Once it had been published in 1970 by  Editorial Br\u00fajula in Argentina, thanks to the support of Ernesto Sabato and Posse's father, and after it received the Sash of Honour of the SADE, Los bogavantes was later published in Barcelona in 1975 where it was the object of Francoist censorship. All 5000 copies were purged of two pages which ridiculed the masculinity of army officers. This singular publishing episode (22) brought him under the attention of those who were the leading literary publishers of the time, Carlos Barral and Carmen Balcells; the latter would become his literary agent.\n\n==Lima (1969\u20131971)==\nAbel Posse was posted to Peru in 1969 and appointed cultural secretary of the embassy in Lima. For him Peru represented the discovery of Inca culture, the \u201crevelation of the Americas\u201d (23) which compelled him to identify himself with his creole roots of North-Western Argentina (24). A visit to [[Machu Picchu]] inspired a long poem of 240 verses, Celebraci\u00f3n de Machu Picchu, which he wrote in Cuzco in 1970 and published much later in Venice in 1977. Also in 1970 he wrote his most ambitious poetical piece, Celebraci\u00f3n del desamparo, which was amongst the finalists of the Maldoror Poetry Prize although Posse decided against publishing it. In those years he read Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas and the great Cuban stylists: Alejo Carpentier, Lezama Lima and Severo Sarduy. He also researched the life of Argentina's national independence hero, General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, and in 1971 was admitted to the Instituto Sanmartiniano de Lima. In Peru he also wrote his second novel, La boca del tigre (1971), inspired by his personal experiences in the Soviet Union. This novel, clearly influenced by Ernesto Sabato's neo-realist style of fiction, helped the author to articulate his distrust of the overbearing ideologies of the time, in order to criticize the exercise of power in the contemporary world and to reflect on the place of the individual in that historical juncture. This thematic concern foreshadowed the ideas about history in his later novel Daimon. La boca del tigre, which received the third National Prize of Argentine Literature, hints at his initial musings on the notion of Amerincaness (americanidad). (25) The influence that the Argentine philosopher and anthropologist [[Rodolfo G\u00fcnther Kusch]] would have on Posse's fiction and indeed his own worldview after his encounter with him and his readings of La seducci\u00f3n de la babarie (1953) and Am\u00e9rica profunda (1962). Consequently, Kusch's thought on the fundamental ontological and cultural antagonism between the West's homo faber with the americano \u201cman of being\u201d and the symbiotic relationship of Amerindians with the Cosmos (\u201cthe Open\u201d) was to become a leitmotif in Posse's work, and particularly in his \u201cTrilogy of the Discovery of America\u201d.\n\n==Venice (1973\u20131979)==\nPosse was named Consul General for [[Venice]] in 1973, where he lived for 6 years. It was here that he wrote Daimon (1978), between October 1973 and August 1977, the novel which began the \u201cTrilogy of the Discovery of America\u201d. This novel has as its protagonist a fictional avatar of the Spanish conquistador Lope de Aguirre (1510\u20131561). In this text, the conqueror, known for his cruelty which is depicted by chroniclers as the archetypal madman and traitor, raises from his ashes eleven years after his death together with the ghosts of his Mara\u00f1ones. Thus begins the \u201cJornada de Am\u00e9rica\u201d, through four centuries of painful Latin American history, on which he casts a disillusioned gaze, by seeing it as an \u201cEternal-Return-of-the-Same\u201d; that is the eternal annihilation of man's liberty against which Lope de Aguirre's rebelliousness is powerless to arrest. This fruitless trans-historical rebellion drives him to an ambiguous death in the mid-1970s in Latin America, a condition which bears a resemblance to the death of Ernesto Che Guevara's revolutionary venture in Bolivia. Several scenes of torture suffered by the protagonist clearly resemble the atrocities committed by the Argentine military during the country's last military dictatorship. (26) This novel constitutes a milestone in Posse's poetics, as it is enthused with Rabelaisian  elements in a baroque style, by continually resorting to the use of humour and ambiguity, to parody, intertextuality, anachronism, the grotesque, and a continuous paratextual dialogue with the reader, characteristics which would reach their highest intensity in the subsequent novel, The dogs of paradise (1983). Daimon was shortlisted for the prestigious Romulo Gallegos Prize in 1982.\n\nThe Venetian sojourn was where he received the recognition of his peers; he was visited by friends such as Ernesto Sabato, Carlos Barral, Manuel Scorza, Victor Massuh, Antonio Requeni, Manuel Mujica Lainez, Jorge Luis Borges, Antonio Di Benedetto and Juan Rulfo. (27) He also met in Venice, Alejo Carpentier, who was writing his Concierto barroco (1974), as well as Italo Calvino, Alberto Moravia and Giorgio Bassani. During his years in Venice, Posse reflected on the Heideggerian concept of \u201cthe Open\u201d (Das Offene) and Kusch's ideas concerning \u2018being\u2019. (29) In 1973 he visited the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (30), and in 1979 together with his wife Sabine  published a Spanish translation of Der feldweg. (31) After a brief trip to Buenos Aires in 1975, and on his return to Venice, he wrote between April and June the same year a dark novel reflecting the murderous political violence being played out in Argentina at the time, titled Momento de morir, but which he did not publish until 1979. Its protagonist, Medardo Rabagliatti, a rather mediocre and irresolute suburban solicitor, is witness to the unfolding armed violence perpetrated by groups of youngsters depicted as fanatics and a sadistic military. Against all odds, the story's denouement sees the vacillating Medardo kill the murderous military leader responsible for the repression, and later oversees the re-establishment of democratic political institutions in the country. The historical reading proposed by the author (various characters are clearly fictional avatars of Mario Firmenich and Hector J. Campora) condemns without a doubt the ERP (Ejercito Revolucionario del Pueblo), the Monotoneros and the military repression, thus underlining the \u201cthesis of two evils\u201d; a thesis the author holds in the prologue he added to the 1997 edition. (32)\n\n'''Paris (1981\u20131985)'''\nIn 1981 Posse was appointed director of the Argentine Cultural Centre in Paris. It was there where he wrote The dogs of paradise (1983), second part of his \u201cTrilogy\u201d, with Christopher Columbus as its protagonist, and for which he was awarded the 1987 R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Prize. This novel, translated into many languages, confirmed Posse, according to many literary scholars, as one of the leading exponents of Latin American's \u201cNew Historical Novel\u201d. As in Daimon, the novel questions the validity of the official historiography of the conquest of the Americas, undermines the laws governing space and time, and anachronism is systematic, as is intertextuality, the pastiche, parody, while the work harbours, like Daimon, a profound reflection on the Latin American condition and its identity.  The dogs of paradise explores the motivations of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] and Columbus, as well as the aftermath of the clash of cultures triggers by the arrival of the Spaniards through the dialogical testimony of  the defeated.  \nBetween 1982 and 1985 Posse edited a bilingual collection (Spanish and French) of 15 Argentine poets titled Nadir, which included: Leopoldo Lugones, Enrique Molina, H\u00e9ctor Antonio Murena, Juan L. Ortiza, Ricardo Molinari, Conrado Nal\u00e9 Roxlo, Baldomero Fernandez Moreno, Alejandra Pizarnik, Oliverio Girondo, Manuel J. Castilla, Alberto Girri, Raul G. Aguirre, Juan Rodolfo Wilcock, Ezequiel Mart\u00ednez Estrada and Leopoldo Marechal. This project was carried out with the assistance of Argentine and French poets, academics and translators. The volumes were gifted and distributed to French libraries and universities, with the aim of increasing the interest of these works internationally. The project was no doubt inspired by Roger Caillois who, with his collection La Croix du Sud, made a major contribution to the international recognition of Jorge Luis Borges\u2019 work. (34)\nIn January 1983 at age 15, Ivan, Posse's only son committed suicide at the family's apartment in Paris, a tragedy which the author would chronicle many years later in Cuando muere el hijo  (2009), an autobiographical account presented as a \u201creal chronicle\u201d. \nWhen The dogs of paradise appeared in bookshops he announced the forthcoming publication of the third sequel of the \u201cTrilogy\u201d, titled Sobre las misiones jesu\u00edticas, to be set in the Jesuit missions of Paraguay. (35)  While its appearance was announced in 1986, with a different title, Los heraldos negros, it is as yet unpublished. (36) \nIn November 1983, alongside the Paris Autumn Festival, Posse organised  with Claudio Segovia a tango festival called Tango argentin, where Roberto Goyeneche participated and which was destined, as it were in his own words: \u201cto bring to life the real tango, the primitive tango of the origins\u201d as against the \u201ctango for export\u201d of Astor Piazzola. (37)\n\n '''Israel (1985\u20131988)'''\nAfter the death of his son, Posse could no longer live in Paris and he was appointed Plenipotentiary Minister at the Argentine embassy in Tel-Aviv. He returned to writing there, and wrote three novels, quite different to his previous ones. He wrote two novels on Nazism,  Los demonios ocultos (1987) and El viajero de Agartha (1989). Los demonios ocultos was a literary project Posse had begun much earlier in 1971, after having met several Nazis in Buenos Aires during his university days. The protagonist of the novels, cast in a neorealist style, is a young Argentine, Alberto Lorca, who goes in search of his father, Walther Werner, a German scientist specialized in Oriental esoterism, who was sent by the Third Reich on a mission to Central Asia. The plot takes place in two temporal spaces, the Second World War and the Argentina of the last military dictatorship.  El viajero de Agartha (1989, Premio Internacional Diana-Novedades,  Mexico) is a true adventure espionage novel. Walter Werner as protagonist narrates the story in a diary recovered by his son, which recounts his mission in Tibet in his search for the mythical city of Agartha. The third novel, La reina del Plata  (1988),  as the title indicates is a homage to the Argentine capital and the period of splendour it once knew. The novel takes place in a futuristic Buenos Aires, whose society is polarized between \u201cInsiders\u201d and \u201cOutsiders\u201d, where the \u201cOutsider\u201d Guillermo Aguirre ruminates on his own identity. The plot is narrated in fragments comprises ninety short chapters, while the action takes place in the typically Buenos Aires atmosphere of cafes and streets inhabited by the tango, the deep musical expression of the port city, where its characters muse about the past and present of the country.\n\n'''Prague (1990\u20131996)'''\nIn 1990 Posse is promoted to Ambassador by President Carlos S. Menem and is posted to Prague for six years. His stay in the Czech capital is quite productive. Here he composes his literary essay Biblioteca essential which he publishes in 1991, where he proposes the most important 101 works of universal literature and his own cannon of the literature of the River Plate. Posse also wrote in the Czech capital El largo atardecer del caminante, the novel which closes the \u201cTrilogy of the Discovery of America\u201d, and which was crowned with the Premio Internacional Extremadura-America V Centenario 1992, where 180 novels had entered. In this work, the baroque style of Daimon and The dogs of paradise give way to a more sombre and reflective style. The protagonist in this work is the conqueror Alvar Nu\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca (1490\u20131558), who lives the last years of his life in a humble abode in Seville, where he reminisces about his \u2018true\u2019 American adventure  through an autobiographical and sincere retelling of his exploits by filling in the blanks and the silences left by his chronicles titled Castaways and Commentaries. Posse's Cabeza de Vaca assumes his americanidad, his hybrid identity, by announcing his maxim, \u201conly faith can cure, only kindness heals\u201d as a way the conquest should have taken place. This introspective and autobiographical style is continued in his next work, La pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan Eva (1994). This is a biographical novel (fictionalised biography) with a polyphonic text which sees an ailing Eva Per\u00f3n living her last nine months of her life while casting a retrospective gaze over her life. At the same time, Posse collects and recovers the testimony of people who knew her, illustrating and readjusting Eva's own account. Although the text has a clear empathy with its subject, the novel's stated aim is to provide a deeper understanding of this powerful woman than given by previous biographies, taking her life out of the ideological straitjacket and transforming it into a destined life.\n\n'''Lima (1998\u20132000)'''\nDuring his posting as ambassador to Lima, Peru, Posse wrote another biographical novel, Los cuadernos de Praga (1998), which also has as its protagonist another memorable 20th century Argentine, Ernesto \u2018Che\u201d Guevara Lynch. As with several of his earlier novels, the author was inspired by personal experience; Posse was informed during his stay in Prague that Che Guevara lived undercover in the city for almost a year after his defeat in the Congo. Like in La pasi\u00f3n seg\u00fan Eva, the motive of the personal diary is the trigger for the autobiographical account, an account which converses with the research the author has carried out. Similarly to the previous novel, the objective of the author is not to simply recount the life of the historical person, but based on \u201csolid foundations\u201d, rescue his destiny in order to give account of his life beyond the ideological.  (38) \nOn his return to Latin America after his European postings Posse increased his journalistic opinion pieces in El Excelsior (Mexico), El Nacional  (Caracas), ABC  and El Mundo (Madrid), Linea and La Naci\u00f3n (Buenos Aires). Posse arrived in Peru when there was still a tense relationship with Ecuador over the war of El Condor, and in the aftermath of the kidnapping of hostages at the Japanese embassy by the MRTA (1997). Posse spoke highly of the Alberto Fujimori's war against the MRTA at the same time he expressed his opposition to the trials by Baltasar Garz\u00f3n against Augusto Pinochet and the International Human Rights Court, measures which he attributed to meddling into the internal affairs of Latin American countries. His opinion pieces also underscored the role Argentina could play in the consolidation of MERCOSUR and highlighted the natural resources of the country for the benefit of the next millennium, by appealing to the patriotism of its citizens and calling on them to imitate the example of Julio Argentino Roca, Hip\u00f6lito Yrigoyen and Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n. Many of these articles were brought together in the first collection of political essays he published in Argentina, el gran viraje (200). His return to Peru renewed his interest in the national hero, Jose de San Martin, which inspired the short story \u201cPaz en guerra\u201d (2000).\n\n'''Copenhagen (2001\u20132002)'''\nIn 2001 Posse published El inquietante d\u00eda de la vida, which received the Literary Prize of the Argentine Academy of Letters for the period 1998-2001. The protagonist is Felipe Segundo Posse, based on a real life ancestor of his who was heir to a vast estate of sugar mills in Tucuman province in the late 19th century. The story begins when he is diagnosed with tuberculosis and decides to abandon his family by travelling to Buenos Aires and then on to Egypt in search of the poet Rimbaud. The novel also fictionalizes historical characters like Domingo F. Sarmiento, Julio A. Roca and Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda while celebrating Argentina's development at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.\n\n'''Madrid (2002\u20132004)'''\nAfter a brief posting at UNESCO in Paris, Posse was appointed by President Duhalde Argentine ambassador to Spain. This was a hugely important posting, particularly due to the aftermath of the 2001 Argentine financial collapse, as this country was the main destination of Argentine migrants of Spanish descent. At the time Posse witnessed the deadly terrorist attacks in the Spanish capital on 11 March 2004. Deeply concerned by the crisis facing Argentina, Posse increased his opinion pieces in La Naci\u00f3n, defending regional integration, national sovereignty, and appealing to national reconstruction by evoking the memory of national figures such as Sarmiento and Evita. In 2003 he published another collection of political articles, El eclipse argentino. De la enfermedad colectiva al renacimiento, a work which attempts to outlay a blueprint for a national project. Once N\u00e9stor Kirchner assumed power, several media outlets pronounced Posse as the preferred candidate as foreign affairs minister, given his diplomatic experience, his age and his key posting in Spain. The journalist and former Montonero militant Miguel Bonasso published an opinion piece and participated in a TV program where he appealed to the president to put aside Posse's candidature, whom he accused of  having a benevolent attitude toward the previous military dictatorship for not having abandoned his diplomatic duties, and for his support of the Fujimori regime. (39) The president appointed Rafael Bielsa as foreign affairs minister, while Posse continued his appointment at the embassy in Madrid until his retirement in 2004 when he returned to Argentina.\n\n'''Buenos Aires (since 2004)'''\nAfter his retirement, Posse's commitment to the anti-Kirchner opposition increased. In very critical and controversial newspaper columns he linked the president and his supporters to extreme left wing militant movements of the 1970s, and he also opposed the restart of trials against the military, and the government's policy of collective memory which he labelled as incomplete. He increased his round of conferences on the state of the nation, and he supported the presidential candidacy of Eduardo Duhalde in 2007, when he was also senate candidate for the City of Buenos Aires in Roberto Lavagna's ticket. In 2005 his published En letra grande, a collection of literary essays and reflections on intellectuals close to him and who he considers as influential. He also published in 2006 a series of political essays under the title, La santa locura de los argentinos, which was a best-seller, where he attempts to map the Argentine question by focusing his analysis from colonial times to the last century in order to make a call for a citizen lead national consensus. In October 2009 he published Cuando muere el hijo, a testimonial novel where the narrators A and S experience the suicide of Ivan, and they try to come to terms with their son's decision. Later they undertake a journey of internal and external initiation when they travel from Paris to Tel-Aviv, and make a stop-over in Miletus, the city of the pre-Socratic philosopher Anaximander of Miletus. \nToward the end of 2009 Posse accepted the appointment of Minister of Education of the City of Buenos Aires offered by Mauricio Macri, which had been left vacant by Mariano Narodowski. Posse took office a day after having published a controversial article in the daily La Naci\u00f3n, titled \u201cCriminality and cowardice\u201d, where he declared that rock music dumbed down the young, and he judged as ineffective  law and order measures of the President, while demanding stronger measures against criminals. He also rejected the reopening of trials against members of the military regime, and reiterated his accusations against Kirchner for his ideological proximity to the 1970s militant left-wing movements. (40) His appointment and this opinion piece triggered a wave of protests by unions and students, from the rock-music scene and web based social networks, to sections of the media, such as P\u00e1gina 12, who accused Posse of having had close ties with previous dictatorship and of asserting that most of his diplomatic career had taken place during the last military junta, which had been first aired by Miguel Bonasso in his 2003 column referred to earlier. In fact, one of the most notorious henchmen of the military who coincidentally was on trial during those days, Benjamin Menendez, paraphrased a few sentences from Posse's article which was taken up by the media tarnishing Posse's image even further. Given such circumstances, Posse resigned 11 days into his new posting.\nIn 2011 he published Noche de lobos, based on the written account of a Montonero female leader who had been held captive and tortured at the ESMA (Navy School of Mechanics) and who had fallen in love with her torturer. This work delves into the conflicts between the urban guerrillas and the military, and both are portrayed as the protagonists of murderous acts of savagery. It recounts the acts of torture suffered by this woman in this clandestine detention centre, and how she falls prey to the so-called \u201cStockholm syndrome\u201d, where tortured and torturer fall in love with each other. This novel also has an autobiographical focus, as it reveals how this female guerrilla fighter while she was a captive at the hands of the military had given her typed account to Posse of her story in the early 1980s while he was in the Argentine embassy in Paris. (42)\nSince his resignation as Minister of Education of Buenos Aires, Abel Posse continues to live in this city, where he gives conferences, especially on Sarmiento's education legacy, and where he publishes frequently in Perfil and La Naci\u00f3n. He remains critical of the Kirchner policies and concerned about the future of the country. Since November 2012, Abel Posse is an elected numbered member of the Argentine Academy of Letters (43), having taken the place of the late Rafael Obligado. In May 2014 he became an elected numbered member of the National Academy of Education taking the numbered chair Bartolome Mitre.\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Novels===\n\n* Los bogavantes (1970)\n* La boca del tigre (1971)\n* Daim\u00f3n (1978) (Translated from the Spanish by Sarah Arvio.

It is often mistaken for, and was originally considered a [[subspecies]] of, the ''[[Banksia littoralis|Banksia&nbsp;littoralis]]'' (Swamp Banksia). [[Stephen Hopper]] described the subspecies ''remanens'' as a short-leaved shrubby form found in the coastal sands below granite outcrops in the [[Walpole-Nornalup National Park]], however [[Alex George|George]] does not feel this form warrants taxonomic recognition as it lies within the normal variability of the species and there was no clear distinction between it and the other populations of ''B.&nbsp;seminuda''.\n\n== Description ==\nThe river banksia generally grows as a tree up to 25&nbsp;metres (80&nbsp;ft) tall with a usually brown to grey trunk covered with a hard grey furrowed bark.<ref name=\"FoA\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=George|first=Alex|title=Banksia|year=1999|chapter=Banksia|editor-last=Wilson|editor-first=Annette |encyclopedia=Flora of Australia|volume= Volume 17B: Proteaceae 3: Hakea to Dryandra|pages=175\u2013251|publisher=CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study|authorlink= Alex George|isbn=0-643-06454-0}}</ref> The tree trunk is often straight and tall as the species generally grows in sheltered forest areas.

The leaves are [[phyllotaxis|arranged]] on the stems in whorls. Measuring {{convert|5|-|12|cm|in|frac=4}} long and {{convert|1|-|1.8|cm|in|frac=4}} across, they are linear in shape with serrated margins. The upper leaf surface is finely furred becoming smooth, while the undersruface is covered in white fur.<ref name=\"FoA\"/>\n\nFlowering occurs between late summer and late winter. The yellow (occasionally red) flower spikes grow up to 200&nbsp;mm (8&nbsp;in) high by 70&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;in) wide, the fruiting cones can remain on the trees for many years after shedding the flowers early. Its leathery leaves are between 70&nbsp;mm (3&nbsp;in) and 120&nbsp;mm (5&nbsp;in) long with fine teeth, subspecies ''remanens'' leaves have few if any teeth except at the tips of the leaves.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe type specimen of ''Banksia seminuda'' was collected on 15 May 1973 in [[Nanga Brook, Western Australia]] by [[Alex George]],<ref name=rye84/> who described it in 1981 as a subspecies of ''B.&nbsp;littoralis''. He had published a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] arrangement of ''Banksia'' in his landmark 1981 monograph ''[[The genus Banksia L.f.

This was despite an overlap in their flowering seasons. The bark of the trunk and flower structure differed greatly between the species.

It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as [[London City Airport|London City]].<ref name=A318steep/>\n\nThe A318 entered service in July 2003 with [[Frontier Airlines]].

The A320 family pioneered the use in commercial aircraft of digital [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control systems]], as well as [[side stick]] controls.\n\nThe Airbus A318 project had its origins in the collaboration among Chinese, Singaporean and European manufacturers. In May 1997, during the visit of French President [[Jacques Chirac]] to China, [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China|Aviation Industries of China]] (AVIC), [[ST Aerospace|Singapore Technologies Aerospace]] (STAe), Airbus and [[Alenia Aermacchi|Alenia]] signed a framework agreement that outlined the development of aircraft in the 100-seat range.<ref name=Interavia>{{Cite web|author1=Condom, Pierre|author2=Sutton, Oliver|date=1 June 1997|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19778327.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702024922/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19778327.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 July 2016|title=New family members mean Airbus means business|work=Interavia Business & Technology|url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]]|accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> The AE31X programme, as it was tentatively dubbed, besides being a global industrial programme would have significantly deepened Sino-European commercial ties.<ref name=Sparaco>{{Cite journal|last=Sparaco|first=Pierre|date=26 May 1997|title=Airbus, Asians Plan Regional Twinjet|journal=Aviation Week & Space Technology|volume=146|issue=22|pages=24\u201325}}</ref>{{rp|24}} With development costs estimated to be upwards of $2 billion, AVIC would have a 46 percent stake in the project, STAe 15 percent, and Airbus Industrie Asia 39 percent, the latter of which comprised Airbus and Alenia.<ref name=Sparaco/>{{rp|24}} Final assembly would have taken place in China.<ref name=\"N&W p.87\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=87}}</ref>\n\nThe project never went past the exploratory phase.<ref name=Terminate>{{Cite journal|last=Sparaco|first=Pierre|date=13 July 1998|title=Europeans, Chinese Terminate AE31X|journal=Aviation Week & Space Technology|volume=149|issue=2|pages=56\u20137}}</ref>{{rp|56}} It comprised two clean-sheet designs \u2013 the AE316 and the AE317.

The aircraft's production took advantage of laser welding, eliminating the necessity for heavy rivets and bolts.\n\nDuring the design process, the A318 encountered several problems. The first one was the decline in demand for new aircraft following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney [[turbofan]] engines, which burned more fuel than expected. By the time [[CFM International]] (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including [[Air China]] and [[British Airways]]. [[America West Airlines]], which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. [[Trans World Airlines]] cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by [[American Airlines]], which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a [[regional jet]] alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept it in the same class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by two CFM56-5 or Pratt & Whitney [[Pratt & Whitney PW6000|PW6000]] engines with maximum thrust ratings of between {{convert|96|and|106|kN|lbf|sigfig=3}}. Launch customers Frontier Airlines and [[Air France]] took deliveries in 2003, with Frontier receiving its aircraft in July of that year. The list price of an A318 ranges from $56 to $62&nbsp;million, and operating costs are between $2,500 and $3,000 for each flight hour.<ref>\n[http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/new-bizjets/ New Bizjets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504052609/http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/new-bizjets/ |date=4 May 2008 }}  Ainonline\n</ref>\n\nOrders for the A318 have been relatively slow, but slightly better than for its direct competitor the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-600]]. At 30 September 2017, Airbus had received 80 orders for this model<ref name=\"Airbus O&D\"/> compared to 69 for the 737-600.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=737&optReportType=AllModels&cboAllModel=737&ViewReportF=View+Report |title=Boeing 737 Model Summary|work=boeing.com|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> The sales pace has been influenced by the strong sales of the [[Bombardier CRJ900]] and [[Embraer E-Jets]] series. The biggest A318 customers at 30 September 2017 were Governments, Executive and Private Jets (20), Air France (18), [[Avianca Holdings]] (15), GECAS (12) and Frontier Airlines (9).<ref name=\"Airbus O&D\"/>\n\n===Further developments===\nOn 10 November 2005 Airbus announced the '''A318 Elite'''. The Airbus A318 Elite is aimed at the medium-range market for flights of up to {{convert|4000|nmi|km|adj=on}} range, with a choice of two cabin layouts seating up to 18 passengers, and powered by CFM engines. [[Comlux Aviation]] became the launch customer by ordering three A318 Elite aircraft.\n\nIn September 2010, Airbus confirmed that from 2013 the Airbus A318 would become available with ''Sharklets'', [[wingtip device]]s which reduce [[lift-induced drag]] and improve efficiency through reduced fuel consumption.<ref name=Sharklets>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/09/23/347719/a318-to-be-available-with-sharklets-from-2013.html|title=A318 to be available with sharklets from 2013|author=Ostrower, Jon|work=Flightglobal|date=23 September 2010|accessdate=1 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925221316/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/09/23/347719/a318-to-be-available-with-sharklets-from-2013.html|archivedate=25 September 2010}}</ref> The optional devices, which will also be available on other Airbus A320 family models and are manufactured by [[Korean Air#Aerospace research and manufacturing|Korean Air Aerospace Division]], will increase the range of the aircraft to {{convert|5930|km|nmi}} \u2013 an increase of {{convert|185|km|nmi}} over a standard A318 with 107 seats in a two-class configuration.<ref name=Sharklets/>\n\n==Design==\nThe Airbus A318 is a small commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle [[landing gear]] and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] with a conventional [[Empennage|tail unit]] having a single [[vertical stabilizer]] and [[rudder]].\n\nOverall, the A318 is over six metres shorter and around {{cvt|3|t|lb}} lighter than the A320. To compensate for the reduced [[Moment (physics)|moment arm]], it has a larger [[vertical stabiliser]]. While initial concepts depicted the aircraft with a [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-300]]-style dorsal fin extension,<ref>{{cite journal| last= Kingsley-Jones | first= Max |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1999/1999%20-%201737.html |title= Cut and Thrust|journal=[[Flight International]]| date= 9\u201315 June 1999 |volume = 155 |issue = 4680| pages = 150, 153\u2013154 |accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> the final design incorporated a fin tip extension, making it {{Convert|75|cm|in}} taller than the other A320 variants. Pilots who are trained on the other variants may fly the A318 with no further certification, since it features a common flight deck and the same type rating as its sister aircraft. The A318 is also referred to as the A318-100<ref>https://www.britishairways.com/en-us/information/about-ba/fleet-facts/airbus-318-100 Retrieved 29 June 2017.</ref>\n\nThe A318 is available with a variety of different [[maximum take-off weight]]s (MTOW) ranging from a {{convert|59|tonne|ton}}, {{convert|2750|km|nmi}} base model to a {{convert|68|tonne|ton}}, {{convert|6000|km|nmi}} version. When equipped with CFM56-5B8/P engines, the A318 is available with a 123,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW. When equipped with CFM56-5B9/P engines, the A318 is available with a 130,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW.<ref>https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2036-1H%20Chg%201.pdf Retrieved 7 May 2017.</ref> The lower MTOW enables it to operate regional routes economically while sacrificing range and the higher MTOW allows it to complement other members of the A320 family on marginal routes. The lighter weight of the A318 gives it an operating range 10% greater than the A320, allowing it to serve some routes that the A320 would be unable to: London \u2013 New York, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]\u2013[[Auckland]] and Singapore\u2013Tokyo, for instance. Its main use for airlines, however, is on short, low-density hops between medium-sized cities.\n\n===Steep approach capability===\n[[File:British Airways (G-EUNA) Airbus A318 at London City Airport.jpg|thumb|left|British Airways Airbus A318 at [[London City Airport]].]]\n[[File:Airbus A318 of British Airways at J.F.K.

The A320 family pioneered the use in commercial aircraft of digital [[fly-by-wire]] [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control systems]], as well as [[side stick]] controls.\n\nThe Airbus A318 project had its origins in the collaboration among Chinese, Singaporean and European manufacturers. In May 1997, during the visit of French President [[Jacques Chirac]] to China, [[Aviation Industry Corporation of China|Aviation Industries of China]] (AVIC), [[ST Aerospace|Singapore Technologies Aerospace]] (STAe), Airbus and [[Alenia Aermacchi|Alenia]] signed a framework agreement that outlined the development of aircraft in the 100-seat range.<ref name=Interavia>{{Cite web|author1=Condom, Pierre|author2=Sutton, Oliver|date=1 June 1997|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19778327.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702024922/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19778327.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 July 2016|title=New family members mean Airbus means business|work=Interavia Business & Technology|url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]]|accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> The AE31X programme, as it was tentatively dubbed, besides being a global industrial programme would have significantly deepened Sino-European commercial ties.<ref name=Sparaco>{{Cite journal|last=Sparaco|first=Pierre|date=26 May 1997|title=Airbus, Asians Plan Regional Twinjet|journal=Aviation Week & Space Technology|volume=146|issue=22|pages=24\u201325}}</ref>{{rp|24}} With development costs estimated to be upwards of $2 billion, AVIC would have a 46 percent stake in the project, STAe 15 percent, and Airbus Industrie Asia 39 percent, the latter of which comprised Airbus and Alenia.<ref name=Sparaco/>{{rp|24}} Final assembly would have taken place in China.<ref name=\"N&W p.87\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=87}}</ref>\n\nThe project never went past the exploratory phase.<ref name=Terminate>{{Cite journal|last=Sparaco|first=Pierre|date=13 July 1998|title=Europeans, Chinese Terminate AE31X|journal=Aviation Week & Space Technology|volume=149|issue=2|pages=56\u20137}}</ref>{{rp|56}} It comprised two clean-sheet designs \u2013 the AE316 and the AE317.

The aircraft's production took advantage of laser welding, eliminating the necessity for heavy rivets and bolts.\n\nDuring the design process, the A318 encountered several problems. The first one was the decline in demand for new aircraft following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney [[turbofan]] engines, which burned more fuel than expected. By the time [[CFM International]] (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including [[Air China]] and [[British Airways]]. [[America West Airlines]], which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. [[Trans World Airlines]] cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by [[American Airlines]], which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a [[regional jet]] alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept it in the same class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by two CFM56-5 or Pratt & Whitney [[Pratt & Whitney PW6000|PW6000]] engines with maximum thrust ratings of between {{convert|96|and|106|kN|lbf|sigfig=3}}. Launch customers Frontier Airlines and [[Air France]] took deliveries in 2003, with Frontier receiving its aircraft in July of that year. The list price of an A318 ranges from $56 to $62&nbsp;million, and operating costs are between $2,500 and $3,000 for each flight hour.<ref>\n[http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/new-bizjets/ New Bizjets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504052609/http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/new-bizjets/ |date=4 May 2008 }}  Ainonline\n</ref>\n\nOrders for the A318 have been relatively slow, but slightly better than for its direct competitor the [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-600]]. At 30 September 2017, Airbus had received 80 orders for this model<ref name=\"Airbus O&D\"/> compared to 69 for the 737-600.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://active.boeing.com/commercial/orders/displaystandardreport.cfm?cboCurrentModel=737&optReportType=AllModels&cboAllModel=737&ViewReportF=View+Report |title=Boeing 737 Model Summary|work=boeing.com|date=30 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> The sales pace has been influenced by the strong sales of the [[Bombardier CRJ900]] and [[Embraer E-Jets]] series. The biggest A318 customers at 30 September 2017 were Governments, Executive and Private Jets (20), Air France (18), [[Avianca Holdings]] (15), GECAS (12) and Frontier Airlines (9).<ref name=\"Airbus O&D\"/>\n\n===Further developments===\nOn 10 November 2005 Airbus announced the '''A318 Elite'''. The Airbus A318 Elite is aimed at the medium-range market for flights of up to {{convert|4000|nmi|km|adj=on}} range, with a choice of two cabin layouts seating up to 18 passengers, and powered by CFM engines. [[Comlux Aviation]] became the launch customer by ordering three A318 Elite aircraft.\n\nIn September 2010, Airbus confirmed that from 2013 the Airbus A318 would become available with ''Sharklets'', [[wingtip device]]s which reduce [[lift-induced drag]] and improve efficiency through reduced fuel consumption.<ref name=Sharklets>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/09/23/347719/a318-to-be-available-with-sharklets-from-2013.html|title=A318 to be available with sharklets from 2013|author=Ostrower, Jon|work=Flightglobal|date=23 September 2010|accessdate=1 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925221316/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/09/23/347719/a318-to-be-available-with-sharklets-from-2013.html|archivedate=25 September 2010}}</ref> The optional devices, which will also be available on other Airbus A320 family models and are manufactured by [[Korean Air#Aerospace research and manufacturing|Korean Air Aerospace Division]], will increase the range of the aircraft to {{convert|5930|km|nmi}} \u2013 an increase of {{convert|185|km|nmi}} over a standard A318 with 107 seats in a two-class configuration.<ref name=Sharklets/>\n\n==Design==\nThe Airbus A318 is a small commercial, narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft with a retractable tricycle [[landing gear]] and is powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318, CFM International with the CFM56-5B engine and Pratt & Whitney with the PW6000 engine. It is a low-wing [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] with a conventional [[Empennage|tail unit]] having a single [[vertical stabilizer]] and [[rudder]].\n\nOverall, the A318 is over six metres shorter and around {{cvt|3|t|lb}} lighter than the A320.

Pilots who are trained on the other variants may fly the A318 with no further certification, since it features a common flight deck and the same type rating as its sister aircraft. The A318 is also referred to as the A318-100<ref>https://www.britishairways.com/en-us/information/about-ba/fleet-facts/airbus-318-100 Retrieved 29 June 2017.</ref>\n\nThe A318 is available with a variety of different [[maximum take-off weight]]s (MTOW) ranging from a {{convert|59|tonne|ton}}, {{convert|2750|km|nmi}} base model to a {{convert|68|tonne|ton}}, {{convert|6000|km|nmi}} version. When equipped with CFM56-5B8/P engines, the A318 is available with a 123,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW. When equipped with CFM56-5B9/P engines, the A318 is available with a 130,000 lb. MTOW or a 150,000 lb. MTOW.<ref>https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2036-1H%20Chg%201.pdf Retrieved 7 May 2017.</ref> The lower MTOW enables it to operate regional routes economically while sacrificing range and the higher MTOW allows it to complement other members of the A320 family on marginal routes. The lighter weight of the A318 gives it an operating range 10% greater than the A320, allowing it to serve some routes that the A320 would be unable to: London \u2013 New York, [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]\u2013[[Auckland]] and Singapore\u2013Tokyo, for instance. Its main use for airlines, however, is on short, low-density hops between medium-sized cities.\n\n===Steep approach capability===\n[[File:British Airways (G-EUNA) Airbus A318 at London City Airport.jpg|thumb|left|British Airways Airbus A318 at [[London City Airport]].]]\n[[File:Airbus A318 of British Airways at J.F.K.
