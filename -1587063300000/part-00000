Frog''' is an [[animated cartoon]] [[fictional character|character]] from the [[Merrie Melodies]] film series. Originally a one-shot character, his only appearance during the original run of the Merrie Melodies series was as the star of ''[[One Froggy Evening]]'' (December 31, 1955), written by [[Michael Maltese]] and directed by [[Chuck Jones]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maltin |first1=Leonard |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |date=1987 |publisher=Plume |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |edition=Revised  |pages=268-269}}</ref> In this cartoon, partly inspired by a 1944 [[Cary Grant]] film entitled ''[[Once Upon a Time (1944 film)|Once Upon a Time]]'', Michigan is a male [[frog]] who wears a [[top hat]], carries a cane, sings [[pop music]], [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]] hits, and other songs from the late 19th and early 20th century while dancing and performing [[acrobatics]] in the style of early 20th century [[vaudeville]]. He appeared in a later cartoon titled ''[[Another Froggy Evening]]'' which was released on October 6, 1995. He was also a former mascot of [[The WB]] from that year until 2005, and after ''[[The Night of Favorites and Farewells]]'', he was shown as the final image of a white silhouette bowing down to viewers, bringing up [[The CW|The CW]].\n\n==History==\nThe character may be loosely based on [[Ol' Rip the Horned Toad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who2.com/bio/michigan-j-frog/|title=Michigan J.

In a clip from a DVD special, Jones stated that he had come up with the name \"Michigan Frog\" during the 1970s and was inspired to add the \"J.\" as a middle initial while being interviewed by a writer named [[Jay Cocks]].<!--NOT vandalism; see wikilinked article which confirms spelling before reverting--><ref>{{cite web  |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060115/REVIEWS08/601150301/1023  |title=Chuck Jones: Three Cartoons (1953-1957)  |last=Ebert  |first=Roger  |date=2006-01-15  |work=rogerebert.com  |publisher=Chicago Sun Times online  |accessdate=2012-08-22  |url-status=live  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920014233/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060115%2FREVIEWS08%2F601150301%2F1023  |archivedate=2012-09-20  }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Looney Tunes Golden Collection'' DVD credits Frog's original singing vocals to Bill Roberts, a nightclub entertainer in Los Angeles in the 1950s who had also done voice work for the 1948 MGM cartoon ''[[Little 'Tinker]]''. (Roberts went uncredited at the time, as were most voice actors at the Warner Bros. studio who were not [[Mel Blanc]], since only Blanc had a clause in his contract ensuring he would get on-screen credit.) In ''Another Froggy Evening'', his voice was provided by [[Jeff McCarthy]].\n\nMichigan J. Frog made a cameo appearance in the ''[[New Looney Tunes]]'' episode \"Misjudgement Day\" voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]]. He appears at the end of the episode as the one who sent one of his futuristic robots to destroy Bugs Bunny, and later he appeared in the show's intro for the second season.\n\nMichigan J. Frog has a brief cameo in the beginning of the 1988 Disney/Amblin film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The character also appears on the cover illustration (drawn by Chuck Jones) of singer-songwriter [[Leon Redbone]]'s 1975 album ''[[On the Track]]''.\n\n===Years with The WB===\n[[Image:MichiganJFrog.png|left|thumb|150px|Michigan J.

Frog, again voiced by McCarthy, was the official [[mascot]] of [[The WB Television Network]] from its inception in 1995 until 2005. The network's first night of programming on January 11, 1995 began with [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Daffy Duck]] wondering which one of them would pull the switch to launch The WB. The camera then panned over to [[Chuck Jones]] drawing Michigan on an easel; when Jones finished, Michigan leapt from the drawing to formally launch The WB.\n\nMichigan also would usually appear before the opening of shows, informing the viewer of the TV rating. Before the beginning of [[Savannah (TV series)|''Savannah'']], for example, the frog would sing a short monologue suggesting that \"[t]here's more comedy for the family Wednesday nights\" and that kids should go to bed, meaning that the show coming on would be for mature audiences only. In later shows like ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and [[Angel (1999 TV series)|''Angel'']], the announcer would present a TV-PG disclaimer, though the frog still appeared as a neon sign.\n\nOn July 22, 2005, Michigan's \"death\" was announced by WB Chairman [[Garth Ancier]] at a fall season preview with the terse statement \"The frog is dead and buried.\" The head of programming for The WB, [[David Janollari]], stated that \"[Michigan] was a symbol that perpetuated the young teen feel of the network. That's not the image we [now] want to put out to our audience.\"<ref>\"[http://www.tv.com/news/michigan-j-frog-has-no-leg-to-stand-on-482/ Michigan J.

His dates were given as December 31, 1955 \u2013 July 22, 2005. Despite the announcement by Ancier, Michigan still appeared in several [[Kids' WB|Kids' WB!]] promos and bumpers (for example, a cart version of himself), The WB's metonym (\"The Frog\") until 2006, and in some WB affiliate logos and in TV spots, such as [[KARZ-TV|KWBF]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]] (whose early slogan was \"The Frog\"; the \"F\" in KWBF is supposedly for \"frog\"), during 2006, and [[WBRL-CD|WBRL-CA]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. Also, [[WMJF]], a small student-run television station at [[Towson University]] just outside [[Baltimore, Maryland]], still uses the same call letters (WMJF \u2013 Michigan J. Frog) from when the station was a WB affiliate. A neon likeness of Michigan J. Frog also adorns the facade of former WB affiliate [[WBNX-TV]]'s studio complex in [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio]].\n\nWhen The WB ceased broadcasting and signed off the air for the final time on September 17, 2006, a white silhouette of Michigan appeared at the end of a montage of stars that appeared on the network during its 11-year history. When the montage ended with \"Thank You\", Michigan's silhouette is shown removing his top hat and bowing to thank the audience for 11 years, bringing The WB to a close, and later bringing [[The CW|The CW Network]] the following day, September 18, 2006.\n\n==Songs performed==\n* \"[[Hello!
