The first event happened less than a decade before the publication of Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo works: the Invasion of Mexico or, in USA the [[Mexican- American war|Mexican\u2013American War]], after which Mexico lost a third of its territory. The second event, the [[Walker affair]], happened the same year both works were written: the decision by U.S. president [[Franklin Pierce]] to recognize the regime recently established in Nicaragua by American [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and his band of filibusters who ruled Nicaragua for nearly a year (1856\u201357) and attempted to reinstate slavery there, where it had been already abolished for three decades\n\nIn both Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo's works, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] and Walker's expedition to Nicaragua are explicitly mentioned as examples of dangers for the region.  For Bilbao, \"Latin America\" was not a geographical concept, since he excluded Brazil, Paraguay and Mexico.  Both authors also ask for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign U.S. interventions. Both rejected also European imperialism, claiming that the return of European countries to non-democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries, and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time: \"despotism.\"  Several years later, during the [[French invasion of Mexico]], Bilbao wrote another work, \"Emancipation of the Spirit in America,\" where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France, and rejected French imperialism in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their \"intellectual emancipation\" by abandoning all French ideas, claiming that France was: \"Hypocrite, because she [France] calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime; treacherous, because she speaks of freedom and nationality, when, unable to conquer freedom for herself, she enslaves others instead!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bilbao |first1=Francisco |title=Emancipaci\u00f3n del esp\u00edritu de Am\u00e9rica |url=http://www.franciscobilbao.cl/1909/article-81905.html |website=Francisco Bilbao Barqu\u00edn, 1823\u20131865, Chile|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> Therefore, as Michel Gobat puts it, the term Latin America itself had an \"anti-imperial genesis,\" and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region, or in any other place of the globe.\n\nHowever, in France the term Latin America was used with the opposite intention. It was employed by the French Empire of [[Napoleon III]] during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude [[Anglo America|Anglophone countries]]. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of the [[Second Mexican Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Chasteen |first1=John Charles |authorlink1= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fC90B5xkYyIC&lpg=PA156&pg=PP1#v=onepage |accessdate=4 July 2010 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2001 |origyear= |publisher=[[W.

Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]]), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, to a lesser extent, Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of African cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basin{{spaced ndash}}including parts of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]).\n\nThe term is not without controversy.  Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the \"allure and power\" of the idea of Latin America. He remarks at the outset, \"The idea of 'Latin America' ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory... But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed,\" going on to say, \"The term is here to stay, and it is important.\"<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''Latin America: The Allure and Power of an Idea''.

The earliest settlements in the Americas are of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas Culture]]<ref>The preceramic Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador https://www.jstor.org/pss/280325</ref> from about 8000&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE, a sedentary group from the coast of [[Ecuador]], the forefathers of the more known [[Valdivia culture]], of the same era. Some groups formed more permanent settlements such as the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] (or \"[[Muisca people|Muisca]]\" or \"Muysca\") and the [[Tairona]] groups. These groups are in the circum Caribbean region. The Chibchas of [[Colombia]], the [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]] of [[Bolivia]] were the three indigenous groups that settled most permanently.\n\nThe region was home to many [[indigenous peoples]] and advanced civilizations, including the [[Aztecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Maya Civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca]]. The [[golden age]] of the Maya began about 250, with the last two great [[civilization]]s, the Aztecs and Incas, emerging into prominence later on in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries, respectively. The Aztec empire was ultimately the most powerful civilization known throughout the Americas, until its downfall in part by the Spanish invasion.\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n{{see also|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n[[File:Desembarco de Col\u00f3n de Di\u00f3scoro Puebla.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.00|[[Romanticism|Romantic]] painting of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] arriving to the Americas (''Primer desembarco de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n en Am\u00e9rica''), by [[Di\u00f3scoro Puebla]] (1862)]]\n[[File:Jal-ixco.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|[[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] leads [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers with [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]n allies against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous warriors]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|European colonization of the Americas]].]]\n\nWith the arrival of the Europeans following [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages, the indigenous elites, such as the Incas and Aztecs, lost power to the heavy European invasion. [[Hern\u00e1ndo Cort\u00e9s]] seized the Aztec elite's power with the help of local groups who had favored the Aztec elite, and [[Francisco Pizarro]] eliminated the Incan rule in Peru. The European powers of Spain and Portugal colonized the region, which along with the rest of the uncolonized world, was divided into areas of Spanish and Portuguese control by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of demarcation]] in 1494, which gave Spain all areas to the west, and Portugal all areas to the east (the Portuguese lands in South America subsequently becoming Brazil). By the end of the sixteenth century Spain and Portugal had been joined by others, including France, in occupying large areas of North, Central and South America, ultimately extending from Alaska to the southern tips of the [[Patagonia]]. European culture, customs and government were introduced, with the Roman Catholic Church becoming the major economic and political power to overrule the traditional ways of the region, eventually becoming the only official religion of the Americas during this period.\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nEpidemics of diseases brought by the Europeans, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], wiped out a large portion of the indigenous population. Historians cannot determine the number of natives who died due to European diseases, but some put the figures as high as 85% and as low as 25%. Due to the lack of written records, specific numbers are hard to verify. Many of the survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mines. [[Miscegenation|Intermixing]] between the indigenous peoples and the European colonists was very common, and, by the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]], people of mixed ancestry ([[mestizo]]s) formed majorities in several colonies.\n\n====Slavery and forced labor in colonial Latin America====\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries.\n\nThe Mita of Colonial Latin America was a system of forced labor imposed on the natives. First established by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo (1569\u20131581), the Mita was upheld by laws that designated how large draft levies were and how much money the workers would receive that was based on how many shifts each individual worker performed. Toledo established Mitas at Potosi and Huancavelica, where the Mitayos\u2014the workers\u2014would be reduced in number to a fraction of how many were originally assigned before the 1700s. While several villages managed to resist the Mita, others offered payment to colonial administrators as a way out. In exchange, free labor became available through volunteers, though the Mita was kept in place as workers like miners, for example, were paid low wages. The Spanish Crown had not made any ruling on the Mita or approved of it when Toledo first established it in spite of the uncertainty of the practice since the Crown could have gained benefits from it. However, the cortes of Spain later abolished it in 1812 once complaints of the Mita violating humanitarian rights were made. Yet complaints also came from: governors; landowners; native leaders known as Kurakas; and even priests, each of whom preferred other methods of economic exploitation. Despite its fall, the Mita made it to the 1800s.<ref>Brown, K. W. (2008). Mita. In J. Kinsbruner & E. D. Langer (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture (2nd ed., Vol. 4, pp. 635\u2013636). Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons.</ref>\n\nAnother important group of slaves to mention were the slaves brought over from Africa. The first slaves came over with Christopher Columbus from the very beginning on his earliest voyages. However in the few hundred years, the Atlantic Slave trade would begin delivering slaves, imported by Spain and other colonizers, by the millions. Many of the large scale productions were run by forced slave labor. They were a part of sugar and coffee production, farming (beans, rice, corn, fruit, etc.), Mining, whale oil and multiple other jobs. Slaves were also house workers, servants, military soldiers, and much more. To say the least these people were property and treated as such. Though indigenous slaves existed, they were no match in quantity and lack of quality jobs when compared to the African slave. The slave population was massive compared to the better known slave ownership in the United States. After 1860 Brazil alone had imported over 4 million slaves, which only represented about 35% of the Atlantic slave trade. Despite the large number of slaves in Latin America, there was not as much reproduction of slaves amongst the population. Because most of the slaves then were African-born, they were more subject to rebellion. The United States involvement in the slave trade is well known amongst North America, however it hides a larger and in some ways crueler operation in the south which had a much longer history.{{sfnp|Meade|2016|pp=53\u201357}}\n\n===Independence (1804\u20131825)===\n{{Main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], Liberator of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Panama]]]]\n\nIn 1804, Haiti became the first Latin American nation to gain independence, following a violent slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'ouverture]] on the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]. The victors abolished slavery. Haitian independence inspired independence movements in Spanish America.\n[[File:Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.png|thumbnail|right|upright=0.70|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] was the first leader of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].]]\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese power waned on the global scene as other European powers took their place, notably Britain and France. Resentment grew among the majority of the population in Latin America over the restrictions imposed by the Spanish government, as well as the dominance of native Spaniards (Iberian-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'') in the major social and political [[institution]]s. [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808 marked a turning point, compelling [[Criollo people|Criollo]] elites to form [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] that advocated independence. Also, the newly independent [[Haiti]], the second oldest nation in the [[New World]] after the United States, further fueled the independence movement by inspiring the leaders of the movement, such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] of Mexico, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and by providing them with considerable munitions and troops.\n\nFighting soon broke out between juntas and the Spanish colonial authorities, with initial victories for the advocates of independence. Eventually, these early movements were crushed by the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist troops]] by 1810, including those of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in [[Mexico]] in the year 1810. Later on [[Francisco de Miranda]] in [[Venezuela]] by 1812. Under the leadership of a new generation of leaders, such as [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] \"The Liberator\", [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and other ''[[Libertadores]]'' in South America, the independence movement regained strength, and by 1825, all [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], except for Puerto Rico and Cuba, had gained independence from Spain. In the same year in [[Mexico]], a military officer, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], led a coalition of conservatives and liberals who created a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Iturbide as [[emperor]]. This [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, and was followed by the creation of a [[republic]] in 1823.\n\n====Independent Empire of Brazil====\n{{Main|Independence of Brazil|Empire of Brazil}}\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|Declaration of the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] by the later [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro&nbsp;I]] on September 7, 1822]]\n\nThe [[Brazilian War of Independence]], which had already begun along other independent movements around the region, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;168, 164, 178</ref> With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824,<ref name=\"Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp. 179\u2013180\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;179\u2013180</ref> Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.<ref name=\"Lustosa, p. 208\">Lustosa, p.&nbsp;208</ref>\n\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D.

''El liberalismo hispanoamericano'' en el siglo XIX. pg2</ref> Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists wanted to see a change in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes in order to promote equality.\n\nWhen liberal [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state had been better off before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government was better in the eyes of the Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. [[General Santa Anna]] was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u201348) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.\n\nIn 1837, conservative [[Rafael Carrera]] conquered [[Guatemala]] and separated from the [[Central American Union]]. The instability that followed the disintegration of the union led to the independence of the other Central American countries.\n\nIn [[Brazil]], rural aristocrats were in conflict with the urban conservatives. Portuguese control over Brazilian ports continued after Brazil's independence. Following the conservative idea that the old government was better, urbanites tended to support conservatism because more opportunities were available to them as a result of the Portuguese presence.\n\n[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] became president of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1819 after the region gained independence from Spain. He led a military-controlled state. Citizens did not like the government's position under Bol\u00edvar: The people in the military were unhappy with their roles, and the civilians were of the opinion that the military had too much power. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, New Grenada continued to have conflicts between conservatives and liberals. These conflicts were each concentrated in particular regions, with conservatives particularly in the southern mountains and the Valley of Cauca. In the mid-1840s some leaders in Caracas organized a liberal opposition. Antonio Leocadio Guzman was an active participant and journalist in this movement and gained much popularity among the people of Caracas.<ref>Halper\u00edn Donghi, T. (2013). ''Historia contempor\u00e1nea de Am\u00e9rica latina''. Madrid: Alianza.</ref>\n\nIn [[Argentina]], the conflict manifested itself as a prolonged civil war between ''[[Unitarian Party|unitarianas]]'' (i.e. ''centralists'') and ''[[Federales|federalists]]'', which were in some aspects respectively analogous to liberals and conservatives in other countries. Between 1832 and 1852, the country existed as a [[Argentine Confederation|confederation]], without a head of state, although the federalist governor of Buenos Aires province, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], was given the powers of debt payment and international relations and exerted a growing hegemony over the country. A national constitution was only enacted in 1853, reformed in 1860, and the country reorganized as a federal republic led by a [[Generation of '80|liberal-conservative elite]].<ref>Galasso, N. (2011). ''Historia de la Argentina'' (Vol. 1).</ref> After Uruguay achieved its independence, in 1828, a similar polarization crystallized between ''blancos'' and ''colorados'', where the agrarian conservative interests were pitted against the liberal commercial interests based in Montevideo, and which eventually resulted in the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'' civil war (1839\u20131851).<ref>Hudson, R., & Meditz, S.

On May 8, 1827 Baron Damas, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Sebasti\u00e1n Camacho, a Mexican diplomat, signed an agreement called \"The Declarations\" which contained provisions regarding commerce and navigation between France and Mexico.

However, the constant state of warfare left Mexico with a tremendous amount of debt owed to Spain, England, and France, all of whom funded the Mexican war effort (Neeno). As newly appointed president, Benito Ju\u00e1rez suspended payment of debts for next two years, to focus on a rebuilding and stabilization initiative in Mexico under the new government. On December 8, 1861, Spain, England and France landed in Veracruz in order to seize unpaid debts from Mexico. However, Napoleon III, with intentions of establishing a French client state to further push his economic interests, pressured the other two powers to withdraw in 1862 (Greenspan; \"French Intervention in Mexico\u2026\").\n[[File:Batalla de Puebla.png|upright=0.80|thumb|right|Painting depicting the [[Battle of Puebla]] in 1862]]\nFrance under Napoleon III remained and established Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=French Intervention in Mexico and the American Civil War, 1862\u20131867|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/french-intervention |website=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian}}</ref> The march by the French to Mexico City enticed heavy resistance by the Mexican government, it resulted in open warfare. The Battle of Puebla in 1862 in particular presented an important turning point in which Ignacio Zaragoza led the Mexican army to victory as they pushed back the French offensive (\"Timeline of the Mexican Revolution\"). The victory came to symbolize Mexico's power and national resolve against foreign occupancy and as a result delayed France's later attack on Mexico City for an entire year (Cinco de Mayo (Mexican History)). With heavy resistance by Mexican rebels and the fear of United States intervention against France, forced Napoleon III to withdraw from Mexico, leaving Maximilian to surrender, where he would be later executed by Mexican troops under the rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ridge Jr.|first1=Michael Allen|title=A country in need of American instruction : The U.S. mission to shape and transform Mexico, 1848\u20131911|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3321&context=etd|website=Iowa Research Online|publisher=University of Iowa}}</ref> Napoleon III's desire to expand France's economic empire influenced the decision to seize territorial domain over the Central American region. The port city of Veracruz, Mexico and France's desire to construct a new canal were of particular interest. Bridging both New World and East Asian trade routes to the Atlantic were key to Napoleon III's economic goals to the mining of precious rocks and the expansion of France's textile industry. Napoleon's fear of the United States' economic influence over the Pacific trade region, and in turn all New World economic activity, pushed France to intervene in Mexico under the pretense of collecting on Mexico's debt. Eventually France began plans to build the Panama Canal in 1881 until 1904 when the United States took over and proceeded with its construction and implementation (\"Read Our Story\").\n\n===American involvement in Latin America during the 19th century===\n\n====Monroe Doctrine====\n[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]]]]\nThe [[Monroe Doctrine]] was included in President [[James Monroe]]'s 1823 annual message to Congress. The doctrine warns European nations that the United States will no longer tolerate any new colonization of Latin American countries. It was originally drafted to meet the present major concerns, but eventually became the precept of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The doctrine was put into effect in 1865 when the U.S. government supported Mexican president, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], diplomatically and militarily. Some Latin American countries viewed the U.S. interventions, allowed by the Monroe Doctrine when the U.S. deems necessary, with suspicion.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. pg 491</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of United States involvement in Latin America is the case of the [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. In 1855, he traveled to Nicaragua hoping to overthrow the government and take the land for the United States. With only the aid of 56 followers, he was able to take over the city of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], declaring himself commander of the army and installing [[Patricio Rivas]] as a puppet president. However, Rivas's presidency ended when he fled Nicaragua; Walker rigged the following election to ensure that he became the next president. His presidency did not last long, however, as he was met with much opposition from political groups in Nicaragua and neighbouring countries. On May 1, 1857, Walker was forced by a coalition of Central American armies to surrender himself to a United States Navy officer who repatriated him and his followers. When Walker subsequently returned to Central America in 1860, he was apprehended by the Honduran authorities and executed.\n\n====Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348)====\n[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|left|American occupation of [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War]], another instance of U.S. involvement in Latin America, was a war between the United States and Mexico that started in April 1846 and lasted until February 1848. The main cause of the war was the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845 and a dispute afterwards about whether the border between Mexico and the United States ended where Mexico claimed, at the [[Nueces River]], or ended where the United States claimed, at the [[Rio Grande]]. Peace was negotiated between the United States and Mexico with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which stated that Mexico was to cede land which would later become part of California and New Mexico as well as give up all claims to Texas, for which the United States would pay $15,000,000. However, tensions between the two countries were still high and over the next six years things only got worse with raids along the border and attacks by Native Americans against Mexican citizens. To defuse the situation, the United States agreed to purchase 29,670 squares miles of land from Mexico for $10,000,000 so a southern railroad could be built to connect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This would become known as the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. A critical component of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs took form in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which drastically affected the futures of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Americas, as well as Guam and the Philippines, by dismantling some of the last remaining Spanish colonial possessions throughout the world.\n\n==From the \"Big Stick\" to the \"Good Neighbor\" policy==\n[[File:Satterfield cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield]] cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic]]\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the U.S. banana importing companies [[United Fruit Company]], [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] (both ancestors of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]]), and [[Standard Fruit Company]] (now [[Dole Food Company|Dole]]), acquired large amounts of land in Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. The companies gained leverage over the governments and a ruling elite in these countries by dominating their economies and paying kickbacks, and exploited local workers.

The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. The revelation of the contents outraged the American public and swayed public opinion. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] moved to arm American merchant ships in order to defend themselves against German submarines, which had started to attack them. The news helped generate support for the [[American entry into World War I|United States declaration of war on Germany]] in April of that year.<ref>[[#Andrew|Andrew]], p.&nbsp;42.</ref>\n\nThe message came as a [[code (cryptography)|coded]] telegram dispatched by the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], on January 16, 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador of Mexico, [[Heinrich von Eckardt]]. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the [[Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I#1917: Renewed \"unrestricted\" campaign|resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany on 1 February, an act which Germany presumed would lead to war. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the U.S. appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for a military alliance, with funding from Germany. As part of the alliance, Germany would assist Mexico in reconquering Texas and the Southwest. Eckardt was instructed to urge Mexico to help broker an alliance between Germany and Japan. Mexico, in the middle of the [[Mexican Revolution]], far weaker militarily, economically and politically than the U.S., ignored the proposal; after the U.S. entered the war, it officially rejected it.\n\n====Brazil's participation in World War II====\nAfter World War I, in which Brazil was an ally of the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[France]], the country realized it needed a more capable army but did not have the technology to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil. They tried to assist the army by bringing them up to the European military standard but constant civil missions did not prepare them for [[World War II]].\n\nBrazil's President, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], wanted to industrialize Brazil, allowing it to be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces. It was recently found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Secret Files Reveal 9,000 Nazi War Criminals Fled to South America after WWII|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117093/Secret-files-reveal-9-000-Nazi-war-criminals-fled-South-America-WWII.html|newspaper=Mail Online|accessdate=24 May 2012|location=London|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=2012-03-19}}</ref> It was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its F\u00fchrer. He even let German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil.\nThis alliance with Germany became Brazil's second best trade alliance behind the United States.\n\n[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian soldiers greet Italian civilians in the city of [[Massarosa]], September 1944. Brazil was the only independent Latin American country to send ground troops to fight in WWII.]]\n\nBrazil continued to try to remain neutral to the United States and Germany because it was trying to make sure it could continue to be a place of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually, Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.\n\nOnce the German submarines attacked unarmed Brazilian trading ships, President Vargas met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss how they could retaliate. On January 22, 1942, Brazil officially ended all relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy, becoming a part of the Allies.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] was sent to Naples, Italy to fight for democracy. Brazil was the only Latin American country to send troops to Europe. Initially, Brazil wanted to only provide resources and shelter for the war to have a chance of gaining a high postwar status but ended up sending 25,000 men to fight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penteado|first=Carlos Joes A.|title=Hyper War: The Brazilian Participation in World War II|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Brazil/Participation/index.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the United States and Latin America continued to have a close relationship.

BBC News. 24 January 2008.</ref>]]\n\nThe Great Depression caused Latin America to grow at a slow rate, separating it from leading industrial democracies. The two world wars and U.S. Depression also made Latin American countries favor internal economic development, leading Latin America to adopt the policy of [[import substitution industrialization]].<ref name=\"History of Latin America\">{{cite web|title=History of Latin America|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Countries also renewed emphasis on exports. Brazil began selling automobiles to other countries, and some Latin American countries set up plants to assemble imported parts, letting other countries take advantage of Latin America's low labor costs. Colombia began to export flowers, emeralds and coffee grains and gold, becoming the world's second-leading flower exporter.\n\nEconomic integration was called for, to attain economies that could compete with the economies of the United States or Europe. Starting in the 1960s with the Latin American Free Trade Association and Central American Common Market, Latin American countries worked toward economic integration.\n\nIn efforts to help regain global economic strength, the U.S. began to heavily assist countries involved in World War II at the expense of Latin America. Markets that were previously unopposed as a result of the war in Latin America grew stagnant as the rest of the world no longer needed their goods.\n\n====Reforms====\nLarge countries like Argentina called for reforms to lessen the disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor, which has been a long problem in Latin America that stunted economic growth.<ref name=\"Kaufman\">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Robert|title=The Political Effects of Inequality: Some Inconvenient Facts|publisher=Rutgers University}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in public health caused an explosion of population growth, making it difficult to provide social services. Education expanded, and social security systems introduced, but benefits usually went to the middle class, not the poor. As a result, the disparity of wealth increased. Increasing inflation and other factors caused countries to be unwilling to fund social development programs to help the poor.\n\n====Bureaucratic authoritarianism====\nBureaucratic authoritarianism was practised in Brazil after 1964, in Argentina, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet, in a response to harsh economic conditions. It rested on the conviction that no democracy could take the harsh measures to curb inflation, reassure investors, and quicken economic growth quickly and effectively. Though inflation fell sharply, industrial production dropped with the decline of official protection.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\n====US relations====\n{{see also|Latin America\u2013United States relations|Foreign interventions by the United States|United States involvement in regime change in Latin America}}\n[[File:Reuni\u00f3n Pinochet - Kissinger.jpg|thumb|Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] shaking hands with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1976]]\nAfter [[World War II]] and the beginning of a [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], US diplomats became interested in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and Latin America, and frequently{{vague|date=June 2014}} waged proxy wars against the Soviet Union in these countries.

The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, and combined with Castro's expropriation of private enterprises, this was detrimental to the Cuban economy.<ref name=\"History of Latin America\" /> Around Latin America, rural guerrilla conflict and urban terrorism increased, inspired by the Cuban example. The United States put down these rebellions by supporting Latin American countries in their counter-guerrilla operations through the Alliance for Progress launched by President John F. Kennedy. This thrust appeared to be successful. A Marxist, Salvador Allende, became president of Chile in 1970, but was overthrown three years later in a military coup backed by the United States. Despite civil war, high crime and political instability, most Latin American countries eventually adopted bourgeois liberal democracies while Cuba maintained its socialist system.\n\n====Bay of Pigs Invasion====\n{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}\n\n[[Image:Attack near Playa Giron.

The incident proved to be very embarrassing for the new Kennedy administration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of the invasion led to a [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet-Cuban alliance]].\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\n{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}\nIn 1962, Cuba threatened the USA when it allowed Soviet missiles to be placed on the island, just 90 miles away from Florida; Cuba saw it as a way to defend the island, while the Americans saw it as a threat. The ensuing Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014the closest the world has ever come to total annihilation\u2014almost saw a US invasion or bombing of Cuba, but it ended when the two sides agreed on the removal of missiles; the US removed theirs from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets removed theirs from Cuba. The crisis' end left Cuba blockaded by the US, which was also obligated to not invade Cuba. In fact, they were allowed to keep [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] as a naval base as per an agreement with the previous government of Batista.\n\n====Alliance for Progress====\nPresident John F. Kennedy initiated the [[Alliance for Progress]] in 1961, to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The Alliance would provide $20 billion for reform in Latin America, and counterinsurgency measures.

The era of Somoza family rule was characterized by strong U.S. support for the government and its military as well as a heavy reliance on U.S.-based multi-national corporations. The Nicaraguan Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n Nicarag\u00fcense or Revoluci\u00f3n Popular Sandinista) encompassed the rising opposition to the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the campaign led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) to violently oust the dictatorship in 1978\u201379, the subsequent efforts of the FSLN to govern Nicaragua from 1979 until 1990 and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] which was waged between the FSLN and the [[Contras]] from 1981\u20131990.\n\nThe Revolution marked a significant period in Nicaraguan history and revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War with the events in the country rising to international attention. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978\u201379 was a bloody affair, the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. A history of Latin America. pg541-542</ref> During the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received large amounts of aid from the Cold War super-powers (respectively, the Soviet Union and the United States).\n\n===Washington Consensus===\n{{Main|Washington Consensus}}\n{{See also|Free Trade Area of the Americas}}\n[[File:Ship passing through Panama Canal 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roll-on/roll-off]]\nships, such as this one pictured here at [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores locks]], are among the largest ships to pass through the [[Panama Canal]].

(Other Latin countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru, have in practice adopted the bulk of the policies.) Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the \"fundamentalist\" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a \"one size fits all\" treatment of individual economies.\n\nThe term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.\n\nThis politico-economical initiative was institutionalized in North America by 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], and elsewhere in the Americas through a series of [[Free Trade Area of the Americas#Agreements|like agreements]].

A development of this has been the creation of the eight-member ALBA alliance, or \"[[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]]\" (Spanish: ''Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra Am\u00e9rica'') by some of the countries already mentioned.

A \"reversal of development\" reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Escobar|editor-first=Arturo|editor-first2=Sonia E.|editor-last2=Alvarez|title=The Making of Social Movements in Latin America|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview|date=1992}}</ref> Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social security, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and [[Informal sector|informalization]] of labor.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> In an effort to bring more investors to these industries, these governments also embraced [[globalization]] through more open interactions with the international economy.\n\nSignificantly, as democracy spread across much of Latin America, the realm of government became more inclusive (a trend that proved conducive to social movements), the economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward while denying political responsibility to provide social welfare rights, and though [[Development studies|development]] projects took place throughout the region, both inequality and poverty increased.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> Feeling excluded from these new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.\n\nBoth urban and rural populations had serious grievances as a result of the above economic and global trends and have voiced them in mass demonstrations. Some of the largest and most violent of these have been protests against cuts in urban services, such as the [[Caracazo]] in Venezuela and the [[Argentinazo]] in Argentina.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\">Johnston, Hank, and Paul Almeida, eds.

These movements have benefited considerably from transnational support from conservationists and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]]. The [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movement of Rural Landless Workers]] (MST) is perhaps the largest contemporary Latin American social movement.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> As indigenous populations are primarily rural, indigenous movements account for a large portion of rural social movements, including the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista rebellion]] in Mexico, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador|CONAIE]]), indigenous organizations in the Amazon region of Ecuador and Bolivia, pan-Mayan communities in Guatemala, and mobilization by the indigenous groups of [[Yanomami]] peoples in the Amazon, [[Guna people|Kuna]] peoples in Panama, and Altiplano [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples in Bolivia.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> Other significant types of social movements include labor struggles and strikes, such as [[recovered factories]] in Argentina, as well as gender-based movements such as the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina and protests against [[maquila]] production, which is largely a women's issue because of how it draws on women for cheap labor.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" />\n\n===Modern era===\nThe [[2000s commodities boom]] caused positive effects for many Latin American economies.

In the Spanish and Portuguese empires, racial mixing or miscegenation was the norm and something that the Spanish and Portuguese had grown rather accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans in the Iberian peninsula. But, demographics may have made this inevitable as well. Thus, for example, of the approximately 13.5 million people who lived in the Spanish colonies in 1800 before independence only about one fifth were white. This contrasts with the U.S., where more than four fifths were whites (out of a population of 5.3 million in 1801, 900,000 were slaves, plus approximately 60,000 free blacks). ...\n\nThe fact of the recognition of a racial continuum in Hispanic American (sic) does not mean that there wasn't discrimination, which there was, or that there wasn't an obsession with race, or 'castes', as they were sometimes called. ...\n\nIn areas with large indigenous Amerindian populations, a racial mixture resulted, which is known in Spanish as ''mestizos'' ... who are a majority in Mexico, Central America and most of South America. Similarly, when African slaves were brought to the Caribbean region and Brazil, where there was very little indigenous presence left, unions between them and Spanish produced a population of mixed ''mulatos'' ... who are a majority of the population in many of those Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela). \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/race.htm|title=Hispanics and Race|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nAske has also written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Spanish colonization was rather different from later English, or British, colonization of North America. They had different '''systems of colonization''' and different methods of subjugation. While the English were primarily interested in grabbing land, the Spanish in addition had a mandate to incorporate the land's inhabitants into their society, something which was achieved by religious conversion and sexual unions which produced a new 'race' of ''mestizos'', a mixture of Europeans and indigenous peoples. ''mestizos'' (sic) form the majority of the population in Mexico, Central America, and much of South America. Racial mixing or miscegenation, after all, was something that the Spanish and Portuguese had been accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans.\n\nSimilarly, later on, when African slaves were introduced into the Caribbean basin region, unions between them and Spaniards produced a population of ''mulatos'', who are a majority of the population in the Caribbean islands (the Antilles) (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico), as well as other areas of the Caribbean region (Colombia, Venezuela and parts of the Central American Caribbean coast). ''mestizos'' (sic) and ''mulatos'' may not have always have been first class citizens in their countries, but they were never disowned in the way the outcomes of unions of Europeans and Native Americans were in the British colonies, where interracial marriages were taboo and one drop of Black or Amerindian blood was enough to make the person 'impure'. \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/history.htm|title=Some historical background|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nIn his famous 1963 book ''[[The Rise of the West]]'', [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Racially mixed societies arose in most of Spanish and Portuguese America, compounded in varying proportions from European, Indian, and Negro strands. Fairly frequent resort to manumission mitigated the hardships of slavery in those areas; and the Catholic church positively encouraged marriages between white immigrants and Indian women as a remedy for sexual immorality. However, in the southern English colonies and in most of the Caribbean islands, the importation of Negro slaves created a much more sharply polarized biracial society. Strong race feeling and the servile status of nearly all Negroes interdicted intermarriage, practically if not legally. Such discrimination did not prevent interbreeding; but children of mixed parentage were assigned to the status of their mothers. Mulattoes and Indian half-breeds were thereby excluded from the white community. In Spanish (and, with some differences, Portuguese) territories a more elaborate and less oppressive principle of racial discrimination established itself. The handful of persons who had been born in the homelands claimed topmost social prestige; next came those of purely European descent; while beneath ranged the various racial blends to form a social pyramid whose numerous racial distinctions meant that no one barrier could become as ugly and inpenetrable as that dividing whites from Negroes in the English, Dutch, and French colonies.\n}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community|last=McNeill|first=William H.|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}, p. 603</ref>\n\nThomas C. Wright, meanwhile, has written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The demographic makeup of colonial Latin America became more complex when, as the native population declined, the Portuguese, Spanish, and the French in Haiti turned to Africa for labor, as did the British in North America. The tricontinental heritage that characterizes Latin America, then, is shared by the United States, but even a casual examination reveals that the outcome of the complex interaction of different peoples has varied. While miscegenation among the three races certainly occurred in North America, it appears to have been much less common than in Latin America. Furthermore, offspring of such liaisons were not recognized as belonging to new, distinct racial categories in North America as they were in Latin America. The terms mestizo or ''mameluco'', mulatto, the general term ''castas'', and dozens of subcategories of racial identity frankly recognized the outcomes of interracial sexual activity in Latin America and established a continuum of race rather than the unrealistic absolute categories of white, black, or Indian as used in the United States.

Spanish in green, Portuguese in orange, and French in blue.]]\n\n[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the predominant language of Latin America. It is spoken as first language by about 60% of the population. Portuguese is spoken by about 34%, and about 6% speak other languages such as Quechua, [[Mayan languages]], Guaran\u00ed, Aymara, Nahuatl, English, French, Dutch and Italian. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]), the biggest and most populous country in the region. Spanish is the official language of most of the rest of the countries and territories on the Latin American mainland ([[Spanish language in the Americas]]), as well as in [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (where it is co-official with English), and the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[French language|French]] is spoken in [[Haiti]] and in the French [[overseas department]]s of [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[French Guiana|Guiana]], and the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]; it is also spoken by some Panamanians of Afro-Antillean descent. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language in [[Suriname]], [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. (As Dutch is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], these territories are not necessarily considered part of Latin America.) However, the native language of Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and Cura\u00e7ao, is [[Papiamento]], a creole language largely based on Portuguese and Spanish and has a considerable influence coming from the Dutch language and [[Portuguese-based creole languages]].\n\n[[File:Map-Most Widely Spoken Native Languages in Latin America.png|thumb|'''{{color|blue|Quechua}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#f9dc38|Guaran\u00ed}}}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#ff9922|Aymara}}}}''', '''{{color|#cc0000|N\u00e1huatl}}''', '''{{color|#006600|Lenguas Mayas}}''', '''Mapudungun''']]\n\n[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] are widely spoken in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Mexico]], and to a lesser degree, in [[Panama]], [[Ecuador]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] amongst other countries. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non-existent (e.g. [[Uruguay]]). Mexico is possibly the only country that contains a wider variety of indigenous languages than any Latin American country, but the most spoken language is Nahuatl.\n\nIn [[Peru]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In [[Ecuador]], while holding no official status, the closely related [[Quichua]] is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], Quechua and Guaran\u00ed hold official status alongside Spanish. [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], along with Spanish, is an official language of [[Paraguay]], and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Corrientes]]. In [[Nicaragua]], Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo languages|Sumo]], and [[Rama language|Rama]] also hold official status. [[Colombia]] recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. [[Nahuatl]] is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as \"national languages\" along with Spanish.\n\nOther European languages spoken in Latin America include: [[English language|English]], by some groups in [[Puerto Rico]], as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, like [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]], and spoken by descendants of British settlers in Argentina & Chile; [[German language|German]], in southern [[Brazil]], southern [[Chile]], portions of [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Paraguay]]; [[Italian language|Italian]], in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and [[Uruguay]]; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] in southern Brazil and Argentina; and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], in southern Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1163503 |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stclassargentina.com/tours/WelshImmigration.html|title=The Welsh Immigration to Argentina|work=1stclassargentina.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Howat |url=http://www.argbrit.org/Patagonia/patagonia_entry.htm |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Argbrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.patagonline.com/patagonia/destacados/peninsula-valdes/gaiman-trelew |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Patagonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andesceltig.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Andesceltig.com |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917174822/http://andesceltig.com/ |archive-date=2017-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glaniad.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Glaniad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808130811/http://www.glaniad.com/ |archive-date=2016-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are possible to be heard around Buenos Aires and S\u00e3o Paulo especially.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html#4 |title=Brazil \u2013 Modern-Day Community |publisher=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref> Non-European or Asian languages include [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay, [[Korean language|Korean]] in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] throughout South America.\n\nIn several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, [[creole languages]] are spoken.

A report released in 2013 by the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] entitled ''Inequality Matters.

Minor blocs or trade agreements are the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Dominican Republic \u2013 Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA), the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and the [[Andean Community of Nations]] (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise.

It is the product of many diverse influences:\n\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to European Colonization. Ancient and very advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The [[Maya civilization|Mayas]], the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca civilization|Incas]] are examples of these. Indigenous legacies in music, dance, foods, arts and crafts, clothing, folk culture and traditions are very strong in Latin America. Linguistic effects on [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are also marked, such as in terms like [[pampa]], [[taco]], [[tamale]], [[cacique]].\n* [[Western culture|Western civilization]], in particular the [[culture of Europe]], was brought mainly by the colonial powers{{spaced ndash}}the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[French people|French]]{{spaced ndash}}between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most enduring European colonial influence is language and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. More recently, additional cultural influences came from the United States and Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, due to the growing influence of the former on the world stage and immigration from the latter. The influence of the United States is particularly strong in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is an American territory. Prior to 1959, Cuba, who fought for its independence along American soldiers in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], was also known to have a close socioeconomic relation with the United States. In addition, the United States also helped Panama become an independent state from Colombia and built the twenty-mile-long [[Panama Canal Zone]] in Panama which held from 1903 (the [[Panama Canal]] opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914) to 1999, when the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone. South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Russians, Croatians, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews. With the end of colonialism, [[Culture of France|French culture]] was also able to exert a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of [[high culture]], science and medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stepan|first=Nancy Leys |title=\"The Hour of Eugenics\": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |location=Ithaca |pages=in passim |nopp=true |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NuUxkMC1ePYC |isbn=978-0-8014-9795-7}}</ref> This can be seen in any expression of the region's artistic traditions, including painting, literature and music, and in the realms of science and politics. \nDue to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution, a certain number of Iberian-American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas in 1791. Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned any reference to state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the 19th century were Dominican Republic (1822), Brazil (1824), Peru (1836), Mexico (1871), Paraguay (1880), Argentina (1887), Honduras (1899), Guatemala and El Salvador. Today same-sex marriage is legal in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Uruguay, and French overseas departments, as well as in several states of Mexico. Civil unions can be held in Chile.\n\n* [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], whose presence derives from a long history of [[Atlantic slave trade|New World slavery]]. Peoples of African descent have influenced the ethno-scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean.

But also from Japanese and Korean immigration especially headed to Brazil. This has largely effected the cuisine, traditions including literature, art and lifestyles and politics.

In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.\n\n[[File:Santiago Martinez Delgado in the colombian congress.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] in the [[Colombian Congress]]]]\n\nFrom the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Barreiro |first=Gabriel|date=December 1994|title=Constructivism in Latin America |journal=University of Essex Collection of Latin American Art|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America.

Historically, the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba.  Latin American film flourished after sound was introduced in cinema, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border.<ref>Paul A. Schroeder Rodriguez. ''Latin American Cinema: A Comparative History'' (University of California Press; 2016) studies 50 films since the silent era.</ref>\n[[File:Alejandro Inarritu Cannes 2017.jpg|right|upright|thumb|In 2015, [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] became the second Mexican director in a row to win both the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]] and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] for Best Director. He won his second [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2016 for ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]''.]]\n\n[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] started out in the silent era from 1896 to 1929 and flourished in the [[Golden age of the cinema of Mexico|Golden Era]] of the 1940s. It boasted a huge industry comparable to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time with stars such as [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Pedro Infante]]. In the 1970s, <!-- and 1970s --> Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu directed in 2010 ''[[Biutiful]]'' and [[Birdman (film)|''Birdman'']] (2014), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n directed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013).  Close friend of both, [[Guillermo del Toro]], a top rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006) and produced ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|El Orfanato]]'' (2007). [[Carlos Carrera]] (''[[The Crime of Father Amaro (film)|The Crime of Father Amaro]])'', and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are also some of the most known present-day Mexican film makers. ''[[Rudo y Cursi]]'' released in December (2008) in Mexico was directed by [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]].\n[[File:Cristina, elenco y Oscar.jpg|left|thumb|President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] with the film director [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella]] and the cast of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009) with the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film]]]]\n\n[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] has also been prominenent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|1976\u20131983 military dictatorship]]; but re-emerged to produce the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[The Official Story]]'' in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including ''[[Nueve reinas]]'' (2000), ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (2001), ''[[El abrazo partido]]'' (2004), ''[[El otro]]'' (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[El secreto de sus ojos]]'' and ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (2014).\n\n[[Cinema of Brazil|In Brazil]], the ''[[Cinema Novo]]'' movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States, with movies such as ''[[Central do Brasil (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' (1999), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|Cidade de Deus]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (2007).\n\n[[Cinema of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican cinema]] has produced some notable films, such as ''[[Una Aventura Llamada Menudo]]'', ''[[Los Diaz de Doris]]'' and ''[[Casi Casi]]''. An influx of Hollywood films affected the local film industry in Puerto Rico during the 1980s and 1990s, but several Puerto Rican films have been produced since and it has been recovering.\n\n[[Cinema of Cuba|Cuban cinema]] has enjoyed much official support since the [[Cuban revolution]] and important film-makers include [[Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Latin American literature}}\n{{See also|List of Latin American writers}}\n\n[[File:Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1772).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] in 1772 by Andr\u00e9s de Islas]]\nPre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate [[Aztec codices|codices]]. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the [[Popol Vuh]]. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking population of Peru and the [[K'iche' people|Quich\u00e9 (K'iche')]] of Guatemala.\n\nFrom the very moment of Europe's discovery of the continents, early explorers and [[conquistadores]] produced written accounts and cr\u00f3nicas of their experience{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s letters or [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]]'s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's ''[[El Periquillo Sarniento]]'' (1816).\n\nThe 19th century was a period of \"foundational fictions\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \"civilization or barbarism\" (for which see, say, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Domingo Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), [[Juan Le\u00f3n Mera]]'s ''Cumand\u00e1'' (1879), or [[Euclides da Cunha]]'s ''[[Os Sert\u00f5es]]'' (1902)). The 19th century also witnessed the realist work of [[Machado de Assis]], who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction, much admired by critic [[Harold Bloom]].\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, ''[[modernismo]]'' emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]]'s ''Azul'' (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]], for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.\n[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Chilean poet [[Gabriela Mistral]], first Latin American to win a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in 1945]]\n[[File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Argentine [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in [[L'H\u00f4tel]], [[Paris]] in 1969]]\n\nHowever, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien a\u00f1os de soledad]]'' (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''Yo, el supremo'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.\n\nContemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Mench\u00fa]]. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]] and Pedro Lemebel.\n\nThe region boasts six [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize winners]]: in addition to the two Chilean poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945) and [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), there is also the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel Angel Asturias]] (1967), the Colombian writer [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (1982),  the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990), and the Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (2010).\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{See also|Music of Latin America|Latin pop|Latin dance}}\n[[File:Salsa en Cali.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] dancing in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]]]\n\nLatin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales.

Both authors also ask for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign U.S. interventions. Both rejected also European imperialism, claiming that the return of European countries to non-democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries, and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time: \"despotism.\"  Several years later, during the [[French invasion of Mexico]], Bilbao wrote another work, \"Emancipation of the Spirit in America,\" where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France, and rejected French imperialism in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their \"intellectual emancipation\" by abandoning all French ideas, claiming that France was: \"Hypocrite, because she [France] calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime; treacherous, because she speaks of freedom and nationality, when, unable to conquer freedom for herself, she enslaves others instead!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bilbao |first1=Francisco |title=Emancipaci\u00f3n del esp\u00edritu de Am\u00e9rica |url=http://www.franciscobilbao.cl/1909/article-81905.html |website=Francisco Bilbao Barqu\u00edn, 1823\u20131865, Chile|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> Therefore, as Michel Gobat puts it, the term Latin America itself had an \"anti-imperial genesis,\" and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region, or in any other place of the globe.\n\nHowever, in France the term Latin America was used with the opposite intention. It was employed by the French Empire of [[Napoleon III]] during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude [[Anglo America|Anglophone countries]]. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of the [[Second Mexican Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Chasteen |first1=John Charles |authorlink1= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fC90B5xkYyIC&lpg=PA156&pg=PP1#v=onepage |accessdate=4 July 2010 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2001 |origyear= |publisher=[[W.

Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]]), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, to a lesser extent, Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of African cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basin{{spaced ndash}}including parts of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]).\n\nThe term is not without controversy.  Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the \"allure and power\" of the idea of Latin America. He remarks at the outset, \"The idea of 'Latin America' ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory... But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed,\" going on to say, \"The term is here to stay, and it is important.\"<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''Latin America: The Allure and Power of an Idea''.

3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Maya Civilization|Mayan]] archeological site [[Chichen Itza]]. ]]\n\nThe earliest known settlement was identified at [[Monte Verde]], near [[Puerto Montt]] in Southern Chile. Its occupation dates to some 14,000 years ago and there is some disputed evidence of even earlier occupation. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the continents. By the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people. The earliest settlements in the Americas are of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas Culture]]<ref>The preceramic Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador https://www.jstor.org/pss/280325</ref> from about 8000&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE, a sedentary group from the coast of [[Ecuador]], the forefathers of the more known [[Valdivia culture]], of the same era. Some groups formed more permanent settlements such as the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] (or \"[[Muisca people|Muisca]]\" or \"Muysca\") and the [[Tairona]] groups. These groups are in the circum Caribbean region. The Chibchas of [[Colombia]], the [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]] of [[Bolivia]] were the three indigenous groups that settled most permanently.\n\nThe region was home to many [[indigenous peoples]] and advanced civilizations, including the [[Aztecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Maya Civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca]]. The [[golden age]] of the Maya began about 250, with the last two great [[civilization]]s, the Aztecs and Incas, emerging into prominence later on in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries, respectively. The Aztec empire was ultimately the most powerful civilization known throughout the Americas, until its downfall in part by the Spanish invasion.\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n{{see also|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n[[File:Desembarco de Col\u00f3n de Di\u00f3scoro Puebla.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.00|[[Romanticism|Romantic]] painting of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] arriving to the Americas (''Primer desembarco de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n en Am\u00e9rica''), by [[Di\u00f3scoro Puebla]] (1862)]]\n[[File:Jal-ixco.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|[[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] leads [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers with [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]n allies against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous warriors]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|European colonization of the Americas]].]]\n\nWith the arrival of the Europeans following [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages, the indigenous elites, such as the Incas and Aztecs, lost power to the heavy European invasion. [[Hern\u00e1ndo Cort\u00e9s]] seized the Aztec elite's power with the help of local groups who had favored the Aztec elite, and [[Francisco Pizarro]] eliminated the Incan rule in Peru. The European powers of Spain and Portugal colonized the region, which along with the rest of the uncolonized world, was divided into areas of Spanish and Portuguese control by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of demarcation]] in 1494, which gave Spain all areas to the west, and Portugal all areas to the east (the Portuguese lands in South America subsequently becoming Brazil). By the end of the sixteenth century Spain and Portugal had been joined by others, including France, in occupying large areas of North, Central and South America, ultimately extending from Alaska to the southern tips of the [[Patagonia]]. European culture, customs and government were introduced, with the Roman Catholic Church becoming the major economic and political power to overrule the traditional ways of the region, eventually becoming the only official religion of the Americas during this period.\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nEpidemics of diseases brought by the Europeans, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], wiped out a large portion of the indigenous population. Historians cannot determine the number of natives who died due to European diseases, but some put the figures as high as 85% and as low as 25%. Due to the lack of written records, specific numbers are hard to verify. Many of the survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mines. [[Miscegenation|Intermixing]] between the indigenous peoples and the European colonists was very common, and, by the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]], people of mixed ancestry ([[mestizo]]s) formed majorities in several colonies.\n\n====Slavery and forced labor in colonial Latin America====\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries.\n\nThe Mita of Colonial Latin America was a system of forced labor imposed on the natives. First established by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo (1569\u20131581), the Mita was upheld by laws that designated how large draft levies were and how much money the workers would receive that was based on how many shifts each individual worker performed. Toledo established Mitas at Potosi and Huancavelica, where the Mitayos\u2014the workers\u2014would be reduced in number to a fraction of how many were originally assigned before the 1700s. While several villages managed to resist the Mita, others offered payment to colonial administrators as a way out. In exchange, free labor became available through volunteers, though the Mita was kept in place as workers like miners, for example, were paid low wages. The Spanish Crown had not made any ruling on the Mita or approved of it when Toledo first established it in spite of the uncertainty of the practice since the Crown could have gained benefits from it. However, the cortes of Spain later abolished it in 1812 once complaints of the Mita violating humanitarian rights were made. Yet complaints also came from: governors; landowners; native leaders known as Kurakas; and even priests, each of whom preferred other methods of economic exploitation. Despite its fall, the Mita made it to the 1800s.<ref>Brown, K. W. (2008). Mita. In J. Kinsbruner & E. D. Langer (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture (2nd ed., Vol. 4, pp. 635\u2013636). Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons.</ref>\n\nAnother important group of slaves to mention were the slaves brought over from Africa. The first slaves came over with Christopher Columbus from the very beginning on his earliest voyages. However in the few hundred years, the Atlantic Slave trade would begin delivering slaves, imported by Spain and other colonizers, by the millions. Many of the large scale productions were run by forced slave labor. They were a part of sugar and coffee production, farming (beans, rice, corn, fruit, etc.), Mining, whale oil and multiple other jobs. Slaves were also house workers, servants, military soldiers, and much more. To say the least these people were property and treated as such. Though indigenous slaves existed, they were no match in quantity and lack of quality jobs when compared to the African slave. The slave population was massive compared to the better known slave ownership in the United States. After 1860 Brazil alone had imported over 4 million slaves, which only represented about 35% of the Atlantic slave trade. Despite the large number of slaves in Latin America, there was not as much reproduction of slaves amongst the population. Because most of the slaves then were African-born, they were more subject to rebellion. The United States involvement in the slave trade is well known amongst North America, however it hides a larger and in some ways crueler operation in the south which had a much longer history.{{sfnp|Meade|2016|pp=53\u201357}}\n\n===Independence (1804\u20131825)===\n{{Main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], Liberator of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Panama]]]]\n\nIn 1804, Haiti became the first Latin American nation to gain independence, following a violent slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'ouverture]] on the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]. The victors abolished slavery. Haitian independence inspired independence movements in Spanish America.\n[[File:Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.png|thumbnail|right|upright=0.70|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] was the first leader of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].]]\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese power waned on the global scene as other European powers took their place, notably Britain and France. Resentment grew among the majority of the population in Latin America over the restrictions imposed by the Spanish government, as well as the dominance of native Spaniards (Iberian-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'') in the major social and political [[institution]]s. [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808 marked a turning point, compelling [[Criollo people|Criollo]] elites to form [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] that advocated independence. Also, the newly independent [[Haiti]], the second oldest nation in the [[New World]] after the United States, further fueled the independence movement by inspiring the leaders of the movement, such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] of Mexico, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and by providing them with considerable munitions and troops.\n\nFighting soon broke out between juntas and the Spanish colonial authorities, with initial victories for the advocates of independence. Eventually, these early movements were crushed by the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist troops]] by 1810, including those of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in [[Mexico]] in the year 1810. Later on [[Francisco de Miranda]] in [[Venezuela]] by 1812. Under the leadership of a new generation of leaders, such as [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] \"The Liberator\", [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and other ''[[Libertadores]]'' in South America, the independence movement regained strength, and by 1825, all [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], except for Puerto Rico and Cuba, had gained independence from Spain. In the same year in [[Mexico]], a military officer, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], led a coalition of conservatives and liberals who created a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Iturbide as [[emperor]]. This [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, and was followed by the creation of a [[republic]] in 1823.\n\n====Independent Empire of Brazil====\n{{Main|Independence of Brazil|Empire of Brazil}}\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|Declaration of the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] by the later [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro&nbsp;I]] on September 7, 1822]]\n\nThe [[Brazilian War of Independence]], which had already begun along other independent movements around the region, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;168, 164, 178</ref> With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824,<ref name=\"Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp. 179\u2013180\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;179\u2013180</ref> Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.<ref name=\"Lustosa, p. 208\">Lustosa, p.&nbsp;208</ref>\n\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D.

''El liberalismo hispanoamericano'' en el siglo XIX. pg2</ref> Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists wanted to see a change in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes in order to promote equality.\n\nWhen liberal [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state had been better off before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government was better in the eyes of the Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. [[General Santa Anna]] was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u201348) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.\n\nIn 1837, conservative [[Rafael Carrera]] conquered [[Guatemala]] and separated from the [[Central American Union]]. The instability that followed the disintegration of the union led to the independence of the other Central American countries.\n\nIn [[Brazil]], rural aristocrats were in conflict with the urban conservatives. Portuguese control over Brazilian ports continued after Brazil's independence. Following the conservative idea that the old government was better, urbanites tended to support conservatism because more opportunities were available to them as a result of the Portuguese presence.\n\n[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] became president of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1819 after the region gained independence from Spain. He led a military-controlled state. Citizens did not like the government's position under Bol\u00edvar: The people in the military were unhappy with their roles, and the civilians were of the opinion that the military had too much power. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, New Grenada continued to have conflicts between conservatives and liberals. These conflicts were each concentrated in particular regions, with conservatives particularly in the southern mountains and the Valley of Cauca. In the mid-1840s some leaders in Caracas organized a liberal opposition. Antonio Leocadio Guzman was an active participant and journalist in this movement and gained much popularity among the people of Caracas.<ref>Halper\u00edn Donghi, T. (2013). ''Historia contempor\u00e1nea de Am\u00e9rica latina''. Madrid: Alianza.</ref>\n\nIn [[Argentina]], the conflict manifested itself as a prolonged civil war between ''[[Unitarian Party|unitarianas]]'' (i.e. ''centralists'') and ''[[Federales|federalists]]'', which were in some aspects respectively analogous to liberals and conservatives in other countries. Between 1832 and 1852, the country existed as a [[Argentine Confederation|confederation]], without a head of state, although the federalist governor of Buenos Aires province, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], was given the powers of debt payment and international relations and exerted a growing hegemony over the country. A national constitution was only enacted in 1853, reformed in 1860, and the country reorganized as a federal republic led by a [[Generation of '80|liberal-conservative elite]].<ref>Galasso, N. (2011). ''Historia de la Argentina'' (Vol. 1).</ref> After Uruguay achieved its independence, in 1828, a similar polarization crystallized between ''blancos'' and ''colorados'', where the agrarian conservative interests were pitted against the liberal commercial interests based in Montevideo, and which eventually resulted in the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'' civil war (1839\u20131851).<ref>Hudson, R., & Meditz, S.

The British were able to capture large amounts of precious metals, before a French naval force intervened on behalf of the Spanish King and took down the invading force. However, this caused much turmoil in the area as militia took control of the area from the viceroy. The next year the British attacked once again with a much larger force attempting to reach and conquer Montevideo.<ref>Donghi, 89</ref> They failed to reach [[Montevideo]] but succeeded in establishing an alliance with the locals.

As newly appointed president, Benito Ju\u00e1rez suspended payment of debts for next two years, to focus on a rebuilding and stabilization initiative in Mexico under the new government. On December 8, 1861, Spain, England and France landed in Veracruz in order to seize unpaid debts from Mexico. However, Napoleon III, with intentions of establishing a French client state to further push his economic interests, pressured the other two powers to withdraw in 1862 (Greenspan; \"French Intervention in Mexico\u2026\").\n[[File:Batalla de Puebla.png|upright=0.80|thumb|right|Painting depicting the [[Battle of Puebla]] in 1862]]\nFrance under Napoleon III remained and established Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=French Intervention in Mexico and the American Civil War, 1862\u20131867|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/french-intervention |website=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian}}</ref> The march by the French to Mexico City enticed heavy resistance by the Mexican government, it resulted in open warfare.

With heavy resistance by Mexican rebels and the fear of United States intervention against France, forced Napoleon III to withdraw from Mexico, leaving Maximilian to surrender, where he would be later executed by Mexican troops under the rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ridge Jr.|first1=Michael Allen|title=A country in need of American instruction : The U.S. mission to shape and transform Mexico, 1848\u20131911|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3321&context=etd|website=Iowa Research Online|publisher=University of Iowa}}</ref> Napoleon III's desire to expand France's economic empire influenced the decision to seize territorial domain over the Central American region. The port city of Veracruz, Mexico and France's desire to construct a new canal were of particular interest. Bridging both New World and East Asian trade routes to the Atlantic were key to Napoleon III's economic goals to the mining of precious rocks and the expansion of France's textile industry. Napoleon's fear of the United States' economic influence over the Pacific trade region, and in turn all New World economic activity, pushed France to intervene in Mexico under the pretense of collecting on Mexico's debt. Eventually France began plans to build the Panama Canal in 1881 until 1904 when the United States took over and proceeded with its construction and implementation (\"Read Our Story\").\n\n===American involvement in Latin America during the 19th century===\n\n====Monroe Doctrine====\n[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]]]]\nThe [[Monroe Doctrine]] was included in President [[James Monroe]]'s 1823 annual message to Congress. The doctrine warns European nations that the United States will no longer tolerate any new colonization of Latin American countries. It was originally drafted to meet the present major concerns, but eventually became the precept of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The doctrine was put into effect in 1865 when the U.S. government supported Mexican president, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], diplomatically and militarily. Some Latin American countries viewed the U.S. interventions, allowed by the Monroe Doctrine when the U.S. deems necessary, with suspicion.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. pg 491</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of United States involvement in Latin America is the case of the [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. In 1855, he traveled to Nicaragua hoping to overthrow the government and take the land for the United States. With only the aid of 56 followers, he was able to take over the city of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], declaring himself commander of the army and installing [[Patricio Rivas]] as a puppet president. However, Rivas's presidency ended when he fled Nicaragua; Walker rigged the following election to ensure that he became the next president. His presidency did not last long, however, as he was met with much opposition from political groups in Nicaragua and neighbouring countries. On May 1, 1857, Walker was forced by a coalition of Central American armies to surrender himself to a United States Navy officer who repatriated him and his followers. When Walker subsequently returned to Central America in 1860, he was apprehended by the Honduran authorities and executed.\n\n====Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348)====\n[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|left|American occupation of [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War]], another instance of U.S. involvement in Latin America, was a war between the United States and Mexico that started in April 1846 and lasted until February 1848. The main cause of the war was the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845 and a dispute afterwards about whether the border between Mexico and the United States ended where Mexico claimed, at the [[Nueces River]], or ended where the United States claimed, at the [[Rio Grande]]. Peace was negotiated between the United States and Mexico with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which stated that Mexico was to cede land which would later become part of California and New Mexico as well as give up all claims to Texas, for which the United States would pay $15,000,000. However, tensions between the two countries were still high and over the next six years things only got worse with raids along the border and attacks by Native Americans against Mexican citizens. To defuse the situation, the United States agreed to purchase 29,670 squares miles of land from Mexico for $10,000,000 so a southern railroad could be built to connect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This would become known as the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. A critical component of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs took form in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which drastically affected the futures of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Americas, as well as Guam and the Philippines, by dismantling some of the last remaining Spanish colonial possessions throughout the world.\n\n==From the \"Big Stick\" to the \"Good Neighbor\" policy==\n[[File:Satterfield cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield]] cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic]]\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the U.S. banana importing companies [[United Fruit Company]], [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] (both ancestors of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]]), and [[Standard Fruit Company]] (now [[Dole Food Company|Dole]]), acquired large amounts of land in Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. The companies gained leverage over the governments and a ruling elite in these countries by dominating their economies and paying kickbacks, and exploited local workers.

The 1898 [[Spanish\u2013American War]] resulted in the end of Spanish colonial presence in the Americas. A period of frequent U.S. intervention in Latin America followed, with the acquisition of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] in 1903, the so-called [[Banana Wars]] in Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Honduras; the [[Caco Wars]] in Haiti; and the so-called [[Border War (1910\u20131919)|Border War]] with Mexico.

The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. The revelation of the contents outraged the American public and swayed public opinion. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] moved to arm American merchant ships in order to defend themselves against German submarines, which had started to attack them. The news helped generate support for the [[American entry into World War I|United States declaration of war on Germany]] in April of that year.<ref>[[#Andrew|Andrew]], p.&nbsp;42.</ref>\n\nThe message came as a [[code (cryptography)|coded]] telegram dispatched by the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], on January 16, 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador of Mexico, [[Heinrich von Eckardt]]. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the [[Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I#1917: Renewed \"unrestricted\" campaign|resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany on 1 February, an act which Germany presumed would lead to war. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the U.S. appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for a military alliance, with funding from Germany. As part of the alliance, Germany would assist Mexico in reconquering Texas and the Southwest. Eckardt was instructed to urge Mexico to help broker an alliance between Germany and Japan. Mexico, in the middle of the [[Mexican Revolution]], far weaker militarily, economically and politically than the U.S., ignored the proposal; after the U.S. entered the war, it officially rejected it.\n\n====Brazil's participation in World War II====\nAfter World War I, in which Brazil was an ally of the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[France]], the country realized it needed a more capable army but did not have the technology to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil. They tried to assist the army by bringing them up to the European military standard but constant civil missions did not prepare them for [[World War II]].\n\nBrazil's President, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], wanted to industrialize Brazil, allowing it to be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces. It was recently found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Secret Files Reveal 9,000 Nazi War Criminals Fled to South America after WWII|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117093/Secret-files-reveal-9-000-Nazi-war-criminals-fled-South-America-WWII.html|newspaper=Mail Online|accessdate=24 May 2012|location=London|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=2012-03-19}}</ref> It was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its F\u00fchrer. He even let German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil.\nThis alliance with Germany became Brazil's second best trade alliance behind the United States.\n\n[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian soldiers greet Italian civilians in the city of [[Massarosa]], September 1944. Brazil was the only independent Latin American country to send ground troops to fight in WWII.]]\n\nBrazil continued to try to remain neutral to the United States and Germany because it was trying to make sure it could continue to be a place of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually, Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.\n\nOnce the German submarines attacked unarmed Brazilian trading ships, President Vargas met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss how they could retaliate. On January 22, 1942, Brazil officially ended all relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy, becoming a part of the Allies.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] was sent to Naples, Italy to fight for democracy. Brazil was the only Latin American country to send troops to Europe. Initially, Brazil wanted to only provide resources and shelter for the war to have a chance of gaining a high postwar status but ended up sending 25,000 men to fight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penteado|first=Carlos Joes A.|title=Hyper War: The Brazilian Participation in World War II|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Brazil/Participation/index.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the United States and Latin America continued to have a close relationship. For example, USAID created family planning programs in Latin America combining the NGOs already in place, providing the women in largely Catholic areas access to contraception.<ref>{{cite web|title=Health in Latin America and the Caribbean|url=http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090422_bliss_healthlatinamer_web.pdf|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Mexico and World War II====\n{{Main|History of Mexico}}\n[[File:BraceroProgram.jpg|thumb|The first Braceros arrive in [[Los Angeles]], 1942.]]\n\nMexico entered World War II in response to German attacks on Mexican ships.

Brazil began selling automobiles to other countries, and some Latin American countries set up plants to assemble imported parts, letting other countries take advantage of Latin America's low labor costs. Colombia began to export flowers, emeralds and coffee grains and gold, becoming the world's second-leading flower exporter.\n\nEconomic integration was called for, to attain economies that could compete with the economies of the United States or Europe. Starting in the 1960s with the Latin American Free Trade Association and Central American Common Market, Latin American countries worked toward economic integration.\n\nIn efforts to help regain global economic strength, the U.S. began to heavily assist countries involved in World War II at the expense of Latin America.

Trujillo also unsuccessfully attempted to establish contacts and relations with the Soviet bloc.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pope Atkins |first1=G. |title=The Dominican Republic and the United States: From Imperialism to Transnationalism |page=118}}</ref> In 1961, Trujillo was murdered with weapons supplied by the CIA.<ref>[https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-assassination-of-rafael-trujillo/ \"The Assassination of Rafael Trujillo\"]</ref>\n\n====Cuban Revolution====\n{{Main|Cuban Revolution}}\nBy 1959, Cuba was afflicted with a corrupt dictatorship under Batista, and [[Fidel Castro]] ousted Batista that year and set up the first communist state in the hemisphere. The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, and combined with Castro's expropriation of private enterprises, this was detrimental to the Cuban economy.<ref name=\"History of Latin America\" /> Around Latin America, rural guerrilla conflict and urban terrorism increased, inspired by the Cuban example. The United States put down these rebellions by supporting Latin American countries in their counter-guerrilla operations through the Alliance for Progress launched by President John F. Kennedy. This thrust appeared to be successful. A Marxist, Salvador Allende, became president of Chile in 1970, but was overthrown three years later in a military coup backed by the United States. Despite civil war, high crime and political instability, most Latin American countries eventually adopted bourgeois liberal democracies while Cuba maintained its socialist system.\n\n====Bay of Pigs Invasion====\n{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}\n\n[[Image:Attack near Playa Giron.

Latin American Political History: Patterns and Personalities. pg 376\u2013377</ref> in 1960, the U.S. decided to support an attack on Cuba by anti-Castro rebels. The Bay of Pigs invasion was an unsuccessful invasion of Cuba in 1961, financed by the U.S. through the CIA, to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]. The incident proved to be very embarrassing for the new Kennedy administration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of the invasion led to a [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet-Cuban alliance]].\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\n{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}\nIn 1962, Cuba threatened the USA when it allowed Soviet missiles to be placed on the island, just 90 miles away from Florida; Cuba saw it as a way to defend the island, while the Americans saw it as a threat. The ensuing Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014the closest the world has ever come to total annihilation\u2014almost saw a US invasion or bombing of Cuba, but it ended when the two sides agreed on the removal of missiles; the US removed theirs from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets removed theirs from Cuba. The crisis' end left Cuba blockaded by the US, which was also obligated to not invade Cuba. In fact, they were allowed to keep [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] as a naval base as per an agreement with the previous government of Batista.\n\n====Alliance for Progress====\nPresident John F. Kennedy initiated the [[Alliance for Progress]] in 1961, to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The Alliance would provide $20 billion for reform in Latin America, and counterinsurgency measures. Instead, the reform failed because of the simplistic theory that guided it and the lack of experienced American experts who could understand Latin American customs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kennedy proposes Alliance for Progress - Mar 13, 1961 - HISTORY.com|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kennedy-proposes-alliance-for-progress|website=HISTORY|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Foreign interventions by Cuba====\n{{Main|Foreign interventions by Cuba}}\n[[File:Cuban PT-76 Angola.JPG|thumb|A Cuban [[PT-76]] performing routine security duties in [[Angola]] during the [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuban intervention into the country]]]]\n[[File:Cubans in Ogaden1.JPG|thumb|Cuban artillerymen in [[Ethiopia]] during the [[Ogaden War]]]]\nArmed Cuban intervention overseas began on 14 June 1959 with an invasion of the Dominican Republic<ref name=CIA/> by a group of fifty-six men, who landed a [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|C-56]] transport aircraft at the military airport of the town of Constanza. Upon their landing, the fifteen-man Dominican garrison began an ongoing gun battle with the invaders, until the survivors disappeared into the surrounding mountains. Immediately after, the Dominican Air Force bombed the area around Constanza with British made [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire jets]] in an unsuccessful attempt to kill the invaders, which instead killed civilians.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roorda |first1=Eric Paul |title=Historical Dictionary of the Dominican Republic |date=2016 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |page=80}}</ref> The invaders either died at the hands of machete-swinging peasants,<ref>{{cite news|title=DOMINICANS HUNT REBEL SURVIVORS; Band of 20 Invaders Eluding Troops and Peasants in Wooded Mountain Area |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/07/02/archives/dominicans-hunt-rebel-survivors-band-of-20-invaders-eluding-troops.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 2, 1959}}</ref> or the military captured, tortured, and imprisoned them. A week later, two yachts offloaded 186 invaders onto Chris-Craft launches for a landing on the north coast. Dominican Air Force pilots fired rockets from their Vampire jets into the approaching launches, killing most of the invaders. The survivors were brutally tortured and murdered.\n\nFrom 1966 until the late 1980s, the Soviet government upgraded Cuba's military capabilities, and Castro saw to it that Cuba assisted with the independence struggles of several countries across the world, most notably Angola and Mozambique in southern Africa, and the anti-imperialist struggles of countries such as Syria, Algeria, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book |title=Parameters: Journal of the US Army War College |date=1977 |publisher=U.S. Army War College |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMdLAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA13&lpg=#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=CIA>{{cite web |title=Foreign Intervention by Cuba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP77M00144R000400100003-7.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[South Africa]] developed nuclear weapons due to the threat to its security posed by the presence of large numbers of Cuban troops in Angola and Mozambique.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime: Prospects for the 21st Century |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |page=95}}</ref> In November 1975, Cuba poured more than 65,000 troops into Angola in one of the fastest military mobilizations in history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why the Cuban military machine should intervene in Syria |url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/stranger_than_fiction/2015/10/21/why-the-cuban-military-machine-should-intervene-in-syria_484903}}</ref> On 10 November 1975, Cuban forces defeated the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) in the [[Battle of Quifangondo]].

On 27 March 1976, the last South African troops withdrew from Angola. In September 1977, 12 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]]s conducted strafing flights over Puerto Plata in Dominican Republic to warn then president Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer against intercepting Cuban warships headed to or returning from Angola.<ref>{{cite web |title=Castro\u2019s turbulent ties with the Dominican Republic |url=https://dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2016/11/27/castros-turbulent-ties-with-the-dominican-republic/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cuba Air Force |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/americas/cuba/Cuba-af-home.htm|website=www.aeroflight.co.uk}}</ref> In 1988, Cuba returned to Angola with a vengeance.

Within two years, the Cold War was over and Cuba's foreign policy shifted away from military intervention.\n\n====Nicaraguan Revolution====\nFollowing the American occupation of Nicaragua in 1912, as part of the [[Banana Wars]], the Somoza family political dynasty came to power, and would rule Nicaragua until their ouster in 1979 during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. The era of Somoza family rule was characterized by strong U.S. support for the government and its military as well as a heavy reliance on U.S.-based multi-national corporations. The Nicaraguan Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n Nicarag\u00fcense or Revoluci\u00f3n Popular Sandinista) encompassed the rising opposition to the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the campaign led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) to violently oust the dictatorship in 1978\u201379, the subsequent efforts of the FSLN to govern Nicaragua from 1979 until 1990 and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] which was waged between the FSLN and the [[Contras]] from 1981\u20131990.\n\nThe Revolution marked a significant period in Nicaraguan history and revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War with the events in the country rising to international attention. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978\u201379 was a bloody affair, the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. A history of Latin America. pg541-542</ref> During the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received large amounts of aid from the Cold War super-powers (respectively, the Soviet Union and the United States).\n\n===Washington Consensus===\n{{Main|Washington Consensus}}\n{{See also|Free Trade Area of the Americas}}\n[[File:Ship passing through Panama Canal 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roll-on/roll-off]]\nships, such as this one pictured here at [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores locks]], are among the largest ships to pass through the [[Panama Canal]]. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of [[Panama]] and is a key conduit for international maritime trade.]]\n\nThe set of specific economic policy prescriptions that were considered the \"standard\" reform package were promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, D.C.-based institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]] during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, several Latin American countries led by socialist or other left wing governments{{spaced ndash}}including Argentina and Venezuela{{spaced ndash}}have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus set of policies. (Other Latin countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru, have in practice adopted the bulk of the policies.) Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the \"fundamentalist\" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a \"one size fits all\" treatment of individual economies.\n\nThe term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.\n\nThis politico-economical initiative was institutionalized in North America by 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], and elsewhere in the Americas through a series of [[Free Trade Area of the Americas#Agreements|like agreements]]. The comprehensive [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] project, however, was rejected by most [[Mercosur|South American countries]] at the 2005 [[4th Summit of the Americas]].\n\n===Turn to the left===\n{{See also|Pink tide}}\n[[File:UNASUR-15SEP2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[UNASUR]] summit in the Palacio de la Moneda, Santiago de Chile]]\nIn most countries, since the 2000s left-wing political parties have risen to power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The presidencies of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela, [[Ricardo Lagos]] and [[Michelle Bachelet]] in Chile, [[Lula da Silva]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]] in Brazil, [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and his wife [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner|Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] in Argentina, [[Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mujica]] in Uruguay, [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador, [[Fernando Lugo]] in Paraguay, [[Manuel Zelaya]] in [[Honduras]] (removed from power by a [[2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]), [[Mauricio Funes]] and [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] in El Salvador are all part of this wave of [[left-wing]] politicians who often declare themselves [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Latin American integration|Latin Americanists]], or [[Anti-Imperialism|anti-imperialists]] (often implying [[Anti-Americanism#Latin America|opposition to US]] [[Washington consensus|policies towards the region]]). A development of this has been the creation of the eight-member ALBA alliance, or \"[[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]]\" (Spanish: ''Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra Am\u00e9rica'') by some of the countries already mentioned. By June 2014, Honduras ([[Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez]]), Guatemala ([[Otto P\u00e9rez Molina]]), and Panama ([[Ricardo Martinelli]]) had right-wing governments.\n\n===Return of social movements===\n[[File:45.

''Latin America after Neoliberalism''. New York: North American Congress on Latin America, 2006.

A \"reversal of development\" reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Escobar|editor-first=Arturo|editor-first2=Sonia E.|editor-last2=Alvarez|title=The Making of Social Movements in Latin America|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview|date=1992}}</ref> Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social security, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and [[Informal sector|informalization]] of labor.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> In an effort to bring more investors to these industries, these governments also embraced [[globalization]] through more open interactions with the international economy.\n\nSignificantly, as democracy spread across much of Latin America, the realm of government became more inclusive (a trend that proved conducive to social movements), the economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward while denying political responsibility to provide social welfare rights, and though [[Development studies|development]] projects took place throughout the region, both inequality and poverty increased.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> Feeling excluded from these new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.\n\nBoth urban and rural populations had serious grievances as a result of the above economic and global trends and have voiced them in mass demonstrations. Some of the largest and most violent of these have been protests against cuts in urban services, such as the [[Caracazo]] in Venezuela and the [[Argentinazo]] in Argentina.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\">Johnston, Hank, and Paul Almeida, eds.

These movements have benefited considerably from transnational support from conservationists and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]]. The [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movement of Rural Landless Workers]] (MST) is perhaps the largest contemporary Latin American social movement.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> As indigenous populations are primarily rural, indigenous movements account for a large portion of rural social movements, including the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista rebellion]] in Mexico, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador|CONAIE]]), indigenous organizations in the Amazon region of Ecuador and Bolivia, pan-Mayan communities in Guatemala, and mobilization by the indigenous groups of [[Yanomami]] peoples in the Amazon, [[Guna people|Kuna]] peoples in Panama, and Altiplano [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples in Bolivia.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> Other significant types of social movements include labor struggles and strikes, such as [[recovered factories]] in Argentina, as well as gender-based movements such as the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina and protests against [[maquila]] production, which is largely a women's issue because of how it draws on women for cheap labor.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" />\n\n===Modern era===\nThe [[2000s commodities boom]] caused positive effects for many Latin American economies.

But, demographics may have made this inevitable as well. Thus, for example, of the approximately 13.5 million people who lived in the Spanish colonies in 1800 before independence only about one fifth were white. This contrasts with the U.S., where more than four fifths were whites (out of a population of 5.3 million in 1801, 900,000 were slaves, plus approximately 60,000 free blacks). ...\n\nThe fact of the recognition of a racial continuum in Hispanic American (sic) does not mean that there wasn't discrimination, which there was, or that there wasn't an obsession with race, or 'castes', as they were sometimes called. ...\n\nIn areas with large indigenous Amerindian populations, a racial mixture resulted, which is known in Spanish as ''mestizos'' ... who are a majority in Mexico, Central America and most of South America. Similarly, when African slaves were brought to the Caribbean region and Brazil, where there was very little indigenous presence left, unions between them and Spanish produced a population of mixed ''mulatos'' ... who are a majority of the population in many of those Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela). \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/race.htm|title=Hispanics and Race|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nAske has also written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Spanish colonization was rather different from later English, or British, colonization of North America. They had different '''systems of colonization''' and different methods of subjugation. While the English were primarily interested in grabbing land, the Spanish in addition had a mandate to incorporate the land's inhabitants into their society, something which was achieved by religious conversion and sexual unions which produced a new 'race' of ''mestizos'', a mixture of Europeans and indigenous peoples. ''mestizos'' (sic) form the majority of the population in Mexico, Central America, and much of South America. Racial mixing or miscegenation, after all, was something that the Spanish and Portuguese had been accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans.\n\nSimilarly, later on, when African slaves were introduced into the Caribbean basin region, unions between them and Spaniards produced a population of ''mulatos'', who are a majority of the population in the Caribbean islands (the Antilles) (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico), as well as other areas of the Caribbean region (Colombia, Venezuela and parts of the Central American Caribbean coast). ''mestizos'' (sic) and ''mulatos'' may not have always have been first class citizens in their countries, but they were never disowned in the way the outcomes of unions of Europeans and Native Americans were in the British colonies, where interracial marriages were taboo and one drop of Black or Amerindian blood was enough to make the person 'impure'. \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/history.htm|title=Some historical background|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nIn his famous 1963 book ''[[The Rise of the West]]'', [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Racially mixed societies arose in most of Spanish and Portuguese America, compounded in varying proportions from European, Indian, and Negro strands. Fairly frequent resort to manumission mitigated the hardships of slavery in those areas; and the Catholic church positively encouraged marriages between white immigrants and Indian women as a remedy for sexual immorality. However, in the southern English colonies and in most of the Caribbean islands, the importation of Negro slaves created a much more sharply polarized biracial society. Strong race feeling and the servile status of nearly all Negroes interdicted intermarriage, practically if not legally. Such discrimination did not prevent interbreeding; but children of mixed parentage were assigned to the status of their mothers. Mulattoes and Indian half-breeds were thereby excluded from the white community. In Spanish (and, with some differences, Portuguese) territories a more elaborate and less oppressive principle of racial discrimination established itself. The handful of persons who had been born in the homelands claimed topmost social prestige; next came those of purely European descent; while beneath ranged the various racial blends to form a social pyramid whose numerous racial distinctions meant that no one barrier could become as ugly and inpenetrable as that dividing whites from Negroes in the English, Dutch, and French colonies.\n}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community|last=McNeill|first=William H.|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}, p. 603</ref>\n\nThomas C. Wright, meanwhile, has written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The demographic makeup of colonial Latin America became more complex when, as the native population declined, the Portuguese, Spanish, and the French in Haiti turned to Africa for labor, as did the British in North America. The tricontinental heritage that characterizes Latin America, then, is shared by the United States, but even a casual examination reveals that the outcome of the complex interaction of different peoples has varied. While miscegenation among the three races certainly occurred in North America, it appears to have been much less common than in Latin America. Furthermore, offspring of such liaisons were not recognized as belonging to new, distinct racial categories in North America as they were in Latin America. The terms mestizo or ''mameluco'', mulatto, the general term ''castas'', and dozens of subcategories of racial identity frankly recognized the outcomes of interracial sexual activity in Latin America and established a continuum of race rather than the unrealistic absolute categories of white, black, or Indian as used in the United States. (The U.S. Census Bureau's forms did not allow individuals to list more than one race until 2000.)\n}}<ref>{{cite book|title=Latin America since Independence: Two Centuries of Continuity and Change|last=Wright|first=Thomas C.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OuIlDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2017|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9781442235724}}, pp. 30 \u2013 31</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Map-Romance Latin America.svg|thumb|left|Linguistic map of Latin America.

It is spoken as first language by about 60% of the population. Portuguese is spoken by about 34%, and about 6% speak other languages such as Quechua, [[Mayan languages]], Guaran\u00ed, Aymara, Nahuatl, English, French, Dutch and Italian. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]), the biggest and most populous country in the region. Spanish is the official language of most of the rest of the countries and territories on the Latin American mainland ([[Spanish language in the Americas]]), as well as in [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (where it is co-official with English), and the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[French language|French]] is spoken in [[Haiti]] and in the French [[overseas department]]s of [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[French Guiana|Guiana]], and the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]; it is also spoken by some Panamanians of Afro-Antillean descent. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language in [[Suriname]], [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. (As Dutch is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], these territories are not necessarily considered part of Latin America.) However, the native language of Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and Cura\u00e7ao, is [[Papiamento]], a creole language largely based on Portuguese and Spanish and has a considerable influence coming from the Dutch language and [[Portuguese-based creole languages]].\n\n[[File:Map-Most Widely Spoken Native Languages in Latin America.png|thumb|'''{{color|blue|Quechua}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#f9dc38|Guaran\u00ed}}}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#ff9922|Aymara}}}}''', '''{{color|#cc0000|N\u00e1huatl}}''', '''{{color|#006600|Lenguas Mayas}}''', '''Mapudungun''']]\n\n[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] are widely spoken in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Mexico]], and to a lesser degree, in [[Panama]], [[Ecuador]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] amongst other countries. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non-existent (e.g. [[Uruguay]]). Mexico is possibly the only country that contains a wider variety of indigenous languages than any Latin American country, but the most spoken language is Nahuatl.\n\nIn [[Peru]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In [[Ecuador]], while holding no official status, the closely related [[Quichua]] is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], Quechua and Guaran\u00ed hold official status alongside Spanish. [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], along with Spanish, is an official language of [[Paraguay]], and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Corrientes]]. In [[Nicaragua]], Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo languages|Sumo]], and [[Rama language|Rama]] also hold official status. [[Colombia]] recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. [[Nahuatl]] is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as \"national languages\" along with Spanish.\n\nOther European languages spoken in Latin America include: [[English language|English]], by some groups in [[Puerto Rico]], as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, like [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]], and spoken by descendants of British settlers in Argentina & Chile; [[German language|German]], in southern [[Brazil]], southern [[Chile]], portions of [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Paraguay]]; [[Italian language|Italian]], in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and [[Uruguay]]; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] in southern Brazil and Argentina; and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], in southern Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1163503 |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stclassargentina.com/tours/WelshImmigration.html|title=The Welsh Immigration to Argentina|work=1stclassargentina.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Howat |url=http://www.argbrit.org/Patagonia/patagonia_entry.htm |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Argbrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.patagonline.com/patagonia/destacados/peninsula-valdes/gaiman-trelew |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Patagonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andesceltig.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Andesceltig.com |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917174822/http://andesceltig.com/ |archive-date=2017-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glaniad.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Glaniad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808130811/http://www.glaniad.com/ |archive-date=2016-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are possible to be heard around Buenos Aires and S\u00e3o Paulo especially.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html#4 |title=Brazil \u2013 Modern-Day Community |publisher=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref> Non-European or Asian languages include [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay, [[Korean language|Korean]] in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] throughout South America.\n\nIn several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, [[creole languages]] are spoken.

These Emigrant Policies focus on the rights, obligations and opportunities for participation of emigrated citizens who already live outside the borders of the country of origin. Research on Latin America shows that the extension of policies towards migrants is linked to a focus on civil rights and state benefits that can positively influence integration in recipient countries. In addition, the tolerance of dual citizenship has spread more in Latin America than in any other region of the world.<ref>Pedroza, L.; Palop, P. y Hoffmann, B. (2018).

The region has made great progress in educational coverage; almost all children attend primary school and access to secondary education has increased considerably. Quality issues such as poor teaching methods, lack of appropriate equipment and overcrowding exist throughout the region. These issues lead to adolescents dropping out of the educational system early.<ref name=\"Welti\">{{cite book |last=Welti|first=Carlos|editor-first=B. |editor-last=Brown|chapter=Adolescents in Latin America: Facing the Future with Skepticism|title=The World's Youth: Adolescence in Eight Regions of the Globe|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, U.K.|isbn=0521006058|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}</ref> Most educational systems in the region have implemented various types of administrative and institutional reforms that have enabled reach for places and communities that had no access to education services in the early 1990s. Compared to prior generations, Latin American youth have seen an increase in their levels of education. On average, they have completed two years schooling more than their parents.<ref name=\"Welti\" />\n\nHowever, there are still 23 million children in the region between the ages of 4 and 17 outside of the formal education system. Estimates indicate that 30% of preschool age children (ages 4\u20135) do not attend school, and for the most vulnerable populations, the poor and rural, this calculation exceeds 40 percent. Among primary school age children (ages 6 to 12), coverage is almost universal; however there is still a need to incorporate 5 million children in the primary education system. These children live mostly in remote areas, are indigenous or Afro-descendants and live in extreme poverty.<ref name=Survey>[BID/EDU Stakeholder Survey 1993/2003, February 8, 2011]</ref>\n\nAmong people between the ages of 13 and 17 years, only 80% are full-time students in the education system; among them only 66% advance to secondary school. These percentages are lower among vulnerable population groups: only 75% of the poorest youth between the ages of 13 and 17 years attend school. Tertiary education has the lowest coverage, with only 70% of people between the ages of 18 and 25 years outside of the education system.

Minor blocs or trade agreements are the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Dominican Republic \u2013 Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA), the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and the [[Andean Community of Nations]] (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise.

More recently, additional cultural influences came from the United States and Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, due to the growing influence of the former on the world stage and immigration from the latter. The influence of the United States is particularly strong in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is an American territory. Prior to 1959, Cuba, who fought for its independence along American soldiers in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], was also known to have a close socioeconomic relation with the United States. In addition, the United States also helped Panama become an independent state from Colombia and built the twenty-mile-long [[Panama Canal Zone]] in Panama which held from 1903 (the [[Panama Canal]] opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914) to 1999, when the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone. South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Russians, Croatians, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews. With the end of colonialism, [[Culture of France|French culture]] was also able to exert a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of [[high culture]], science and medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stepan|first=Nancy Leys |title=\"The Hour of Eugenics\": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |location=Ithaca |pages=in passim |nopp=true |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NuUxkMC1ePYC |isbn=978-0-8014-9795-7}}</ref> This can be seen in any expression of the region's artistic traditions, including painting, literature and music, and in the realms of science and politics. \nDue to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution, a certain number of Iberian-American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas in 1791. Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned any reference to state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the 19th century were Dominican Republic (1822), Brazil (1824), Peru (1836), Mexico (1871), Paraguay (1880), Argentina (1887), Honduras (1899), Guatemala and El Salvador.

In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.\n\n[[File:Santiago Martinez Delgado in the colombian congress.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] in the [[Colombian Congress]]]]\n\nFrom the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Barreiro |first=Gabriel|date=December 1994|title=Constructivism in Latin America |journal=University of Essex Collection of Latin American Art|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America.

Historically, the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba.  Latin American film flourished after sound was introduced in cinema, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border.<ref>Paul A. Schroeder Rodriguez. ''Latin American Cinema: A Comparative History'' (University of California Press; 2016) studies 50 films since the silent era.</ref>\n[[File:Alejandro Inarritu Cannes 2017.jpg|right|upright|thumb|In 2015, [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] became the second Mexican director in a row to win both the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]] and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] for Best Director. He won his second [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2016 for ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]''.]]\n\n[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] started out in the silent era from 1896 to 1929 and flourished in the [[Golden age of the cinema of Mexico|Golden Era]] of the 1940s. It boasted a huge industry comparable to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time with stars such as [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Pedro Infante]]. In the 1970s, <!-- and 1970s --> Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu directed in 2010 ''[[Biutiful]]'' and [[Birdman (film)|''Birdman'']] (2014), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n directed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013).  Close friend of both, [[Guillermo del Toro]], a top rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006) and produced ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|El Orfanato]]'' (2007). [[Carlos Carrera]] (''[[The Crime of Father Amaro (film)|The Crime of Father Amaro]])'', and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are also some of the most known present-day Mexican film makers. ''[[Rudo y Cursi]]'' released in December (2008) in Mexico was directed by [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]].\n[[File:Cristina, elenco y Oscar.jpg|left|thumb|President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] with the film director [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella]] and the cast of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009) with the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film]]]]\n\n[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] has also been prominenent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|1976\u20131983 military dictatorship]]; but re-emerged to produce the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[The Official Story]]'' in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including ''[[Nueve reinas]]'' (2000), ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (2001), ''[[El abrazo partido]]'' (2004), ''[[El otro]]'' (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[El secreto de sus ojos]]'' and ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (2014).\n\n[[Cinema of Brazil|In Brazil]], the ''[[Cinema Novo]]'' movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States, with movies such as ''[[Central do Brasil (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' (1999), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|Cidade de Deus]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (2007).\n\n[[Cinema of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican cinema]] has produced some notable films, such as ''[[Una Aventura Llamada Menudo]]'', ''[[Los Diaz de Doris]]'' and ''[[Casi Casi]]''. An influx of Hollywood films affected the local film industry in Puerto Rico during the 1980s and 1990s, but several Puerto Rican films have been produced since and it has been recovering.\n\n[[Cinema of Cuba|Cuban cinema]] has enjoyed much official support since the [[Cuban revolution]] and important film-makers include [[Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Latin American literature}}\n{{See also|List of Latin American writers}}\n\n[[File:Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1772).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] in 1772 by Andr\u00e9s de Islas]]\nPre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate [[Aztec codices|codices]]. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the [[Popol Vuh]]. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking population of Peru and the [[K'iche' people|Quich\u00e9 (K'iche')]] of Guatemala.\n\nFrom the very moment of Europe's discovery of the continents, early explorers and [[conquistadores]] produced written accounts and cr\u00f3nicas of their experience{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s letters or [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]]'s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's ''[[El Periquillo Sarniento]]'' (1816).\n\nThe 19th century was a period of \"foundational fictions\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \"civilization or barbarism\" (for which see, say, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Domingo Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), [[Juan Le\u00f3n Mera]]'s ''Cumand\u00e1'' (1879), or [[Euclides da Cunha]]'s ''[[Os Sert\u00f5es]]'' (1902)). The 19th century also witnessed the realist work of [[Machado de Assis]], who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction, much admired by critic [[Harold Bloom]].\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, ''[[modernismo]]'' emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]]'s ''Azul'' (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]], for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.\n[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Chilean poet [[Gabriela Mistral]], first Latin American to win a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in 1945]]\n[[File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Argentine [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in [[L'H\u00f4tel]], [[Paris]] in 1969]]\n\nHowever, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien a\u00f1os de soledad]]'' (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''Yo, el supremo'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.\n\nContemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Mench\u00fa]]. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]] and Pedro Lemebel.\n\nThe region boasts six [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize winners]]: in addition to the two Chilean poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945) and [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), there is also the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel Angel Asturias]] (1967), the Colombian writer [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (1982),  the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990), and the Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (2010).\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{See also|Music of Latin America|Latin pop|Latin dance}}\n[[File:Salsa en Cali.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] dancing in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]]]\n\nLatin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales.

He is best known for claiming to have reached the [[geographic North Pole]] with his expedition on April 6, 1909.\n\nPeary was born in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], but following his father's death at a young age, was raised in [[Portland, Maine]].  He went to a prominent boarding school called Loomis Chaffe. He attended [[Bowdoin College]], then joined the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|National Geodetic Survey]] as a draftsman. Peary enlisted in the navy in 1881, as a civil engineer. In 1885, he was made chief of surveying for the [[Nicaragua Canal]] (which was never built). Peary visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886, making an unsuccessful attempt to cross [[Greenland]] by [[dogsled]]. [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892|He returned in 1891]] much better prepared, and by reaching [[Independence Fjord]] (in what is now known as [[Peary Land]]) proved conclusively that Greenland was an island. He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study [[Inuit]] survival techniques.\n\nOn his 1898\u20131902 expedition, Peary set a new \"[[Farthest North]]\" record by reaching Greenland's northernmost point, [[Cape Morris Jesup]]. Peary made two further expeditions to the Arctic, in 1905\u20131906 and in 1908\u20131909. During the latter, he claimed to have reached the North Pole. Peary received a number of awards from [[Learned society|geographical societies]] during his lifetime, and in 1911 received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. He served two terms as president of [[The Explorers Club]] and retired to [[Eagle Island (Casco Bay, Maine)|Eagle Island]].\n\nPeary's claim to have reached the North Pole was widely debated in contemporary newspapers (along with a competing claim made by [[Frederick Cook]]), but eventually won widespread acceptance. In 1989, British explorer [[Wally Herbert]] concluded Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have been as close as {{convert|60|mi|km|0}}. His conclusions have been widely accepted, although disputed by some authorities.\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\n[[File:Peary.jpg|thumb|alt= Photographic portrait of Peary |Peary {{circa|1900}}]]\nRobert Edwin Peary was born on May 6, 1856, in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], to Charles N. and Mary P.

During that time he made a profile survey from the top of Fryeburg's Jockey Cap Rock. The 360-degree survey names the larger hills and mountains visible from the summit. After Peary's death, his boyhood friend, Alfred E. Burton, suggested that the profile survey be made into a monument. It was cast in bronze and set atop a granite cylinder and erected to his memory by the Peary family in 1938. A hike of less than a mile leads visitors to the summit and the monument.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mainetrailfinder.com/trails/trail/jockey-cap|title=Jockey Cap \u2013 Maine Trail Finder|website=www.mainetrailfinder.com|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter college, Peary worked as a draftsman making technical drawings at the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] office in Washington, D.C. He joined the [[United States Navy]] and on October 26, 1881, was commissioned as a civil engineer, with the relative rank of lieutenant.<ref name=NavalHistory/> From 1884 to 1885 he was an assistant engineer on the surveys for the [[Nicaragua Canal]] and later became the engineer in charge. As reflected in a diary entry he made in 1885, during his time in the Navy, he resolved to be the first man to reach the [[North Pole]].<ref name=Mills510/>\n\nIn April 1886, he wrote a paper for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] proposing two methods for crossing Greenland's ice cap. One was to start from the west coast and trek about {{convert|400|mi|km|-1}} to the east coast. The second, more difficult path, was to start from [[Whale Sound]] at the top of the known portion of [[Baffin Bay]] and travel north to determine whether Greenland was an island or if it extended all the way across the Arctic.<ref name=Mills511/> Peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on January 5, 1901, and to commander on April 6, 1902.<ref name=NavalHistory/>\n\n==Initial Arctic expeditions==\nPeary made his first expedition to the [[Arctic]] in 1886, intending to cross Greenland by [[dog sled]], taking the first of his own suggested paths. He was given six months' leave from the Navy, and he received $500 from his mother to book passage north and buy supplies. He sailed on a [[whaler]] to Greenland, arriving in [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]] on June 6, 1886.<ref name=Mills510/> Peary wanted to make a solo trek, but a young Danish official named Christian Maigaard convinced him he would die if he went out alone. Maigaard and Peary set off together and traveled nearly {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} due east before turning back because they were short on food. This was the second-farthest penetration of Greenland's ice sheet at the time. Peary returned home knowing more of what was required for long-distance ice trekking.<ref name=Mills511>Mills 2003, p.&nbsp;511.</ref>\n\n[[File:Matthew Henson 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Photograph of Matthew Henson dressed in polar gear | [[Matthew Henson]], Peary's assistant, in 1910]]\nBack in Washington attending with the US Navy, in November 1887 Peary was ordered  to survey likely routes for a proposed Nicaragua Canal. To complete his tropical outfit he needed a sun hat. He went to a men's clothing store where he met 21-year-old [[Matthew Henson]], a black man working as a sales clerk. Learning that Henson had six years of seagoing experience as a [[cabin boy]],<ref name=Nuttall856>Nuttall 2012, p.&nbsp;856.</ref> Peary immediately hired him as a personal [[valet]].<ref name=Nuttall855>Nuttall 2012, p.&nbsp;855.</ref>\n\nOn assignment in the jungles of Nicaragua, Peary told Henson of his dream of Arctic exploration. Henson accompanied Peary on every one of his subsequent Arctic expeditions, becoming his field assistant and \"first man\", a critical member of his team.<ref name=Mills511/><ref name=Nuttall855/>\n\n==Second Greenland expedition==\nIn 1891, [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892|Peary returned to Greenland]], taking the second, more difficult route that he laid out in 1886: traveling farther north to find out whether Greenland was a larger landmass extending to the North Pole. He was financed by several groups, including the [[American Geographic Society]], the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University|Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences]], and the [[Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]]. Members of this expedition included Peary's aide Henson, [[Frederick A. Cook]], who served as the group's surgeon; the expedition's ethnologist, Norwegian skier [[Eivind Astrup]]; bird expert and marksman [[Langdon Gibson]], and [[John M.

By wearing furs to preserve body heat and building igloos, he was able to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march.  Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system\u2014which he called the \"Peary system\"\u2014of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel. The Inuit were curious about the American party and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by their body odor (they did not bathe), their flea infestations and their food. She studied the people, however, and kept a journal of her experiences.<ref name=Conefrey/><ref name=\"year\"/> In September 1891, Peary's men took dog sled teams and pushed inland onto the ice sheet to lay caches of supplies. They did not go farther than {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} from Red Cliff.<ref name=Mills511/>\n\nPeary's leg mended by February 1892. By April, he made some short trips with Josephine and an Inuit dog sled driver to native villages to purchase supplies. On May 3, 1892, Peary finally set out on the intended trek with Henson, Gibson, Cook, and Astrup. At about the {{convert|150|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} mark, Peary continued on with Astrup.

The parties made well under {{convert|10|mi|km}} a day until they became separated by a storm.\n\n[[File:Peary's steamer Roosevelt, Hudson-Fulton Parade.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of the SS ''Roosevelt'' |''Roosevelt'' in the [[Hudson\u2013Fulton Celebration|Hudson\u2013Fulton parade]] in 1909]]\nAs a result, Peary was without a companion sufficiently trained in navigation to verify his account from that point northward. With insufficient food, and  uncertainty whether he could negotiate the ice between himself and land, he made the best possible dash and barely escaped with his life from the melting ice. On April 20, he was no farther north than 86\u00b030' latitude. For obvious reasons, this latitude was never published by Peary. It is in a typescript of his April 1906 diary, discovered by [[Wally Herbert]] in his assessment commissioned by the [[National Geographic Society]] in the late 1980s. (Herbert, 1989). The typescript suddenly stopped there, one day before Peary's April 21 purported \"farthest\".

They wintered near [[Cape Sheridan]] on Ellesmere Island, and from Ellesmere departed for the pole on February 28, 1909. The last support party was turned back from Bartlett Camp on April 1, in a latitude no greater than 87\u00b0 45' N.

He continued with five assistants, none capable of making navigation observations: [[Matthew Henson]], Ootah, Egigingwah, Seegloo, and Ooqueah. On April 6, he established Camp Jesup within {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|0}} of the pole.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Henson scouted ahead to what was thought to be the North Pole site; he returned with the greeting, \"I think I'm the first man to sit on top of the world,\" much to Peary's chagrin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geog.ucsb.edu/who-was-the-first-person-to-reach-the-north-pole/|title=Who Was the First Person To Reach the North Pole? {{!}} UC Geography|website=geog.ucsb.edu|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nPeary was unable to fully enjoy the fruits of his labors.

Others have suggested that he was guilty of deliberately exaggerating his accomplishments. Peary's account has been newly criticized by [[Pierre Berton]] (2001) and Bruce Henderson (2005).\n\n===Lack of independent validation===\nPeary did not submit his evidence for review to neutral national or international parties or to other explorers.<ref name=\":0\" /> Peary's claim was certified by the National Geographic Society (NGS) in 1909 after a cursory examination of Peary's records, as NGS was a major sponsor of his expedition.<ref name=\":0\" /> This was a few weeks before Cook's Pole claim was rejected by a Danish panel of explorers and navigational experts.\n\nThe National Geographic Society limited access to Peary's records.

This was further exacerbated by Peary's failure to produce records of observed data for steering, for the direction (\"[[Magnetic declination|variation]]\") of the compass, for his longitudinal position at any time, or for zeroing-in on the pole either latitudinally or transversely beyond Bartlett Camp.<ref>Herbert, 1989; Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#wpst Contributions]</ref>\n\n====Inconsistent speeds====\n[[File:PearyBartlett.png|thumb|alt= Photograph of Peary and Robert Bartlett | Peary and Robert Bartlett at [[Battle Harbour]] in 1909]]\nThe last five marches when Peary was accompanied by a navigator (Capt. Bob Bartlett) averaged no better than {{convert|13|mi|km}} marching north. But once the last support party turned back at \"Camp Bartlett\", where Bartlett was ordered southward, at least {{convert|133|nmi|km}} from the pole, Peary's claimed speeds immediately doubled for the five marches to Camp Jesup. The recorded speeds quadrupled during the two and a half-day return to Camp Bartlett&nbsp;\u2013 at which point his speed slowed drastically. Peary's account of a beeline journey to the pole and back\u2014which would have assisted his claim of such speed\u2014is contradicted by his companion Henson's account of tortured detours to avoid \"pressure ridges\" (ice floes' rough edges, often a few meters high) and \"leads\" (open water between those floes).\n\nIn his official report, Peary claimed to have traveled a total of  304 nautical miles between April 2, 1909, (when he left Bartlett's last camp) and April 9 (when he returned there), {{convert|133|nmi|km}} to the pole, the same distance back, and {{convert|38|nmi|km}} in the vicinity of the pole.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} These distances are counted without detours due to drift, leads and difficult ice, i.e. the distance traveled must have been significantly higher to make good the distance claimed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Peary and his party arrived back in Cape Columbia on the morning of April 23, 1909, only about two and a half days after Capt Bartlett, yet Peary claimed he had traveled a minimum of {{convert|304|nmi|km}} more than Bartlett (to the Pole and vicinity).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe conflicting and unverified claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his Antarctic expedition so as to leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the South Pole, which\u2014like [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s a month later in 1912\u2014was supported by the sextant, [[theodolite]], and compass observations of several other navigators.\n\n====Review of Peary's diary====\n[[File:Diary of Robert E. Peary - NARA - 304960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt= Photograph of Peary's diary entry for his arrival at the North pole | Peary's diary entry for arrival at the [[North Pole]]]]\nThe diary that Robert E. Peary kept on his 1909 polar expedition was finally made available for research in 1986. Historian [[Larry Schweikart]] examined it, finding that: the writing was consistent throughout (giving no evidence of post-expedition alteration), that there were consistent [[pemmican]] and other stains on all pages, and that all evidence was consistent with a conclusion that Peary's observations were made on the spot he claimed. Schweikart compared the reports and experiences of Japanese explorer [[Naomi Uemura]], who reached the North Pole alone in 1978, to those of Peary and found they were consistent.<ref>[[Larry Schweikart]], \"Polar Revisionism and the Peary Claim: The Diary of Robert E. Peary,\" ''The Historian'', XLVIII, May 1986.</ref> However, Peary made no entries in the diary on the crucial days of April 6 and 7, 1909, and his famous words \"The Pole at Last!\", allegedly written in his diary at the pole, were written on loose slips of paper that were inserted into the diary.\n\n====1984 and 1989 National Geographic Society studies====\nIn 1984 the National Geographic Society (a major sponsor of Peary's expeditions) commissioned the Arctic explorer [[Wally Herbert]] to write an assessment of Peary's original 1909 diary and astronomical observations. As Herbert researched the material, he came to believe that Peary must have falsified his records and concluded that he did not reach the Pole.<ref name=\":1\" /> His book, ''The Noose of Laurels'', caused a furor when it was published in 1989. If Peary did not reach the pole in 1909, Herbert himself would claim the record of being the first to reach the pole on foot.<ref name=\"Herbert\">American Polar Society: Sir Wally Herbert].

Peary's original camera (a 1908 #4 Folding Pocket Kodak) has not survived. As such cameras were made with at least six different lenses from various manufacturers, the focal length of the lens\u2014and hence the shadow analysis based on it\u2014must be considered uncertain at best.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The NGS has never released Peary's photos for an independent analysis. Specialists questioned the Society's conclusions.<ref>\"Washington Post\", December 12, 1989; \"Scientific American\", March and June, 1990</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe NGS commissioned the Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation to resolve the issue. Their 1989 report concluded that Peary had indeed reached the Pole.  Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the NGS, said, \"I consider this the end of a historic controversy and the confirmation of due justice to a great explorer.\"<ref>Thomas D. Davies, ''Robert E. Peary At The North Pole'', Starpath Publications, 17 Dec 2009; {{ISBN|9780914025207}}</ref>\n\n====Review of depth soundings====\nSupporters of Peary and Henson assert that the depth soundings they made on the outward journey have been matched by recent surveys, and so their claim of having reached the Pole is confirmed.<ref>[http://www.matthewhenson.com/northpoleproofDEPTH2.htm \"Proof Henson & Peary reached Pole\"], ''Matthew A Henson website''. Retrieved August 11, 2007.</ref> Only the first few of the Peary party's soundings, taken nearest the shore, touched bottom; experts have said their usefulness is limited to showing that he was above deep water.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}<ref>Peary's expedition possessed 4000 fathoms of sounding line, but he took only 2000 with him over an ocean already established as being deeper in many regions.

They ensured their sled weights were the same as Peary's sleds throughout their journey. They reached the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours\u2014nearly five hours faster than Peary.<ref>Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/det.htm#pdxm Zero]</ref> Avery writes on his web site that: <blockquote>The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia.

Avery never exceeded {{convert|90|nmi|km}} in any five-day stretch, and was losing over {{convert|7|mi|km}} a day at this time to the southerly drift of the ice.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Avery matched Peary's overall 37-day total in part because Peary was held up by open water for five days at the Big Lead. But Peary had a team consisting of 133 dogs and 25 men, meaning he was able to keep his \"polar party\" fresh for the sprint to the Pole. Peary's team was more experienced than Avery's at dog sledding.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Cape York monument.JPG|thumb|alt= Photograph of the Peary monument at Cape York, Greenland | Peary monument at [[Cape York, Greenland|Cape York]]]]\nSeveral United States Navy ships have been named {{USS|Robert E.

After initial acceptance of Peary's claim, he later came to doubt Peary's having reached 90\u00b0. \n\nIn his book ''Ninety Degrees North'', polar historian Fergus Fleming describes Peary as \"undoubtedly the most driven, possibly the most successful and probably the most unpleasant man in the annals of polar exploration\".{{uncited quote|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Honors ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nMedals\n* American Geographical Society, [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (1896)\n* American Geographical Society, [[Charles P.

He is best known for claiming to have reached the [[geographic North Pole]] with his expedition on April 6, 1909.\n\nPeary was born in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], but following his father's death at a young age, was raised in [[Portland, Maine]].  He went to a prominent boarding school called Loomis Chaffe. He attended [[Bowdoin College]], then joined the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|National Geodetic Survey]] as a draftsman. Peary enlisted in the navy in 1881, as a civil engineer. In 1885, he was made chief of surveying for the [[Nicaragua Canal]] (which was never built). Peary visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886, making an unsuccessful attempt to cross [[Greenland]] by [[dogsled]]. [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892|He returned in 1891]] much better prepared, and by reaching [[Independence Fjord]] (in what is now known as [[Peary Land]]) proved conclusively that Greenland was an island. He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study [[Inuit]] survival techniques.\n\nOn his 1898\u20131902 expedition, Peary set a new \"[[Farthest North]]\" record by reaching Greenland's northernmost point, [[Cape Morris Jesup]]. Peary made two further expeditions to the Arctic, in 1905\u20131906 and in 1908\u20131909. During the latter, he claimed to have reached the North Pole. Peary received a number of awards from [[Learned society|geographical societies]] during his lifetime, and in 1911 received the [[Thanks of Congress]] and was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]]. He served two terms as president of [[The Explorers Club]] and retired to [[Eagle Island (Casco Bay, Maine)|Eagle Island]].\n\nPeary's claim to have reached the North Pole was widely debated in contemporary newspapers (along with a competing claim made by [[Frederick Cook]]), but eventually won widespread acceptance. In 1989, British explorer [[Wally Herbert]] concluded Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have been as close as {{convert|60|mi|km|0}}. His conclusions have been widely accepted, although disputed by some authorities.\n\n==Early life, education, and career==\n[[File:Peary.jpg|thumb|alt= Photographic portrait of Peary |Peary {{circa|1900}}]]\nRobert Edwin Peary was born on May 6, 1856, in [[Cresson, Pennsylvania]], to Charles N. and Mary P.

After his father died in 1859, Peary's mother moved with their son and settled in [[Portland, Maine]].<ref name=\"NavalHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/peary_roberte.htm |title=Rear Admiral Robert E.

During that time he made a profile survey from the top of Fryeburg's Jockey Cap Rock. The 360-degree survey names the larger hills and mountains visible from the summit. After Peary's death, his boyhood friend, Alfred E. Burton, suggested that the profile survey be made into a monument. It was cast in bronze and set atop a granite cylinder and erected to his memory by the Peary family in 1938. A hike of less than a mile leads visitors to the summit and the monument.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mainetrailfinder.com/trails/trail/jockey-cap|title=Jockey Cap \u2013 Maine Trail Finder|website=www.mainetrailfinder.com|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter college, Peary worked as a draftsman making technical drawings at the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] office in Washington, D.C. He joined the [[United States Navy]] and on October 26, 1881, was commissioned as a civil engineer, with the relative rank of lieutenant.<ref name=NavalHistory/> From 1884 to 1885 he was an assistant engineer on the surveys for the [[Nicaragua Canal]] and later became the engineer in charge. As reflected in a diary entry he made in 1885, during his time in the Navy, he resolved to be the first man to reach the [[North Pole]].<ref name=Mills510/>\n\nIn April 1886, he wrote a paper for the [[National Academy of Sciences]] proposing two methods for crossing Greenland's ice cap. One was to start from the west coast and trek about {{convert|400|mi|km|-1}} to the east coast. The second, more difficult path, was to start from [[Whale Sound]] at the top of the known portion of [[Baffin Bay]] and travel north to determine whether Greenland was an island or if it extended all the way across the Arctic.<ref name=Mills511/> Peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on January 5, 1901, and to commander on April 6, 1902.<ref name=NavalHistory/>\n\n==Initial Arctic expeditions==\nPeary made his first expedition to the [[Arctic]] in 1886, intending to cross Greenland by [[dog sled]], taking the first of his own suggested paths. He was given six months' leave from the Navy, and he received $500 from his mother to book passage north and buy supplies. He sailed on a [[whaler]] to Greenland, arriving in [[Qeqertarsuaq|Godhavn]] on June 6, 1886.<ref name=Mills510/> Peary wanted to make a solo trek, but a young Danish official named Christian Maigaard convinced him he would die if he went out alone. Maigaard and Peary set off together and traveled nearly {{convert|100|mi|km|-1}} due east before turning back because they were short on food. This was the second-farthest penetration of Greenland's ice sheet at the time. Peary returned home knowing more of what was required for long-distance ice trekking.<ref name=Mills511>Mills 2003, p.&nbsp;511.</ref>\n\n[[File:Matthew Henson 1910.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= Photograph of Matthew Henson dressed in polar gear | [[Matthew Henson]], Peary's assistant, in 1910]]\nBack in Washington attending with the US Navy, in November 1887 Peary was ordered  to survey likely routes for a proposed Nicaragua Canal. To complete his tropical outfit he needed a sun hat. He went to a men's clothing store where he met 21-year-old [[Matthew Henson]], a black man working as a sales clerk. Learning that Henson had six years of seagoing experience as a [[cabin boy]],<ref name=Nuttall856>Nuttall 2012, p.&nbsp;856.</ref> Peary immediately hired him as a personal [[valet]].<ref name=Nuttall855>Nuttall 2012, p.&nbsp;855.</ref>\n\nOn assignment in the jungles of Nicaragua, Peary told Henson of his dream of Arctic exploration. Henson accompanied Peary on every one of his subsequent Arctic expeditions, becoming his field assistant and \"first man\", a critical member of his team.<ref name=Mills511/><ref name=Nuttall855/>\n\n==Second Greenland expedition==\nIn 1891, [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892|Peary returned to Greenland]], taking the second, more difficult route that he laid out in 1886: traveling farther north to find out whether Greenland was a larger landmass extending to the North Pole. He was financed by several groups, including the [[American Geographic Society]], the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University|Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences]], and the [[Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]]. Members of this expedition included Peary's aide Henson, [[Frederick A. Cook]], who served as the group's surgeon; the expedition's ethnologist, Norwegian skier [[Eivind Astrup]]; bird expert and marksman [[Langdon Gibson]], and [[John M. Verhoeff]], who was a weatherman and mineralogist. Peary also took his wife along as dietitian, though she had no formal training.<ref name=Mills511/> Newspaper reports criticized Peary for bringing his wife.<ref name=\"Conefrey\">{{cite book |title=How to Climb Mt.

A dwelling was built for his recuperation during the next six months. Josephine stayed with Peary. Gibson, Cook, Verhoeff, and Astrup hunted game by boat and became familiar with the area and the [[Inuit]] people.<ref name=Mills511/>\n\n[[File: Robert Edwin Peary.jpg|thumb|right|upright| alt= Photograph of Peary dressed in furs to survive winter | Peary was one of the first Arctic explorers to study Inuit survival techniques.]]\nUnlike most previous explorers, Peary had studied Inuit survival techniques; he built [[igloo]]s during the expedition and dressed in practical furs in the native fashion. By wearing furs to preserve body heat and building igloos, he was able to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march.  Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system\u2014which he called the \"Peary system\"\u2014of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel. The Inuit were curious about the American party and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by their body odor (they did not bathe), their flea infestations and their food. She studied the people, however, and kept a journal of her experiences.<ref name=Conefrey/><ref name=\"year\"/> In September 1891, Peary's men took dog sled teams and pushed inland onto the ice sheet to lay caches of supplies. They did not go farther than {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} from Red Cliff.<ref name=Mills511/>\n\nPeary's leg mended by February 1892. By April, he made some short trips with Josephine and an Inuit dog sled driver to native villages to purchase supplies. On May 3, 1892, Peary finally set out on the intended trek with Henson, Gibson, Cook, and Astrup. At about the {{convert|150|mi|km|-1|adj=on}} mark, Peary continued on with Astrup. The two found the {{convert|1000|m|ft|adj=on}} high view from Navy Cliff to be revealing: they saw [[Independence Fjord]] and concluded that Greenland was an island.

With insufficient food, and  uncertainty whether he could negotiate the ice between himself and land, he made the best possible dash and barely escaped with his life from the melting ice. On April 20, he was no farther north than 86\u00b030' latitude. For obvious reasons, this latitude was never published by Peary. It is in a typescript of his April 1906 diary, discovered by [[Wally Herbert]] in his assessment commissioned by the [[National Geographic Society]] in the late 1980s. (Herbert, 1989). The typescript suddenly stopped there, one day before Peary's April 21 purported \"farthest\".

They wintered near [[Cape Sheridan]] on Ellesmere Island, and from Ellesmere departed for the pole on February 28, 1909. The last support party was turned back from Bartlett Camp on April 1, in a latitude no greater than 87\u00b0 45' N. The figure is based upon Bartlett's slight miscomputation of the distance of a single [[Thomas Hubbard Sumner|Sumner line]] from the pole.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOn the final stage of the journey toward the North Pole, Peary told Bartlett to stay behind. He continued with five assistants, none capable of making navigation observations: [[Matthew Henson]], Ootah, Egigingwah, Seegloo, and Ooqueah. On April 6, he established Camp Jesup within {{convert|5|mi|spell=in|0}} of the pole.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Henson scouted ahead to what was thought to be the North Pole site; he returned with the greeting, \"I think I'm the first man to sit on top of the world,\" much to Peary's chagrin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://geog.ucsb.edu/who-was-the-first-person-to-reach-the-north-pole/|title=Who Was the First Person To Reach the North Pole? {{!}} UC Geography|website=geog.ucsb.edu|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>\n\nPeary was unable to fully enjoy the fruits of his labors.

Others have suggested that he was guilty of deliberately exaggerating his accomplishments. Peary's account has been newly criticized by [[Pierre Berton]] (2001) and Bruce Henderson (2005).\n\n===Lack of independent validation===\nPeary did not submit his evidence for review to neutral national or international parties or to other explorers.<ref name=\":0\" /> Peary's claim was certified by the National Geographic Society (NGS) in 1909 after a cursory examination of Peary's records, as NGS was a major sponsor of his expedition.<ref name=\":0\" /> This was a few weeks before Cook's Pole claim was rejected by a Danish panel of explorers and navigational experts.\n\nThe National Geographic Society limited access to Peary's records.

This was further exacerbated by Peary's failure to produce records of observed data for steering, for the direction (\"[[Magnetic declination|variation]]\") of the compass, for his longitudinal position at any time, or for zeroing-in on the pole either latitudinally or transversely beyond Bartlett Camp.<ref>Herbert, 1989; Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#wpst Contributions]</ref>\n\n====Inconsistent speeds====\n[[File:PearyBartlett.png|thumb|alt= Photograph of Peary and Robert Bartlett | Peary and Robert Bartlett at [[Battle Harbour]] in 1909]]\nThe last five marches when Peary was accompanied by a navigator (Capt. Bob Bartlett) averaged no better than {{convert|13|mi|km}} marching north. But once the last support party turned back at \"Camp Bartlett\", where Bartlett was ordered southward, at least {{convert|133|nmi|km}} from the pole, Peary's claimed speeds immediately doubled for the five marches to Camp Jesup. The recorded speeds quadrupled during the two and a half-day return to Camp Bartlett&nbsp;\u2013 at which point his speed slowed drastically. Peary's account of a beeline journey to the pole and back\u2014which would have assisted his claim of such speed\u2014is contradicted by his companion Henson's account of tortured detours to avoid \"pressure ridges\" (ice floes' rough edges, often a few meters high) and \"leads\" (open water between those floes).\n\nIn his official report, Peary claimed to have traveled a total of  304 nautical miles between April 2, 1909, (when he left Bartlett's last camp) and April 9 (when he returned there), {{convert|133|nmi|km}} to the pole, the same distance back, and {{convert|38|nmi|km}} in the vicinity of the pole.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} These distances are counted without detours due to drift, leads and difficult ice, i.e. the distance traveled must have been significantly higher to make good the distance claimed.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Peary and his party arrived back in Cape Columbia on the morning of April 23, 1909, only about two and a half days after Capt Bartlett, yet Peary claimed he had traveled a minimum of {{convert|304|nmi|km}} more than Bartlett (to the Pole and vicinity).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe conflicting and unverified claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his Antarctic expedition so as to leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the South Pole, which\u2014like [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s a month later in 1912\u2014was supported by the sextant, [[theodolite]], and compass observations of several other navigators.\n\n====Review of Peary's diary====\n[[File:Diary of Robert E. Peary - NARA - 304960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt= Photograph of Peary's diary entry for his arrival at the North pole | Peary's diary entry for arrival at the [[North Pole]]]]\nThe diary that Robert E. Peary kept on his 1909 polar expedition was finally made available for research in 1986. Historian [[Larry Schweikart]] examined it, finding that: the writing was consistent throughout (giving no evidence of post-expedition alteration), that there were consistent [[pemmican]] and other stains on all pages, and that all evidence was consistent with a conclusion that Peary's observations were made on the spot he claimed. Schweikart compared the reports and experiences of Japanese explorer [[Naomi Uemura]], who reached the North Pole alone in 1978, to those of Peary and found they were consistent.<ref>[[Larry Schweikart]], \"Polar Revisionism and the Peary Claim: The Diary of Robert E. Peary,\" ''The Historian'', XLVIII, May 1986.</ref> However, Peary made no entries in the diary on the crucial days of April 6 and 7, 1909, and his famous words \"The Pole at Last!\", allegedly written in his diary at the pole, were written on loose slips of paper that were inserted into the diary.\n\n====1984 and 1989 National Geographic Society studies====\nIn 1984 the National Geographic Society (a major sponsor of Peary's expeditions) commissioned the Arctic explorer [[Wally Herbert]] to write an assessment of Peary's original 1909 diary and astronomical observations. As Herbert researched the material, he came to believe that Peary must have falsified his records and concluded that he did not reach the Pole.<ref name=\":1\" /> His book, ''The Noose of Laurels'', caused a furor when it was published in 1989. If Peary did not reach the pole in 1909, Herbert himself would claim the record of being the first to reach the pole on foot.<ref name=\"Herbert\">American Polar Society: Sir Wally Herbert].

Peary's original camera (a 1908 #4 Folding Pocket Kodak) has not survived. As such cameras were made with at least six different lenses from various manufacturers, the focal length of the lens\u2014and hence the shadow analysis based on it\u2014must be considered uncertain at best.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The NGS has never released Peary's photos for an independent analysis. Specialists questioned the Society's conclusions.<ref>\"Washington Post\", December 12, 1989; \"Scientific American\", March and June, 1990</ref><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe NGS commissioned the Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation to resolve the issue. Their 1989 report concluded that Peary had indeed reached the Pole.  Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the NGS, said, \"I consider this the end of a historic controversy and the confirmation of due justice to a great explorer.\"<ref>Thomas D. Davies, ''Robert E. Peary At The North Pole'', Starpath Publications, 17 Dec 2009; {{ISBN|9780914025207}}</ref>\n\n====Review of depth soundings====\nSupporters of Peary and Henson assert that the depth soundings they made on the outward journey have been matched by recent surveys, and so their claim of having reached the Pole is confirmed.<ref>[http://www.matthewhenson.com/northpoleproofDEPTH2.htm \"Proof Henson & Peary reached Pole\"], ''Matthew A Henson website''.

They ensured their sled weights were the same as Peary's sleds throughout their journey. They reached the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours\u2014nearly five hours faster than Peary.<ref>Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/det.htm#pdxm Zero]</ref> Avery writes on his web site that: <blockquote>The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from Cape Columbia.

Avery never exceeded {{convert|90|nmi|km}} in any five-day stretch, and was losing over {{convert|7|mi|km}} a day at this time to the southerly drift of the ice.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Avery matched Peary's overall 37-day total in part because Peary was held up by open water for five days at the Big Lead. But Peary had a team consisting of 133 dogs and 25 men, meaning he was able to keep his \"polar party\" fresh for the sprint to the Pole. Peary's team was more experienced than Avery's at dog sledding.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Cape York monument.JPG|thumb|alt= Photograph of the Peary monument at Cape York, Greenland | Peary monument at [[Cape York, Greenland|Cape York]]]]\nSeveral United States Navy ships have been named {{USS|Robert E.

The same production method was adopted in 1909 by the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', in 1927 by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and eventually by virtually all the other national newspapers. Printing of the ''Scottish Daily Mail'' was switched from Edinburgh to the Deansgate plant in Manchester in 1968 and, for a while, ''[[The People]]'' was also printed on the ''Mail'' presses in Deansgate. In 1987, printing at Deansgate ended and the northern editions were thereafter printed at other Associated Newspapers plants.\n\nIn 1906 the paper offered \u00a310,000 for the first flight from London to [[Manchester]], followed by a \u00a31,000 prize for the first flight across the [[English Channel]].

Fifteen hundred members of the [[London Stock Exchange]] burned unsold copies and called for a boycott of the Harmsworth Press. Prime Minister [[H. H.

But light-hearted stunts enlivened him, such as the 'Hat campaign' in the winter of 1920.

In 1928, the newspaper established an early example of an [[offshore radio]] station aboard a yacht, both as a means of self-promotion and as a way to break the BBC's monopoly. However, the project failed as the equipment was not able to provide a decent signal from overboard, and the transmitter was replaced by a set of speakers. The yacht spent the summer entertaining beach-goers with gramophone records interspersed with publicity for the newspaper and its insurance fund. The ''Mail'' was also a frequent sponsor on [[Border blaster|continental commercial radio stations targeted towards Britain]] throughout the 1920s and 1930s and periodically voiced support for the legalisation of private radio, something that would not happen until 1973.\n\nFrom 1923 Lord Rothermere and the ''Daily Mail'' formed an alliance with the other great press baron, [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]]. Their opponent was the Conservative Party politician and leader [[Stanley Baldwin]].

In early 1930 the two Lords launched the [[United Empire Party]] which the ''Daily Mail'' supported enthusiastically.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe rise of the new party dominated the newspaper and, even though Beaverbrook soon withdrew, Rothermere continued to campaign. Vice Admiral [[Ernest Augustus Taylor]] fought the first by-election for the [[United Empire Party]] in October, defeating the official Conservative candidate by 941 votes. Baldwin's position was now in doubt, but in 1931 [[Duff Cooper]] won the key [[1931 Westminster St George's by-election|by-election at St George's, Westminster]], beating the United Empire Party candidate, Sir [[Ernest Petter]], supported by Rothermere, and this broke the political power of the press barons.<ref name=\"Dennis2006\">{{cite book|title=Fleet Street|chapter=13.

The same production method was adopted in 1909 by the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', in 1927 by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and eventually by virtually all the other national newspapers. Printing of the ''Scottish Daily Mail'' was switched from Edinburgh to the Deansgate plant in Manchester in 1968 and, for a while, ''[[The People]]'' was also printed on the ''Mail'' presses in Deansgate. In 1987, printing at Deansgate ended and the northern editions were thereafter printed at other Associated Newspapers plants.\n\nIn 1906 the paper offered \u00a310,000 for the first flight from London to [[Manchester]], followed by a \u00a31,000 prize for the first flight across the [[English Channel]].

In 1928, the newspaper established an early example of an [[offshore radio]] station aboard a yacht, both as a means of self-promotion and as a way to break the BBC's monopoly. However, the project failed as the equipment was not able to provide a decent signal from overboard, and the transmitter was replaced by a set of speakers. The yacht spent the summer entertaining beach-goers with gramophone records interspersed with publicity for the newspaper and its insurance fund. The ''Mail'' was also a frequent sponsor on [[Border blaster|continental commercial radio stations targeted towards Britain]] throughout the 1920s and 1930s and periodically voiced support for the legalisation of private radio, something that would not happen until 1973.\n\nFrom 1923 Lord Rothermere and the ''Daily Mail'' formed an alliance with the other great press baron, [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]]. Their opponent was the Conservative Party politician and leader [[Stanley Baldwin]].

In early 1930 the two Lords launched the [[United Empire Party]] which the ''Daily Mail'' supported enthusiastically.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe rise of the new party dominated the newspaper and, even though Beaverbrook soon withdrew, Rothermere continued to campaign. Vice Admiral [[Ernest Augustus Taylor]] fought the first by-election for the [[United Empire Party]] in October, defeating the official Conservative candidate by 941 votes. Baldwin's position was now in doubt, but in 1931 [[Duff Cooper]] won the key [[1931 Westminster St George's by-election|by-election at St George's, Westminster]], beating the United Empire Party candidate, Sir [[Ernest Petter]], supported by Rothermere, and this broke the political power of the press barons.<ref name=\"Dennis2006\">{{cite book|title=Fleet Street|chapter=13.
