Thus, due to his correct behaviour and tall stature,\u00a0standing at {{height|ft=6|in=2}}, he was nicknamed ''Il Gigante Buono'' \u2013 The Gentle Giant.<ref name=tuttojuve/>\n\nHis brother, [[Mel Charles]] and nephew [[Jeremy Charles]], also represented Wales. His grandson, [[Jake Charles]], currently plays for Stafford Rangers, and has represented Wales at youth level.\n\n==Club career==\nCharles was born in the [[Cwmbwrla]] district of [[Swansea]] during late 1931. Charles would play football as a child, with younger brother [[Mel Charles]] who also went on to become a professional, later playing alongside each other for the Welsh national team.<ref>[http://www.royoftherovers.com/halloffame/charles.htm RoyoftheRovers.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106142154/http://www.royoftherovers.com/halloffame/charles.htm |date= 6 January 2007 }}</ref>\n\nWhile still at school, Charles joined the boys section of the local team Swansea Town, who later became [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]. When he left school at age 14 he was taken onto the groundstaff at [[Vetch Field]], yet because of his young age [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] Swansea never gave him a first-team call up. His only senior appearances came for the reserve side in the [[Welsh Football League]].\n\n===Leeds United first spell===\nWhile playing for Gendros, a local youth club, he was scouted by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and given a trial in September 1948. At his trial he impressed and duly signed for them at the age of 17, relocating to [[Yorkshire]].\n\n[[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Buckley]], then manager of Leeds, selected Charles in a variety of positions including right-back, centre-half and left-half for Leeds Reserves.\n\nCharles made his first team debut as a centre back for Leeds United in a friendly versus [[Dumfries]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] on 19 April 1949. Charles was tasked with marking the incumbent [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] centre forward [[Billy Houliston]], who ten days previously at [[Wembley]] had run the England defence ragged as the Scots won 3\u20131. The score at Elland Road was 0\u20130. After the game Houliston said 17-year-old Charles was \"the best centre half I've ever played against\".<ref name=QoS />\n[[File:John Charles, Wales versus Scotland, Ninian Park, 1954.jpg|left|thumb|Charles in 1954, Wales versus Scotland, Ninian Park]]\nCharles made his league debut against Blackburn Rovers also in April 1949, playing at centre-half. From 1950 until 1952 Charles was away on National Service with the 12th Royal Lancers at Carlisle. The army allowed him to turn out for Leeds but also saw to it that he played for them, and in 1952 Charles skippered his side to the Army Cup. It was during this period that he had operations to repair cartilages in both knees.\n\nAfter his return to the Leeds side in November 1951 Charles played at centre-forward and centre half. This prompted a debate as to where Charles should play in the team, but he remained at centre-half until the 1952\u201353 season. In October 1952, he was switched to Centre forward and immediately started to score, with 11 goals in 6 games. In 1955 he was appointed club captain and during the 1955\u201356 season Leeds won promotion to the first division with Charles in sparkling form scoring 29 goals in 42 appearances. In the following season Charles scored a new club top flight record tally of 38 goals in 40 league appearances as Leeds secured an 8th-place finish in the first division, before moving finally moving away from the club. His influence on Leeds' success during his final season was so strong, reporters nicknamed the club 'John Charles United'.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/archie-gibson-tenacious-midfielder-for-leeds-united-8076917.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Archie Gibson: Tenacious midfielder for Leeds United | date=24 August 2012}}</ref> In total he scored 150 league goals in eight years for Leeds, including a club record 42 goals in 39 appearances during the 1953\u201354 season. He remains the second highest all time goal scorer for Leeds after Peter Lorimer.\n\n===Playing in Italy with Juventus===\nIn August 1957 he joined the Italian club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for a then British record \u00a365,000 transfer fee, almost doubling the previous record. The transfer was notable as Charles became one of the first British professional players to be signed for an overseas team after [[John Fox Watson]] led the way moving from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 1948.<ref name=tuttojuve/>\n\nHis debut came on 8 September 1957 against [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]]. Goals from Boniperti and S\u00edvori had made the score 2\u20132 when up popped Charles to score the winner. The following week he scored the only goal in the victory over Udinese and he then hit the decisive strike in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. He had been the match-winner in his first three games.<ref name=tuttojuve/>\n\n[[File:Juventus FC - 'Magical Trio' (S\u00edvori, Charles, Boniperti).jpg|thumb|right|The Holy Trident: Charles with [[Omar S\u00edvori|S\u00edvori]] and [[Giampiero Boniperti|Boniperti]] at Juventus]]\nIn his first season in Italy, Charles was [[Capocannoniere|Serie A's top scorer]] with 28 goals, and was voted player of the season as Juventus won the Scudetto. He played in [[Turin]] for five years, scoring 108 goals in 155 matches, winning the [[scudetto]] ([[Serie A|Italian league championship]]) three times, and the [[Coppa Italia|Italian Cup]] twice. He placed third in the [[Ballon d'Or]] in [[1959 Ballon d'Or|1959]]. His prolific partnership with S\u00edvori and Boniperti in Juventus's front-line earned the trio the nicknames ''The Holy Trident'' and ''The Magical Trio''; Charles was also dubbed ''Il Gigante Buono'' (The Gentle Giant) during his five seasons with the club, due to his size and fair play.<ref name=tuttojuve/> The respect Charles earned from Juventus fans was shown when, on the occasion of the club's centenary in 1997, they voted him the club's best-ever foreign player.<ref>[http://archive.theoxfordtimes.net/2004/2/24/14286.html Oxford Times, 24 February 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228032635/http://archive.theoxfordtimes.net/2004/2/24/14286.html |date=28 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Returning to Leeds===\nFollowing his time at Juventus, [[Don Revie]] paid a club record \u00a353,000 to secure the return to Yorkshire of John Charles. As a result of the excitement this created, Leeds United raised admission prices for the start of the 1962\u201363 season. Charles second spell at Elland Road was less successful. After five years in Italy he found it difficult to adjust to life and football back in Britain.\n\n===Roma===\nAfter 11 games and three goals \u2013 a shadow of his former strike rate \u2013 Charles was sold for \u00a370,000 to [[A.S. Roma]]. Initially, the move was a success and Charles scored within fifteen minutes of his first game for Roma, in a match against Bologna. The early promise was never fulfilled, however, and Charles was on the move again a year later.\n\n===Later career===\nHe left to join [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] where he stayed until 1966, which marked the end of his league career.\nHe later became manager of [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] and [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]], and technical director of the Canadian team [[Hamilton Steelers (CSL)|Hamilton Steelers]], who he became coach of midway through the 1987 season.\n\n==International career==\n\nCharles first played for the [[Welsh national football team|Wales national team]] shortly after his 18th birthday.\n\nHe played for Wales at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] in Sweden \u2013 to date the only time the nation has qualified for the competition. It was also [[National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup|the only time]] all four of the [[Home Nations]] qualified for the same World Cup, though only Wales and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] made it past the group stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles|2009|p=14}}</ref> Wales remained undefeated in the group stage, battling to draws with [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] (thanks to a Charles goal), [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], and eventual runners-up [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. As Hungary also recorded three points, a play-off match ensued, and Wales came from behind at the [[R\u00e5sunda Stadium]] to advance with a 2\u20131 win; however, Charles was injured in the match and missed out on the rest of the tournament. The Welsh were eventually knocked out by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-finals thanks to a goal by [[Pel\u00e9]] in the 66th minute: the Brazilians went on to [[1958 FIFA World Cup Final|win the competition]]. Wales manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] said that \"with John Charles in the side we might have won\".<ref>{{harvnb|Charles|2009|p=18}}</ref>\n\nIn total for Wales, Charles made 38 appearances and scored 15 goals.\n\nCharles played for the [[United Kingdom national football team|Great Britain]] team against  Ireland in 1955.\n\n==Life after football==\nFollowing his retirement from football, Charles became the landlord of the New Inn public house on Elland Road, [[Churwell]], [[Leeds]] which later was also managed by another Leeds United player and Wales international, [[Byron Stevenson]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Keating | first = Frank | title = Frank Keating interviews Leeds legend John Charles | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 24 December 2001 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/dec/24/newsstory.sport2 | accessdate = 11 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref> On 16 June 2001, as part of [[2001 Birthday Honours|that year's]] [[Queen's Birthday Honours]], he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] \"for services to Association Football\".<ref name=\"LG 16 June 2001\">{{London Gazette |issue=56237 |date=16 June 2001 |pages=7\u20138  |supp=y }}</ref> Until shortly before his death he continued to attend every Leeds United home game.

Charles became an Inaugural Inductee to the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in 2002.

As a [[Striker (association football)|striker]], he was renowned for being a prolific goalscorer, as he was capable of scoring with either foot, courtesy of his powerful and accurate shot; due to his height, physique, and strength, as well as his heading power and accuracy, he also excelled in the air, which made him an aerial goal threat. Despite his size, he was also a fast player, with good technical skills and passing ability, which allowed him both to score and create goals. In addition to his ability, he was also known for his correct behaviour on the pitch, which along with his stature, earned him the nickname ''Il Gigante Buono'' (The Gentle Giant).<ref name=ilpalloneracconta/><ref name=tuttojuve/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/news/pavoletti-e-i-grandi-specialisti-di-testa-dell-italia-e-del-mond-85255 |title=Pavoletti e i grandi specialisti di testa dell'Italia e del mondo |publisher=www.calciomercato.com |author1=Furio Zara |language=Italian |date=15 May 2018 |accessdate=1 May 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nThe John Charles Lounge in Aberystwyth Town Football Club's ground is named after Charles. The [[John Charles Centre for Sport]] in [[Leeds]] is named after Charles. The West stand at Elland Road is named \"The John Charles Stand\" and the entrance lobby to the Banqueting Suite attached to the back of the stand contains a bust of Charles, in memory of all he did for the club. A street near Elland Road in the [[Wortley, West Yorkshire|Lower Wortley]] area of Leeds is named John Charles Way.\n\nIn the foreword for Charles' autobiography, [[Sir Bobby Robson]] described him as \"incomparable\" and classed him among the all-time footballing greats such as [[Pel\u00e9]], [[Diego Maradona]] and [[George Best]], saying \"Incomparable. John wasn't only one of the greatest footballers who ever lived. He was one of the greatest men ever to play the game.\"<ref name=\"page 11\">{{harvnb|Charles|2009|p=11}}</ref> He also noted that Charles is the only footballing great to be world class in two very different positions.\n\n[[Giampiero Boniperti]], the captain of Juventus when Charles had joined the Bianconeri, spoke of the Welshman's nature as a person: \"I would say he was from another world because of his human qualities. John was one of the most loyal and honest people I have ever met, a very special person.

Thus, due to his correct behaviour and tall stature,\u00a0standing at {{height|ft=6|in=2}}, he was nicknamed ''Il Gigante Buono'' \u2013 The Gentle Giant.<ref name=tuttojuve/>\n\nHis brother, [[Mel Charles]] and nephew [[Jeremy Charles]], also represented Wales. His grandson, [[Jake Charles]], currently plays for Stafford Rangers, and has represented Wales at youth level.\n\n==Club career==\nCharles was born in the [[Cwmbwrla]] district of [[Swansea]] during late 1931. Charles would play football as a child, with younger brother [[Mel Charles]] who also went on to become a professional, later playing alongside each other for the Welsh national team.<ref>[http://www.royoftherovers.com/halloffame/charles.htm RoyoftheRovers.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106142154/http://www.royoftherovers.com/halloffame/charles.htm |date= 6 January 2007 }}</ref>\n\nWhile still at school, Charles joined the boys section of the local team Swansea Town, who later became [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]]. When he left school at age 14 he was taken onto the groundstaff at [[Vetch Field]], yet because of his young age [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] Swansea never gave him a first-team call up. His only senior appearances came for the reserve side in the [[Welsh Football League]].\n\n===Leeds United first spell===\nWhile playing for Gendros, a local youth club, he was scouted by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and given a trial in September 1948. At his trial he impressed and duly signed for them at the age of 17, relocating to [[Yorkshire]].\n\n[[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Major Buckley]], then manager of Leeds, selected Charles in a variety of positions including right-back, centre-half and left-half for Leeds Reserves.\n\nCharles made his first team debut as a centre back for Leeds United in a friendly versus [[Dumfries]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] on 19 April 1949. Charles was tasked with marking the incumbent [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] centre forward [[Billy Houliston]], who ten days previously at [[Wembley]] had run the England defence ragged as the Scots won 3\u20131. The score at Elland Road was 0\u20130. After the game Houliston said 17-year-old Charles was \"the best centre half I've ever played against\".<ref name=QoS />\n[[File:John Charles, Wales versus Scotland, Ninian Park, 1954.jpg|left|thumb|Charles in 1954, Wales versus Scotland, Ninian Park]]\nCharles made his league debut against Blackburn Rovers also in April 1949, playing at centre-half. From 1950 until 1952 Charles was away on National Service with the 12th Royal Lancers at Carlisle. The army allowed him to turn out for Leeds but also saw to it that he played for them, and in 1952 Charles skippered his side to the Army Cup. It was during this period that he had operations to repair cartilages in both knees.\n\nAfter his return to the Leeds side in November 1951 Charles played at centre-forward and centre half. This prompted a debate as to where Charles should play in the team, but he remained at centre-half until the 1952\u201353 season. In October 1952, he was switched to Centre forward and immediately started to score, with 11 goals in 6 games. In 1955 he was appointed club captain and during the 1955\u201356 season Leeds won promotion to the first division with Charles in sparkling form scoring 29 goals in 42 appearances. In the following season Charles scored a new club top flight record tally of 38 goals in 40 league appearances as Leeds secured an 8th-place finish in the first division, before moving finally moving away from the club. His influence on Leeds' success during his final season was so strong, reporters nicknamed the club 'John Charles United'.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/archie-gibson-tenacious-midfielder-for-leeds-united-8076917.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Archie Gibson: Tenacious midfielder for Leeds United | date=24 August 2012}}</ref> In total he scored 150 league goals in eight years for Leeds, including a club record 42 goals in 39 appearances during the 1953\u201354 season. He remains the second highest all time goal scorer for Leeds after Peter Lorimer.\n\n===Playing in Italy with Juventus===\nIn August 1957 he joined the Italian club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for a then British record \u00a365,000 transfer fee, almost doubling the previous record. The transfer was notable as Charles became one of the first British professional players to be signed for an overseas team after [[John Fox Watson]] led the way moving from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in 1948.<ref name=tuttojuve/>\n\nHis debut came on 8 September 1957 against [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]]. Goals from Boniperti and S\u00edvori had made the score 2\u20132 when up popped Charles to score the winner. The following week he scored the only goal in the victory over Udinese and he then hit the decisive strike in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. He had been the match-winner in his first three games.<ref name=tuttojuve/>\n\n[[File:Juventus FC - 'Magical Trio' (S\u00edvori, Charles, Boniperti).jpg|thumb|right|The Holy Trident: Charles with [[Omar S\u00edvori|S\u00edvori]] and [[Giampiero Boniperti|Boniperti]] at Juventus]]\nIn his first season in Italy, Charles was [[Capocannoniere|Serie A's top scorer]] with 28 goals, and was voted player of the season as Juventus won the Scudetto. He played in [[Turin]] for five years, scoring 108 goals in 155 matches, winning the [[scudetto]] ([[Serie A|Italian league championship]]) three times, and the [[Coppa Italia|Italian Cup]] twice. He placed third in the [[Ballon d'Or]] in [[1959 Ballon d'Or|1959]]. His prolific partnership with S\u00edvori and Boniperti in Juventus's front-line earned the trio the nicknames ''The Holy Trident'' and ''The Magical Trio''; Charles was also dubbed ''Il Gigante Buono'' (The Gentle Giant) during his five seasons with club, due to his size and fair play.<ref name=tuttojuve/> The respect Charles earned from Juventus fans was shown when, on the occasion of the club's centenary in 1997, they voted him the club's best-ever foreign player.<ref>[http://archive.theoxfordtimes.net/2004/2/24/14286.html Oxford Times, 24 February 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228032635/http://archive.theoxfordtimes.net/2004/2/24/14286.html |date=28 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Returning to Leeds===\nFollowing his time at Juventus, [[Don Revie]] paid a club record \u00a353,000 to secure the return to Yorkshire of John Charles. As a result of the excitement this created, Leeds United raised admission prices for the start of the 1962\u201363 season. Charles second spell at Elland Road was less successful. After five years in Italy he found it difficult to adjust to life and football back in Britain.\n\n===Roma===\nAfter 11 games and three goals \u2013 a shadow of his former strike rate \u2013 Charles was sold for \u00a370,000 to [[A.S. Roma]]. Initially, the move was a success and Charles scored within fifteen minutes of his first game for Roma, in a match against Bologna. The early promise was never fulfilled, however, and Charles was on the move again a year later.\n\n===Later career===\nHe left to join [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] where he stayed until 1966, which marked the end of his league career.\nHe later became manager of [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] and [[Merthyr Tydfil F.C.|Merthyr Tydfil]], and technical director of the Canadian team [[Hamilton Steelers (CSL)|Hamilton Steelers]], who he became coach of midway through the 1987 season.\n\n==International career==\n\nCharles first played for the [[Welsh national football team|Wales national team]] shortly after his 18th birthday.\n\nHe played for Wales at the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] in Sweden \u2013 to date the only time the nation has qualified for the competition. It was also [[National team appearances in the FIFA World Cup|the only time]] all four of the [[Home Nations]] qualified for the same World Cup, though only Wales and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] made it past the group stage.<ref>{{harvnb|Charles|2009|p=14}}</ref> Wales remained undefeated in the group stage, battling to draws with [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] (thanks to a Charles goal), [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], and eventual runners-up [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. As Hungary also recorded three points, a play-off match ensued, and Wales came from behind at the [[R\u00e5sunda Stadium]] to advance with a 2\u20131 win; however, Charles was injured in the match and missed out on the rest of the tournament. The Welsh were eventually knocked out by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-finals thanks to a goal by [[Pel\u00e9]] in the 66th minute: the Brazilians went on to [[1958 FIFA World Cup Final|win the competition]]. Wales manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] said that \"with John Charles in the side we might have won\".<ref>{{harvnb|Charles|2009|p=18}}</ref>\n\nIn total for Wales, Charles made 38 appearances and scored 15 goals.\n\nCharles played for the [[United Kingdom national football team|Great Britain]] team against  Ireland in 1955.\n\n==Life after football==\nFollowing his retirement from football, Charles became the landlord of the New Inn public house on Elland Road, [[Churwell]], [[Leeds]] which later was also managed by another Leeds United player and Wales international, [[Byron Stevenson]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Keating | first = Frank | title = Frank Keating interviews Leeds legend John Charles | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 24 December 2001 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/dec/24/newsstory.sport2 | accessdate = 11 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref> On 16 June 2001, as part of [[2001 Birthday Honours|that year's]] [[Queen's Birthday Honours]], he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] \"for services to Association Football\".<ref name=\"LG 16 June 2001\">{{London Gazette |issue=56237 |date=16 June 2001 |pages=7\u20138  |supp=y }}</ref> Until shortly before his death he continued to attend every Leeds United home game.

As a [[Striker (association football)|striker]], he was renowned for being a prolific goalscorer, as he was capable of scoring with either foot, courtesy of his powerful and accurate shot; due to his height, physique, and strength, as well as his heading power and accuracy, he also excelled in the air, which made him an aerial goal threat. Despite his size, he was also a fast player, with good technical skills and passing ability, which allowed him both to score and create goals. In addition to his ability, he was also known for his correct behaviour on the pitch, which along with his stature, earned him the nickname ''Il Gigante Buono'' (The Gentle Giant).<ref name=ilpalloneracconta/><ref name=tuttojuve/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/news/pavoletti-e-i-grandi-specialisti-di-testa-dell-italia-e-del-mond-85255 |title=Pavoletti e i grandi specialisti di testa dell'Italia e del mondo |publisher=www.calciomercato.com |author1=Furio Zara |language=Italian |date=15 May 2018 |accessdate=1 May 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nThe John Charles Lounge in Aberystwyth Town Football Club's ground is named after Charles. The [[John Charles Centre for Sport]] in [[Leeds]] is named after Charles. The West stand at Elland Road is named \"The John Charles Stand\" and the entrance lobby to the Banqueting Suite attached to the back of the stand contains a bust of Charles, in memory of all he did for the club. A street near Elland Road in the [[Wortley, West Yorkshire|Lower Wortley]] area of Leeds is named John Charles Way.\n\nIn the foreword for Charles' autobiography, [[Sir Bobby Robson]] described him as \"incomparable\" and classed him among the all-time footballing greats such as [[Pel\u00e9]], [[Diego Maradona]] and [[George Best]], saying \"Incomparable. John wasn't only one of the greatest footballers who ever lived. He was one of the greatest men ever to play the game.\"<ref name=\"page 11\">{{harvnb|Charles|2009|p=11}}</ref> He also noted that Charles is the only footballing great to be world class in two very different positions.\n\n[[Giampiero Boniperti]], the captain of Juventus when Charles had joined the Bianconeri, spoke of the Welshman's nature as a person: \"I would say he was from another world because of his human qualities. John was one of the most loyal and honest people I have ever met, a very special person. He managed to keep the whole team united, and any quarrels or arguments quietened down as soon as he appeared on the pitch or in the dressing room.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n[[Tottenham Hotspur]] and England player [[Jimmy Greaves]] once stated that \"If I were picking my all-time great British team, or even a world eleven, John Charles would be in it.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} [[Jack Charlton]] said of his former teammate, \"John Charles was a team unto himself. People often say to me, 'Who was the best player you ever saw?', and I answer that it was probably [[Eus\u00e9bio]], [[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano|Di St\u00e9fano]], [[Johan Cruyff|Cruyff]], Pel\u00e9 or our Bob ([[Bobby Charlton]]). But the most effective player I ever saw, the one that made the most difference to the performance of the whole team, was without question John Charles.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nCharles's sporting behavior led international referee [[Clive Thomas]] to say \"If you had 22 players of John's calibre, there would be no need for referees \u2013 only time-keepers.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Honours==\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccermond.com/players/c/charles_john/charles_john_page.php|title=William John Charles \u2013 \"The Gentle Giant\"|publisher=soccermond.com|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''Leeds United'''\n*[[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] runners-up: [[1955\u201356 Football League#Second Division|1955\u201356]]\n\n'''Juventus'''\n*[[Serie A]]: [[1957\u201358 Serie A|1957\u201358]], [[1959\u201360 Serie A|1959\u201360]], [[1960\u201361 Serie A|1960\u201361]]\n*[[Coppa Italia]]: [[1958\u201359 Coppa Italia|1958\u201359]], [[1959\u201360 Coppa Italia|1959\u201360]]\n\n'''Cardiff City'''\n*[[Welsh Cup]]: [[1963\u201364 Welsh Cup|1963\u201364]], [[1964\u201365 Welsh Cup|1964\u201365]]\n\n'''Wales'''\n*[[British Home Championship]]: [[1959\u201360 British Home Championship|1959\u201360]]; runners-up: [[1960\u201361 British Home Championship|1960\u201361]], [[1961\u201362 British Home Championship|1961\u201362]]\n*[[FIFA World Cup]] quarter-finalist: [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]\n\n'''Individual'''\n* [[Football League First Division|English First Division]] Top Scorer: [[1956\u201357 Football League#First Division|1956\u201357]]\n* [[Capocannoniere|Serie A Top Goal-scorer]]: [[1957\u201358 Serie A|1957\u201358]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/italtops.html |title=Italy \u2013 Serie A Top Scorers |publisher=RSSSF |author1=Roberto Di Maggio |author2=Igor Kramarsic |author3=Alberto Novello |date=11 June 2015 |accessdate=2 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031163443/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/italtops.html |archivedate=31 October 2015 }}</ref>\n* [[Ballon d'Or]] \u2013 Third place: [[1959 Ballon d'Or|1959]]\n* [[UEFA Jubilee Awards|UEFA Golden Player]]: Wales\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=QoS>\n{{Cite web\n  | last = McLean\n  | first = Kirk\n  | title = Billy Houliston profile\n  | publisher = [[Queen of the South F.C.]]\n  | url = http://www.qosfc.com/new_legendsview.aspx?playerid=1047\n  | accessdate = 28 May 2011}}\n</ref>\n<ref name=BBC2010-06-16>\n{{cite news\n  | title = Footballer John Charles' Italian medal auctioned\n  | work = [[BBC News Online]]\n  | date = 16 June 2010\n  | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10324664\n  | accessdate = 1 November 2010}}\n</ref>\n<!--ref name=BBC2004-02-24>\n{{cite news\n  | title = John Charles dies\n  | work = [[BBC News Online]]\n  | date = 24 February 2004\n  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3488975.stm\n  | accessdate = 28 May 2011\n  | quote = He was quick, he was strong, he could run with the ball.

According to legend, a group of men who went hunting on this mountain always returned home hungry, having caught only one quail between them. This mountain can be seen from many vantage points in Montpelier, where Hunger Mountain the magazine is located. The initial goals of the magazine were to call attention to established and emerging writers, while also highlighting local Vermont writers and artists. The journal was founded in 2002 by Caroline Mercurio and was made possible through a generous donation from a Vermont College of Fine Arts MFA in Writing alumnus. The premiere issue, released in the fall of 2002, included work by Wally Lamb, Maxine Kumin, and an interview with Grace Paley.

According to legend, a group of men who went hunting on this mountain always returned home hungry, having caught only one quail between them. This mountain can be seen from many vantage points in Montpelier, where Hunger Mountain the magazine is located. The initial goals of the magazine were to call attention to established and emerging writers, while also highlighting local Vermont writers and artists. The journal was founded in 2002 by Caroline Mercurio and was made possible through a generous donation from a Vermont College of Fine Arts MFA in Writing alumnus. The premiere issue, released in the fall of 2002, included work by Wally Lamb, Maxine Kumin, and an interview with Grace Paley.

Heintjes gave some background on the magazine's origins:\n:Rick Marschall and I conceived the idea of ''Hogan's Alley'' in early 1994. We often talked about the type of coverage we wanted cartooning to have, and we would blue-sky about our ideal comics magazine. It sounded so good that&ndash;like a couple of idiots&ndash;we decided to put it out ourselves. In the course of that first issue, we brought David Folkman on board as art director, and he's been an indispensable part of things from the first issue. One thing we felt was important was to connect cartooning's present to its earliest days, so we came up with the title ''Hogan's Alley''. In hindsight, from a marketing point of view, it probably isn't a good title. Most comics fans have no idea what the title represents&ndash;[[the Yellow Kid]]'s neighborhood&ndash;so they don't know that they might be interested in the magazine. Also&ndash;we found this out later&ndash;a Hogan's Alley is a firearms training exercise, so I occasionally get letters from gun owners who felt tricked into picking up the magazine. I am not crazy about the idea of misleading a bunch of gun owners, but we're stuck with the title now. To fund the issue&ndash;the printing and postage and advertising&ndash;we emptied our piggy banks, sold some of our comics stuff and sought investments from friends who thought our idea had merit. The earliest issues all lost money, but it's become largely a break-even endeavor by now. We pay our writers, although David and I have never made a penny from the magazine.<ref name=scoop/>\n\n==Writers==\nThe scope of the magazine ranges from historical articles to coverage of current comic strips. Contributing writers have included [[Ron Goulart]], [[R. C. Harvey]] and [[Allan Holtz]]. In issue #12, Holtz examined the early evolution of [[Sunday comics]] supplements to the daily comic strip, notably ''The Importance of Mister Peewee'', which ran in [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s ''[[New York World]]'' in 1903-04. In that same issue, R. C. Harvey offered an in-depth profile of cartoonist [[Dave Breger]].\n\nInterview subjects have included [[Gus Arriola]], [[C. C.

The Apertura tournament will be played in the second half of 2019, while the Clausura will be played in the first half of 2020.\n\nThe league is one of the few football leagues in the world that has not suspended their season due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Nicaragua|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Omar |title=Mexicans players in Nicaragua play through coronavirus outbreak as fear, uncertainty linger |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/mexico-mex/story/4079002/mexicans-players-in-nicaragua-play-through-coronavirus-outbreak-as-fearuncertainty-lingers |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=4 April 2020 |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe Apertura play-off format was changed from previous years, while the Clausura will use the same 4-team play-off format. For the Apertura, the top four teams from the regular stage advanced to a \"quadrangular\" double-round robin instead of a play-off stage. The regular stage and quadrangular winners would have played to decide the tournament's champion, but ultimately the same team won both and the final was not necessary. The same format was recently adopted by the [[Costa Rican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], but for both half seasons.\n\n== Team information ==\n\nA total of ten teams will contest the league, including eight sides from the [[2017\u201318 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Nicaragua|2017\u201318 Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], and two sides from the [[2018\u201319 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Salvadore\u00f1o|2018\u201319 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]].\n\n[[UNAN Managua]] finished last in the aggregate table and were relegated to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. The champions from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, [[Deportivo Las Sabanas]] were promoted in their place.\n\nThe 9th place team in the aggregate table, [[Chinandega FC]], faced the second place team from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, [[FC Guti\u00e9rrez]], in a playoff for a spot in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n.

the history of the [[Liga Primera de Nicaragua]], the top division of [[association football|football]] in [[Nicaragua]]. The Apertura tournament will be played in the second half of 2019, while the Clausura will be played in the first half of 2020.\n\nThe league is one of the few football leagues in the world that has not suspended their season due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Nicaragua|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Omar |title=Mexicans players in Nicaragua play through coronavirus outbreak as fear, uncertainty linger |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/mexico-mex/story/4079002/mexicans-players-in-nicaragua-play-through-coronavirus-outbreak-as-fearuncertainty-lingers |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=4 April 2020 |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nThe Apertura play-off format was changed from previous years, while the Clausura will use the same 4-team play-off format. For the Apertura, the top four teams from the regular stage advanced to a \"quadrangular\" double-round robin instead of a play-off stage. The regular stage and quadrangular winners would have played to decide the tournament's champion, but ultimately the same team won both and the final was not necessary. The same format was recently adopted by the [[Costa Rican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], but for both half seasons.\n\n== Team information ==\n\nA total of ten teams will contest the league, including eight sides from the [[2017\u201318 Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Nicaragua|2017\u201318 Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], and two sides from the [[2018\u201319 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Salvadore\u00f1o|2018\u201319 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]].\n\n[[UNAN Managua]] finished last in the aggregate table and were relegated to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. The champions from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, [[Deportivo Las Sabanas]] were promoted in their place.\n\nThe 9th place team in the aggregate table, [[Chinandega FC]], faced the second place team from the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, [[FC Guti\u00e9rrez]], in a playoff for a spot in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n.
