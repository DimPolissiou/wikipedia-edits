In the second act of the musical, Nettie Fowler, the cousin of the protagonist Julie Jordan, sings \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" to comfort and encourage Julie when her husband, Billy Bigelow, the male lead, falls on his knife and dies after a failed robbery attempt. It is [[reprise]]d in the final scene to encourage a graduation class of which Louise (Billy and Julie's daughter) is a member. The now invisible Billy, who has been granted the chance to return to Earth for one day in order to redeem himself, watches the ceremony and is able to silently motivate the unhappy Louise to join in the song.\n\nThe song is also sung at [[association football]] clubs around the world, where it is performed by a massed chorus of supporters on matchday; this tradition developed at [[Liverpool F.C.]] after the chart success of the 1963 single of the song by the local [[Liverpool]] group [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]].<ref name=\"Indy\"/>\n\n\"You'll Never Walk Alone\" has rapidly become the world-wide anthem to show support for and encouragement to medical staff, first responders, those impacted by, under restrictions or in quarantine because of the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The classic hits that are now coronavirus anthems |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52068546 |website=BBC News |date=27 March 2020}}</ref> \n\n==Background==\n[[Christine Johnson (actress)|Christine Johnson]], who created the role of Nettie Fowler, introduced the song in the original [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlsUfOjVhrM |title=You'll Never Walk Alone (original version 1945) |work=Youtube |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref>  Later in the show [[Jan Clayton]], as Julie Jordan, reprised it, with the chorus joining in.\n\nIn the film, it is first sung by [[Claramae Turner]] as Nettie.

The Shades moved to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where the band's name changed to \"Little Daddy & the Bachelors\". They recorded a single, \"Too Much Monkey Business\" / \"Junior's Jerk\". Together with bandmember Bobby Taylor, Chong opened a Vancouver nightclub in 1963.  Formerly the Alma Theatre, they called it \"Blue Balls\". They brought in the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before. Although Little Daddy & the Bachelors built up a small following, things soured when they went with Chong's suggestion and had themselves billed as \"Four [[Nigger]]s and a [[Chink]]\"<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Andrew|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p130602|title=Bobby Taylor|work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> (or, bowing to pressure, \"Four N's and a C\") before taking on the moniker [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\nIn 1965, the Vancouvers signed with Gordy Records (a subsidiary of Detroit's [[Motown Records]]). They recorded their debut album, an [[eponymous]] release, and their debut single, the Tommy Chong co-composition, \"Does Your Mama Know About Me,\" which peaked at number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> While on tour in Chicago for a short time, the band followed opening act [[the Jackson 5]].

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn't fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. \"I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don't want to just work for a Berry Gordy. And he says I can, I can dig that. So he was nice.

His case never went to trial, as his attorney negotiated a plea agreement with the US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania's Office. He admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes on the Internet through Nice Dreams, a family company. Chong agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife, Shelby, and his son, Paris. Chong cooperated with the government and was the first of the Operation Pipe Dreams defendants to plead guilty.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAt Chong's sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania Mary McKeen Houghton said in her arguments that Tommy Chong \"used his public image to promote this crime\" and marketed his products to children.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite news |author=Torsten Ove | title=Chong Actor Tommy Chong gets nine months for selling pot pipes| date=September 13, 2003 | newspaper= Pittsburgh Post Gazette| url= http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030912chong0912p5.asp}}</ref> U.S. Attorney [[Mary Beth Buchanan]] also was present at the sentencing in Pittsburgh and released a statement to the press stating, \"there are consequences for violating the law, even if the violator is a well-known entertainer like Thomas Chong.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nWhile Chong argued for community service and home detention at his sentencing, the district judge, [[Arthur J.

They brought in the [[Ike & Tina Turner]] Revue, which had never been to Vancouver before.

Chong was fired by [[Chris Clark (singer)|Chris Clark]] and Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for arriving late to the gig. Later, when Berry Gordy told Chong that he wasn't fired after all, that it had been a mistake, Chong said he wanted to stay fired. \"I said I want to become a Berry Gordy, I don't want to just work for a Berry Gordy.

His case never went to trial, as his attorney negotiated a plea agreement with the US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania's Office. He admitted to distributing 7,500 bongs and water pipes on the Internet through Nice Dreams, a family company. Chong agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife, Shelby, and his son, Paris. Chong cooperated with the government and was the first of the Operation Pipe Dreams defendants to plead guilty.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAt Chong's sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania Mary McKeen Houghton said in her arguments that Tommy Chong \"used his public image to promote this crime\" and marketed his products to children.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite news |author=Torsten Ove | title=Chong Actor Tommy Chong gets nine months for selling pot pipes| date=September 13, 2003 | newspaper= Pittsburgh Post Gazette| url= http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030912chong0912p5.asp}}</ref> U.S. Attorney [[Mary Beth Buchanan]] also was present at the sentencing in Pittsburgh and released a statement to the press stating, \"there are consequences for violating the law, even if the violator is a well-known entertainer like Thomas Chong.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nWhile Chong argued for community service and home detention at his sentencing, the district judge, [[Arthur J.

They questioned why Chong was prosecuted rather than his son Paris Chong, who was CEO of the business. They also pointed to the disparity in sentences between Chong's and those of other defendants and the DEA tactics used in the investigation.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nParis Chong had started Nice Dreams in 1999. He was never charged with his crimes in relation to the investigation as part of a plea bargain. When asked why the government had focused on Chong rather than his son the CEO, US Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan said that \"Tommy Chong was the more responsible corporate officer because he financed and marketed the product.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nOf the 55 people who were subjects of the investigation, Chong was the only one without previous convictions who received jail time.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> When questioned on the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan noted that Chong had never gone to trial and made a plea bargain.

They asked Paris Chong to sell them [[Water pipe percolator|pipes]] through the mail to a fictitious shop in the town of [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]], {{convert|31|mi|km}} from Pittsburgh. Paris Chong had been prohibited from selling to Pittsburgh or anywhere in [[Western Pennsylvania]] because of the successful federal prosecution of Akhil Kumar Mishra and his wife, Rajeshwari, who had two head shops in the city.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Accounts differ as to who in Nice Dreams went against Chong's prohibition, or even if it had been made up by the defense, but the sales did take place to the agents. This enabled the U.S. Attorney to show jurisdiction in Pennsylvania for Chong's illegal activities, as opposed to California, which was the base for Nice Dreams.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn December 2004, Chong was to appear in an off-Broadway show entitled ''[[The Marijuana-Logues]]'', a parody of [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.

The search was one of nine conducted for [[Operation True Test]], an investigation being led by Buchanan, still the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
