At age fifteen he was drafted into service in a German antiaircraft unit. He was captured by the Soviets toward the end of the war. He managed to escape (he said later that escape was relatively easy),<ref name=BG/> and walked hundreds of miles across defeated Germany, arriving in G\u00f6ttingen in 1945. He lacked the necessary documentation for acceptance to university,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Creativity: The psychology of discovery and invention|last=Czikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2013|pages=54}}</ref> but was admitted after he demonstrated his knowledge in an exam. He entered the university's first postwar class.\n\nEigen desired to study Physics, but since returning soldiers who were previously enrolled received priority, he enrolled in Geophysics. He earned an undergraduate degree and entered graduate study in natural sciences. One of his advisors was [[Werner Heisenberg]], the noted proponent of the [[uncertainty principle]].<ref name=BG/> He received his doctorate in 1951.\n\n==Career and research==\nEigen received his Ph.D. at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1951 under supervision of [[Arnold Eucken]].<ref name=mathgene/> In 1964 he presented the results of his research at a meeting of the [[Faraday Society]] in London. His findings demonstrated for the first time that it was possible to determine the rates of chemical reactions that occurred during time intervals as brief as a nanosecond.\n\nBeginning in 1953 Eigen worked at the [[Max Planck Institute]] for Physical Chemistry in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], becoming its director in 1964 and joining it with the Max Planck Institute for Spectroscopy to become the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]].

At age fifteen he was drafted into service in a German antiaircraft unit. He was captured by the Soviets toward the end of the war. He managed to escape (he said later that escape was relatively easy),<ref name=BG/> and walked hundreds of miles across defeated Germany, arriving in G\u00f6ttingen in 1945. He lacked the necessary documentation for acceptance to university,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Creativity: The psychology of discovery and invention|last=Czikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2013|pages=54}}</ref> but was admitted after he demonstrated his knowledge in an exam. He entered the university's first postwar class.\n\nEigen desired to study Physics, but since returning soldiers who were previously enrolled received priority, he enrolled in Geophysics. He earned an undergraduate degree and entered graduate study in natural sciences. One of his advisors was [[Werner Heisenberg]], the noted proponent of the [[uncertainty principle]].<ref name=BG/> He received his doctorate in 1951.\n\n==Career and research==\nEigen received his Ph.D. at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in 1951 under supervision of [[Arnold Eucken]].<ref name=mathgene/> In 1964 he presented the results of his research at a meeting of the [[Faraday Society]] in London. His findings demonstrated for the first time that it was possible to determine the rates of chemical reactions that occurred during time intervals as brief as a nanosecond.\n\nBeginning in 1953 Eigen worked at the [[Max Planck Institute]] for Physical Chemistry in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], becoming its director in 1964 and joining it with the Max Planck Institute for Spectroscopy to become the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]]. He was an honorary professor of the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]]. From 1982 to 1993, Eigen was president of the [[German National Merit Foundation]].
