On 2 June 1946, a [[plebiscite]] of the Italian peoples abolished the monarchy and established a republic. On 1 January 1948, the new constitution of the [[History of the Italian Republic#The birth of the Republic (1946\u20131948)|Italian Republic]] went into effect. The political changes had a notable effect on the arrangement of the ecclesiastical provinces in the Abruzzi, as [[Pope Pius XII]] was well aware. He was especially concerned about the substantial movement of population to Pescara in the first half of the 20th century, and the decision of the Italian government, partially due to destruction of parts of the area during the military operations of World War II, to direct its resources toward the rebuilding and improvement of Pescara. As the capital of a province, Pescara deserved to become the seat of a bishop; but the city extended over two different dioceses, Chieti and Penne.<ref>\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\": ''Hisce namque novissimis temporibus Piscar\u00eda urbs dioecesis Pinnensis, quae ad maris Adriatici oras iacet, tale incrementum sumpsit, ut, magni facta nominis civitas, merito eiusdem nominis Provinciae caput evaserit. Haec Piscar\u00eda urbs nunc ex unione efformata est duorum iam prius exsistentium oppidorum : quorum alterum, Piscar\u00eda nuncupatum, ad Theatinam archidioecesim pertinet ; alterum vero, cui nomen Castrum Maris Adriatici, intra fines exstat dioecesis Pinnensis; ita ut nova Piscar\u00eda urbs partim Archiepiscopi Theatini, partim Episcopi Pinnensis iurisdictioni subiecta est.''</ref> The Pope, therefore decided on the rearrangement of the diocesan system, which he effected in the Bull ''Dioecesium subscriptiones'' of 1 July 1949.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-42-1950-ocr.pdf \"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\"], ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 42 (1950), pp.&nbsp;135\u2013137.</ref>\n\nFirst of all, the Bull brought together all of the parishes of the city of Pescara, by transferring five parishes from the diocese of Chieti to the diocese of Penne. Second, the seat of the diocese of Penne was transferred from Penne<ref>[[Penne, Abruzzo|Penne]] was a town of only 14,000 persons in 1951.</ref> to the city of Pescara, and its name changed to ''Pinnensis-Piscarensis''. Third, the parish of S. Cetteo in Pescara was elevated to the status of a cathedral, and the Chapter of the cathedral of Penne was transferred to [[Pescara Cathedral|S. Cetteo]]; the Archpriest of the Chapter was to be the parish priest of the cathedral. The cathedral in Penne was named a co-cathedral. The diocesan seminary was transferred to Pescara. Since the diocese of Atri was entirely in the civil province of Teramo, Atri was united ''aequaliter principaliter'' with the diocese of Teramo, forming the diocese of Teramo e Atri.<ref>\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\", p. 136, nos. 2-10.</ref>\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]] made additional changes in the ecclesiastical structure of the Abruzzi. In the Bull ''Ad majorem quidam'' of 2 March 1982, he created a new ecclesiastical province, and named the bishop of Penne-Pescara as the metropolitan archbishop. He assigned the diocese of Teramo e Altri, which had been immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy), as a suffragan of the new archdiocese. He also changed the name of the archdiocese from Penne-Pescara to Pescara-Penne. These changes divested the Papacy of the direct control of two more dioceses.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19820302_pinnensis-piscariensis_lt.html ''Ad maiorem quidem''], ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 74 (1982), pp.&nbsp;533\u2013534.</ref>\n\n===Cathedral and Chapter===\nWhen the diocese of Atri was established in 1251, the number of Canons in the Chapter of the cathedral was fixed at twenty secular Canons. In electing a new bishop, the two Chapters of Canons were to vote together as one body. The number of electors from each Chapter was to be the same, even if one Chapter had more members than the other. For the first round of voting, they could meet in one or the other cathedral, or in some mutually agreed upon place; in subsequent votes they were to meet alternately in Atri and Penne.<ref>Ughelli, p. 1139.</ref>\n\nA document of 4 January 1252 mentions that among the dignities of the Chapter of Penne were the Primicerius and the Archpriest.<ref name=\"Ughelli, p. 1143\">Ughelli, p. 1143.</ref> Another, of 26 January 1260, names the Archdeacon, the Archpriest of civitas S.

On 2 June 1946, a [[plebiscite]] of the Italian peoples abolished the monarchy and established a republic. On 1 January 1948, the new constitution of the [[History of the Italian Republic#The birth of the Republic (1946\u20131948)|Italian Republic]] went into effect. The political changes had a notable effect on the arrangement of the ecclesiastical provinces in the Abruzzi, as [[Pope Pius XII]] was well aware. He was especially concerned about the substantial movement of population to Pescara in the first half of the 20th century, and the decision of the Italian government, partially due to destruction of parts of the area during the military operations of World War II, to direct its resources toward the rebuilding and improvement of Pescara. As the capital of a province, Pescara deserved to become the seat of a bishop; but the city extended over two different dioceses, Chieti and Penne.<ref>\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\": ''Hisce namque novissimis temporibus Piscar\u00eda urbs dioecesis Pinnensis, quae ad maris Adriatici oras iacet, tale incrementum sumpsit, ut, magni facta nominis civitas, merito eiusdem nominis Provinciae caput evaserit.

Second, the seat of the diocese of Penne was transferred from Penne<ref>[[Penne, Abruzzo|Penne]] was a town of only 14,000 persons in 1951.</ref> to the city of Pescara, and its name changed to ''Pinnensis-Piscarensis''. Third, the parish of S. Cetteo in Pescara was elevated to the status of a cathedral, and the Chapter of the cathedral of Penne was transferred to [[Pescara Cathedral|S. Cetteo]]; the Archpriest of the Chapter was to be the parish priest of the cathedral. The cathedral in Penne was named a co-cathedral. The diocesan seminary was transferred to Pescara. Since the diocese of Atri was entirely in the civil province of Teramo, Atri was united ''aequaliter principaliter'' with the diocese of Teramo, forming the diocese of Teramo e Atri.<ref>\"Dioecesium circumscriptiones\", p. 136, nos. 2-10.</ref>\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]] made additional changes in the ecclesiastical structure of the Abruzzi. In the Bull ''Ad majorem quidam'' of 2 March 1982, he created a new ecclesiastical province, and named the bishop of Penne-Pescara as the metropolitan archbishop. He assigned the diocese of Teramo e Altri, which had been immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy), as a suffragan of the new archdiocese. He also changed the name of the archdiocese from Penne-Pescara to Pescara-Penne. These changes divested the Papacy of the direct control of two more dioceses.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19820302_pinnensis-piscariensis_lt.html ''Ad maiorem quidem''], ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 74 (1982), pp.&nbsp;533\u2013534.</ref>\n\n===Cathedral and Chapter===\nWhen the diocese of Atri was established in 1251, the number of Canons in the Chapter of the cathedral was fixed at twenty secular Canons. In electing a new bishop, the two Chapters of Canons were to vote together as one body. The number of electors from each Chapter was to be the same, even if one Chapter had more members than the other. For the first round of voting, they could meet in one or the other cathedral, or in some mutually agreed upon place; in subsequent votes they were to meet alternately in Atri and Penne.<ref>Ughelli, p. 1139.</ref>\n\nA document of 4 January 1252 mentions that among the dignities of the Chapter of Penne were the Primicerius and the Archpriest.<ref name=\"Ughelli, p. 1143\">Ughelli, p. 1143.</ref> Another, of 26 January 1260, names the Archdeacon, the Archpriest of civitas S.

It has been Nissan's most internationally recognized sedan, in multiple body styles, and is known for its dependability and durability. The Bluebird originated from Nissan's first vehicles, dating to the early 1900s, and its traditional competitor became the [[Toyota Corona]]. The Bluebird was positioned to compete with the Corona, as the Corona was developed to continue offering a sedan used as a [[taxicab|taxi]] since [[Toyota Crown]] was growing in size. Every generation of the Bluebird has been available as a taxi, duties that are shared with base level [[Nissan Cedric]]s. It is one of the longest-running nameplates from a Japanese automaker. It spawned most of Nissan's products sold internationally, and has been known by a number of different names and bodystyles, including the 160J/710/Violet/Auster/Stanza line.\n\n== Export and foreign-built model names ==\nExport versions were sold variously as the [[Datsun 510 Sedan|Datsun 510]], Datsun 180B (with 160B and 200B versions) and the Datsun Bluebird. The Nissan Bluebird nameplate began appearing around 1982 as the [[Datsun]] marque was phased out in favour of Nissan.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, Australia followed the Japanese convention by calling its car the Bluebird, and had a unique, facelifted rear-wheel-drive version for 1984 and 1985. That car was replaced in 1986 by the [[Nissan Pintara]]. It would be replaced by the successive Bluebird, also called Pintara, until 1992; then the range was brought in line with the Japanese model, for the U13 series from 1993 to 1997. In an unusual twist, brought about under the short lived [[Button Plan]], the Pintara was also rebadged for [[Ford Australia]] as the [[Ford Corsair]], reviving a Ford UK nameplate last used in the 1960s.\n\nIn the United States, the Bluebird was eventually sold as the [[Nissan Stanza]]. In 1992, the Stanza became the [[Nissan Altima]]. Currently, the Bluebird is not sold in North America; in 1998, the Altima was completely redesigned, becoming a model unique to the North American market. The Bluebird sold in Europe between 1986 and 1990 was in fact a rebadged [[Nissan Auster]]\u2014this was replaced by the [[Nissan Primera|Primera]] in Nissan's European line-up in 1990. A six-cylinder version called the [[Nissan Maxima|Maxima]] was released in the 1980s and became a separate model.\n\n== Historic vehicles ==\nThe DAT corporation had been producing cars since 1914 [Togo, pg. 11], but through the 1920s, much of their profitability depended on government subsidies of their large trucks [Togo, pg. 8]. A 1930 ministerial ordinance by the Japanese government declared that drivers' licenses would not be required for cars with engines up to 500 cc displacement, and that the purchase of these vehicles would be taxed at a lower rate. [Togo, pg. 12] DAT began to produce a small car for this market. The new car was called \"Datson\"(i.e. \"Son of DAT\")<ref name=\"CMad22\">[[Nissan Bluebird#CMad|Madeley]], p. 22</ref> and later \"Datsun\" to distinguish it from the full-sized trucks and cars the company had produced in the past.\n\n=== Datsun Type 10 \u2013 17 ===\n\n==== Type 10 ====\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Type 10\n| production = 1930\n| assembly = Japan\n| designer = Takayoshi Gotou\n| body_style = phaeton, van, roadster\n}}\nIn 1929, DAT built a small-car prototype called the '''DAT 91'''.

[JSAE]. It was offered in several body styles, and DAT/Nissan sold 150 of the Type 11 in 1932. [JSAE] The Type 11 was only produced during the year 1932, as changes in the law allowed Nissan to sell a new model with a larger engine in 1933.\n\nThe Datsun Type 11 had the same engine displacement and external dimensions as an Austin Seven, and information about the British car was widely available within Japan. In October and November 1929, the chief engineer of Austin presented a paper in Tokyo called \"The British Light Car\". This paper is supposed to have provided detailed explanations and illustrations of many of the mechanical components of the Austin Seven.<ref name=CMad22/> The exact relationship between the two cars is, however, in dispute.

The name [[Datsun]] was used by DAT for their line of small cars. After the DAT corporation was absorbed into Nissan, these cars continued to be produced, and the original model name was maintained. The Type 12 was basically similar to the earlier 1932 Type 11, but had a larger engine.\n\nJapanese laws at that time did not require a license to drive automobiles with small-displacement engines. DAT/Nissan produced the Datsun Type 11 as their entry into this market. The original limitation for this class of vehicles was 500 cc displacement engines, but that was changed to 750 cc in 1933. Nissan responded to this change by producing a larger engine, and gave the more powerful car a new name, the Type 12.\n\nThe 1934 '''Datsun Type 13''' went into production in April 1934 with its chassis built in the ''Osaka Plant of the Automotive Division of Tobata Casting'', which merged with ''Nihon Sangyo Co.'' ([[Nissan]]) after selling its factory. Its grille was chrome plated with a tall heart shaped opening instead of the Austin 7 like grille. It is the first Datsun model to have a truck variant called the '''13T''', along as being the first car exported from Japan; a total of 44 vehicles were exported to South Africa and Australia.\n\nThe 1935 '''Datsun Type 14''' is externally very similar to the Type 13 but uses the addition of a leaping rabbit emblem at the front. Mechanically, the old DAT engine of the Datsun 13 was replaced with the Datsun Type 7 engine, a [[Flathead engine|side valve]] 4 cylinder engine with a displacement of 722 cc (44.1 cu in). It marked \"''the birth of the Japanese car industry''\" according to Britain's National Motor Museum at Beaulieu. Nissan produced the vehicle at [[Yokohama]], along with its commercial truck version called the '''14T'''.\n{{-}}\n\n==== Type 15 \u2013 17 ====\n{{See also|Datsun Type 15|Datsun Type 16|Datsun Type 17}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Type 15\n| image = File:Datsun Model 15 Phaeton (17126095594).jpg\n| manufacturer = Datsun/[[Nissan]]\n| production = May 1936\n| assembly = Japan: [[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Yokohama Plant]], [[Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama]]\n| body_style = phaeton, roadster, coupe, sedan, van, truck (15T)\n| engine = 722 cc (44.1 in3) Type 7 I4\n| transmission = 3-speed manual\n| successor = [[Datsun Type 16]]\n}}\nThe 1936 '''Datsun Type 15''' was mechanically very similar to the preceding [[Datsun Type 14]]. The Type 7 engine was retained, by with a higher compression ratio, increased from 5.2 to 5.4, which increased power by 1&nbsp;hp (0.75&nbsp;kW). All Datsun 15 models have bumpers. Both the Type 15 and '''15T''' were produced in Yokohama on May 1936, with the 15T having a different engine cover that has near vertical vents instead of the cars horizontal vents.\n\nThe '''Datsun Type 16''' is the successor of the Type 15. It could only be differentiated externally by detailing on the bonnet and changes in the bonnet mascot and its logo.\n\nThe last Datsun small car is the '''Datsun Type 17''' which is distinguished by a wide vertical bar in middle of the front grille. Production began in April 1938 and, according to Nissan, continued until January 1944. Although David Bent claims that it finished in late 1938 as part of the cessation civilian car production that followed the Japanese decision to focus on military vehicles. The Datsun Type 17T resumed production after the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1949 until the 1955 introduction of the all new [[Datsun Truck|Datsun 120-series truck]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Datsun 16 Sedan 1937.jpg|1937 Datsun Type 16 2-door sedan\nFile:1938 Datsun Model 17 Phaeton.jpg|The Datsun Type 17 is the last Datsun small car\n</gallery>\n\n{{-}}\n\n=== Datsun DA/DB/DC/DS/DW series ===\n{{see also|Datsun DA|Datsun DB Series|Datsun DC-3|Datsun DS series}}\n[[File:1953 Datsun DB-4.jpg|thumb|1953 Datsun DB-4]]\nNissan resumed automobile production starting in November 1947 with the Datsun DA series,<ref>{{cite web |title=Datsun DA series |url=http://www.earlydatsun.com/index.html |website=Early Datsun |accessdate=18 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804231444/http://www.earlydatsun.com/index.html |archivedate=4 August 2010  }}</ref> in a resumed engineering cooperation with the British [[Austin Motor Company]], who shared various contributions to Nissan. The DA was a very modest and simple car based on the Type 17, with the slightly larger DB series added in March 1948. Nissan also offered commercial vehicles, and the DA was sold as the Datsun 1121 truck, which was essentially the DA with a shortened cab for the front seat and an exposed cargo area attached to the chassis. An open-top roadster/convertible called the Datsun DC-3 appeared 12 January 1952, largely created by Yuichi Ohta. Yuichi was the son of Hiro Ohta, who founded the [[Ohta Jidosha]] car company, which produced cars in Japan between 1934 and 1957, until it became part of [[Tokyu Kogyo Kurogane]] shortly thereafter.

Sedans built in Japan during the 1950s were introduced to serve as taxis, and introduced mass production vehicles, as opposed to earlier vehicles made using a slower hand-made process.\n\nThis sedan was designed to be compliant with the Japanese Government's [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] passed in 1950. The engine displacement was also kept below the 1000cc designation to reduce the annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation. Nissan did have an engineering relationship with the [[Austin Motor Company#Japan|Austin Motor Company]], and this generation does share some appearance similarities to the [[Mini]], introduced in 1959.\n\nThe Datsun 110 series used the [[Nissan D engine|Nissan D10]] type engine based on an original (albeit Austin inspired) design from before World War II. The engine is a water-cooled inline-four cylinder with two crankshaft bearings, side intake and exhaust valves, a displacement of 860cc and with {{convert|25|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4000&nbsp;rpm. Aside from not using the name, the A110 is the direct forerunner of the modern Bluebird line. Incremental changes were denoted by 112 and 113 codes&nbsp;\u2013 the 111 designation was skipped. The last model, introduced in June 1956, received an all-new, developed in-house gearbox. The earlier 110 and 112 had been using the four-speed, floor-mounted transmission from the [[Austin A40 Somerset]] (then built under license by Nissan), but the new 113 received a column-shifted four-speed unit which narrowly allowed seating for three in front. The new unit was also {{convert|10|kg|lb|0|abbr=out}} lighter than the Austin one.<ref name=\"bent1\">{{cite web |last=Bent |first=Alan |url=http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun113.html |title=1956 Datsun 113 Model |publisher=Earlydatsun.com |accessdate=3 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823233216/http://earlydatsun.com/datsun113.html |archivedate=23 August 2014  }}</ref> Both units received synchronization on the top three gears only, as was the norm for the time.\n\nThe 110 series was available as a sedan or as the rare W110/112/113 station wagon, which had a horizontally split tail gate.

The Datsun 114 was introduced in October 1957 as a low cost option to the 210 (the 114 used the 210's body except for the grille and exterior trim combined with the old 25&nbsp;PS \"D10\" engine). Another low cost alternative was the Datsun 115 (lower specification version of the 211) and was similar to the 114 with the exception of a bigger rear window and slightly redesigned front turn signals.

In Taiwan it also replaced the 701 and was known as ''Yue Loong Bluebird 704''. The Datsun 312 was also sold in Korea. The 310 series was also built in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria in CKD form during 1962 and 1963. The model was also sold in New Zealand and was one of the first Japanese models available there, beginning in May 1962.<ref name=NZA>{{citation |ref=NZa |title=Assembly: New Zealand Car Production 1921\u201398 |last=Webster |first=Mark |publisher=Reed |year=2002 |page=78 |location=Birkenhead, Auckland, New Zealand |isbn=0-7900-0846-7}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1960, a five-door station wagon was added (WP310). The P310 was powered by the 1.2&nbsp;L [[Nissan E engine]]. A smaller-engine version (simply called \"310\") was powered by the 1.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan C engine]]. The P311 and P312 (powered by the 60&nbsp;hp 1.2&nbsp;L [[Nissan E engine|Nissan E-1 engine]]) also had smaller-engined versions (\"311\" and \"312\") that were powered by the 45&nbsp;hp 1.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan C engine|Nissan C-1 engine]]. The 310 and 311 were equipped with a 3-speed manual transmission (fully synchronized for the 311 and 312). The station wagon was also available for the 311 and 312. The 312 was also available in a deluxe version (DP312). A trim model called the \"Fancy Deluxe\" (model code DP312-L) was marketed for the female driver; it featured a pale yellow exterior, pale yellow/grey interior, high heel shoe holder under the dash, a vanity mirror on the back of the driver's side sun visor, a turn signal relay that played music, curtains, automatic clutch, and bigger mirrors. By February 1961, a 1.2&nbsp;L overhead-valve engine (codenamed E-1) became an option on a higher-trim DX model.\n\nStyling tended to mimic larger American cars. A very small number did make it to the United States. This generation of Bluebird became one of the first Japanese cars to be sold in significant numbers in Europe, after Finland fully opened its doors to automobile imports in mid-1962. 700 were brought in, and by the time the 410-series had arrived, Datsun had passed [[Saab Automobile|SAAB]] and [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]] in registrations.

The 410 was built from 1964 to 1967. The appearance appears to have had an influence on Nissan's first V8-powered [[Nissan President#President H150 and H250|Nissan President]] in 1965, and the [[Nissan Sunny#B10 (1966\u20131969)|Nissan Sunny]] in 1966.\n\nThis generation Bluebird was introduced in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] as Nissan wanted to offer an all new, modern appearance in time for the games.\n[[File:Datsun Bluebird 410 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun Bluebird 410]]\nTwo basic models were built: 410 (1964\u20131965) with a combination rear lamp set consisting of round and rectangular lenses, and 411 (1965\u20131967), which featured the same combination rear lamp set as the earlier 410 through 1966, changing to higher mounted rectangular tail light sets for 1967. On both, the rear direction indicators were red or amber, according to market \u2013 New Zealand, which allows either, took the 410 with both and the 411 with red only. This Bluebird was one of the first Japanese car lines assembled in New Zealand, initially imported under a tariff/duty arrangement allowing 300 cars a year (the so-called '300 Club') with CKD kits built up by Motor Holdings at Mount Wellington in Auckland. The 410 series sedan and station wagon plus a light delivery van was assembled in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria. These cars were all in CKD format.\n\nA sporting model, the '''Bluebird SS''', was launched in Japan in March 1964, with a tuned 1.2&nbsp;L engine. The SS was originally available only in a four-door configuration (MTK), but a two-door (RTK) joined about a year later. Two versions of the SS were built: the DP410-MTK/RTK and the DP411-MTK/RTK. The DP410 was powered by a {{convert|71|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the 1.2&nbsp;L [[Nissan E engine|Nissan E-1 engine]]. The {{convert|78|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} double-carburetted version of the [[Nissan J engine|J13]] powered the DP411. All SS models were equipped with a four-speed manual transmission.\n\n[[File:Datsun 1600 Wagon (410).jpg|thumb|left|1967 Datsun 1600 Wagon (US)]]\n[[File:DatsunBluebird411.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun Bluebird 411]]\nInitially, only a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon were in the range, but a two-door was added in September 1964. The two-door SS was launched in February 1965. The 410 and 411 were also available in a deluxe version (DP410 and DP411). A \"Fancy Deluxe\" version was also available in the home market. A DP411 SSS was entered in motor sport by the Datsun factory in South Africa and was used as test car for Nissan Japan. A Datsun DP411 SSS was also entered in the 1964 [[Monte Carlo rally]], where it was driven by a South African called Ewold van Bergen.\n\nTo minimize production costs for export, the [[Windscreen wiper#Geometry|windshield wipers]] used a pattern where the wipers started in the center and wiped towards the edge of the windshield, instead of from the passenger side towards the driver.\n\nIn May 1965 the base engine was enlarged to a downtuned version of the 1.3&nbsp;L unit already used in the 411-series SS, now with a single (twin-barrel) carb and developing {{convert|67|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200&nbsp;rpm.

For some reason it broke with the earlier standard of simply changing the second digit of the chassis code to a \"2\", instead labelling it the '''520'''. The commercial-use 520 further marked the divergence of Datsun's Bluebird and truck lines as it continued to be available until 1972. Later versions received a modernized front end, similar to the contemporary 510 Bluebird.\n\nIn the United States, only the four-door sedan and wagon were offered; the two-door was never available. The 1.6-litre, featuring the same R16 engine as the [[Datsun Sports#SP311|SP(L)311 Roadster]], was only available in 1967. The 1.2 and 1.3 410 and 411 series' had a manual gearbox, while the 1.6-litre was available as either a manual or automatic. The cars were labeled ''DATSUN'', with no mention of Bluebird either on the car or in the owner's manual.\n\nIn Taiwan the Bluebird 410 was built and sold as the ''Yue Loong YLN-705B''.\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|510}} 510 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image =510BluebirdSSS.jpg\n| name = Datsun Bluebird 510\n| aka = Datsun 510<br />Datsun 1600<br />Tan Chong 510<br />Yue Loong YLN-706\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] (Oppama plant)<br />Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria]]<ref name=\"Davises\">{{cite book |first1=Pedr |last1=Davis |first2=Tony |last2=Davis |year=1990 |title=Volvo downunder: A Swedish success story |location=Blakehurst, New South Wales |publisher=Marque |page=76 |isbn=0-947079-14-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Carsales 1971 Datsun 1600 GL\">{{cite web |last=Britten |first=Tim |date=31 July 2012 |url=http://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/advice/1971/classic-and-rare/datsun/1600/from-the-classifieds-1971-datsun-1600-gl-31613 |title=From The Classifieds: 1971 Datsun 1600 GL |publisher=Carsales | access-date=19 March 2015}}</ref><ref name = \"Carsales Datsun rises again\">{{cite web |date=21 March 2012 |url=http://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/news/2012/datsun/datsun-rises-again-29362 |title=Datsun rises again |publisher=Carsales |access-date=29 May 2015}}</ref><br />New Zealand: [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]]\n| production = 1967\u20131972\n| body_style =2/4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />5-door [[station wagon]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| engine = 1.3&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan L engine|L13]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<ref name=Autocar196712>{{Cite journal |authorlink=Shotaro Kobayashi |title=OHC is the fashion: Japan's Datsun Bluebird in latest form as 1300 and 1600 |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |volume=127 (nbr 3747) |pages=Pages 25\u201326 |date=7 December 1967}}</ref><br />1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan L engine|L16]]'' I4<ref name=Autocar196712/>\n| transmission =4 speed manual all-synchromesh<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n| wheelbase = {{convert|95.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar196712/>\n| length = {{convert|162.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar196712/>\n| width = {{convert|61.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar196712/>\n| height = {{convert|55.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar196712/>\n| weight =\n}}\n\n{{main|Datsun 510}}\n\nLaunched in August 1967, it was one of the most comprehensive Bluebird ranges in terms of body styles: a two-door sedan, a four-door sedan, a five-door station wagon, and a two-door coup\u00e9 (added in November 1968).

A few automatic and twin carburettor SSS versions were imported built-up from Japan, primarily for buyers who had access to funds overseas and could utilise the country's 'no remittance' new car purchase scheme to avoid lengthy waiting lists.\n\nThe trim designation \"SS\" was changed to \"SSS\" as General Motors was already using the term for performance branded Chevrolet products called the [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]] starting in 1961.\n\nThe P510 sedan and coup\u00e9 were built in South Africa [Pretoria] from 1969 to 1974 and had the L16 engine, available as 1600 SSS (twin carbs) and as the single carbed 1600 DeLuxe. An automatic gearbox model was also available for the DeLuxe range. The factory also made two versions of the two-door coup\u00e9. They were a 1600GL and a 1800GL. The 1600GL had a single carburetor or twin carbs and 1800&nbsp;cc cars had twin carbs. The 1600 SSS was also used in motorsport as test cars for Nissan Japan. The cars were used in numerous motorsport rallies by Ewold van Bergen from Pretoria, South Africa, who was a test engineer for Nissan Japan.\n[[File:Datsun Bluebird Coupe (510) 001.JPG|thumb|left|Datsun Bluebird \"SSS\" series 510 coup\u00e9]]\n[[File:1968 Datsun Bluebird wgn.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun Bluebird 510 Wagon]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|610}} 610 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Bluebird 610\n| image = Datsun-Bluebird610.jpg\n| caption = Inline-six Datsun Bluebird Coup\u00e9 (G610)\n| aka = Datsun 160B/180B<br />Datsun 610<ref>{{citation |url=http://oldjapanesecar.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=brodatnis&action=print&thread=930 |work=brochure |title=Datsun 610 Hardtop |year=1973 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n| production = 1971\u20131976<br />1972\u20131977 (Australia)\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] (Oppama Plant)<br />Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria]]<ref name=\"Carsales 1971 Datsun 1600 GL\"/><ref name=\"Carsales Datsun rises again\"/><br />New Zealand: [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]] (Campbell Industries); [[Porirua]] (Todd Motors)\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />5-door [[station wagon]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| related = [[Datsun Truck#Datsun 620|Datsun Truck 620]]\n| engine = 1595&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L16|L16]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18]]'' I4<br />1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20B|L20B]]'' I4 (U.S.)<ref name=WC76>{{Cite book |title=World Cars 1976 |publisher=L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books |location=Bronxville, NY |ref=WC76 |page=376 |year=1976 |isbn=0-910714-08-8}}</ref><br />1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20/L20A]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] (G610)\n| transmission = 4-speed manual<br />5-speed manual<br />3-speed automatic\n| wheelbase = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|2500|mm|abbr=on}} | {{convert|2650|mm|abbr=on}} (G610) }}\n| length = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|4215|mm|abbr=on}} | {{convert|4420|mm|abbr=on}} (G610) }}\n| width = {{convert|1600|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1415|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1035|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe 610 series was launched in Japan in August 1971 and was badged as the '''Datsun Bluebird-U'''. The meaning behind the U suffix is \"User Oriented\", to signify the higher comfort levels than 510 predecessor could muster.<ref name=Catvol20>{{cite journal |ref=JAMA20 |title=\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af: Japanese motor vehicles guide book 1973/1974 |language=Japanese |volume=20 |date=30 October 1973 |publisher=[[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] |location=Japan |page=123}}</ref> A domestic advertising campaign used the catch-line \"Bluebird U \u2013 Up You!\", and was short-lived due to the innuendo. The 610 was one of the first Nissan products to adopt a popular styling appearance, called \"[[coke bottle styling|coke bottle]]\" which appeared internationally during the 1960s and 1970s, an appearance shared with the larger [[Nissan Cedric#Third generation 230|Nissan Cedric]], as both vehicles were available at Japanese Nissan dealerships called ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Bluebird Store]]''.\n\n[[File:1972 Datsun 180B (P610) Deluxe sedan (20651657636).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Datsun 180B Deluxe sedan (Australia)]]\n[[File:1977 Datsun 180B (10899901566).jpg|thumb|left|1977 Datsun 180B sedan (NZ)]]\n[[File:1974 Datsun 180B (P610) SSS coupe (19055363101).jpg|thumb|left|1974 Datsun 180B SSS hardtop (Australia)]]\n[[File:1976 Datsun 180B (P610) GL sedan (2011-01-05).jpg|thumb|left|1977 Datsun 180B GL sedan (Australia)]]\n[[File:1975 Datsun 180B (P610) GX station wagon (25722031675).jpg|thumbnail|left|1975 Datsun 180B GX station wagon (Australia)]]\n\nFor the Japanese domestic market, the 610 was pitted against the second generation [[Toyota Corona Mark II]]. Also in Japan, the 610 was initially sold alongside the 510 but eventually replaced the 510. 610s were available as a four-door, two-door hardtop (HT), and a five-door wagon/light van. Trim levels in Japan were '''GL''' (Grand Luxe), '''SSS''' (Super Sports Sedan), '''DX''' (Deluxe) or '''STD''' (Standard). It borrowed its suspension and drive train from the outgoing 510, with some modifications. Likewise, the 610 four-door and two-door retained the class-leading, independent rear trailing arm design, while the wagon reused the rear live axle with leaf springs from the 510 wagon.\n\nWhether four or six-cylinder models, all 610s were equipped with Nissan's [[Nissan L engine|L-series]] inline engines. In many export markets, including UK, Europe, and Australia, the 610 was badged as the '''160B''' or '''180B''' with respect to particular engine displacement. The Bluebird name also often appeared in advertising and in brochures. In the UK the popularity of the 160B/180B/180B SSS Coupe range further strengthened Datsun's position as the leading Japanese importer. As a result of Japanese Government passage of emission control regulations, Nissan introduced their emissions technology in 1975, using a badge that said \"[[Nissan NAPS]]\" (Nissan Anti Pollution System) on vehicles thus equipped. Most 610s worldwide came equipped with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission, but a five-speed manual transmission was available in the Japanese and Australian markets.\n\nAs with the 510, the '''SSS''' trim included miscellaneous sport options and a higher output engine with twin-Hitachi carburetors. A Japan-only '''SSS-E''' model was equipped with [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]-licensed [[Fuel injection|electronic fuel injection]], and so was one of the first, mass-produced [[Nissan]] vehicles to be sold without a [[carburetor]]. Another 610 never exported was the inline-six U-2000 GT and U-2000 GTX (nicknamed \"shark-nose\" in Japanese), which shows some visual similarities to the [[Pontiac GTO#Second generation|Pontiac GTO]] and [[Oldsmobile Cutlass#Third Generation - 1968\u20131972|Oldsmobile Cutlass]]. Called the G610, it came with a stretched front end to accommodate the longer engine and featured a different grill and other aesthetic modifications. This model was not available as a [[wagon]]. The most powerful GTX-E received fuel injection and {{convert|130|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[[#WC76|''World Cars 1976'']], p. 377</ref>\n\nThe 610 Bluebird received a facelift in 1974, with prominent turn signals mounted on the front corners and with a more squared off grille as well as new taillamps.<ref name=MMIp9697>{{cite journal |journal=Motor Magazine International |date=January 1974 |title=New Model: Datsun Bluebird U |pages=96\u201397 |volume=2 |number=1}}</ref> The SSS models now had styled steel wheels without hubcaps.

A three-speed automatic&nbsp;\u2013 using a transmission made by Nissan Japan subsidiary JATCO&nbsp;\u2013 was later added as a factory option. Relaxed restrictions on car assembly kit imports and increasing affluence in NZ meant Campbell's, which also assembled Toyota, Renault, Rambler, Hino, Isuzu and Peugeot models over the years, could not meet demand so Nissan-Datsun (NZ) contracted Chrysler/Mitsubishi importer Todd Motors to assemble additional manual 180Bs at its Porirua factory alongside the Chrysler Valiant, Hunter, Avenger and Alpine model ranges and Mitsubishi Lancer sedan and Colt Galant coupe. The Todd-built cars gave Datsun dealers a new range of paint colours all different from those Campbell's offered.\n\n'''Racing history'''\nA 610 four-door participated in the 1972 and 1973 [[East African Safari Rally]]. Bob Sharp drove his 610 HT race car to second place overall in the American SCCA B Sedan Championship for 1973 and 1974. The same car achieved a first place for the 1976 SCCA B-Sedan Championship but with [[Elliot Forbes-Robinson]] driving.\n{{clear_left}}\n\n=== {{anchor|710}} 710 series ===\n[[File:Nissan Violet 710.jpg|right|thumb|Datsun Violet 710 series sedan]]\nShortly after the introduction of the 610, Nissan launched a new line of slightly smaller cars January 1973 utilizing parts and styling cues from the 610. This new line of cars was sold in various markets as the [[Datsun]] 140J/160J, [[Nissan Violet|Datsun Violet]], or Datsun 710. In Japan, it was exclusive to ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Cherry Store]]'' Japanese dealerships as a larger companion to the smaller [[Nissan Cherry]], thereby giving Nissan the opportunity to sell a Bluebird-sized vehicle at a different sales channel. The use of the 710 name was a source of confusion because it implied that the model was either a larger, upscale version of the 610 (it was the opposite) or a newer model in the Bluebird line. This car was built at various international plants and was marketed under different names as local conditions required. As the Bluebirds traditional cross-town rival, the Toyota Corona split into a new model called the [[Toyota Carina]], the Violet appeared just under three years after the Carina did.\n\n{{details|Nissan Violet}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|810|200B}} 810 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Bluebird 810\n| image = Datsun Bluebird 1979 Castle Hedingham 2008.JPG\n| caption = 1979 Datsun Bluebird 1.8 GL Sedan (810 series)\n| aka = Datsun 160B<ref name=Robson>Graham Robson, A-Z of Cars of the 1970s, Bay View Books, 1990, page 49</ref><br />Datsun 180B<ref name=Robson/><br />Datsun 200B<ref name=200Bbrochure>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/drdatto/sets/72157613721941896/with/3274666149/ Datsun 200B brochure] Retrieved on 14 August 2011</ref><br />[[Datsun 810]]<ref name=autocade810>[http://autocade.net/index.php/Nissan_Bluebird_%28810%29 Nissan Bluebird (810)] Retrieved on 14 August 2011</ref>\n| production = 1976\u20131979\n| assembly = Japan: [[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Oppama Plant]], [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]]<br />Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria]]<ref name=autocade810/>\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />5-door wagon/van\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| engine = {{ unbulleted list | 1.4&nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1595&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L16|L16]]'' I4 | 1595&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z16|Z16]]'' I4 | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18/L18E]]'' I4 | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z18|Z18/Z18E]]'' I4 | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20B|L20B]]'' I4 | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20/L20E]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] | 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan L engine#L24|L24/L24E]]'' I6 }}\n| transmission = {{ unbulleted list | 4/5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] }}\n| wheelbase = {{ unbulleted list | {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} | {{convert|2650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (G4/G6) }}\n| length = {{convert|167.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n| width = {{convert|64.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n| height = {{convert|54.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n| weight = {{convert|2390|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n}}\n\nThe 810 was introduced in July 1976.

In January 1978 local assembly began for the sedan, followed shortly by the wagon. The sedan trim levels were GL and GX. While the coupe remained a [[hardtop]], Datsun added an [[opera window]] in the rear pillar. The coupe was discontinued in Australia in 1979. The engine used is a larger version of the L series engine from the preceding 180B. Dubbed the L20B its capacity was increased to 1952&nbsp;cc, making it good for {{convert|72|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAlmost immediately the 200B became Australia's top selling four-cylinder car, a position it held until it was displaced by the [[Mitsubishi Sigma]]. Its popularity however remained strong right through the production run, family buyers appreciative of the plentiful interior room and standard features. It may have been somewhat conservatively styled, but the effort [[Nissan]] had put into the engineering of the car made it reliable and tough, qualities most Australians rated higher than a more advanced design.\n\nOnly the early fully imported 200B sedans and coupes retained the independent rear suspension from the 180B, locally assembled 200B sedans instead switched to [[coil spring]]s with a live axle, while the wagon (imported from Japan) had a [[live axle]] in the rear with [[leaf spring]]s. Seen as a giant step backwards, the reason for the change was certainly not a cost-cutting measure, but simply the need for Nissan to reach an 85% local content quota that the then Federal Government demanded of Australian car manufacturers. However, in practice the live rear axle, being an Australian development, proved to actually benefit the car's overall handling dynamics.\n\nThe biggest downside to the 200B was the noise the driver would have to endure. The 2-litre overhead cam engine could be very loud when pushed up through the rev range, and to make matters worse there was always plenty of drive line vibration. These issues prompted an exhaustive correction programme to be undertaken by the parent company in Japan, and thankfully later models were somewhat improved.\n\nA sportier version of the 200B sedan was released in June 1978. The new SX featured a revised grille, front spoiler, alloy wheels, revised door and seat trim (striped seat inserts) and tachometer, while the suspension was altered to improve handling. The colours available for this model were simply blue, white or red, and the only transmission available was a 4-speed floor shift. Significantly the SX was a unique model to Australia, the added input from Nissan's Australian design engineers signified a step away from just assembling cars. This in turn led to the locally built Datsuns, and later Nissans, being re-engineered to better suit Australian conditions, with many components being sourced locally a tradition that would continue right up until 1992, when Nissan ceased local manufacture.\n\nIn October 1979, the 200B was revised with a new grille, bumpers, seats, trim, and dashboard. The seats were a unique Australian design for the locally built cars. This facelift was penned by [[Paul Beranger]], a former [[Holden]] designer \u2013 years later he would style the 2006 [[Toyota Aurion]].\n\nIn 1980, a limited edition 200B Aspen GL sedan was released featuring distinctive shadow tone paint available in green, blue, or grey. The 200B was discontinued in May 1981, replaced by the [[Datsun Bluebird]]. Australian comedy band, Tripod, have written a song about the 200B, called \"200B.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/pennywyatt/Interests/Tripod/BoxSet/Box%20Set05.html |title=Box Set Lyrics \u2013 05 \u2013 200B |publisher=Members.optusnet.com.au |accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand (160B/180B/200B) ===\nThis model was also released to New Zealand in 1977, assembled [[Complete knock down|CKD]] in 4-door sedan and 5-door wagon forms. A coupe model was also released, imported built-up from Japan. Unlike the Australian models the sedans used the independent rear suspension system of the Japanese specification models. This Bluebird was the first to be assembled in Nissan New Zealand's own brand-new assembly plant at Wiri, South Auckland. For the first two years of assembly the cars were fitted with a 1.8-litre unit, hence they used the ''180B'' nameplate. Automatic transmission was optional for both. Nissan also added its first luxury ZX version with this generation \u2013 features included velour upholstery, 'luxury' cut-pile carpet sourced locally and tinted glass. There was also, for the first time in Kiwi assembly, a wagon variant with mid-range trim and equipment.\n\nDuring 1979 a number of changes were made on the car, namely an engine enlargement to 2.0 (leading to a renaming of the car to ''200B''), and a mild facelift, using new dual rectangular headlights and a new grille. Due to New Zealand's favour for smaller-engined models, a 1.6-litre ''160B'' variant was also introduced.\n\nProduction of the New Zealand 160/200B continued until late 1980, when it was replaced by the Datsun Bluebird (910).\n\n=== {{anchor|Datsun 810}} North America (810) ===\n[[File:1977 Datsun 810 Wagon.jpg|thumb|right|1977 Datsun 810 wagon]]\n\nIn North America, Datsun marketed the 810 series Bluebird sold as the [[Datsun 810]] from February 1977 to 1980\u2014the direct ancestor of the long running [[Nissan Maxima|Datsun/Nissan Maxima]] range. The Datsun 810 model line began with the six-cylinder Nissan Bluebird 2000G6 sold in Japan. With a longer nose than the regular Bluebird, to accommodate a longer inline-six engine, it was powered by two versions of the [[SOHC]] ''[[Nissan L engine|L-series]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] engine: a 2.0&nbsp;L displacement for the Japanese market and a 2.4&nbsp;L24E unit for the US market. The Bluebird G6 used a [[carburetor]] for the base model and [[fuel injection]] for the sporty version. The 2.0&nbsp;L engine was good for 122&nbsp;PS [[Horsepower#Japanese Industrial Standard D 1001|JIS]] (90&nbsp;kW), while the bigger American engine could reach 125&nbsp;hp [[SAE International|SAE]] (93&nbsp;kW). The sport version channeled power through a four-speed [[manual transmission]] for the sedan and wagon, five-speed transmission for the coupe. These cars were [[rear-wheel drive]] and had a semi-trailing arm rear suspension. The [[station wagon]] variant, only sold in North America, had a rear live axle for load carrying reasons. Some fuel-injected versions had automatic transmissions.\n\nThe 2-door coup\u00e9 version was introduced in North America in January 1979 for the 1979 model year.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lamm |first=Michael |date=January 1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39QDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover |title=and the new Datsun 810 |journal=[[Popular Mechanics]] |location=New York City |volume=155 |number=1 |pages=85, 87, 118 |quote=\"The coupe, introduced in January 1979, has been discontinued, but the four-door sedan and wagon remain.\"}}</ref> Around the same time, the 810 received an exterior refresh. The coup\u00e9 version was never available in second generation 810/Maximas. The new [[Datsun 280ZX]] did not share much of the 810's chassis as thought, though the 810 was not available with that Z car's larger 2.8&nbsp;L engine. The first use of the \"Maxima\" name happened on a domestic Japanese market luxury version of the [[Nissan Stanza|Stanza]], in August 1977.<ref name=GazooStz>{{cite web |work=Gazoo.com |url=http://gazoo.com/meishakan/meisha/shousai.asp?R_ID=1297&ex_spec=shousai |title=\u691c\u7d22\u7d50\u679c: 1979\u5e74 \u30cb\u30c3\u30b5\u30f3 \u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30b6 4door 1800 Maxma X-E ''(sic)'' |trans-title=Great Car Pavilion: 1979 Nissan Stanza 1800 Maxima X-E 4-door |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Toyota Motor Corporation]] |accessdate=10 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504170711/http://gazoo.com/meishakan/meisha/shousai.asp?R_ID=1297&ex_spec=shousai |archivedate=4 May 2012  }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|910}} 910 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Bluebird 910\n| image = 910BluebirdSSS.jpg\n| production = 1979\u20131983<ref name=Autocade910>[http://www.autocade.net/index.php/Nissan_Bluebird_(910) Nissan Bluebird (910)] Retrieved from http://www.autocade.net on 11 April 2011</ref>\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] (Oppama Plant)<br />Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria]]<ref name=Davis>Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 163.</ref>\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]<ref name=Autocade910/><br />5-door [[station wagon]]<ref name=Autocade910/><br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<ref name=Autocade910/>\n| layout = [[FR layout]]<ref name=Autocade910/>\n}}\n\n{{main|Datsun Bluebird 910}}\n\nThe Bluebird 910, the last of the rear-wheel drive Bluebirds, featured simple clean-cut lines, unlike the \"Coke Bottle\" styling of its predecessor.<ref name=Lewis>Martin Lewis, A-Z of Cars of the 1980s, 1994, page 102</ref> It did however retain the same engine range, the same MacPherson strut suspension and the same {{convert|99|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase as the 810.<ref name=Lewis/> Starting with this generation, in Japan the Bluebird returned to offering only four-cylinder vehicles, and the six-cylinder Bluebird was replaced by the [[Nissan Skyline]] based [[Nissan Leopard]] at ''Nissan Bluebird Store'' Japanese dealerships. Bluebirds of this generation were renowned for reliability but rusted away in salted areas long before the engine gave trouble. Nissan realigned with the [[Nissan Violet#T11 series (1981\u201386)|Japanese Stanza/Auster/Violet]] sedans which were assigned to individual [[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Japanese Nissan dealerships]].\n\nThis car was also assembled in Australia, in South Africa, in Taiwan, and in New Zealand. This generation was also the basis of the North American [[Nissan Maxima#1981\u20131984|Datsun/Nissan 810 Maxima]] from 1980 onwards.\n\nIn Europe, the Bluebird was joined in 1981 by the similar-sized [[Nissan Violet|Stanza]], which gave Nissan buyers the alternative option of front-wheel drive and a hatchback body style for the first time, as front-wheel drive hatchbacks were by now overtaking rear-wheel drive saloons in popularity.\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|U11}} U11 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Bluebird U11\n| image =Nissan U11 Bluebird SSS.jpg\n| caption = Bluebird SSS-XG hardtop\n| aka = Tan Chong Bluebird<br />Yue Loong Bluebird 921/923\n| production = {{unbulleted list | 1983\u20131987 | 1984\u20131990 (wagon) }}\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] ([[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Oppama Plant]])<br />New Zealand: [[Auckland]]<ref name=autocade810/>\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]] sedan<br />5-door wagon/estate\n| layout = [[FF layout]]\n| related = [[Nissan Maxima#Second generation (PU11; 1984\u20131988)|Nissan Maxima]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 1598&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA16|CA16]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (RU11) | 1809&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA18|CA18S/CA18E]]'' I4 (U11) | 1809&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA18|CA18ET/DET]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4 (U11) | 1973&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA20|CA20S/E]]'' I4 (YU11) | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan VG engine#VG20|VG20E/VG20ET]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (PU11) | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#LD20|LD20]]'' [[Diesel engine|diesel]] I4 (EU11) | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#LD20|LD20T]]'' [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4 (EU11) }}\n| transmission =4/5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />3/4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2550|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4360|-|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1370|-|1430|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1080|-|1215|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| successor = [[Nissan Avenir]] (wagon)\n}}\n\nThe Bluebird was modified to front-wheel drive in October 1983, but retained the boxy styling of its predecessor. At the time, Nissan's design chief believed this method of styling would remain popular. Even though every panel was changed and most details were considerably smoother, the drag coefficient remained a fairly high 0.39.<ref name=Moniteur>{{cite journal |ref=Moniteur |journal=Le Moniteur de l'Automobile |page=16 |title=Nissan Bluebird: L'habit ne fait pas le moine |trans-title=The clothes do not make the man |language=French |volume=35 |number=793 |date=19 April 1984 |publisher=Editions Auto-Magazine}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1987 Nissan Bluebird 2.0 ZX-E (14334547702).jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Bluebird 2.0 ZX-E (New Zealand)]]\n\nThe range was offered in four-door sedan, four-door hardtop, and five-door station wagon forms. The coup\u00e9 was deleted, and the hardtop sedan is rarely seen outside Japan.\n\nThis model was offered in Europe for only two years before Nissan began building the [[Nissan Stanza#T12 series (1986\u201390)|Auster]] as the Bluebird at its newly opened plant in the UK in 1986. Certain Bluebird models (diesels and station wagons) continued to be offered alongside the T12 \"Bluebird\" in some markets. As usual, the Bluebird received ample standard equipment in European markets. In some markets, the petrol 2.0 was only available coupled to an automatic gearbox.<ref name=Moniteur2>''[[#Moniteur|Le Moniteur de l'Automobile]]'' (no. 793), p. 18</ref>\n\nAlthough the U11 sedans were replaced for the 1988 model year, the station wagon continued to be built until 1990. The six-cylinder Maxima also continued to be built (without the \"Bluebird\" portion of the name from May 1987) until October 1988, when an all-new [[Nissan Maxima|Maxima]] appeared. Most of the wagons sold in Japan were to commercial vehicle specifications, but a plusher Wagon was also offered.

The [[Nissan VG engine#VG20ET|VG20ET]] V6 was offered for the first time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the [[Nissan Maxima|Bluebird Maxima]]. This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan VG engine#VG30E|VG30E]]. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the turbodiesel had better gas mileage in standardized test cycles, presumably due to it being less stressed \u2013 as long as one did not take full advantage of its better performance.<ref name=Moniteur2/>\n\n[[File:1986 Nissan Bluebird Wagon 2.0 GL 01.jpg|thumb|left|Bluebird 2.0 GL wagon (Europe)]]\nAustralia made do with the 910 series, which was facelifted in 1985. New Zealand marketing for the U11 proclaimed the vehicle as the 'Widetrack Bluebird', to differentiate it from its very similar-looking predecessor. Several Wiri-assembled models including a wagon were offered with 1.6 (base) or two-litre carburettor engines. The alloy head castings all had an unused location for a second spark plug per cylinder, as [[Dual ignition|twin-plug]], fuel-injected versions of the same engines were used in certain markets (US, Japan, Scandinavia) with stricter emission laws.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the following versions were offered:\n* 1.8 DX (1984\u201386)\n* 2.0 GL/GL estate/SGL (1984\u201386)\n* 1.8 Turbo ZX (1984\u201386)\n\n[[File:Yue Loong Bluebird 923SD T9-956 20150411.jpg|thumb|left|Yue Loong Bluebird 923SD (Taiwan)]]\nThe U11 was sold as the ''Yue Loong Bluebird 921 / 923 '' in Taiwan.\n{{clear}}\n\n== T12/T72 series {{anchor|T12|T72}} ==\n[[File:T72 1.8GS .jpg|thumb|Bluebird T12/T72 Series]]\n{{main|Nissan Violet#T12|l1=Nissan Bluebird (T12)}}\n\nThe T12 and the later T72 Nissan Bluebird, is a third-generation [[Nissan Stanza|Auster]], rebadged and sold in Europe. The T12 was introduced in Europe in 1985 as a replacement for the U11 Bluebird. From July 1986, the T12 was assembled from parts shipped in from Japan, at [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]], England.

In addition to the SSS series, the Bluebird wagon was replaced by the [[Nissan Avenir]], and the sedans (LE / SE Saloon / XE Sedan / Super-select) were also available.

With the Maxima having been spun off into its own range, U12 Bluebirds were all four-cylinder models, with either a 1.6-, 1.8-, or 2.0-liter petrol engine and also the option of the LD20 2.0-liter diesel. The sports and luxury versions came with a factory viscous LSD. Nissan made a turbocharged Bluebird from 1987 to 1990 named the RNU12, using the 1809&nbsp;cc [[DOHC]] CA18DET that was sold in Japan and New Zealand. It, too used the ATTESA system.\n\n===Export markets===\nThe U12 was also sold in North America as the [[Nissan Stanza]].\n\n;Australia and New Zealand\nThis model was sold as the Nissan Pintara in Australia, replacing a larger Skyline-based model, from 1989 to 1993. There, it had been codenamed \u2018Project Matilda\u2019,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUi7FJ4pRsEC&pg=PA28&dq=Project+Matilda+nissan+ford&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wFQ0Vfb-GoOzaYi8gVg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=button&f=true ''Information, Opportunism and Economic Coordination''], Peter E.

In Japan, a four-door sedan and four-door hardtop were offered, although Nissan of Australia did create a five-door Pintara 'Superhatch' model that was sold as the Bluebird in some export markets, including New Zealand. It was marketed as the 'Bluebird Aussie' in Japan, selling complete with a fluffy little koala, Aussie flag under the clock and other small touches.\n\n[[File:1989 Nissan Bluebird 1.8 XE Saloon HT.jpg|thumb|left|A 1989 Hardtop, with different bodywork behind the A-pillar]]\n\nAustralian models came with the CA20E SOHC 2.0l EFI and KA24E SOHC 2.4l EFI motors. Sadly for Nissan Australia, Project Matilda was not the success it had hoped, even with a twin built for [[Ford Australia]] called the [[Ford Corsair#Ford Corsair UA - Australia|Corsair]], which was even less successful. This led to the collapse of Nissan\u2019s Australian manufacturing operations in the early 1990s. Most of the early Bluebirds of this generation sold in New Zealand were again assembled locally from CKD kits, as had been the case with almost all NZ-bound cars since the first generation in the early 1960s. The Japanese-made, NZ-assembled cars were replaced by Australian made U12 sedans at 'facelift' time though the Kiwi-built wagon, a body variant not made in Australia, carried on.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} NZ trim levels included SGS and ZX; like rival Toyota Australia, Nissan Australia, which ceased local manufacturing in 1994, was willing to build uniquely specified and badged models for its trans-Tasman customer.\n\nTrim levels of the Australian U12 Pintara were as follows:\n*GLi: 2.0&nbsp;L manual 5 speed, high mounted brake light, AM/FM radio cassette\n*Executive: 2.0&nbsp;L auto 4-speed, as above plus, power steering, remote boot release\n*T: 2.4&nbsp;L manual or auto, as above plus 4-wheel disc brakes, tacho, split fold rear seat\n*Ti: 2.4&nbsp;L manual or auto, as above plus limited slip differential, cruise control, climate control, central locking, electric windows, graphic equaliser, fog lamps, alloy wheels\n*TRX: 2.4&nbsp;L manual or auto, as above plus sports seats, sports suspension, body kit, alarm, 6Jx14\" alloy wheels (all other models have 5.5Jx14\" wheels)\n\nAll models were available as a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatch, except the TRX, which was only available as a 4-door sedan. The Ford Corsair was available as a GL (CA20 engine) and Ghia (KA24, similar features as the Ti).\n\n;Malaysia\nLocal assemblers [[Tan Chong Motor|Tan Chong]] were losing the low-cost market to local upstart [[PROTON Holdings|Proton]] in the mid-1980s (by 1986, Nissan sales in Malaysia were down 90 percent from their peak a few years earlier). To revive their fortunes, Tan Chong attempted to reposition the brand as \"upmarket standard,\" taking on brands such as Honda.

The two models were visually distinct: the four-door sedan had curves where its U12 predecessor had edges, while the hardtop, called the '''Nissan Bluebird ARX''', had more traditional styling. The Bluebird wagon was replaced by the new [[Nissan Avenir]]. This series replaced the [[Nissan Violet|Stanza/Auster/Violet]] platform expansion that enabled Nissan to sell a Bluebird-sized product at [[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan's Japanese dealership network]], as the economic effects of the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] began to unfold in Japan. Projected production for 1992 was 15,000 cars per month, 13,000 of which were intended for the Japanese domestic market.<ref name=im91>{{cite magazine | magazine = Intan Motor | title = Nissan Bluebird, Honda Civic & Prelude dipasarkan | trans-title = Nissan Bluebird, Honda Civic & Prelude on the market | date = 2 October 1991 | issn = 0215-7713 | number = 91 | publisher = Yayasan Beraya Press | location = Jakarta | language = id | last = Biono | first = Adhi | page = 31 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1995-1997 Nissan Bluebird (U13 S2) LX sedan 01.jpg|thumb|left|1995\u201397 Nissan Bluebird (U13) LX sedan (Australia)]]\n[[File:Nissan U13 Bluebird SSS ATTESA.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Nissan Bluebird (U13) SSS ATTESA LTD (Japan)]]\n[[File:1991 Nissan Bluebird 01.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Nissan Bluebird (U13) ARX hardtop sedan (Japan)]]\n\nThe new Bluebird was designed with comfort in mind. The more spacious cabin was the result of a longer wheelbase and a slightly taller design, in a package retaining the length and width of the previous model. Another comfort equipment was the [[Active noise control|Active Noise Cancellation]] (ANC) system available in domestic market Hardtop models.<ref name=im91/> This was the first installation of such a system, although its effect was limited and it was to be another twenty years before it reached wider adoption.<ref>{{citation | title = Active Control of Noise and Vibration, Second Edition | first1 = Colin | last1 = Hansen | first2 = Scott | last2 = Snyder | first3 = Xiaojun | last3 = Qiu | first4 = Laura | last4 = Brooks | first5 = Danielle | last5 = Moreau | publisher = CRC Press | date = 2012 | isbn = 9781482234008 | page = 3 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral Japanese models included an All Wheel Drive version ([[ATTESA]]). The engines used in the Japanese models ranged greatly in capacity and type. The SSS Attesa LTD model used a \"redtop\" [[Nissan SR engine|SR20DET]] with {{convert|210|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This was a similar engine/drivetrain package to the more powerful one used in the [[Nissan Pulsar|Pulsar GTi-R]]. It had only a single throttle body as opposed the GTi-R's multiple throttle body, smaller bearings, hydraulic rather than solid lifters, and a smaller turbo. The GTi-R had a large top mount [[intercooler]], while the SSS ATTESA LTD had a smaller front mount intercooler. The Bluebird SSS was set apart from the North American Altima in that not only having the SR20DET and AWD Attesa as an option, it also had other details such as power folding retracting mirrors (some heated) and a rear wiper if equipped with a spoiler. US cars are also larger due to the fitment of bigger bumpers.\n\n===Export markets===\nThe Australian delivered U13 Bluebird was released in late 1993 and terminated in 1997. Series 1 ran from 1993 until 1995 while Series 2 ran from 1995 to 1997. Series 2 saw the addition of a driver's airbag, revised grille styling, and a seat belt warning light. The Series 1 LX model came equipped with cruise control standard but strangely it was an option on the Series 2.\n\nThe Australian U13 Bluebirds were available in three different models, LX\u2014the base model but very well equipped, Ti\u2014the luxury model, and the SSS\u2014the sports model. Compared to the LX, the Ti had climate control, a sunroof, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). while comparing the LX to the SSS, the SSS had a HUD (heads-up display\u2014digital speedo on windscreen), climate control, fog lights, ski-port, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). Despite there being a sports model (SSS), the LX was the fastest of the Australian models due to having the least weight. The engine used in the Australian and US U13 models was the [[KA24DE]] with {{convert|112|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}} and 210&nbsp;Nm of torque).\n\nThe U13 Bluebird was introduced in New Zealand in early 1993, and was produced at Nissan's assembly plant in [[South Auckland]] from CKD packs imported from Japan until 1997, when it was replaced by the [[Nissan Primera|Primera]]. The model came in for lots of praise for its handling roadholding, with some models benefitting from the Attesa's passively steered rear wheels.<ref>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Anderson |editor-first=Donn |date=April 1993 |title=High flying Bluebird |magazine=New Zealand Car |location=Auckland |publisher=Accent Publishing Cnr |volume=7 |number=6 |pages=48\u201350 |issn=0113-0196}}</ref> New Zealand models were; S (base model, not available until later), SE (mid-spec), SES (sport) and SEL (luxury). Several versions of the sedan, including the first local Bluebird to have standard factory-fitted air conditioning (automatic climate control in this case) and optional locally supplied leather upholstery. At launch, some local motoring writers criticised Nissan NZ's decision to fit luxury equipment items instead of airbags in top versions but the company insisted there was not yet sufficient retail or fleet buyer demand.\n\nThe US-built U13 ([[Nissan Altima]]) was released in 1993 and was similar to the Australian U13.\n\n===EQ7200 series===\nNissan Motor signed an agreement with [[Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd.]] of China, to build the Bluebird there in the early 2000s. It was the U13 model that was chosen, and is sold there as the Nissan Bluebird.\n\n[[Yulon]] Motor, the [[Taiwan]]-based automaker, developed this variant of the U13, called the EQ7200-II series, in 2001. This featured a U13 central section but heavily revised front and rear ends. However, the centre of the car remains the same, and the {{convert|2620|mm|in|adj=on}} wheelbase is retained. No mention of the Taiwanese connection was made in advertising in Mainland China.\n\nThe EQ7200-I commenced production in 1999 and lasted until 2002 being replaced by the EQ7200-II.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2017/05/02/spotted-china-u13-nissan-fengshen-bluebird-eq7200-sss/|title=Spotted in China: U13 Nissan Fengshen Bluebird EQ7200 SSS|first=Tycho de|last=Feijter|date=2 May 2017|website=CarNewsChina.com}}</ref> The EQ7200-II was built from 2001 to 2003, when it was replaced by a revised EQ7200-III model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2014/08/18/spotted-in-china-nissan-bluebird-eq-7200-ii/|title=Spotted in China: Nissan Bluebird EQ 7200-II|first=Tycho de|last=Feijter|date=18 August 2014|website=CarNewsChina.com}}</ref> The EQ7200-III was sold from 2003 to 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2015/12/09/spotted-in-china-nissan-bluebird-eq-7200-iii/|title=Spotted in China: Nissan Bluebird EQ 7200-III|first=Tycho de|last=Feijter|date=9 December 2015|website=CarNewsChina.com}}</ref> The EQ7200-I was a rebadged [[Nissan Altima#First generation (U13, 1992\u20131997)|Nissan Altima U13]] while the EQ7200-II and EQ7200-III were rebadged [[Nissan Altima#Second generation (L30, 1997\u20132001)|Nissan Altima L30]].\n\nThe car is marginally longer at {{convert|4664|mm|in}}, as opposed to the original U13's {{convert|4585|mm|in}}.

The American Altima developed into a completely separate line of cars, with new L-series chassis codes. But in its home market of Japan&nbsp;\u2013 also the only market it was sold new in&nbsp;\u2013 the Bluebird was targeted more at buyers who favoured the formality of larger Japanese sedans. To fit in with a lower bracket in [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese taxation legislation]], the U14 retained a sub-{{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} width.\n\n[[File:Nissan Bluebird SSS (U14).JPG|thumb|left|Nissan Bluebird SSS]]\n\nOnly a four-door sedan was offered. The hardtop and the option of a 1.6&nbsp;L engine were removed. Engine choices were either the SR18(DE), SR20(DE) and the SR20(VE) with available all-wheel-drive (ATTESA) versions. The Nissan Hyper CVT automatic transmission was available in this generation along with standard four-speed automatic, five-speed manual, or as an all-wheel-drive with a five-speed manual. Some models had a 1973&nbsp;cc diesel [[Nissan CD engine#CD20E|CD20E]] engine. Models offered include the standard LeGrand, luxury Eprise, sports-oriented SSS, and a limited run SSS-Z model. The SSS-Z model came with the SR20VE engine option and featured special interior trim which was silver rather than the wood trim found in the Legrand, Eprice and SSS model.\n\nIn 2001 a final limited run of SSS models was produced. These cars have a special red and grey paint job, gold rather than the standard silver emblems, and red metal covers over the headlights.\n\nThis model also came with the SR20VE engine.\n\nProduction of the Nissan Bluebird ended in Japan in 2001, and it was replaced by the mid-size [[Nissan Maxima]], [[Nissan Teana]], and [[Nissan Altima]] internationally, and the compact [[Nissan Bluebird Sylphy]] in Japan. It was a popular export to Russia, Africa and New Zealand.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* [http://press.nissan-global.com/COMMON/HERITAGE/database/en_detail.html?001 Nissan Heritage Collection]\n* Ken Togo's paper [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID963953_code436859.pdf?abstractid=963953&mirid=1 Infant Industry Policy: A Case of Japanese Automobile Industry Before 1945]\n* [http://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/data_e/1-5e.html Japanese Society of Automotive Engineers (JSAE)]\n* {{citation |first=Christopher |last=Madeley |url=http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/is/is494.pdf |work=International and Japanese Studies Symposium: The Automobile in Japan |title=Kaishinsha, DAT, Nissan and the British Motor Vehicle Industry |date=July 2005 |id=No. IS/05/494 |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |location=London, UK |ref=CMad}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n* [http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=9765&vf=18 Drive.com.au Nissan Bluebird Review]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070914175208/http://dogandlemon.com/site/japanese-vehicle-recalls/?make=NISSAN&model=BLUEBIRD Japanese Imports Safety Recalls]\n* [http://www.ratdat.com/ RatDat.com \u2013 paint colors, sales brochures, and model names]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100804231444/http://www.earlydatsun.com/index.html earlydatsun.com]\n* {{cite web |title=1932 Datsun 11 |work=Early Datsun Homepage |url=http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun11.html |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811234724/http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun11.html |archivedate=11 August 2010  }}\n* {{cite web |title=1933 Datsun 12 |work=Early Datsun Homepage |url=http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun12.html |accessdate=23 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812002128/http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun12.html |archivedate=12 August 2010  }}\n{{nissan}}\n{{Modern European Nissan vehicles}}\n{{North American Datsun vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Nissan vehicles|Bluebird]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with four-wheel steering]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with CVT transmission]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1959]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Nissan Bluebird\n| image        = NISSAN Bluebird SSS 02.jpg\n| caption      = Nissan Bluebird (U14)\n| manufacturer = [[Nissan]]\n| production   = 1955\u20132007\n| class        = [[Compact car]]\n| body_style   = 2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]/[[sedan (car)|sedan]]/wagon\n| layout = [[FR layout]] (1955\u20131983)<br>[[FF layout]] (1983\u20132007)\n| successor    = [[Nissan Primera]] (Europe)<br />[[Nissan Pintara]] (Australia)<br />[[Nissan Teana]] (Asia)<br />[[Nissan Altima]] (Americas)<br />[[Nissan Lannia]] (China){{cn|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Nissan Bluebird''' is a compact car with a model name introduced in 1957. It has been Nissan's most internationally recognized sedan, in multiple body styles, and is known for its dependability and durability. The Bluebird originated from Nissan's first vehicles, dating to the early 1900s, and its traditional competitor became the [[Toyota Corona]]. The Bluebird was positioned to compete with the Corona, as the Corona was developed to continue offering a sedan used as a [[taxicab|taxi]] since [[Toyota Crown]] was growing in size. Every generation of the Bluebird has been available as a taxi, duties that are shared with base level [[Nissan Cedric]]s. It is one of the longest-running nameplates from a Japanese automaker. It spawned most of Nissan's products sold internationally, and has been known by a number of different names and bodystyles, including the 160J/710/Violet/Auster/Stanza line.\n\n== Export and foreign-built model names ==\nExport versions were sold variously as the [[Datsun 510 Sedan|Datsun 510]], Datsun 180B (with 160B and 200B versions) and the Datsun Bluebird. The Nissan Bluebird nameplate began appearing around 1982 as the [[Datsun]] marque was phased out in favour of Nissan.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, Australia followed the Japanese convention by calling its car the Bluebird, and had a unique, facelifted rear-wheel-drive version for 1984 and 1985. That car was replaced in 1986 by the [[Nissan Pintara]]. It would be replaced by the successive Bluebird, also called Pintara, until 1992; then the range was brought in line with the Japanese model, for the U13 series from 1993 to 1997. In an unusual twist, brought about under the short lived [[Button Plan]], the Pintara was also rebadged for [[Ford Australia]] as the [[Ford Corsair]], reviving a Ford UK nameplate last used in the 1960s.\n\nIn the United States, the Bluebird was eventually sold as the [[Nissan Stanza]]. In 1992, the Stanza became the [[Nissan Altima]]. Currently, the Bluebird is not sold in North America; in 1998, the Altima was completely redesigned, becoming a model unique to the North American market. The Bluebird sold in Europe between 1986 and 1990 was in fact a rebadged [[Nissan Auster]]\u2014this was replaced by the [[Nissan Primera|Primera]] in Nissan's European line-up in 1990. A six-cylinder version called the [[Nissan Maxima|Maxima]] was released in the 1980s and became a separate model.\n\n== Historic vehicles ==\nThe DAT corporation had been producing cars since 1914 [Togo, pg. 11], but through the 1920s, much of their profitability depended on government subsidies of their large trucks [Togo, pg. 8]. A 1930 ministerial ordinance by the Japanese government declared that drivers' licenses would not be required for cars with engines up to 500 cc displacement, and that the purchase of these vehicles would be taxed at a lower rate. [Togo, pg. 12] DAT began to produce a small car for this market. The new car was called \"Datson\"(i.e. \"Son of DAT\")<ref name=\"CMad22\">[[Nissan Bluebird#CMad|Madeley]], p. 22</ref> and later \"Datsun\" to distinguish it from the full-sized trucks and cars the company had produced in the past.\n\n=== Datsun Type 10 \u2013 17 ===\n\n==== Type 10 ====\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Type 10\n| production = 1930\n| assembly = Japan\n| designer = Takayoshi Gotou\n| body_style = phaeton, van, roadster\n}}\nIn 1929, DAT built a small-car prototype called the '''DAT 91'''. They ended up marketing this model as the '''DATSON Type 10''' (\"son of DAT\"), since it was a shrunken version of the earlier 31.<ref name=DAT10>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun10.html|title=earlydatsun.com|website=www.earlydatsun.com|access-date=16 December 2018}}</ref> \"DAT\" was now a backronym for '''D'''urable, '''A'''ttractive, and '''T'''rustworthy.

[JSAE]. It was offered in several body styles, and DAT/Nissan sold 150 of the Type 11 in 1932. [JSAE] The Type 11 was only produced during the year 1932, as changes in the law allowed Nissan to sell a new model with a larger engine in 1933.\n\nThe Datsun Type 11 had the same engine displacement and external dimensions as an Austin Seven, and information about the British car was widely available within Japan. In October and November 1929, the chief engineer of Austin presented a paper in Tokyo called \"The British Light Car\". This paper is supposed to have provided detailed explanations and illustrations of many of the mechanical components of the Austin Seven.<ref name=CMad22/> The exact relationship between the two cars is, however, in dispute.

The name [[Datsun]] was used by DAT for their line of small cars. After the DAT corporation was absorbed into Nissan, these cars continued to be produced, and the original model name was maintained. The Type 12 was basically similar to the earlier 1932 Type 11, but had a larger engine.\n\nJapanese laws at that time did not require a license to drive automobiles with small-displacement engines. DAT/Nissan produced the Datsun Type 11 as their entry into this market. The original limitation for this class of vehicles was 500 cc displacement engines, but that was changed to 750 cc in 1933. Nissan responded to this change by producing a larger engine, and gave the more powerful car a new name, the Type 12.\n\nThe 1934 '''Datsun Type 13''' went into production in April 1934 with its chassis built in the ''Osaka Plant of the Automotive Division of Tobata Casting'', which merged with ''Nihon Sangyo Co.'' ([[Nissan]]) after selling its factory. Its grille was chrome plated with a tall heart shaped opening instead of the Austin 7 like grille. It is the first Datsun model to have a truck variant called the '''13T''', along as being the first car exported from Japan; a total of 44 vehicles were exported to South Africa and Australia.\n\nThe 1935 '''Datsun Type 14''' is externally very similar to the Type 13 but uses the addition of a leaping rabbit emblem at the front. Mechanically, the old DAT engine of the Datsun 13 was replaced with the Datsun Type 7 engine, a [[Flathead engine|side valve]] 4 cylinder engine with a displacement of 722 cc (44.1 cu in). It marked \"''the birth of the Japanese car industry''\" according to Britain's National Motor Museum at Beaulieu. Nissan produced the vehicle at [[Yokohama]], along with its commercial truck version called the '''14T'''.\n{{-}}\n\n==== Type 15 \u2013 17 ====\n{{See also|Datsun Type 15|Datsun Type 16|Datsun Type 17}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Type 15\n| image = File:Datsun Model 15 Phaeton (17126095594).jpg\n| manufacturer = Datsun/[[Nissan]]\n| production = May 1936\n| assembly = Japan: [[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Yokohama Plant]], [[Kanagawa-ku, Yokohama]]\n| body_style = phaeton, roadster, coupe, sedan, van, truck (15T)\n| engine = 722 cc (44.1 in3) Type 7 I4\n| transmission = 3-speed manual\n| successor = [[Datsun Type 16]]\n}}\nThe 1936 '''Datsun Type 15''' was mechanically very similar to the preceding [[Datsun Type 14]].

Both the Type 15 and '''15T''' were produced in Yokohama on May 1936, with the 15T having a different engine cover that has near vertical vents instead of the cars horizontal vents.\n\nThe '''Datsun Type 16''' is the successor of the Type 15. It could only be differentiated externally by detailing on the bonnet and changes in the bonnet mascot and its logo.\n\nThe last Datsun small car is the '''Datsun Type 17''' which is distinguished by a wide vertical bar in middle of the front grille. Production began in April 1938 and, according to Nissan, continued until January 1944. Although David Bent claims that it finished in late 1938 as part of the cessation civilian car production that followed the Japanese decision to focus on military vehicles.

The DA was a very modest and simple car based on the Type 17, with the slightly larger DB series added in March 1948. Nissan also offered commercial vehicles, and the DA was sold as the Datsun 1121 truck, which was essentially the DA with a shortened cab for the front seat and an exposed cargo area attached to the chassis. An open-top roadster/convertible called the Datsun DC-3 appeared 12 January 1952, largely created by Yuichi Ohta. Yuichi was the son of Hiro Ohta, who founded the [[Ohta Jidosha]] car company, which produced cars in Japan between 1934 and 1957, until it became part of [[Tokyu Kogyo Kurogane]] shortly thereafter.

It was introduced to Japan within a month of the introduction of the [[Toyota Crown]] RS series, and was smaller than the [[Prince Sedan]] introduced earlier in 1952 and the [[Subaru 1500]] introduced in 1955. Sedans built in Japan during the 1950s were introduced to serve as taxis, and introduced mass production vehicles, as opposed to earlier vehicles made using a slower hand-made process.\n\nThis sedan was designed to be compliant with the Japanese Government's [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]] passed in 1950. The engine displacement was also kept below the 1000cc designation to reduce the annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]] obligation. Nissan did have an engineering relationship with the [[Austin Motor Company#Japan|Austin Motor Company]], and this generation does share some appearance similarities to the [[Mini]], introduced in 1959.\n\nThe Datsun 110 series used the [[Nissan D engine|Nissan D10]] type engine based on an original (albeit Austin inspired) design from before World War II. The engine is a water-cooled inline-four cylinder with two crankshaft bearings, side intake and exhaust valves, a displacement of 860cc and with {{convert|25|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4000&nbsp;rpm. Aside from not using the name, the A110 is the direct forerunner of the modern Bluebird line. Incremental changes were denoted by 112 and 113 codes&nbsp;\u2013 the 111 designation was skipped. The last model, introduced in June 1956, received an all-new, developed in-house gearbox. The earlier 110 and 112 had been using the four-speed, floor-mounted transmission from the [[Austin A40 Somerset]] (then built under license by Nissan), but the new 113 received a column-shifted four-speed unit which narrowly allowed seating for three in front.

The 312 was also available in a deluxe version (DP312). A trim model called the \"Fancy Deluxe\" (model code DP312-L) was marketed for the female driver; it featured a pale yellow exterior, pale yellow/grey interior, high heel shoe holder under the dash, a vanity mirror on the back of the driver's side sun visor, a turn signal relay that played music, curtains, automatic clutch, and bigger mirrors. By February 1961, a 1.2&nbsp;L overhead-valve engine (codenamed E-1) became an option on a higher-trim DX model.\n\nStyling tended to mimic larger American cars.

The appearance appears to have had an influence on Nissan's first V8-powered [[Nissan President#President H150 and H250|Nissan President]] in 1965, and the [[Nissan Sunny#B10 (1966\u20131969)|Nissan Sunny]] in 1966.\n\nThis generation Bluebird was introduced in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] as Nissan wanted to offer an all new, modern appearance in time for the games.\n[[File:Datsun Bluebird 410 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun Bluebird 410]]\nTwo basic models were built: 410 (1964\u20131965) with a combination rear lamp set consisting of round and rectangular lenses, and 411 (1965\u20131967), which featured the same combination rear lamp set as the earlier 410 through 1966, changing to higher mounted rectangular tail light sets for 1967. On both, the rear direction indicators were red or amber, according to market \u2013 New Zealand, which allows either, took the 410 with both and the 411 with red only. This Bluebird was one of the first Japanese car lines assembled in New Zealand, initially imported under a tariff/duty arrangement allowing 300 cars a year (the so-called '300 Club') with CKD kits built up by Motor Holdings at Mount Wellington in Auckland. The 410 series sedan and station wagon plus a light delivery van was assembled in South Africa at a factory in Rosslyn Pretoria. These cars were all in CKD format.\n\nA sporting model, the '''Bluebird SS''', was launched in Japan in March 1964, with a tuned 1.2&nbsp;L engine. The SS was originally available only in a four-door configuration (MTK), but a two-door (RTK) joined about a year later. Two versions of the SS were built: the DP410-MTK/RTK and the DP411-MTK/RTK. The DP410 was powered by a {{convert|71|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of the 1.2&nbsp;L [[Nissan E engine|Nissan E-1 engine]]. The {{convert|78|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} double-carburetted version of the [[Nissan J engine|J13]] powered the DP411. All SS models were equipped with a four-speed manual transmission.\n\n[[File:Datsun 1600 Wagon (410).jpg|thumb|left|1967 Datsun 1600 Wagon (US)]]\n[[File:DatsunBluebird411.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun Bluebird 411]]\nInitially, only a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon were in the range, but a two-door was added in September 1964. The two-door SS was launched in February 1965. The 410 and 411 were also available in a deluxe version (DP410 and DP411). A \"Fancy Deluxe\" version was also available in the home market. A DP411 SSS was entered in motor sport by the Datsun factory in South Africa and was used as test car for Nissan Japan. A Datsun DP411 SSS was also entered in the 1964 [[Monte Carlo rally]], where it was driven by a South African called Ewold van Bergen.\n\nTo minimize production costs for export, the [[Windscreen wiper#Geometry|windshield wipers]] used a pattern where the wipers started in the center and wiped towards the edge of the windshield, instead of from the passenger side towards the driver.\n\nIn May 1965 the base engine was enlarged to a downtuned version of the 1.3&nbsp;L unit already used in the 411-series SS, now with a single (twin-barrel) carb and developing {{convert|67|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5,200&nbsp;rpm.

For some reason it broke with the earlier standard of simply changing the second digit of the chassis code to a \"2\", instead labelling it the '''520'''. The commercial-use 520 further marked the divergence of Datsun's Bluebird and truck lines as it continued to be available until 1972. Later versions received a modernized front end, similar to the contemporary 510 Bluebird.\n\nIn the United States, only the four-door sedan and wagon were offered; the two-door was never available. The 1.6-litre, featuring the same R16 engine as the [[Datsun Sports#SP311|SP(L)311 Roadster]], was only available in 1967.

The \"510\" still enjoys considerable fame in the U.S.\n\nLike its predecessors, the 510 Bluebird line was imported into New Zealand, this time as a single 1.6-litre, four-speed manual Deluxe model, assembled from CKD kits by Campbell Industries (later Toyota New Zealand Thames assembly plant). Local content included glass, radiator, upholstery, carpet, paint, wiring and numerous other items. A few automatic and twin carburettor SSS versions were imported built-up from Japan, primarily for buyers who had access to funds overseas and could utilise the country's 'no remittance' new car purchase scheme to avoid lengthy waiting lists.\n\nThe trim designation \"SS\" was changed to \"SSS\" as General Motors was already using the term for performance branded Chevrolet products called the [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|Super Sport]] starting in 1961.\n\nThe P510 sedan and coup\u00e9 were built in South Africa [Pretoria] from 1969 to 1974 and had the L16 engine, available as 1600 SSS (twin carbs) and as the single carbed 1600 DeLuxe. An automatic gearbox model was also available for the DeLuxe range. The factory also made two versions of the two-door coup\u00e9. They were a 1600GL and a 1800GL. The 1600GL had a single carburetor or twin carbs and 1800&nbsp;cc cars had twin carbs. The 1600 SSS was also used in motorsport as test cars for Nissan Japan. The cars were used in numerous motorsport rallies by Ewold van Bergen from Pretoria, South Africa, who was a test engineer for Nissan Japan.\n[[File:Datsun Bluebird Coupe (510) 001.JPG|thumb|left|Datsun Bluebird \"SSS\" series 510 coup\u00e9]]\n[[File:1968 Datsun Bluebird wgn.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun Bluebird 510 Wagon]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|610}} 610 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Bluebird 610\n| image = Datsun-Bluebird610.jpg\n| caption = Inline-six Datsun Bluebird Coup\u00e9 (G610)\n| aka = Datsun 160B/180B<br />Datsun 610<ref>{{citation |url=http://oldjapanesecar.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=brodatnis&action=print&thread=930 |work=brochure |title=Datsun 610 Hardtop |year=1973 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n| production = 1971\u20131976<br />1972\u20131977 (Australia)\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] (Oppama Plant)<br />Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria]]<ref name=\"Carsales 1971 Datsun 1600 GL\"/><ref name=\"Carsales Datsun rises again\"/><br />New Zealand: [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]] (Campbell Industries); [[Porirua]] (Todd Motors)\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />5-door [[station wagon]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| related = [[Datsun Truck#Datsun 620|Datsun Truck 620]]\n| engine = 1595&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L16|L16]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18]]'' I4<br />1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20B|L20B]]'' I4 (U.S.)<ref name=WC76>{{Cite book |title=World Cars 1976 |publisher=L'Editrice dell'Automobile LEA/Herald Books |location=Bronxville, NY |ref=WC76 |page=376 |year=1976 |isbn=0-910714-08-8}}</ref><br />1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20/L20A]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] (G610)\n| transmission = 4-speed manual<br />5-speed manual<br />3-speed automatic\n| wheelbase = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|2500|mm|abbr=on}} | {{convert|2650|mm|abbr=on}} (G610) }}\n| length = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|4215|mm|abbr=on}} | {{convert|4420|mm|abbr=on}} (G610) }}\n| width = {{convert|1600|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1415|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1035|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe 610 series was launched in Japan in August 1971 and was badged as the '''Datsun Bluebird-U'''. The meaning behind the U suffix is \"User Oriented\", to signify the higher comfort levels than 510 predecessor could muster.<ref name=Catvol20>{{cite journal |ref=JAMA20 |title=\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af: Japanese motor vehicles guide book 1973/1974 |language=Japanese |volume=20 |date=30 October 1973 |publisher=[[Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association]] |location=Japan |page=123}}</ref> A domestic advertising campaign used the catch-line \"Bluebird U \u2013 Up You!\", and was short-lived due to the innuendo. The 610 was one of the first Nissan products to adopt a popular styling appearance, called \"[[coke bottle styling|coke bottle]]\" which appeared internationally during the 1960s and 1970s, an appearance shared with the larger [[Nissan Cedric#Third generation 230|Nissan Cedric]], as both vehicles were available at Japanese Nissan dealerships called ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Bluebird Store]]''.\n\n[[File:1972 Datsun 180B (P610) Deluxe sedan (20651657636).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Datsun 180B Deluxe sedan (Australia)]]\n[[File:1977 Datsun 180B (10899901566).jpg|thumb|left|1977 Datsun 180B sedan (NZ)]]\n[[File:1974 Datsun 180B (P610) SSS coupe (19055363101).jpg|thumb|left|1974 Datsun 180B SSS hardtop (Australia)]]\n[[File:1976 Datsun 180B (P610) GL sedan (2011-01-05).jpg|thumb|left|1977 Datsun 180B GL sedan (Australia)]]\n[[File:1975 Datsun 180B (P610) GX station wagon (25722031675).jpg|thumbnail|left|1975 Datsun 180B GX station wagon (Australia)]]\n\nFor the Japanese domestic market, the 610 was pitted against the second generation [[Toyota Corona Mark II]]. Also in Japan, the 610 was initially sold alongside the 510 but eventually replaced the 510. 610s were available as a four-door, two-door hardtop (HT), and a five-door wagon/light van. Trim levels in Japan were '''GL''' (Grand Luxe), '''SSS''' (Super Sports Sedan), '''DX''' (Deluxe) or '''STD''' (Standard). It borrowed its suspension and drive train from the outgoing 510, with some modifications. Likewise, the 610 four-door and two-door retained the class-leading, independent rear trailing arm design, while the wagon reused the rear live axle with leaf springs from the 510 wagon.\n\nWhether four or six-cylinder models, all 610s were equipped with Nissan's [[Nissan L engine|L-series]] inline engines. In many export markets, including UK, Europe, and Australia, the 610 was badged as the '''160B''' or '''180B''' with respect to particular engine displacement. The Bluebird name also often appeared in advertising and in brochures. In the UK the popularity of the 160B/180B/180B SSS Coupe range further strengthened Datsun's position as the leading Japanese importer. As a result of Japanese Government passage of emission control regulations, Nissan introduced their emissions technology in 1975, using a badge that said \"[[Nissan NAPS]]\" (Nissan Anti Pollution System) on vehicles thus equipped. Most 610s worldwide came equipped with either a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission, but a five-speed manual transmission was available in the Japanese and Australian markets.\n\nAs with the 510, the '''SSS''' trim included miscellaneous sport options and a higher output engine with twin-Hitachi carburetors. A Japan-only '''SSS-E''' model was equipped with [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]-licensed [[Fuel injection|electronic fuel injection]], and so was one of the first, mass-produced [[Nissan]] vehicles to be sold without a [[carburetor]]. Another 610 never exported was the inline-six U-2000 GT and U-2000 GTX (nicknamed \"shark-nose\" in Japanese), which shows some visual similarities to the [[Pontiac GTO#Second generation|Pontiac GTO]] and [[Oldsmobile Cutlass#Third Generation - 1968\u20131972|Oldsmobile Cutlass]]. Called the G610, it came with a stretched front end to accommodate the longer engine and featured a different grill and other aesthetic modifications. This model was not available as a [[wagon]]. The most powerful GTX-E received fuel injection and {{convert|130|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[[#WC76|''World Cars 1976'']], p. 377</ref>\n\nThe 610 Bluebird received a facelift in 1974, with prominent turn signals mounted on the front corners and with a more squared off grille as well as new taillamps.<ref name=MMIp9697>{{cite journal |journal=Motor Magazine International |date=January 1974 |title=New Model: Datsun Bluebird U |pages=96\u201397 |volume=2 |number=1}}</ref> The SSS models now had styled steel wheels without hubcaps.

A minor upgrade to the front suspension (offset strut tops) for the 610 led to slightly improved handling before the introduction of the 810.\nt\n'''Australia'''\nIn Australia, Datsun released the locally produced 180B in October 1972<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&make=Nissan&model=Bluebird |title=Nissan Bluebird \u2013 Used Car Research |work=GoAuto |accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> as a four-door sedan in Deluxe and GL trims, and a two-door SSS coupe.<ref name = \"GoAuto P610\">{{cite web |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=2698707334628987CA257125001A1389 |title=Nissan Bluebird (P610 180B (Mk4 Bluebird)) |work=GoAuto |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> The engine fitted was the 1.8-liter ''L18'' engine paired to a four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission; Datsun upgraded the SSS to a five-speed manual in 1975.<ref name = \"GoAuto P610\"/> Over the base Deluxe, GL models added: vinyl roof, radio with separate speaker, upgraded interior upholstery and trim, cut-pile interior carpeting, chrome exhaust extension, rear mounted GL badge, and whitewall tyres.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/New_Datsun_180B_GL_Deluxe_SSS_1974_brochure_Australia |title=New Datsun 180B GL, Deluxe and SSS |format=PDF |publisher=Nissan Australia |date=May 1974 |id=7729.5.74 |accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> In early 1974, wrap-around front indicators, new tail-lights and cabin trim changes heralded a range-wide facelift, while a fully imported (not locally manufactured) luxury GX sedan arrived in November 1974.<ref name = \"GoAuto P610\"/>\nThe GX model could only be differentiated on the exterior by its grille, wipers and badges, although the interior gained luxuries such as cloth inserts for the vinyl upholstery and a three-way adjustable driving seat (fore/aft, recline, thigh support).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Loon |first=A.

A three-speed automatic&nbsp;\u2013 using a transmission made by Nissan Japan subsidiary JATCO&nbsp;\u2013 was later added as a factory option. Relaxed restrictions on car assembly kit imports and increasing affluence in NZ meant Campbell's, which also assembled Toyota, Renault, Rambler, Hino, Isuzu and Peugeot models over the years, could not meet demand so Nissan-Datsun (NZ) contracted Chrysler/Mitsubishi importer Todd Motors to assemble additional manual 180Bs at its Porirua factory alongside the Chrysler Valiant, Hunter, Avenger and Alpine model ranges and Mitsubishi Lancer sedan and Colt Galant coupe. The Todd-built cars gave Datsun dealers a new range of paint colours all different from those Campbell's offered.\n\n'''Racing history'''\nA 610 four-door participated in the 1972 and 1973 [[East African Safari Rally]]. Bob Sharp drove his 610 HT race car to second place overall in the American SCCA B Sedan Championship for 1973 and 1974. The same car achieved a first place for the 1976 SCCA B-Sedan Championship but with [[Elliot Forbes-Robinson]] driving.\n{{clear_left}}\n\n=== {{anchor|710}} 710 series ===\n[[File:Nissan Violet 710.jpg|right|thumb|Datsun Violet 710 series sedan]]\nShortly after the introduction of the 610, Nissan launched a new line of slightly smaller cars January 1973 utilizing parts and styling cues from the 610. This new line of cars was sold in various markets as the [[Datsun]] 140J/160J, [[Nissan Violet|Datsun Violet]], or Datsun 710. In Japan, it was exclusive to ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Cherry Store]]'' Japanese dealerships as a larger companion to the smaller [[Nissan Cherry]], thereby giving Nissan the opportunity to sell a Bluebird-sized vehicle at a different sales channel. The use of the 710 name was a source of confusion because it implied that the model was either a larger, upscale version of the 610 (it was the opposite) or a newer model in the Bluebird line. This car was built at various international plants and was marketed under different names as local conditions required. As the Bluebirds traditional cross-town rival, the Toyota Corona split into a new model called the [[Toyota Carina]], the Violet appeared just under three years after the Carina did.\n\n{{details|Nissan Violet}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|810|200B}} 810 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Bluebird 810\n| image = Datsun Bluebird 1979 Castle Hedingham 2008.JPG\n| caption = 1979 Datsun Bluebird 1.8 GL Sedan (810 series)\n| aka = Datsun 160B<ref name=Robson>Graham Robson, A-Z of Cars of the 1970s, Bay View Books, 1990, page 49</ref><br />Datsun 180B<ref name=Robson/><br />Datsun 200B<ref name=200Bbrochure>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/drdatto/sets/72157613721941896/with/3274666149/ Datsun 200B brochure] Retrieved on 14 August 2011</ref><br />[[Datsun 810]]<ref name=autocade810>[http://autocade.net/index.php/Nissan_Bluebird_%28810%29 Nissan Bluebird (810)] Retrieved on 14 August 2011</ref>\n| production = 1976\u20131979\n| assembly = Japan: [[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Oppama Plant]], [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]]<br />Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria]]<ref name=autocade810/>\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]]<br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />5-door wagon/van\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| engine = {{ unbulleted list | 1.4&nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|I4]] | 1595&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L16|L16]]'' I4 | 1595&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z16|Z16]]'' I4 | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L18|L18/L18E]]'' I4 | 1770&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan Z engine#Z18|Z18/Z18E]]'' I4 | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20B|L20B]]'' I4 | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20/L20E]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] | 2.4&nbsp;L ''[[Nissan L engine#L24|L24/L24E]]'' I6 }}\n| transmission = {{ unbulleted list | 4/5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] }}\n| wheelbase = {{ unbulleted list | {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} | {{convert|2650|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} (G4/G6) }}\n| length = {{convert|167.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n| width = {{convert|64.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n| height = {{convert|54.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n| weight = {{convert|2390|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref name=Autocar1977091977/>\n}}\n\nThe 810 was introduced in July 1976.

In January 1978 local assembly began for the sedan, followed shortly by the wagon. The sedan trim levels were GL and GX. While the coupe remained a [[hardtop]], Datsun added an [[opera window]] in the rear pillar. The coupe was discontinued in Australia in 1979. The engine used is a larger version of the L series engine from the preceding 180B. Dubbed the L20B its capacity was increased to 1952&nbsp;cc, making it good for {{convert|72|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAlmost immediately the 200B became Australia's top selling four-cylinder car, a position it held until it was displaced by the [[Mitsubishi Sigma]]. Its popularity however remained strong right through the production run, family buyers appreciative of the plentiful interior room and standard features. It may have been somewhat conservatively styled, but the effort [[Nissan]] had put into the engineering of the car made it reliable and tough, qualities most Australians rated higher than a more advanced design.\n\nOnly the early fully imported 200B sedans and coupes retained the independent rear suspension from the 180B, locally assembled 200B sedans instead switched to [[coil spring]]s with a live axle, while the wagon (imported from Japan) had a [[live axle]] in the rear with [[leaf spring]]s. Seen as a giant step backwards, the reason for the change was certainly not a cost-cutting measure, but simply the need for Nissan to reach an 85% local content quota that the then Federal Government demanded of Australian car manufacturers. However, in practice the live rear axle, being an Australian development, proved to actually benefit the car's overall handling dynamics.\n\nThe biggest downside to the 200B was the noise the driver would have to endure. The 2-litre overhead cam engine could be very loud when pushed up through the rev range, and to make matters worse there was always plenty of drive line vibration. These issues prompted an exhaustive correction programme to be undertaken by the parent company in Japan, and thankfully later models were somewhat improved.\n\nA sportier version of the 200B sedan was released in June 1978. The new SX featured a revised grille, front spoiler, alloy wheels, revised door and seat trim (striped seat inserts) and tachometer, while the suspension was altered to improve handling. The colours available for this model were simply blue, white or red, and the only transmission available was a 4-speed floor shift. Significantly the SX was a unique model to Australia, the added input from Nissan's Australian design engineers signified a step away from just assembling cars. This in turn led to the locally built Datsuns, and later Nissans, being re-engineered to better suit Australian conditions, with many components being sourced locally a tradition that would continue right up until 1992, when Nissan ceased local manufacture.\n\nIn October 1979, the 200B was revised with a new grille, bumpers, seats, trim, and dashboard. The seats were a unique Australian design for the locally built cars. This facelift was penned by [[Paul Beranger]], a former [[Holden]] designer \u2013 years later he would style the 2006 [[Toyota Aurion]].\n\nIn 1980, a limited edition 200B Aspen GL sedan was released featuring distinctive shadow tone paint available in green, blue, or grey. The 200B was discontinued in May 1981, replaced by the [[Datsun Bluebird]]. Australian comedy band, Tripod, have written a song about the 200B, called \"200B.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/pennywyatt/Interests/Tripod/BoxSet/Box%20Set05.html |title=Box Set Lyrics \u2013 05 \u2013 200B |publisher=Members.optusnet.com.au |accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand (160B/180B/200B) ===\nThis model was also released to New Zealand in 1977, assembled [[Complete knock down|CKD]] in 4-door sedan and 5-door wagon forms. A coupe model was also released, imported built-up from Japan. Unlike the Australian models the sedans used the independent rear suspension system of the Japanese specification models. This Bluebird was the first to be assembled in Nissan New Zealand's own brand-new assembly plant at Wiri, South Auckland. For the first two years of assembly the cars were fitted with a 1.8-litre unit, hence they used the ''180B'' nameplate. Automatic transmission was optional for both. Nissan also added its first luxury ZX version with this generation \u2013 features included velour upholstery, 'luxury' cut-pile carpet sourced locally and tinted glass. There was also, for the first time in Kiwi assembly, a wagon variant with mid-range trim and equipment.\n\nDuring 1979 a number of changes were made on the car, namely an engine enlargement to 2.0 (leading to a renaming of the car to ''200B''), and a mild facelift, using new dual rectangular headlights and a new grille. Due to New Zealand's favour for smaller-engined models, a 1.6-litre ''160B'' variant was also introduced.\n\nProduction of the New Zealand 160/200B continued until late 1980, when it was replaced by the Datsun Bluebird (910).\n\n=== {{anchor|Datsun 810}} North America (810) ===\n[[File:1977 Datsun 810 Wagon.jpg|thumb|right|1977 Datsun 810 wagon]]\n\nIn North America, Datsun marketed the 810 series Bluebird sold as the [[Datsun 810]] from February 1977 to 1980\u2014the direct ancestor of the long running [[Nissan Maxima|Datsun/Nissan Maxima]] range. The Datsun 810 model line began with the six-cylinder Nissan Bluebird 2000G6 sold in Japan. With a longer nose than the regular Bluebird, to accommodate a longer inline-six engine, it was powered by two versions of the [[SOHC]] ''[[Nissan L engine|L-series]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]] engine: a 2.0&nbsp;L displacement for the Japanese market and a 2.4&nbsp;L24E unit for the US market. The Bluebird G6 used a [[carburetor]] for the base model and [[fuel injection]] for the sporty version. The 2.0&nbsp;L engine was good for 122&nbsp;PS [[Horsepower#Japanese Industrial Standard D 1001|JIS]] (90&nbsp;kW), while the bigger American engine could reach 125&nbsp;hp [[SAE International|SAE]] (93&nbsp;kW). The sport version channeled power through a four-speed [[manual transmission]] for the sedan and wagon, five-speed transmission for the coupe. These cars were [[rear-wheel drive]] and had a semi-trailing arm rear suspension. The [[station wagon]] variant, only sold in North America, had a rear live axle for load carrying reasons. Some fuel-injected versions had automatic transmissions.\n\nThe 2-door coup\u00e9 version was introduced in North America in January 1979 for the 1979 model year.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lamm |first=Michael |date=January 1981 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39QDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover |title=and the new Datsun 810 |journal=[[Popular Mechanics]] |location=New York City |volume=155 |number=1 |pages=85, 87, 118 |quote=\"The coupe, introduced in January 1979, has been discontinued, but the four-door sedan and wagon remain.\"}}</ref> Around the same time, the 810 received an exterior refresh. The coup\u00e9 version was never available in second generation 810/Maximas. The new [[Datsun 280ZX]] did not share much of the 810's chassis as thought, though the 810 was not available with that Z car's larger 2.8&nbsp;L engine. The first use of the \"Maxima\" name happened on a domestic Japanese market luxury version of the [[Nissan Stanza|Stanza]], in August 1977.<ref name=GazooStz>{{cite web |work=Gazoo.com |url=http://gazoo.com/meishakan/meisha/shousai.asp?R_ID=1297&ex_spec=shousai |title=\u691c\u7d22\u7d50\u679c: 1979\u5e74 \u30cb\u30c3\u30b5\u30f3 \u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30b6 4door 1800 Maxma X-E ''(sic)'' |trans-title=Great Car Pavilion: 1979 Nissan Stanza 1800 Maxima X-E 4-door |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Toyota Motor Corporation]] |accessdate=10 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504170711/http://gazoo.com/meishakan/meisha/shousai.asp?R_ID=1297&ex_spec=shousai |archivedate=4 May 2012  }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|910}} 910 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Datsun Bluebird 910\n| image = 910BluebirdSSS.jpg\n| production = 1979\u20131983<ref name=Autocade910>[http://www.autocade.net/index.php/Nissan_Bluebird_(910) Nissan Bluebird (910)] Retrieved from http://www.autocade.net on 11 April 2011</ref>\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] (Oppama Plant)<br />Australia: [[Clayton, Victoria]]<ref name=Davis>Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 163.</ref>\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (car)|sedan]]<ref name=Autocade910/><br />5-door [[station wagon]]<ref name=Autocade910/><br />2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<ref name=Autocade910/>\n| layout = [[FR layout]]<ref name=Autocade910/>\n}}\n\n{{main|Datsun Bluebird 910}}\n\nThe Bluebird 910, the last of the rear-wheel drive Bluebirds, featured simple clean-cut lines, unlike the \"Coke Bottle\" styling of its predecessor.<ref name=Lewis>Martin Lewis, A-Z of Cars of the 1980s, 1994, page 102</ref> It did however retain the same engine range, the same MacPherson strut suspension and the same {{convert|99|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase as the 810.<ref name=Lewis/> Starting with this generation, in Japan the Bluebird returned to offering only four-cylinder vehicles, and the six-cylinder Bluebird was replaced by the [[Nissan Skyline]] based [[Nissan Leopard]] at ''Nissan Bluebird Store'' Japanese dealerships. Bluebirds of this generation were renowned for reliability but rusted away in salted areas long before the engine gave trouble. Nissan realigned with the [[Nissan Violet#T11 series (1981\u201386)|Japanese Stanza/Auster/Violet]] sedans which were assigned to individual [[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Japanese Nissan dealerships]].\n\nThis car was also assembled in Australia, in South Africa, in Taiwan, and in New Zealand. This generation was also the basis of the North American [[Nissan Maxima#1981\u20131984|Datsun/Nissan 810 Maxima]] from 1980 onwards.\n\nIn Europe, the Bluebird was joined in 1981 by the similar-sized [[Nissan Violet|Stanza]], which gave Nissan buyers the alternative option of front-wheel drive and a hatchback body style for the first time, as front-wheel drive hatchbacks were by now overtaking rear-wheel drive saloons in popularity.\n{{clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|U11}} U11 series ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Bluebird U11\n| image =Nissan U11 Bluebird SSS.jpg\n| caption = Bluebird SSS-XG hardtop\n| aka = Tan Chong Bluebird<br />Yue Loong Bluebird 921/923\n| production = {{unbulleted list | 1983\u20131987 | 1984\u20131990 (wagon) }}\n| assembly = Japan: [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa]] ([[Nissan#Manufacturing locations|Oppama Plant]])<br />New Zealand: [[Auckland]]<ref name=autocade810/>\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon/sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]] sedan<br />5-door wagon/estate\n| layout = [[FF layout]]\n| related = [[Nissan Maxima#Second generation (PU11; 1984\u20131988)|Nissan Maxima]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 1598&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA16|CA16]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (RU11) | 1809&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA18|CA18S/CA18E]]'' I4 (U11) | 1809&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA18|CA18ET/DET]]'' [[Turbocharger|turbo]] I4 (U11) | 1973&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan CA engine#CA20|CA20S/E]]'' I4 (YU11) | 1998&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan VG engine#VG20|VG20E/VG20ET]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (PU11) | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#LD20|LD20]]'' [[Diesel engine|diesel]] I4 (EU11) | 1952&nbsp;cc ''[[Nissan L engine#LD20|LD20T]]'' [[Turbodiesel|TD]] I4 (EU11) }}\n| transmission =4/5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />3/4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2550|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4360|-|4500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1370|-|1430|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1080|-|1215|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| successor = [[Nissan Avenir]] (wagon)\n}}\n\nThe Bluebird was modified to front-wheel drive in October 1983, but retained the boxy styling of its predecessor.

Even though every panel was changed and most details were considerably smoother, the drag coefficient remained a fairly high 0.39.<ref name=Moniteur>{{cite journal |ref=Moniteur |journal=Le Moniteur de l'Automobile |page=16 |title=Nissan Bluebird: L'habit ne fait pas le moine |trans-title=The clothes do not make the man |language=French |volume=35 |number=793 |date=19 April 1984 |publisher=Editions Auto-Magazine}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1987 Nissan Bluebird 2.0 ZX-E (14334547702).jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Bluebird 2.0 ZX-E (New Zealand)]]\n\nThe range was offered in four-door sedan, four-door hardtop, and five-door station wagon forms. The coup\u00e9 was deleted, and the hardtop sedan is rarely seen outside Japan.\n\nThis model was offered in Europe for only two years before Nissan began building the [[Nissan Stanza#T12 series (1986\u201390)|Auster]] as the Bluebird at its newly opened plant in the UK in 1986. Certain Bluebird models (diesels and station wagons) continued to be offered alongside the T12 \"Bluebird\" in some markets. As usual, the Bluebird received ample standard equipment in European markets. In some markets, the petrol 2.0 was only available coupled to an automatic gearbox.<ref name=Moniteur2>''[[#Moniteur|Le Moniteur de l'Automobile]]'' (no. 793), p. 18</ref>\n\nAlthough the U11 sedans were replaced for the 1988 model year, the station wagon continued to be built until 1990. The six-cylinder Maxima also continued to be built (without the \"Bluebird\" portion of the name from May 1987) until October 1988, when an all-new [[Nissan Maxima|Maxima]] appeared. Most of the wagons sold in Japan were to commercial vehicle specifications, but a plusher Wagon was also offered.

The [[Nissan VG engine#VG20ET|VG20ET]] V6 was offered for the first time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the [[Nissan Maxima|Bluebird Maxima]]. This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0&nbsp;L [[Nissan VG engine#VG30E|VG30E]]. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the turbodiesel had better gas mileage in standardized test cycles, presumably due to it being less stressed \u2013 as long as one did not take full advantage of its better performance.<ref name=Moniteur2/>\n\n[[File:1986 Nissan Bluebird Wagon 2.0 GL 01.jpg|thumb|left|Bluebird 2.0 GL wagon (Europe)]]\nAustralia made do with the 910 series, which was facelifted in 1985. New Zealand marketing for the U11 proclaimed the vehicle as the 'Widetrack Bluebird', to differentiate it from its very similar-looking predecessor. Several Wiri-assembled models including a wagon were offered with 1.6 (base) or two-litre carburettor engines. The alloy head castings all had an unused location for a second spark plug per cylinder, as [[Dual ignition|twin-plug]], fuel-injected versions of the same engines were used in certain markets (US, Japan, Scandinavia) with stricter emission laws.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the following versions were offered:\n* 1.8 DX (1984\u201386)\n* 2.0 GL/GL estate/SGL (1984\u201386)\n* 1.8 Turbo ZX (1984\u201386)\n\n[[File:Yue Loong Bluebird 923SD T9-956 20150411.jpg|thumb|left|Yue Loong Bluebird 923SD (Taiwan)]]\nThe U11 was sold as the ''Yue Loong Bluebird 921 / 923 '' in Taiwan.\n{{clear}}\n\n== T12/T72 series {{anchor|T12|T72}} ==\n[[File:T72 1.8GS .jpg|thumb|Bluebird T12/T72 Series]]\n{{main|Nissan Violet#T12|l1=Nissan Bluebird (T12)}}\n\nThe T12 and the later T72 Nissan Bluebird, is a third-generation [[Nissan Stanza|Auster]], rebadged and sold in Europe.

With the Maxima having been spun off into its own range, U12 Bluebirds were all four-cylinder models, with either a 1.6-, 1.8-, or 2.0-liter petrol engine and also the option of the LD20 2.0-liter diesel. The sports and luxury versions came with a factory viscous LSD. Nissan made a turbocharged Bluebird from 1987 to 1990 named the RNU12, using the 1809&nbsp;cc [[DOHC]] CA18DET that was sold in Japan and New Zealand. It, too used the ATTESA system.\n\n===Export markets===\nThe U12 was also sold in North America as the [[Nissan Stanza]].\n\n;Australia and New Zealand\nThis model was sold as the Nissan Pintara in Australia, replacing a larger Skyline-based model, from 1989 to 1993.

In Japan, a four-door sedan and four-door hardtop were offered, although Nissan of Australia did create a five-door Pintara 'Superhatch' model that was sold as the Bluebird in some export markets, including New Zealand. It was marketed as the 'Bluebird Aussie' in Japan, selling complete with a fluffy little koala, Aussie flag under the clock and other small touches.\n\n[[File:1989 Nissan Bluebird 1.8 XE Saloon HT.jpg|thumb|left|A 1989 Hardtop, with different bodywork behind the A-pillar]]\n\nAustralian models came with the CA20E SOHC 2.0l EFI and KA24E SOHC 2.4l EFI motors. Sadly for Nissan Australia, Project Matilda was not the success it had hoped, even with a twin built for [[Ford Australia]] called the [[Ford Corsair#Ford Corsair UA - Australia|Corsair]], which was even less successful. This led to the collapse of Nissan\u2019s Australian manufacturing operations in the early 1990s. Most of the early Bluebirds of this generation sold in New Zealand were again assembled locally from CKD kits, as had been the case with almost all NZ-bound cars since the first generation in the early 1960s. The Japanese-made, NZ-assembled cars were replaced by Australian made U12 sedans at 'facelift' time though the Kiwi-built wagon, a body variant not made in Australia, carried on.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} NZ trim levels included SGS and ZX; like rival Toyota Australia, Nissan Australia, which ceased local manufacturing in 1994, was willing to build uniquely specified and badged models for its trans-Tasman customer.\n\nTrim levels of the Australian U12 Pintara were as follows:\n*GLi: 2.0&nbsp;L manual 5 speed, high mounted brake light, AM/FM radio cassette\n*Executive: 2.0&nbsp;L auto 4-speed, as above plus, power steering, remote boot release\n*T: 2.4&nbsp;L manual or auto, as above plus 4-wheel disc brakes, tacho, split fold rear seat\n*Ti: 2.4&nbsp;L manual or auto, as above plus limited slip differential, cruise control, climate control, central locking, electric windows, graphic equaliser, fog lamps, alloy wheels\n*TRX: 2.4&nbsp;L manual or auto, as above plus sports seats, sports suspension, body kit, alarm, 6Jx14\" alloy wheels (all other models have 5.5Jx14\" wheels)\n\nAll models were available as a 4-door sedan and 5-door hatch, except the TRX, which was only available as a 4-door sedan. The Ford Corsair was available as a GL (CA20 engine) and Ghia (KA24, similar features as the Ti).\n\n;Malaysia\nLocal assemblers [[Tan Chong Motor|Tan Chong]] were losing the low-cost market to local upstart [[PROTON Holdings|Proton]] in the mid-1980s (by 1986, Nissan sales in Malaysia were down 90 percent from their peak a few years earlier). To revive their fortunes, Tan Chong attempted to reposition the brand as \"upmarket standard,\" taking on brands such as Honda. As a result, the U12 Bluebird was priced much higher than the preceding generation, and was also available with more equipment and in a more powerful, fuel injected 2-litre Super Select model.<ref name=leepsb>{{cite journal |author=Leeps |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=71lPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LZADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5873%2C2280581 | title = Nissan Goes Upmarket | journal = [[New Straits Times]] | page = New Sunday Times, 21 |date=1989-07-09 |accessdate=2020-04-05 }}</ref> The 1974&nbsp;cc CA20E engine produces {{convert|115|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600&nbsp;rpm.

The two models were visually distinct: the four-door sedan had curves where its U12 predecessor had edges, while the hardtop, called the '''Nissan Bluebird ARX''', had more traditional styling. The Bluebird wagon was replaced by the new [[Nissan Avenir]]. This series replaced the [[Nissan Violet|Stanza/Auster/Violet]] platform expansion that enabled Nissan to sell a Bluebird-sized product at [[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan's Japanese dealership network]], as the economic effects of the collapse of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] began to unfold in Japan. Projected production for 1992 was 15,000 cars per month, 13,000 of which were intended for the Japanese domestic market.<ref name=im91>{{cite magazine | magazine = Intan Motor | title = Nissan Bluebird, Honda Civic & Prelude dipasarkan | trans-title = Nissan Bluebird, Honda Civic & Prelude on the market | date = 2 October 1991 | issn = 0215-7713 | number = 91 | publisher = Yayasan Beraya Press | location = Jakarta | language = id | last = Biono | first = Adhi | page = 31 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1995-1997 Nissan Bluebird (U13 S2) LX sedan 01.jpg|thumb|left|1995\u201397 Nissan Bluebird (U13) LX sedan (Australia)]]\n[[File:Nissan U13 Bluebird SSS ATTESA.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Nissan Bluebird (U13) SSS ATTESA LTD (Japan)]]\n[[File:1991 Nissan Bluebird 01.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Nissan Bluebird (U13) ARX hardtop sedan (Japan)]]\n\nThe new Bluebird was designed with comfort in mind. The more spacious cabin was the result of a longer wheelbase and a slightly taller design, in a package retaining the length and width of the previous model. Another comfort equipment was the [[Active noise control|Active Noise Cancellation]] (ANC) system available in domestic market Hardtop models.<ref name=im91/> This was the first installation of such a system, although its effect was limited and it was to be another twenty years before it reached wider adoption.<ref>{{citation | title = Active Control of Noise and Vibration, Second Edition | first1 = Colin | last1 = Hansen | first2 = Scott | last2 = Snyder | first3 = Xiaojun | last3 = Qiu | first4 = Laura | last4 = Brooks | first5 = Danielle | last5 = Moreau | publisher = CRC Press | date = 2012 | isbn = 9781482234008 | page = 3 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral Japanese models included an All Wheel Drive version ([[ATTESA]]). The engines used in the Japanese models ranged greatly in capacity and type. The SSS Attesa LTD model used a \"redtop\" [[Nissan SR engine|SR20DET]] with {{convert|210|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This was a similar engine/drivetrain package to the more powerful one used in the [[Nissan Pulsar|Pulsar GTi-R]]. It had only a single throttle body as opposed the GTi-R's multiple throttle body, smaller bearings, hydraulic rather than solid lifters, and a smaller turbo. The GTi-R had a large top mount [[intercooler]], while the SSS ATTESA LTD had a smaller front mount intercooler. The Bluebird SSS was set apart from the North American Altima in that not only having the SR20DET and AWD Attesa as an option, it also had other details such as power folding retracting mirrors (some heated) and a rear wiper if equipped with a spoiler. US cars are also larger due to the fitment of bigger bumpers.\n\n===Export markets===\nThe Australian delivered U13 Bluebird was released in late 1993 and terminated in 1997. Series 1 ran from 1993 until 1995 while Series 2 ran from 1995 to 1997. Series 2 saw the addition of a driver's airbag, revised grille styling, and a seat belt warning light. The Series 1 LX model came equipped with cruise control standard but strangely it was an option on the Series 2.\n\nThe Australian U13 Bluebirds were available in three different models, LX\u2014the base model but very well equipped, Ti\u2014the luxury model, and the SSS\u2014the sports model. Compared to the LX, the Ti had climate control, a sunroof, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). while comparing the LX to the SSS, the SSS had a HUD (heads-up display\u2014digital speedo on windscreen), climate control, fog lights, ski-port, woodgrain styling, and gear selector display on the instrument cluster (automatic models only). Despite there being a sports model (SSS), the LX was the fastest of the Australian models due to having the least weight. The engine used in the Australian and US U13 models was the [[KA24DE]] with {{convert|112|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}} and 210&nbsp;Nm of torque).\n\nThe U13 Bluebird was introduced in New Zealand in early 1993, and was produced at Nissan's assembly plant in [[South Auckland]] from CKD packs imported from Japan until 1997, when it was replaced by the [[Nissan Primera|Primera]]. The model came in for lots of praise for its handling roadholding, with some models benefitting from the Attesa's passively steered rear wheels.<ref>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Anderson |editor-first=Donn |date=April 1993 |title=High flying Bluebird |magazine=New Zealand Car |location=Auckland |publisher=Accent Publishing Cnr |volume=7 |number=6 |pages=48\u201350 |issn=0113-0196}}</ref> New Zealand models were; S (base model, not available until later), SE (mid-spec), SES (sport) and SEL (luxury). Several versions of the sedan, including the first local Bluebird to have standard factory-fitted air conditioning (automatic climate control in this case) and optional locally supplied leather upholstery. At launch, some local motoring writers criticised Nissan NZ's decision to fit luxury equipment items instead of airbags in top versions but the company insisted there was not yet sufficient retail or fleet buyer demand.\n\nThe US-built U13 ([[Nissan Altima]]) was released in 1993 and was similar to the Australian U13.\n\n===EQ7200 series===\nNissan Motor signed an agreement with [[Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd.]] of China, to build the Bluebird there in the early 2000s. It was the U13 model that was chosen, and is sold there as the Nissan Bluebird.\n\n[[Yulon]] Motor, the [[Taiwan]]-based automaker, developed this variant of the U13, called the EQ7200-II series, in 2001. This featured a U13 central section but heavily revised front and rear ends. However, the centre of the car remains the same, and the {{convert|2620|mm|in|adj=on}} wheelbase is retained. No mention of the Taiwanese connection was made in advertising in Mainland China.\n\nThe EQ7200-I commenced production in 1999 and lasted until 2002 being replaced by the EQ7200-II.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2017/05/02/spotted-china-u13-nissan-fengshen-bluebird-eq7200-sss/|title=Spotted in China: U13 Nissan Fengshen Bluebird EQ7200 SSS|first=Tycho de|last=Feijter|date=2 May 2017|website=CarNewsChina.com}}</ref> The EQ7200-II was built from 2001 to 2003, when it was replaced by a revised EQ7200-III model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2014/08/18/spotted-in-china-nissan-bluebird-eq-7200-ii/|title=Spotted in China: Nissan Bluebird EQ 7200-II|first=Tycho de|last=Feijter|date=18 August 2014|website=CarNewsChina.com}}</ref> The EQ7200-III was sold from 2003 to 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carnewschina.com/2015/12/09/spotted-in-china-nissan-bluebird-eq-7200-iii/|title=Spotted in China: Nissan Bluebird EQ 7200-III|first=Tycho de|last=Feijter|date=9 December 2015|website=CarNewsChina.com}}</ref> The EQ7200-I was a rebadged [[Nissan Altima#First generation (U13, 1992\u20131997)|Nissan Altima U13]] while the EQ7200-II and EQ7200-III were rebadged [[Nissan Altima#Second generation (L30, 1997\u20132001)|Nissan Altima L30]].\n\nThe car is marginally longer at {{convert|4664|mm|in}}, as opposed to the original U13's {{convert|4585|mm|in}}.

The American Altima developed into a completely separate line of cars, with new L-series chassis codes. But in its home market of Japan&nbsp;\u2013 also the only market it was sold new in&nbsp;\u2013 the Bluebird was targeted more at buyers who favoured the formality of larger Japanese sedans. To fit in with a lower bracket in [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese taxation legislation]], the U14 retained a sub-{{convert|1700|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} width.\n\n[[File:Nissan Bluebird SSS (U14).JPG|thumb|left|Nissan Bluebird SSS]]\n\nOnly a four-door sedan was offered. The hardtop and the option of a 1.6&nbsp;L engine were removed. Engine choices were either the SR18(DE), SR20(DE) and the SR20(VE) with available all-wheel-drive (ATTESA) versions. The Nissan Hyper CVT automatic transmission was available in this generation along with standard four-speed automatic, five-speed manual, or as an all-wheel-drive with a five-speed manual. Some models had a 1973&nbsp;cc diesel [[Nissan CD engine#CD20E|CD20E]] engine. Models offered include the standard LeGrand, luxury Eprise, sports-oriented SSS, and a limited run SSS-Z model. The SSS-Z model came with the SR20VE engine option and featured special interior trim which was silver rather than the wood trim found in the Legrand, Eprice and SSS model.\n\nIn 2001 a final limited run of SSS models was produced. These cars have a special red and grey paint job, gold rather than the standard silver emblems, and red metal covers over the headlights.\n\nThis model also came with the SR20VE engine.\n\nProduction of the Nissan Bluebird ended in Japan in 2001, and it was replaced by the mid-size [[Nissan Maxima]], [[Nissan Teana]], and [[Nissan Altima]] internationally, and the compact [[Nissan Bluebird Sylphy]] in Japan. It was a popular export to Russia, Africa and New Zealand.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* [http://press.nissan-global.com/COMMON/HERITAGE/database/en_detail.html?001 Nissan Heritage Collection]\n* Ken Togo's paper [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID963953_code436859.pdf?abstractid=963953&mirid=1 Infant Industry Policy: A Case of Japanese Automobile Industry Before 1945]\n* [http://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/data_e/1-5e.html Japanese Society of Automotive Engineers (JSAE)]\n* {{citation |first=Christopher |last=Madeley |url=http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/is/is494.pdf |work=International and Japanese Studies Symposium: The Automobile in Japan |title=Kaishinsha, DAT, Nissan and the British Motor Vehicle Industry |date=July 2005 |id=No. IS/05/494 |publisher=London School of Economics and Political Science |location=London, UK |ref=CMad}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n* [http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/ArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=9765&vf=18 Drive.com.au Nissan Bluebird Review]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070914175208/http://dogandlemon.com/site/japanese-vehicle-recalls/?make=NISSAN&model=BLUEBIRD Japanese Imports Safety Recalls]\n* [http://www.ratdat.com/ RatDat.com \u2013 paint colors, sales brochures, and model names]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100804231444/http://www.earlydatsun.com/index.html earlydatsun.com]\n* {{cite web |title=1932 Datsun 11 |work=Early Datsun Homepage |url=http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun11.html |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811234724/http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun11.html |archivedate=11 August 2010  }}\n* {{cite web |title=1933 Datsun 12 |work=Early Datsun Homepage |url=http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun12.html |accessdate=23 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812002128/http://www.earlydatsun.com/datsun12.html |archivedate=12 August 2010  }}\n{{nissan}}\n{{Modern European Nissan vehicles}}\n{{North American Datsun vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Nissan vehicles|Bluebird]]\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with four-wheel steering]]\n[[Category:Vehicles with CVT transmission]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1959]]\n[[Category:Touring cars]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n", "name_user": "Davey2010", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Bluebird"}

He also has a phone in his car, and a portable darkroom in the trunk where he could develop his negatives on the spot. \n \nKovac's police liaison is Lieutenant Donovan ([[James Flavin]]), though he frequently seeks advice from Anton Kovac ([[Ludwig St\u00f6ssel]]), his immigrant father.\n\n==Main cast==\n* [[Charles Bronson]] as Mike Kovac\n* [[James Flavin]] as Lieutenant Donovan\n* [[Ludwig St\u00f6ssel]] as Anton Kovac\n\n==Selected guest stars==\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Rachel Ames]]\n* [[Roscoe Ates]]\n* [[Phyllis Avery]]\n* [[Arthur Batanides]]\n* [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]]\n* [[Sebastian Cabot (actor)|Sebastian Cabot]]\n* [[Anthony Caruso (actor)|Anthony Caruso]]\n* [[Booth Colman]]\n* [[Russ Conway (actor)|Russ Conway]]\n* [[Yvonne Craig]]\n* [[Norma Crane]]\n* [[Audrey Dalton]]\n* [[Angie Dickinson]]\n* [[Dolores Donlon]]\n* [[Don Durant]]\n* [[Robert Ellenstein]]\n* [[Bill Erwin]]\n* [[Frank Faylen]]\n* [[Virginia Field]]\n* [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]]\n* [[Rodolfo Hoyos, Jr.]]\n* [[I.

C. 1183 Archbishop Aymon of Tarentaise engaged in an arbitration between Bishop Guigo of Aosta and the Collegiate Church of S. Omer: Duc, ''Cartulaire'', pp. 203-204. Frutaz, p. 284, cites a pair of bulls of [[Pope Alexander III]] of 1172 and 1176 which confirm the metropolitan status of Tarentaise.</ref> It then became subject to Milan again, but was restored to Tarentaise. The diocese of Aosta was suppressed by order of the Emperor Napoleon I, in 1802, an order which was given canonical effect by Pius VII in 1803.<ref>Duchesne, p. 247. Kehr, p. 158.</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Ursus of Aosta|Ursus]] is sometimes said to have been the first bishop, this is controverted.<ref>Savio, pp. 70-71.

The two titles were separated at or following the death of Bishop Anselm of Aosta, in 1026, owing to [[Conrad II]]'s desire to strengthen his position near the important [[Little St Bernard Pass]] and distrust of [[Burchard, bishop of Aosta|Burchard]], Anselm's successor and a relative of various nobles opposed to Conrad's claims in Burgundy. (Burchard subsequently rose in a revolt, which failed; he was later translated to [[diocese of Lyon|Lyons]].)\n\nHis namesake, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (1033-1109), was also a native of [[Aosta]] and probably related to its dynasty of bishops; however, rather than remain in local service, he travelled to [[Bec Abbey]] in [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and ultimately became [[archbishop of Canterbury|primate]] over [[Norman England]] instead.\n\nIn 1133, Bishop Herbert, with the consent of the Provost and Canons of the Collegiate Church of S. Ursi (Ours), converted the Chapter of secular canons into an association of Canons Regular of S. Augustine. This change had the support and authority of [[Pope Innocent II]] behind it. The first Prior of the Canons of S. Ours was Arnulphus, who later became Bishop of Aosta.<ref>Duc, ''Esquisses'', pp. 7-10. Kehr, p. 163.</ref> Two of his Canons, Aimon de Quart and Walbert, later became bishops of Aosta as well.<ref>Duc, ''Esquisses'', p. 11.</ref> In 1134 Bishop Herbert granted the Canons the free administration of their goods, releasing them from episcopal control.<ref>Duc, ''Esquisses'', pp. 12-14.</ref> In 1135 Innocent II conceded the Canons of S. Ours the right of burial and the right to elect their own Prior. This was confirmed by [[Pope Lucius II]] in 1144, and [[Pope Eugene III]] in 1146.<ref>Kehr, p. 163 nos. 3, 4, and 5.

Bishop Humbertus was encouraged by Pope Innocent II, who was under the reforming influence of Bernard of Clairvaux.</ref> The Chapter consisted of two dignities, the Provost and the Archdeacon, and twenty Canons. One of the Canons served as Theologus. There were also fifty-two Perpetual Chaplains and six choir boys (called the ''Innocentes''). A twenty-first Canon was added on 14 September 1721, through the generosity of Father Jean-Baptiste du Chatelard, Prior Commendatory of the Cathedral.<ref>De Tillier, ''Historique'', p. 67. After the death of the donor, the right of nomination to the canonry was transferred to the Chapter.</ref> By 1743 there were twenty-three Canons.<ref>Saint-Marthe, ''Gallia christiana'' XII, p. 805. Ritzler-Sefrin, ''Hierarchia catholica'' V, p. 104 note 1; VI, p. 106 note 1.</ref>\n\nIn the filling of vacancies in the Chapter, an unusual system was followed. In the first month of each season of the year, the Pope had the right of appointment; in the second month of each season, the Bishop enjoyed the right; in the third month, the Chapter. This system lasted down until the administration of Bishop Filiberto Alberto Bailly (1659\u20131691), who traded his right to nominate in February, May, August, and November to the Pope, in exchange for the right to appoint to the ''cures'' in his diocese.<ref>De Tillier, ''Historique'', p. 73-74.</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Bishops of Aosta==\n===to 1200===\n{{Div col}}\n* Eustasius (c. 451 ?)<ref>Eustatius did not attend the provincial council of Milan under Bishop Eusebius in 451, but sent instead a priest named Gratus to represent him.

C. 1183 Archbishop Aymon of Tarentaise engaged in an arbitration between Bishop Guigo of Aosta and the Collegiate Church of S. Omer: Duc, ''Cartulaire'', pp. 203-204. Frutaz, p. 284, cites a pair of bulls of [[Pope Alexander III]] of 1172 and 1176 which confirm the metropolitan status of Tarentaise.</ref> It then became subject to Milan again, but was restored to Tarentaise. The diocese of Aosta was suppressed by order of the Emperor Napoleon I, in 1802, an order which was given canonical effect by Pius VII in 1803.<ref>Duchesne, p. 247. Kehr, p. 158.</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Ursus of Aosta|Ursus]] is sometimes said to have been the first bishop, this is controverted.<ref>Savio, pp. 70-71.

(It was discovered in 1833.) From the ninth century the list of bishops is fairly complete.<ref>Compare Frutaz, pp. 13-14, who states that from the beginning of the diocese to the beginning of the 11th century, only eight names of bishops are known, which he lists and annotates.</ref> [[Bernard of Menthon]] (1008), Archdeacon of Aosta, founded the hospice on the [[Alps]] named after him, as a relief to pilgrims.<ref>{{harvnb|A\u2019Becket|1907}}</ref>\n\nIn the 10th and early 11th centuries, the bishops of Aosta ruled the surrounding country as its [[count of Aosta|secular counts]]. The two titles were separated at or following the death of Bishop Anselm of Aosta, in 1026, owing to [[Conrad II]]'s desire to strengthen his position near the important [[Little St Bernard Pass]] and distrust of [[Burchard, bishop of Aosta|Burchard]], Anselm's successor and a relative of various nobles opposed to Conrad's claims in Burgundy. (Burchard subsequently rose in a revolt, which failed; he was later translated to [[diocese of Lyon|Lyons]].)\n\nHis namesake, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (1033-1109), was also a native of [[Aosta]] and probably related to its dynasty of bishops; however, rather than remain in local service, he travelled to [[Bec Abbey]] in [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and ultimately became [[archbishop of Canterbury|primate]] over [[Norman England]] instead.\n\nIn 1133, Bishop Herbert, with the consent of the Provost and Canons of the Collegiate Church of S. Ursi (Ours), converted the Chapter of secular canons into an association of Canons Regular of S. Augustine. This change had the support and authority of [[Pope Innocent II]] behind it. The first Prior of the Canons of S. Ours was Arnulphus, who later became Bishop of Aosta.<ref>Duc, ''Esquisses'', pp. 7-10. Kehr, p. 163.</ref> Two of his Canons, Aimon de Quart and Walbert, later became bishops of Aosta as well.<ref>Duc, ''Esquisses'', p. 11.</ref> In 1134 Bishop Herbert granted the Canons the free administration of their goods, releasing them from episcopal control.<ref>Duc, ''Esquisses'', pp. 12-14.</ref> In 1135 Innocent II conceded the Canons of S. Ours the right of burial and the right to elect their own Prior. This was confirmed by [[Pope Lucius II]] in 1144, and [[Pope Eugene III]] in 1146.<ref>Kehr, p. 163 nos. 3, 4, and 5.

His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Concordat of 1801]] between Bonaparte and [[Pope Pius VII]], the Pope issued a bull, ''Gravissimis causis'' (1 June 1803),<ref>{{cite book|title=Bullarii Romani continuatio, Summorum Pontificum Benedicti XIV, Clementis XIII, Clementis XIV, Pii VI, Pii VII, Leonis XII, Pii VIII constitutiones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsXKgLwN6UsC|volume=Tomus septimus|year=1850|publisher=Typographia Aldina|location=Prati|language=Latin|pages=443\u2013447, no.

Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.<ref name=\"XIV1842\">{{cite book|author=Benedictus XIV|title=Benedicti XIV ...

Bishop Humbertus was encouraged by Pope Innocent II, who was under the reforming influence of Bernard of Clairvaux.</ref> The Chapter consisted of two dignities, the Provost and the Archdeacon, and twenty Canons. One of the Canons served as Theologus. There were also fifty-two Perpetual Chaplains and six choir boys (called the ''Innocentes''). A twenty-first Canon was added on 14 September 1721, through the generosity of Father Jean-Baptiste du Chatelard, Prior Commendatory of the Cathedral.<ref>De Tillier, ''Historique'', p. 67. After the death of the donor, the right of nomination to the canonry was transferred to the Chapter.</ref> By 1743 there were twenty-three Canons.<ref>Saint-Marthe, ''Gallia christiana'' XII, p. 805. Ritzler-Sefrin, ''Hierarchia catholica'' V, p. 104 note 1; VI, p. 106 note 1.</ref>\n\nIn the filling of vacancies in the Chapter, an unusual system was followed. In the first month of each season of the year, the Pope had the right of appointment; in the second month of each season, the Bishop enjoyed the right; in the third month, the Chapter. This system lasted down until the administration of Bishop Filiberto Alberto Bailly (1659\u20131691), who traded his right to nominate in February, May, August, and November to the Pope, in exchange for the right to appoint to the ''cures'' in his diocese.<ref>De Tillier, ''Historique'', p. 73-74.</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Bishops of Aosta==\n===to 1200===\n{{Div col}}\n* Eustasius (c. 451 ?)<ref>Eustatius did not attend the provincial council of Milan under Bishop Eusebius in 451, but sent instead a priest named Gratus to represent him.
