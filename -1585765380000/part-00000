{"title_page": "Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand", "text_new": "The '''[[horse racing|racing]] of [[Thoroughbred]] horses''' or gallopers as they are also known is a popular sport in [[New Zealand]]. \n\nThe governing body is New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing Incorporated. \n\n[[Image:The Winner by 3 quarters of a length - Cluden Creek.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Wellington Cup]] race in [[New Zealand]] ]]\n\n==History==\n\nThe first [[totalisator]] machine in the world was installed at [[Ellerslie Racecourse]] in 1913, see Sir [[George Julius]]).\n\nFamous New Zealand racehorses include the great mares [[Desert Gold (horse)|Desert Gold]], [[Cuddle (horse)|Cuddle]], [[Horlicks (horse)|Horlicks]] and [[Sunline]], plus [[Carbine (horse)|Carbine]], [[Kindergarten (horse)|Kindergarten]], [[Phar Lap]], [[Nightmarch]], [[Gloaming (horse)|Gloaming]], [[Rising Fast]], [[Il Tempo (horse)|Il Tempo]], [[Advance (horse)|Advance]], [[Tulloch (horse)|Tulloch]] and [[Grey Way]]. Both Australia and New Zealand claim Phar Lap. Gloaming, an Australian-bred horse, raced in Australia and in New Zealand.\n\n===Women jockeys===\nIn 1977 the New Zealand Racing Conference accepted female jockeys and they became eligible to ride on 15 July 1978. Previously Linda Jones was the first to apply for an apprentice\u2019s licence and be turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. \n\nThe first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977. Sue Day from Christchurch became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru<ref>https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2018/07/13/sue-historic-day-40-years-racing-milestone/</ref>. Other female riders then included Joanne Hale, Vivienne Kaye, Joanne Lamond and Cherie Saxon. \n\nLinda Jones\u2019 first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after Royal Petite was the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Linda were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby).  Linda Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia (Doomben).<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12088993</ref>\n\nFemale riders have subsequently gone on to win the New Zealand premiership; Lisa Cropp (2005-2007), Lisa Allpress (2012, 2016 and 2019) and Samantha Collett (2018).\n\nIn late February 2020 Lisa Allpress was the first female to win a thoroughbred race in Saudi Arabia on the horse Matmon at King Abdullah Aziz racetrack in Riyadh<ref>https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/238767/jockey-lisa-allpress-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia</ref>. She was competing in the inaugural International jockeys challenge in which she competed with 14 other jockeys including 7 women. The challenge was won by American Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith, Swiss-born Germany based Sibylle Vogt was second while Lisa was third equal with French jockey Mickaelle Michel<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/racing/119949865/lisa-allpress-becomes-first-female-jockey-to-ride-a-winner-in-saudi-arabia</ref>.\n\n===New Zealand horses in Australia===\n\nHorses frequently move between New Zealand and its neighbour [[Australia]], for races and for [[Horse breeding|breeding]] purposes. \n\nBetween 1882 and {{as of | 2019 | alt = 2019}} New Zealand-bred horses won Australia's [[Melbourne Cup]] 43 times.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!-- no byline --> |title=Melbourne Cup 2019 full guide: Kiwi connections, prizemoney, livestream |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/racing/117158773/melbourne-cup-2019-full-guide-kiwi-connections-prizemoney-livestream |accessdate=25 January 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=November 5, 2019 }}</ref> During the 2008-09 racing season 19 New Zealand-bred Thoroughbreds won 22 [[Group One]] races around the world.<ref>\nRacetrack Sires 2009, June/August, 2009, ''Record season for the New Zealand breed'', p.52\n</ref>\n\n==Race clubs and courses of New Zealand==\n\nThoroughbred racing is held throughout New Zealand, including courses in some of the smaller centres.\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"; style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:100%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"LightSteelBlue\" align=\"center\"\n! width=\"100px\" | '''Club'''<br />\n! width=\"170px\" | '''Course, Town/city/province'''  <br />\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Track'''\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Direction'''\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Straight'''\n! width=\"150px\" | '''Notes'''  <br />\n|-\n| Ashburton RC     || [[Ashburton, New Zealand]]  || 1876m ||left-handed || 382m ||\n|-\n| Auckland RC   || [[Ellerslie Racecourse]], Auckland  ||  1876m ||right-handed ||382m||\n|-\n| Avondale JC   || [[Avondale, Auckland]] ||  1800m ||right-handed|| 450m ||\n|-\n| Banks Peninsula RC|| Motukarara, Canterbury  ||  1800m ||left-handed  ||400m||\n|-\n| Beaumont RC    || Wingatui, Dunedin (since 1987) || 2000m|| left-handed ||350m || Part of Gallop South \n|-\n| Cambridge RC     || Te Rapa, Hamilton || 1800m || left-handed || 420m|| Owns training course/complex at Cambridge\n|-\n| Canterbury JC    || [[Riccarton Park Racecourse | Riccarton Park]], Christchurch  || 2400m || left-handed ||400m||\n|-\n| Central Otago RC    || Omakau  || 1600m ||left-handed|| 300m|| Part of Gallop South \n|-\n| Counties RC    || Pukekohe Park, Franklin  ||1900m ||right-handed ||520m ||\n|-\n| Dargaville RC    || Awakino Point   ||1600m ||left-handed || 350m|| 1 meeting per year, in November \n|-\n| Egmont RC    || Hawera || 1822m||left-handed ||350m ||\n|-\n| Feilding JC    || Awapuni, Palmerston North  ||  1700m ||left-handed || 350m || Part of RACE\n|-\n| Foxton RC    || Previously raced at Foxton, Horowhenua  ||1811m || left-handed||349m ||Trials only.

Both Australia and New Zealand claim Phar Lap. Gloaming, an Australian-bred horse, raced in Australia and in New Zealand.\n\n===Women jockeys===\nIn 1977 the New Zealand Racing Conference accepted female jockeys and they became eligible to ride on 15 July 1978. Previously Linda Jones was the first to apply for an apprentice\u2019s licence and be turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. \n\nThe first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977. Sue Day from Christchurch became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru<ref>https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2018/07/13/sue-historic-day-40-years-racing-milestone/</ref>. Other female riders then included Joanne Hale, Vivienne Kaye, Joanne Lamond and Cherie Saxon. \n\nLinda Jones\u2019 first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after Royal Petite was the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Linda were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby).  Linda Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia (Doomben).<ref>https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=12088993</ref>\n\nFemale riders have subsequently gone on to win the New Zealand premiership; Lisa Cropp (2005-2007), Lisa Allpress (2012, 2016 and 2019) and Samantha Collett (2018).\n\nIn late February 2020 Lisa Allpress was the first female to win a thoroughbred race in Saudi Arabia on the horse Matmon at King Abdullah Aziz racetrack in Riyadh<ref>https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/238767/jockey-lisa-allpress-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia</ref>. She was competing in the inaugural International jockeys challenge in which she competed with 14 other jockeys including 7 women. The challenge was won by American Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith, Swiss-born Germany based Sibylle Vogt was second while Lisa was third equal with French jockey Mickaelle Michel<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/racing/119949865/lisa-allpress-becomes-first-female-jockey-to-ride-a-winner-in-saudi-arabia</ref>.\n\n===New Zealand horses in Australia===\n\nHorses frequently move between New Zealand and its neighbour [[Australia]], for races and for [[Horse breeding|breeding]] purposes. \n\nBetween 1882 and {{as of | 2019 | alt = 2019}} New Zealand-bred horses won Australia's [[Melbourne Cup]] 43 times.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!-- no byline --> |title=Melbourne Cup 2019 full guide: Kiwi connections, prizemoney, livestream |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/racing/117158773/melbourne-cup-2019-full-guide-kiwi-connections-prizemoney-livestream |accessdate=25 January 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=November 5, 2019 }}</ref> During the 2008-09 racing season 19 New Zealand-bred Thoroughbreds won 22 [[Group One]] races around the world.<ref>\nRacetrack Sires 2009, June/August, 2009, ''Record season for the New Zealand breed'', p.52\n</ref>\n\n==Race clubs and courses of New Zealand==\n\nThoroughbred racing is held throughout New Zealand, including courses in some of the smaller centres.\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"; style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:100%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"LightSteelBlue\" align=\"center\"\n! width=\"100px\" | '''Club'''<br />\n! width=\"170px\" | '''Course, Town/city/province'''  <br />\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Track'''\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Direction'''\n! width=\"30px\" | '''Straight'''\n! width=\"150px\" | '''Notes'''  <br />\n|-\n| Ashburton RC     || [[Ashburton, New Zealand]]  || 1876m ||left-handed || 382m ||\n|-\n| Auckland RC   || [[Ellerslie Racecourse]], Auckland  ||  1876m ||right-handed ||382m||\n|-\n| Avondale JC   || [[Avondale, Auckland]] ||  1800m ||right-handed|| 450m ||\n|-\n| Banks Peninsula RC|| Motukarara, Canterbury  ||  1800m ||left-handed  ||400m||\n|-\n| Beaumont RC    || Wingatui, Dunedin (since 1987) || 2000m|| left-handed ||350m || Part of Gallop South \n|-\n| Cambridge RC     || Te Rapa, Hamilton || 1800m || left-handed || 420m|| Owns training course/complex at Cambridge\n|-\n| Canterbury JC    || [[Riccarton Park Racecourse | Riccarton Park]], Christchurch  || 2400m || left-handed ||400m||\n|-\n| Central Otago RC    || Omakau  || 1600m ||left-handed|| 300m|| Part of Gallop South \n|-\n| Counties RC    || Pukekohe Park, Franklin  ||1900m ||right-handed ||520m ||\n|-\n| Dargaville RC    || Awakino Point   ||1600m ||left-handed || 350m|| 1 meeting per year, in November \n|-\n| Egmont RC    || Hawera || 1822m||left-handed ||350m ||\n|-\n| Feilding JC    || Awapuni, Palmerston North  ||  1700m ||left-handed || 350m || Part of RACE\n|-\n| Foxton RC    || Previously raced at Foxton, Horowhenua  ||1811m || left-handed||349m ||Trials only.

{"title_page": "List of prizes known as the Nobel of a field", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\nSeveral fields of human cultural and scientific development are not included in the list of [[Nobel Prize]]s, because they are either not among the prizes established as part of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s will nor, in the case of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], sponsored afterwards by the [[Nobel Foundation]]. While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes include (with the year when a prize was awarded for the first time in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes include (with the year when a prize was awarded for the first time in brackets):\n\n===Mathematical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Applied Sciences===\n\n====Astronomy====\n* [[Kavli

The observation that sandstone tabular bodies were deposited with coarse sandstones and [[tuff]] interclasts also supports that ''Aniksosaurus'' was preserved in a fluvial environment. The soft tissue underwent subaerial [[weathering]] and then began to decompose, from the contributory action of small vertebrae scavengers as evidenced by a series of small grooves in one of the femora recovered, which was then followed by the partial disarticulation of the skeleton. Disarticulation was followed by reorientation of the remains by fluvial currents, which was then followed by differential burial in what appears to have been at least two stages of sedimentation.

The soft tissue underwent subaerial [[weathering]] and then began to decompose, from the contributory action of small vertebrae scavengers as evidenced by a series of small grooves in one of the femora recovered, which was then followed by the partial disarticulation of the skeleton. Disarticulation was followed by reorientation of the remains by fluvial currents, which was then followed by differential burial in what appears to have been at least two stages of sedimentation. No evidence was found to support either cannibalism or intra-specific competition.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://dml.cmnh.org/2001Jan/msg00511.html Mickey Mortimer] and [http://dml.cmnh.org/2001Jan/msg00521.html Josh B.

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book thats in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''.

While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story closes with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions.

When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker. A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "name_user": "Ravenabusjit", "label": "safe", "comment": "word choice", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker%27s_Back"}
