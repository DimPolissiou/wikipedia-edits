In 635 CE, it became the first city in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to be conquered by the Muslim [[Rashidun army]] and quickly developed into a center of [[Fiqh|Islamic law]]. However, by the time the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]] invaded the country starting in 1099, Gaza was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza experienced several hardships\u2014from [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] raids to floods and locusts, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the [[Ridwan dynasty]] controlled Gaza and under them the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893.\n\nGaza fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|part]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. As a result of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], [[Egypt]] administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was captured by [[Israel]] in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly-created [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In the months following the 2006 election, an [[Fatah-Hamas conflict|armed conflict]] broke out between the Palestinian political factions of [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]], resulting in the latter [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|taking power in Gaza]]. Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] on the Gaza Strip.<ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\" /> Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.<ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/05/gaza-economy-benefits-fro_n_890181.html Gaza Benefiting From Israel Easing Economic Blockade]</ref><ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 06/21/11 08:13 AM ET\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/gaza-border-opening-bring_n_881127.html Gaza Border Opening Brings Little Relief]</ref>\n\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza are small-scale industries and agriculture.

Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and [[tamarind]]. Many of the traditional dishes rely on [[clay pot cooking]], which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played an important role in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as ''saliq wa adas'' (\"chard and lentils\") and ''bisara'' (skinless fava beans mashed with dried [[mulukhiya]] leaves and chilies).<ref name=\"Haddad\">[[Laila el-Haddad|El-Haddad, Laila]].

More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gaza-toil-rubble-rami-salem?trk=prof-post |title=Gaza: Toil & Rubble |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Health care ==\n[[File:Al-Quds hospital, Gaza City, following Israeli shelling.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Quds hospital]], Gaza City, following Israeli shelling]]\n[[Al-Shifa Hospital]] (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s.

In 635 CE, it became the first city in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to be conquered by the Muslim [[Rashidun army]] and quickly developed into a center of [[Fiqh|Islamic law]]. However, by the time the [[First Crusade|Crusaders]] invaded the country starting in 1099, Gaza was in ruins. In later centuries, Gaza experienced several hardships\u2014from [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] raids to floods and locusts, reducing it to a village by the 16th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the first half of Ottoman rule, the [[Ridwan dynasty]] controlled Gaza and under them the city went through an age of great commerce and peace. The municipality of Gaza was established in 1893.\n\nGaza fell to British forces during World War I, becoming a [[Gaza Subdistrict, Mandatory Palestine|part]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]]. As a result of the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], [[Egypt]] administered the newly formed Gaza Strip territory and several improvements were undertaken in the city. Gaza was captured by [[Israel]] in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred to the newly-created [[Palestinian National Authority]]. In the months following the 2006 election, an [[Fatah-Hamas conflict|armed conflict]] broke out between the Palestinian political factions of [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]], resulting in the latter [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|taking power in Gaza]]. Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip|blockade]] on the Gaza Strip.<ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\" /> Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.<ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 07/ 5/11 08:34 AM ET\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/05/gaza-economy-benefits-fro_n_890181.html Gaza Benefiting From Israel Easing Economic Blockade]</ref><ref name=\"IBRAHIM BARZAK 06/21/11 08:13 AM ET\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/21/gaza-border-opening-bring_n_881127.html Gaza Border Opening Brings Little Relief]</ref>\n\nThe primary economic activities of Gaza are small-scale industries and agriculture.

Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and [[tamarind]]. Many of the traditional dishes rely on [[clay pot cooking]], which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also played an important role in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as ''saliq wa adas'' (\"chard and lentils\") and ''bisara'' (skinless fava beans mashed with dried [[mulukhiya]] leaves and chilies).<ref name=\"Haddad\">[[Laila el-Haddad|El-Haddad, Laila]].

One of the main aspects of this problem is the huge quantities of rubble and debris generated as a result of Israeli bombardments.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Salemdeeb|first1=Ramy|title=Gaza's Challenge|journal=CIWM|date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://zerowastemena.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/gazas-challenge.html |title=Gaza's Challenge |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\nFor instance, The scale of damage resulting from the [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Operation Protective Edge]] is unprecedented. All governorates in the Gaza Strip witnessed extensive aerial bombardment, naval shelling and artillery fire, resulting in a considerable amount of rubble. According to recent statistics, more than 2 million tonnes of debris was generated.  Approximately 10,000 houses were leveled to the ground including two 13-story residential buildings. A tremendous amount of debris remains scattered in Gaza. Serious efforts and a high budget are required to handle this challenge.  More importantly, and based on a UNEP study after the 2008 war, the debris is highly likely to be contaminated with PAHs and probably with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furan compounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gaza-toil-rubble-rami-salem?trk=prof-post |title=Gaza: Toil & Rubble |publisher=CIWM journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Health care ==\n[[File:Al-Quds hospital, Gaza City, following Israeli shelling.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Quds hospital]], Gaza City, following Israeli shelling]]\n[[Al-Shifa Hospital]] (\"the Cure\") was founded in the Rimal District by the British Mandate government in the 1940s.
