The ten basic elements are plant, fire, earth, cold, lightning, water, air, metal, light, and dark.\n\nEpic dragons are rarer than basic elemental dragons and hybrids. Types of Epic dragon include Sun, Moon, Rainbow, Treasure, Olympus, Gemstone, Dream, Seasonal, Apocalypse, Chrysalis, Ornamental, Crystalline, Snowflake, Monolith, Aura, Hidden, Galactic, and Surface.\n\nThere are a number of limited or rare dragons, known as \"Special Dragons\", that are only available during a specific period of time.

Many Epic dragons are also limited; for example, the [[Leap year|Leap Year]] Dragon that is theoretically only available every 4 years. Limited dragons are often released alongside a limited park decoration. Limited dragons include the gemstone dragons, which correspond to the monthly birthstones.

Players can buy new islands to make space for more habitats although there is a limit on habitats.\n\nPlayers raise dragons to adulthood by feeding them treats grown from treat farms, won from the race track, or earned from the completion of quests. The higher level a dragon is, the more dragoncash it will earn per minute. Different dragons earn dragoncash at different rates. For example, a Gift dragon at level 10 can only earn 77 dragoncash per minute while a level 10 Moon Dragon can earn 256 coins per minute. Rainbow Dragons can earn 400 dragoncash per minute at level 10.\n\nThere have also been several events held in relation to time of year or holidays that require the player to do a number of activities like collecting Dragoncash/Gems, hatching or selling dragons after incubation, and other special provisions.

It has five rotor blades to ensure a smooth flight which can prove particularly beneficial for patients suffering head or spinal injuries. Twin turbine engines give it a cruising speed of {{convert|154|mph|abbr=on}}, and skid landing gear allows it to cope with all types of terrain. Its compact dimensions allow it to land in confined spaces, yet it has room to carry one stretcher patient. It contains all equipment found on any front-line ambulance plus other special items.\n\nThey have to land in a great variety of places: in one call, the only land near enough and flat enough to land on was the top of [[Whernside]] at {{convert|2415|ft}}.\n\nIn 2016, the two existing helicopters were replaced by two new [[Eurocopter EC145|Airbus H145]]s, which are registered as G-YAAC (based at Nostell Priory) and G-YOAA (based at RAF Topcliffe). The new H145 helicopters cost at total of \u00a312M and offer lower operational and maintenance costs, as well as having night capability enabling longer hours of operation.

This boundary has been disputed with Oromia's neighbors in a number of cases, most notably between Oromia and the [[Somali Region]]. One attempt to resolve the dispute between the two regions was the October 2004 referendum held in about 420 [[kebele]]s in 12 [[woreda]]s across five zones of the Somali Region. According to the official results of the referendum, about 80% of the disputed areas have fallen under Oromia administration, though there were allegations of voting irregularities in many of them.<ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument \"Somali-Oromo border referendum of December 2004\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430113732/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/%28httpEnvelopes%29/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument |date=30 April 2009 }}, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre website (accessed 11 February 2009)</ref> The results led over the following weeks to minorities in these kebeles being pressured to leave.

This boundary has been disputed with Oromia's neighbors in a number of cases, most notably between Oromia and the [[Somali Region]]. One attempt to resolve the dispute between the two regions was the October 2004 referendum held in about 420 [[kebele]]s in 12 [[woreda]]s across five zones of the Somali Region. According to the official results of the referendum, about 80% of the disputed areas have fallen under Oromia administration, though there were allegations of voting irregularities in many of them.<ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument \"Somali-Oromo border referendum of December 2004\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430113732/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/%28httpEnvelopes%29/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument |date=30 April 2009 }}, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre website (accessed 11 February 2009)</ref> The results led over the following weeks to minorities in these kebeles being pressured to leave.

Their friend, Bernie, tags along and tries to convince the girls to let him represent them. The girls meet Dirk, from ''DareMeBro'', a series in which he takes dare requests. Dirk asks the girls if they want some of his cake. Frankie smashes the cake, thinking it is a cake smash dare, but Dirk tells them it was a birthday cake. The girls leave and meet Amelia, from ''Perfect Perfection with Amelia'', a series about fashion. Amelia is stressed because her video will not upload to the Internet. Paige tells her she knows a trick to fix it, and in the process of doing such, she deletes Amelia's video. This leads the whole room to shun the girls. Later, the girls meet Liam, the son of the creator of Vuuugle, who asks them about their channel. Frankie and Paige say the channel was named by thinking of random words and combining them: \"bizarre\" and \"[[aardvark]]\". They also tell him about their video idea for the upcoming VidView party, and he tells them he does not get it, leading Paige and Frankie to believe they are too weird. They try to change their video, but they get stuck thinking everything they do is too weird. Upset, the girls leave the studio, deciding to quit with ''Bizaardvark''. When Bernie reminds them of their fans, they remember why they make their videos and they resume their original video idea, \"The Comeback Song\". They show their video at the VidView party and receive praise from Dirk and Amelia who have forgiven them for what happened.

Their friend, Bernie, tags along and tries to convince the girls to let him represent them. The girls meet Dirk, from ''DareMeBro'', a series in which he takes dare requests. Dirk asks the girls if they want some of his cake. Frankie smashes the cake, thinking it is a cake smash dare, but Dirk tells them it was a birthday cake. The girls leave and meet Amelia, from ''Perfect Perfection with Amelia'', a series about fashion. Amelia is stressed because her video will not upload to the Internet. Paige tells her she knows a trick to fix it, and in the process of doing such, she deletes Amelia's video. This leads the whole room to shun the girls. Later, the girls meet Liam, the son of the creator of Vuuugle, who asks them about their channel. Frankie and Paige say the channel was named by thinking of random words and combining them: \"bizarre\" and \"[[aardvark]]\". They also tell him about their video idea for the upcoming VidView party, and he tells them he does not get it, leading Paige and Frankie to believe they are too weird. They try to change their video, but they get stuck thinking everything they do is too weird. Upset, the girls leave the studio, deciding to quit with ''Bizaardvark''. When Bernie reminds them of their fans, they remember why they make their videos and they resume their original video idea, \"The Comeback Song\". They show their video at the VidView party and receive praise from Dirk and Amelia who have forgiven them for what happened.

Often contrasted with [[procedural justice|just process]], which is concerned with the administration of law, distributive justice concentrates on outcomes.

To determine whether distributive justice has taken place, individuals often turn to the [[social norm|behavioral expectations]] of their group.<ref name=\"Forsyth\">Forsyth, D. R. (2006). Conflict.

Forsyth]]:<ref name=Forsyth />\n\n# '''Equality''': Regardless of their inputs, all group members should be given an equal share of the rewards/costs. Equality supports that someone who contributes 20% of the group's resources should receive as much as someone who contributes 60%. .{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n# '''Equity''': Members' outcomes should be based upon their inputs. Therefore, an individual who has invested a large amount of input (e.g. time, money, energy) should receive more from the group than someone who has contributed very little. Members of large groups prefer to base allocations of rewards and costs on equity.\n# '''Power''': Those with more authority, status, or control over the group should receive less than those in lower level positions.\n# '''Need''': Those in greatest needs should be provided with resources needed to meet those needs. These individuals should be given more resources than those who already possess them, regardless of their input.\n# '''Responsibility''': Group members who have the most should share their resources with those who have less.\n\n==Outcomes==\nDistributive justice affects performance when efficiency and productivity are involved.<ref name=ccands>Cohen-Charash, Y., & Spector, P.E.

(2009). \"Organizational Justice and Organizational Citizenship Behavior: A Mediated Multifoci Model\". ''Journal of Management'' 35, 112.</ref> [[Organizational citizenship behavior]]s (OCBs) are employee actions in support of the organization that are outside the scope of their job description. Such behaviors depend on the degree to which an organization is perceived to be distributively just.<ref name=ccands /><ref name=karriker /> As organizational actions and decisions are perceived as more just, employees are more likely to engage in OCBs. Perceptions of distributive justice are also strongly related to the withdrawal of employees from the organization.<ref name=ccands />\n\n==Wealth ==\n{{See also|Redistribution (economics)}}\nDistributive justice considers whether the distribution of goods among the members of society at a given time is subjectively acceptable.\n\nNot all advocates of [[consequentialist]] theories are concerned with an equitable society. What unites them is the mutual interest in achieving the best possible results or, in terms of the example above, the best possible distribution of wealth.\n\n==Environmental justice==\n\nDistributive justice in an environmental context is the equitable distribution of a society's technological and environmental risks, impacts, and benefits. These burdens include air pollution, landfills, industrial factories, and other environmental burdens. Distributive justice is an essential principle of [[environmental justice]] because there is evidence that shows that these burdens cause health problems, negatively affect quality of life, and drive down property value.\n\nThe potential negative social impacts of environmental degradation and regulatory policies have been at the center environmental discussions since the rise of environmental justice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McGurty|first1=Eileen|title=From NIMBY to Civil Rights: The Origins of the Environmental Justice Movement|journal=Environmental History|date=1997|volume=2|issue=3|pages=301\u2013323|doi=10.2307/3985352}}<!--|accessdate=April 4, 2016--></ref> Historically, in the United States, environmental burdens fall on poor communities that are predominantly African-American, Native-American, Latino, and Appalachian.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shrader-Frenchette|first1=Kristin|title=Environmental Justice: Creating Equity, Reclaiming Democracy|date=January 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|isbn=9780198034704|page=24}}</ref>\n\n==In policy positions==\nDistributive justice theory argues that societies have a duty to individuals in need and that all individuals have a duty to help others in need. Proponents of distributive justice link it to [[human rights]].\n\nMany governments are known for dealing with issues of distributive justice, especially countries with ethnic tensions and geographically distinctive minorities. Post-[[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] is an example of a country that deals with issues of re-allocating resources with respect to the distributive justice framework.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Consequentialism]]\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[Distribution (economics)]]\n* [[Extended sympathy]]\n* [[Environmental racism]]\n* [[Injustice]]\n* [[Interactional justice]]\n* [[Justice (economics)]]\n* [[Redistributive justice]]\n* [[Restorative justice]]\n* [[Retributive justice]]\n* [[Rule According to Higher Law]]\n* [[Rule of law]]\n* [[Service recovery paradox]]\n* [[Teaching for social justice]]\n* [[Transformative justice]]\n* [[Utilitarianism]]\n* [[John Rawls]]\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*[[Edmund S.

Members of large groups prefer to base allocations of rewards and costs on equity.\n# '''Power''': Those with more authority, status, or control over the group should receive less than those in lower level positions.\n# '''Need''': Those in greatest needs should be provided with resources needed to meet those needs. These individuals should be given more resources than those who already possess them, regardless of their input.\n# '''Responsibility''': Group members who have the most should share their resources with those who have less.\n\n==Outcomes==\nDistributive justice affects performance when efficiency and productivity are involved.<ref name=ccands>Cohen-Charash, Y., & Spector, P.E.

What unites them is the mutual interest in achieving the best possible results or, in terms of the example above, the best possible distribution of wealth.\n\n==Environmental justice==\n\nDistributive justice in an environmental context is the equitable distribution of a society's technological and environmental risks, impacts, and benefits. These burdens include air pollution, landfills, industrial factories, and other environmental burdens. Distributive justice is an essential principle of [[environmental justice]] because there is evidence that shows that these burdens cause health problems, negatively affect quality of life, and drive down property value.\n\nThe potential negative social impacts of environmental degradation and regulatory policies have been at the center environmental discussions since the rise of environmental justice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McGurty|first1=Eileen|title=From NIMBY to Civil Rights: The Origins of the Environmental Justice Movement|journal=Environmental History|date=1997|volume=2|issue=3|pages=301\u2013323|doi=10.2307/3985352}}<!--|accessdate=April 4, 2016--></ref> Historically, in the United States, environmental burdens fall on poor communities that are predominantly African-American, Native-American, Latino, and Appalachian.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shrader-Frenchette|first1=Kristin|title=Environmental Justice: Creating Equity, Reclaiming Democracy|date=January 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|isbn=9780198034704|page=24}}</ref>\n\n==In policy positions==\nDistributive justice theory argues that societies have a duty to individuals in need and that all individuals have a duty to help others in need. Proponents of distributive justice link it to [[human rights]].\n\nMany governments are known for dealing with issues of distributive justice, especially countries with ethnic tensions and geographically distinctive minorities.

With the arrival of the [[New Spain|Spaniards]], the area became known for its [[copper]] mining. After the [[American Civil War]], a settlement developed and became known as \"La Ci\u00e9nega de San Vicente\" (the Oasis of St. Vincent). With a wave of American [[prospecting|prospectors]], the pace of change increased, and Silver City was founded in the summer of 1870. The founding of the town occurred shortly after the discovery of [[silver]] ore deposits at Chloride Flat, on the hill just west of the farm of Captain John M. Bullard and his brother James. Following the silver strike, Captain Bullard laid out the streets of Silver City, and a bustling [[tent city]] quickly sprang to life. Although the trajectory of Silver City's development was to be different from the hundreds of other mining boom towns established during the same period, Captain Bullard himself never lived to see even the beginnings of permanence, as he was killed in a confrontation with Apache, attempting to take their land, less than a year later, on February 23, 1871.\n\nThe town's violent crime rate was substantial during the 1870s. However, Grant County Sheriff [[Harvey Whitehill]] was elected in 1874, and gained a sizable reputation for his abilities at controlling trouble. In 1875, Whitehill became the first lawman to arrest [[Billy the Kid]], known at the time under the alias of Henry Antrim. Whitehill arrested him twice, both times for theft in Silver City (Sheriff Whitehill testified to the Justice of the Peace that he believed Henry Antrim did not do the actual stealing the second time arrested, but assisted in the hiding of the property stolen by Sombrero Jack. Whitehill would later claim that the young man was a likeable kid, whose stealing was a result more of necessity than criminality. His mother is buried in the town cemetery. In 1878, the town hired its first town marshal, [[Dan Tucker (lawman)|\"Dangerous Dan\" Tucker]], who had been working as a deputy for Whitehill since 1875. [[Butch Cassidy]] and his [[Wild Bunch]] were also reported to frequent the Silver City saloons in the late 1800s.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.desertusa.com/cities/nm/silver.html|title=Silver City New Mexico| publisher=DesertUSA |accessdate=2018-03-23 |df=}}</ref>\n \nMrs. Lettie B. Morrill, in a talk given to the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] chapter in Silver City on September 19, 1908, stated, \"John Bullard was placed in the first grave dug in Silver City, having been killed while punishing the Indians for an attack upon the new town; the brothers were prospectors about the country for many years. The last one left for the old home about 1885, saying, 'It is only a matter of time until the Indians get me if I stay here.'\" Silver City was also the starting point for many expeditions hunting treasures, such as the [[Lost Adams Diggings]].\n\nThe communities of Silver City and [[Pinos Altos, New Mexico|Pinos Altos]] developed as 19th century miners recovered easily extracted copper, gold and silver from ore deposits of the area.  Standard-gauge [[Santa Fe Railroad]] reached Silver City in 1886, and [[Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon Railroad]] was incorporated in 1889 to build a railway north to [[Mogollon, New Mexico|Mogollon]].  Construction was limited to {{convert|5|mi|km}} of grading<ref name=cab>{{cite journal |last1=Tufford |first1=Garrie L. |last2= |first2= |year=1999 |title=A Caboose for the Silver City, Pinos Altos & Mogollon |journal=[[Narrow Gauge and Shortline Gazette]] |volume= |issue=January/February |pages=30&31 |publisher=Benchmark Publications }}</ref> until Wisconsin-based Comanche Mining and Smelting purchased the railroad in 1903<ref>Myrick (1970) p.150</ref> after horse-drawn ore transport became uneconomical.

It was later known as New Mexico Western State Teachers College. In 1963, it was renamed [[Western New Mexico University]]. Today, WNMU offers eight graduate degrees, 41 baccalaureate degrees, and 18 associate degree and certificate programs. The WNMU's mascot is referred to as the [[Western New Mexico Mustangs|Mustangs]]. Recognition for the university includes the 2003 Zia Award, the 2005 Best Practice Award (for the School of Education), the 2006 Chamber of Commerce Large Business of the Year Award, the 2008 Pi\u00f1on Award, and the 2008 Compa\u00f1ero Award.\n\nThe town had originally been designed with the streets running north to south. It was also built without adequate planning for storm water runoff. Businesses sprang up, and people learned to deal with the inconveniences of the summer rain. Silver City was built with high sidewalks in the downtown area to accommodate high flood waters. However, uncontrolled grazing and deforestation over time in the surrounding area contributed to higher levels of runoff. During the night of July 21, 1895, a heavy wall of water rushed through the downtown business district, leaving a trail of destruction. A ditch {{convert|55|ft|m}} lower than the original street level was created in what was once known as Main Street.<ref>\"Destruction of Main Street\", ''[[Silver City Daily Press]]'', July 9, 1975, p. 7</ref> Businesses on Main Street began using their back doors on Bullard Street as main entrances and eventually, were permanently used as the new front entrances. To this day, the incorrect odd/even addressing conventions on the east side of Bullard Street are a reminder that the buildings were addressed on Main Street originally, not Bullard Street. Main Street now ends near the back of the Silver City Police Station, where the Big Ditch Park begins.\n\nThe [[Mimbres Mogollon]] Indians (A.D. 200\u2013A.D. 1140/50) once lived in the area, along with other prehistoric groups, including the Salado. Mimbres archaeological sites are located throughout Silver City and surrounding communities on federal, state, municipal, and private property. Collecting of Mimbres pottery by landowners and others is documented as far back as the late 1870s. Collecting was something that occurred during a Sunday picnic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some individuals maintained collections that can now be seen in the [[Smithsonian]], and other museums, who sent individuals out to acquire collections in the nearby Mimbres Valley during the early 1900s. Others dug into the ancient sites and used the pottery they found for [[target practice]]\u2014something that occurred into the 1930s according to oral histories. Collecting, and the looting, of Mimbres Mogollon sites did not stop with archaeological research conducted on private lands during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1970s, nor with the passage of the New Mexico \"Burial Law\" in 1989. Sadly, unlawful looting continues to this day, and many prehistoric sites have been badly damaged or completely obliterated.\n\nThe Apaches occupied areas in the vicinity of Silver City beginning in the late 1500s to early 1600s, based on archaeological evidence.\n\n==Geography==\nSilver City is located near the center of Grant County, at the southern foot of the Pinos Altos Range of the [[Mogollon Mountains]]. The town is {{convert|3|mi|0}} east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], in the valley of San Vicente Arroyo, a south-flowing tributary of the [[Mimbres River]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 180]] passes through the northern part of the town, leading east {{convert|10|mi|0}} to [[Bayard, New Mexico|Bayard]] and northwest {{convert|29|mi}} to [[Cliff, New Mexico|Cliff]]. [[New Mexico State Road 90]] (Hudson Street) leads southwest {{convert|45|mi}} to [[Lordsburg, New Mexico|Lordsburg]] and [[Interstate 10]], and [[New Mexico State Road 15|State Road 15]] leads north {{convert|44|mi}} to [[Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], Silver City has a total area of {{convert|26.3|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.04|sqkm|order=flip|2}}, or 0.17%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Geology==\nThe local geology of the Silver City area is complex. Sedimentary gravels are found in the form of the alluvial Mangas Valley gravels. Metamorphic schist and gneiss are also found. The downtown area is mostly made of granite outcrops.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Silver City can be classified as [[semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool semi-arid climate]] according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] system. It is characterized by hot summers, and cool winters with significant precipitation in the form of rain, occasional snow, and intense summer monsoon thunderstorm rainfall.\n\nDuring the period from 1901 to 1964 when readings were taken at the city center (which is cooler and wetter than outlying districts to the southeast), the coldest temperature recorded was {{convert|&minus;13|F|C}} on January 11, 1962, and the hottest {{convert|105|F|C|1}} on July 5, 1901. The coldest month was January 1949 with a monthly mean temperature of {{convert|28.7|F|C|disp=or}}, and the hottest July 1951 which averaged {{convert|77.4|F|C|disp=or}}.

The District was the location of Fort Bayard, which was established in 1866 to station soldiers of the US Army in proximity to mining camps in the region. In later years the fort was converted to an Army hospital, specializing in the treatment of tuberculosis. In the early 1920s it became a US Veterans Hospital under the Veterans Administration. The property was sold to the State of New Mexico in 1965, which used the facility as a State Hospital. With the construction of a newer hospital in 2010, the property was vacated. Fort Bayard then became home to a museum, maintained by the Fort Bayard Historic Preservation Society. The museum personnel offer tours of both the building and the grounds on a regular schedule.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2012}}\n\n* [[Alfred Shea Addis]] (1832-1886), photographer of Billy the Kid's mother's home, lived in Silver City and acted as sheriff in 1886\n* [[Angela Sommer-Bodenburg]], author\n* [[Ben D.

With the arrival of the [[New Spain|Spaniards]], the area became known for its [[copper]] mining. After the [[American Civil War]], a settlement developed and became known as \"La Ci\u00e9nega de San Vicente\" (the Oasis of St. Vincent). With a wave of American [[prospecting|prospectors]], the pace of change increased, and Silver City was founded in the summer of 1870. The founding of the town occurred shortly after the discovery of [[silver]] ore deposits at Chloride Flat, on the hill just west of the farm of Captain John M. Bullard and his brother James. Following the silver strike, Captain Bullard laid out the streets of Silver City, and a bustling [[tent city]] quickly sprang to life. Although the trajectory of Silver City's development was to be different from the hundreds of other mining boom towns established during the same period, Captain Bullard himself never lived to see even the beginnings of permanence, as he was killed in a confrontation with Apache, attempting to take their land, less than a year later, on February 23, 1871.\n\nThe town's violent crime rate was substantial during the 1870s. However, Grant County Sheriff [[Harvey Whitehill]] was elected in 1874, and gained a sizable reputation for his abilities at controlling trouble. In 1875, Whitehill became the first lawman to arrest [[Billy the Kid]], known at the time under the alias of Henry Antrim. Whitehill arrested him twice, both times for theft in Silver City (Sheriff Whitehill testified to the Justice of the Peace that he believed Henry Antrim did not do the actual stealing the second time arrested, but assisted in the hiding of the property stolen by Sombrero Jack. Whitehill would later claim that the young man was a likeable kid, whose stealing was a result more of necessity than criminality. His mother is buried in the town cemetery. In 1878, the town hired its first town marshal, [[Dan Tucker (lawman)|\"Dangerous Dan\" Tucker]], who had been working as a deputy for Whitehill since 1875. [[Butch Cassidy]] and his [[Wild Bunch]] were also reported to frequent the Silver City saloons in the late 1800s.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.desertusa.com/cities/nm/silver.html|title=Silver City New Mexico| publisher=DesertUSA |accessdate=2018-03-23 |df=}}</ref>\n \nMrs. Lettie B. Morrill, in a talk given to the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] chapter in Silver City on September 19, 1908, stated, \"John Bullard was placed in the first grave dug in Silver City, having been killed while punishing the Indians for an attack upon the new town; the brothers were prospectors about the country for many years. The last one left for the old home about 1885, saying, 'It is only a matter of time until the Indians get me if I stay here.'\" Silver City was also the starting point for many expeditions hunting treasures, such as the [[Lost Adams Diggings]].\n\nThe communities of Silver City and [[Pinos Altos, New Mexico|Pinos Altos]] developed as 19th century miners recovered easily extracted copper, gold and silver from ore deposits of the area.  Standard-gauge [[Santa Fe Railroad]] reached Silver City in 1886, and [[Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon Railroad]] was incorporated in 1889 to build a railway north to [[Mogollon, New Mexico|Mogollon]].  Construction was limited to {{convert|5|mi|km}} of grading<ref name=cab>{{cite journal |last1=Tufford |first1=Garrie L. |last2= |first2= |year=1999 |title=A Caboose for the Silver City, Pinos Altos & Mogollon |journal=[[Narrow Gauge and Shortline Gazette]] |volume= |issue=January/February |pages=30&31 |publisher=Benchmark Publications }}</ref> until Wisconsin-based Comanche Mining and Smelting purchased the railroad in 1903<ref>Myrick (1970) p.150</ref> after horse-drawn ore transport became uneconomical.

It was later known as New Mexico Western State Teachers College. In 1963, it was renamed [[Western New Mexico University]]. Today, WNMU offers eight graduate degrees, 41 baccalaureate degrees, and 18 associate degree and certificate programs. The WNMU's mascot is referred to as the [[Western New Mexico Mustangs|Mustangs]]. Recognition for the university includes the 2003 Zia Award, the 2005 Best Practice Award (for the School of Education), the 2006 Chamber of Commerce Large Business of the Year Award, the 2008 Pi\u00f1on Award, and the 2008 Compa\u00f1ero Award.\n\nThe town had originally been designed with the streets running north to south. It was also built without adequate planning for storm water runoff. Businesses sprang up, and people learned to deal with the inconveniences of the summer rain. Silver City was built with high sidewalks in the downtown area to accommodate high flood waters. However, uncontrolled grazing and deforestation over time in the surrounding area contributed to higher levels of runoff. During the night of July 21, 1895, a heavy wall of water rushed through the downtown business district, leaving a trail of destruction. A ditch {{convert|55|ft|m}} lower than the original street level was created in what was once known as Main Street.<ref>\"Destruction of Main Street\", ''[[Silver City Daily Press]]'', July 9, 1975, p. 7</ref> Businesses on Main Street began using their back doors on Bullard Street as main entrances and eventually, were permanently used as the new front entrances. To this day, the incorrect odd/even addressing conventions on the east side of Bullard Street are a reminder that the buildings were addressed on Main Street originally, not Bullard Street. Main Street now ends near the back of the Silver City Police Station, where the Big Ditch Park begins.\n\nThe [[Mimbres Mogollon]] Indians (A.D. 200\u2013A.D. 1140/50) once lived in the area, along with other prehistoric groups, including the Salado. Mimbres archaeological sites are located throughout Silver City and surrounding communities on federal, state, municipal, and private property. Collecting of Mimbres pottery by landowners and others is documented as far back as the late 1870s. Collecting was something that occurred during a Sunday picnic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Some individuals maintained collections that can now be seen in the [[Smithsonian]], and other museums, who sent individuals out to acquire collections in the nearby Mimbres Valley during the early 1900s. Others dug into the ancient sites and used the pottery they found for [[target practice]]\u2014something that occurred into the 1930s according to oral histories. Collecting, and the looting, of Mimbres Mogollon sites did not stop with archaeological research conducted on private lands during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1970s, nor with the passage of the New Mexico \"Burial Law\" in 1989. Sadly, unlawful looting continues to this day, and many prehistoric sites have been badly damaged or completely obliterated.\n\nThe Apaches occupied areas in the vicinity of Silver City beginning in the late 1500s to early 1600s, based on archaeological evidence.\n\n==Geography==\nSilver City is located near the center of Grant County, at the southern foot of the Pinos Altos Range of the [[Mogollon Mountains]]. The town is {{convert|3|mi|0}} east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], in the valley of San Vicente Arroyo, a south-flowing tributary of the [[Mimbres River]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 180]] passes through the northern part of the town, leading east {{convert|10|mi|0}} to [[Bayard, New Mexico|Bayard]] and northwest {{convert|29|mi}} to [[Cliff, New Mexico|Cliff]]. [[New Mexico State Road 90]] (Hudson Street) leads southwest {{convert|45|mi}} to [[Lordsburg, New Mexico|Lordsburg]] and [[Interstate 10]], and [[New Mexico State Road 15|State Road 15]] leads north {{convert|44|mi}} to [[Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], Silver City has a total area of {{convert|26.3|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|0.04|sqkm|order=flip|2}}, or 0.17%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==Geology==\nThe local geology of the Silver City area is complex. Sedimentary gravels are found in the form of the alluvial Mangas Valley gravels. Metamorphic schist and gneiss are also found. The downtown area is mostly made of granite outcrops.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Silver City can be classified as [[semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool semi-arid climate]] according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] system. It is characterized by hot summers, and cool winters with significant precipitation in the form of rain, occasional snow, and intense summer monsoon thunderstorm rainfall.\n\nDuring the period from 1901 to 1964 when readings were taken at the city center (which is cooler and wetter than outlying districts to the southeast), the coldest temperature recorded was {{convert|&minus;13|F|C}} on January 11, 1962, and the hottest {{convert|105|F|C|1}} on July 5, 1901. The coldest month was January 1949 with a monthly mean temperature of {{convert|28.7|F|C|disp=or}}, and the hottest July 1951 which averaged {{convert|77.4|F|C|disp=or}}. The wettest calendar year in this time span was 1914 with {{convert|24.97|in|mm|1|disp=or}} and the driest 1947 with {{convert|6.77|in|mm|1|disp=or}}. The most snow in one season was {{convert|48.0|in|m|2|disp=or}} between July 1912 and June 1913, which featured the coldest winter on record with {{convert|33.1|F|C|disp=or}} as the mean from December to February.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Silver City, New Mexico, 1901-1964.

The [[population density]] was 1,040.1 people per square mile (401.5/km\u00b2). There were 4,757 housing units at an average density of 469.2 per square mile (181.1/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the town was 71.72% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.86% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 1.14% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.45% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.05% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 22.42% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.37% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 52.43% of the population.\n\nThere were 4,227 households out of which 30.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.6% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 15.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.4% were non-families. 30.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 3.00.\n\nIn the town, the population by age was: 25.0% under the age of 18, 11.4% from 18 to 24, 24.2% from 25 to 44, 23.1% from 45 to 64, and 16.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.7 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $25,881, and the median income for a family was $31,374. Males had a median income of $28,476 versus $18,434 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $13,813. About 17.7% of families and 21.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 29.2% of those under age 18 and 10.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nSilver City was founded as a mining town. [[George Hearst]] built a [[smelter]] after the Silver City, Deming and Pacific [[narrow gauge railway]] reached Silver City in 1883. The [[Santa Fe Railroad]] provided [[standard gauge]] rail service in 1886, and Commanche Mining and Smelting extended the 2-foot narrow gauge [[Silver City, Pinos Altos and Mogollon Railroad]] to [[Pinos Altos, New Mexico|Pinos Altos]] in 1906 (none of which are still in existence).<ref>{{cite book| title=Silver City Narrow Gauge |author=Ericson, Duane |publisher=M2FQ Publications |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nThe nearby mining operations, formerly [[Phelps Dodge]], are still the basis for the local economy. In 2006, the [[El Chino Mine|Chino]] and Tyrone mines produced {{convert|125400|LT|MT}} of copper. Mine employment was 1,250, with wages and salaries totaling $73&nbsp;million. However, a Phelps-Dodge spokesman remarked in 2007 that \"based on current economic projections, our properties in New Mexico will not be operating in 25&nbsp;years\".<ref>New Mexico Business Journal, 9-07, p. 31</ref> Phelps Dodge was acquired by international mining firm [[Freeport-McMoRan]] in March 2007, and operations at the Chino and Tyrone operations are continuing under the Freeport name.\n\nTourism, retirement and trade are the other major components of Silver City's economy.
