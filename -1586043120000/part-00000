Located to the West of [[The Intracoastal Waterway|the Intracoastal Waterway]] in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], in an area planned by [[International Paper]] in the late 1990s. Regarded as the \"bedroom community\" of [[Myrtle Beach]], Carolina Forest is comprised of [[private community|private subdivisions]] and [[gated community|gated communities]], the majority of which are planned around a multitude of lakes with resort-style amenities. Several [[golf course community|golf course communities]] are also located here, most notably is River Oaks Golf Plantation.\n\n== Geography ==\nCarolina Forest is situated West of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] in Myrtle Beach, and East of Gardner Lacy Road; between [[U.S. Route 501 in South Carolina|U.S. Route 501]] and International Drive. Located between 3.8 and 8 miles from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the average Carolina Forest home is roughly less than 7 miles from [[Grand Strand]] beaches.\n\nCarolina Forest was developed in and around existing [[Longleaf Pine]] forests and [[Eastern savannas of the United States|savannas]], within the [[Waccamaw River]] watershed, part of the greater lower watershed of the [[Pee Dee River]]. The topography of the region between the Waccamaw River and the Intracoastal Waterway is spotted with [[Carolina Bay|Carolina Bays]], which are elliptical-shaped depressions in the land, often filled with thick vegetation and rich in [[biodiversity]]. \n\n== Roads and Intersections ==\n[[Carolina Forest Boulevard]] serves as the main artery of Carolina Forest, other main roads include River Oaks Drive, International Drive, Postal Way, Renee Drive, and [[South Carolina Highway 31|Carolina Bays Parkway]]\n\n== History ==\nCarolina Forest was once part of a larger tract of land in eastern [[Horry County]] called the Buist Tract. Originally owned by Burroughs & Chapin, International Paper bought the {{convert|30000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} Buist Tract in 1937. It was used as part of the Conway Bombing and Gunnery Range during World War II. In 1960, the company donated part of the tract for what is now [[Coastal Carolina University]] (located several miles away from Carolina Forest). In 1989, approximately {{convert|9000|acre|km2|0}} north of Carolina Forest were donated to the state to form the [[Lewis Ocean Bay Heritage Preserve]]. The [[planned unit development]] was initially created to have 20,000 single and multi-family homesites when completed. Most of the development follows the Carolina Forest Master Plan, developed cooperatively between International Paper and the Horry County Government.\n\n\nIn June 1994, Kylee Mueller sold {{convert|125|acre|km2}} of the remaining {{convert|21000|acre|km2|0}} of the Buist Tract to Horry County Schools for development of Carolina Forest Elementary School, Carolina Forest Middle School, and [[Carolina Forest High School]]. In addition, {{convert|350|acre|km2}} were sold to form a golf course and residential property.\n\nBy the end of 1994, International Paper began to sell more of its land. Due to the lack of funding from other sources for road infrastructure, the first {{convert|1.25|mi|km|2}} of Carolina Forest Boulevard were completed by November 1995 by International Paper. Further expansions of both Carolina Forest Boulevard and River Oaks Drive (creating an {{convert|11|mi|km|0|adj=on}} loop) would open up {{convert|11000|acre|km2|0}} to development west of the Intracoastal Waterway. Carolina Forest Boulevard was completed in December 1996, with River Oaks Drive being completed in December 1997.<ref>\"IP Asks Permission to Lengthen Road,\" Mike Soraghan, ''The Sun News'', July 4, 1996</ref>\n\nOn December 2, 1997, [[Horry County]] council voted to freeze zoning rules in an {{convert|11|sqmi|km2|0}} area of Carolina Forest for 20 years in exchange for land to build parks and roads in an 8-3 vote on the development agreement. An estimated 35,000 people would live in the {{convert|7073|acre|km2|0}} covered by the agreement. In the agreement, Horry County did not require International Paper to widen [[Carolina Forest Boulevard]] or River Oaks Drive to four lanes. Land would be given to the county at no cost for the then-future [[South Carolina Highway 31|SC Highway 31]] north and south of the [[Robert Grissom Parkway]] bridge. Approximately {{convert|140|acre|km2}} was set aside for future schools, which would include Ocean Bay Elementary and Middle Schools. Because nearly half of Carolina Forest was open space, the area was exempt from future open space directives set by Horry County.<ref>\"Horry County Approves Carolina Forest Pact,\" Mike Soraghan, ''The Sun News'', December 3, 1997</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], Carolina Forest's population increased from 3400 in 2000 to 21,000.<ref name=Dickerson>\"Carolina Forest community hoping for benefits from redistricting,\" Brad Dickerson, ''The Sun News'', June 16, 2011</ref>\n\n==Subdivisions==\nSource:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carolinaforestmyrtlebeach.net/subdivisions/index.html|title=Carolina Forest Subdivisions}}</ref>\n{{Div col|colwidth=12em}}\n*Alta Surf\n*Amherst\n*Ashford Estates\n*Ashley Park\n*Avalon\n*Bay Meadows\n*Bella Vita\n*BelleGrove Preserve\n*Berkshire Forest\n*Black Creek Plantation\n*Brookberry\n*Brighton Lakes\n*Brightwater\n*Canterbury\n*Carolina Willows\n*Clear Pond\n*Covington Lake\n*Covington Lake East\n*Carolina Waterway Plantation\n*Emerald Forest\n*Fairways\n*Garden Homes\n*Indigo Bay\n*Inverness\n*Legends\n*Myrtle Beach National\n*Oakmont Village\n*Ocean Bay Townhomes\n*Perry Place\n*Plantation Lakes\n*River Landing\n*River Oaks\n*Sago Plantation\n*Sawgrass East\n*Seaside Grove\n*Southcreek\n*Southgate\n*Spring Lake\n*Summerlyn\n*The Battery\n*The Bluffs\n*The Cloisters\n*The Farm\n*The Parks\n*The Reserve\n*The Vinings\n*Turnberry\n*Turning Pines\n*Village of Dreams\n*Walkers Woods\n*Waterbridge\n*Waterford Plantation\n*Waterway Palms Plantation\n*Waterway Village\n*Westwood Estates\n*Windsor Green\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Education==\nCarolina Forest has a [[public library]], a branch of the Horry County Memorial Library.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.greenvillelibrary.org/locations-and-hours | title=Locations & Hours | publisher=Greenville County Library System | accessdate=8 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.wmbfnews.com/story/36941942/carolina-forest-the-20-year-plan Carolina Forest Master Plan]\n\n{{Myrtle Beach}}\n{{Horry County, South Carolina}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in South Carolina]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Horry County, South Carolina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name          = Carolina Forest, South Carolina\n| settlement_type        = [[Unincorporated area|Unincorporated community]]\n| image_skyline          = Carolina Forest Sign.jpg\n| image_flag             = \n| image_seal             = \n| image_caption          = Sign at the entrance to Carolina Forest at the intersection of US 501 and Carolina Forest Boulevard\n| pushpin_map            = USA South Carolina#USA\n| pushpin_label          = Carolina Forest, SC\n| map_caption            = \n| coordinates            = {{coord|33|45|29|N|78|58|1|W|region:US-SC|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type       = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name       = United States\n| subdivision_type1      = [[U.S. state|State]]\n| subdivision_name1      = [[South Carolina]]\n| subdivision_type2      = [[List of cities in South Carolina|City]]\n| subdivision_name2      = [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]]\n| subdivision_type3      = [[List of counties in South Carolina|County]]\n| subdivision_name3      = [[Horry County, South Carolina|Horry]]\n| area_magnitude         = 1 E8\n| area_total_km2         = 65.7\n| area_land_km2          = 63.9\n| area_water_km2         = 2.8\n| elevation_m            = 12\n| elevation_ft           = 39\n| postal_code_type       = [[ZIP Code]]\n| postal_code            = 29579\n| area_code              = 843\n<!--\n|population_as_of = 2000\n|population_total = 5009\n-->\n| population_total       = 33966\n| population_as_of       = 2014 est.\n| population_density_km2 = 124.1\n| timezone               = [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|EST]]\n| utc_offset             = -5\n| website                = \n}}\n'''Carolina Forest''' is an upscale [[planned community]] in [[Myrtle Beach]], [[South Carolina]], United States.
