Each episode begins with four chefs who have to create dishes from groceries they purchase from customers at a nearby [[supermarket]] with a budget of $500 each; with the final chef winning a prize of $10,000.<ref name=\"meaww\">{{cite web|url=https://meaww.com/alex-guarnaschelli-supermarket-stakeout-release-date-plot-cast-new-show-on-food-network|title=&#39;Supermarket Stakeout&#39;: Release date, plot, cast and all you need know about Alex Guarnaschelli&#39;s new show on Food Network {{!}} MEAWW|work=MEAWW|date=August 9, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Supermarket Stakeout'' officially premiered on August 13, 2019.<ref name=\"tvg\"/>\n\n==Format==\n\n{{unrefsect|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe competition consists of three rounds and is adjudicated by a panel of two judges. It takes place in a supermarket parking lot, with separate stations for each chef to prepare and cook food. They are each given $500 at the outset, which they must use to buy groceries from customers as they depart the market. A limited stock of additional ingredients is available for the chefs' use. \n\nIn each round, Guarnaschelli assigns a general type of dish for the chefs to create. They have 45 minutes to buy ingredients and prepare, cook, and plate three servings (one for each judge and a third \"beauty plate\"). The judges evaluate the dishes on taste, presentation, and how closely they adhere to the theme of the round. The chef whose dish is judged the least satisfactory is eliminated from the competition and must forfeit his/her remaining money. After the third round, the last remaining chef has his/her cash total increased to $10,000.\n\nThe shopping restrictions change from round to round as follows;\n\n* ''Round 1:'' Chefs may buy groceries from as many customers as they wish, but may not look inside the shopping bags first.\n\n* ''Round 2:'' Each chef may buy from only one customer, but they may look in the bags before deciding whether to make an offer.\n\n* ''Round 3:'' Chefs may buy individual items from as many customers as they wish and look through the bags, but may buy no more than five items each. During the final 10 minutes, each chef may enter the market and purchase one additional item of his / her choice from the shelves if desired.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Season 1 (2019)===\n\n{|

show|series]] that airs on [[Food Network]].<ref name=\"tvg\"/> It is presented by [[chef]] [[Alex Guarnaschelli]]. Each episode begins with four chefs who have to create dishes from groceries they purchase from customers at a nearby [[supermarket]] with a budget of $500 each; with the final chef winning a prize of $10,000.<ref name=\"meaww\">{{cite web|url=https://meaww.com/alex-guarnaschelli-supermarket-stakeout-release-date-plot-cast-new-show-on-food-network|title=&#39;Supermarket Stakeout&#39;: Release date, plot, cast and all you need know about Alex Guarnaschelli&#39;s new show on Food Network {{!}} MEAWW|work=MEAWW|date=August 9, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Supermarket Stakeout'' officially premiered on August 13, 2019.<ref name=\"tvg\"/>\n\n==Format==\n\n{{unrefsect|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe competition consists of three rounds and is adjudicated by a panel of two judges. It takes place in a supermarket parking lot, with separate stations for each chef to prepare and cook food. They are each given $500 at the outset, which they must use to buy groceries from customers as they depart the market. A limited stock of additional ingredients is available for the chefs' use. \n\nIn each round, Guarnaschelli assigns a general type of dish for the chefs to create. They have 45 minutes to buy ingredients and prepare, cook, and plate three servings (one for each judge and a third \"beauty plate\"). The judges evaluate the dishes on taste, presentation, and how closely they adhere to the theme of the round. The chef whose dish is judged the least satisfactory is eliminated from the competition and must forfeit his/her remaining money. After the third round, the last remaining chef has his/her cash total increased to $10,000.\n\nThe shopping restrictions change from round to round as follows;\n\n* ''Round 1:'' Chefs may buy groceries from as many customers as they wish, but may not look inside the shopping bags first.\n\n* ''Round 2:'' Each chef may buy from only one customer, but they may look in the bags before deciding whether to make an offer.\n\n* ''Round 3:'' Chefs may buy individual items from as many customers as they wish and look through the bags, but may buy no more than five items each. During the final 10 minutes, each chef may enter the market and purchase one additional item of his / her choice from the shelves if desired.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Season 1 (2019)===\n\n{|
