Solar panels can also be used for harvesting most of the rain water falling on them and drinking quality water, free from bacteria and suspended matter, can be generated by simple [[Water purification|filtration and disinfection]] processes as rain water is very low in [[salinity]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.windpowerengineering.com/environmental/wind-solar-powered-offgridbox-useful-hurricane-passes/ |title=Rain fed solar powered water purification systems. |accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/04/inverted-umbrella-brings-clean-water-clean-power-india/ |title=Inverted Umbrella Brings Clean Water & Clean Power To India |accessdate=5 December 2017|date=2017-12-04 }}</ref><ref name=inh>{{cite web |url=https://inhabitat.com/new-rooftop-solar-hydropanels-harvest-drinking-water-and-energy-at-the-same-time/  |title=New rooftop solar hydro panels harvest drinking water and energy at the same time |accessdate=2017-11-30}}</ref> Exploitation of rain water for value added products like bottled drinking water, makes solar PV power plants profitable even in high rainfall/ cloudy areas by the augmented income from value added drinking water generation.\nRecently cost effective Rain water collection in the already dug wells found to be highly effective in the bringing ground water level up in India.\n\n== Advantages ==\nRainwater harvesting provides the independent water supply during regional water restrictions, and in developed countries, is often used to supplement the main supply. It provides water when a drought occurs, can help mitigate flooding of low-lying areas, and reduces demand on wells which may enable groundwater levels to be sustained. It also helps in the availability of potable water, as rainwater is substantially free of salinity and other salts. Applications of rainwater harvesting in [[Integrated urban water management|urban water system]] provides a substantial benefit for both [[water supply]] and [[wastewater]] subsystems by reducing the need for [[clean water]] in water distribution systems, less generated [[stormwater]] in [[sewer system]]s,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Behzadian |first=k |last2=Kapelan |first2=Z |date=2015 |title=Advantages of integrated and sustainability based assessment for metabolism based strategic planning of urban water systems |journal=Science of the Total Environment |volume=527-528 |pages=220\u2013231 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.097 |pmid= 25965035|hdl=10871/17351 |url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/10871/17351/1/Behzadian%20and%20Kapelan%202015b.pdf |bibcode=2015ScTEn.527..220B }}</ref> and a reduction in stormwater runoff polluting freshwater bodies.\n\nA large body of work has focused on the development of life cycle assessment and its costing methodologies to assess the level of environmental impacts and money that can be saved by implementing rainwater harvesting systems.<ref name=inh/>\n\n=== Independent water supply ===\nRainwater harvesting provides an independent water supply during water restrictions. In areas where clean water is costly, or difficult to come by, rainwater harvesting is a critical source of clean water. In developed countries, rainwater is often harvested to be used as a supplemental source of water rather than the main source, but the harvesting of rainwater can also decrease a household's water costs or overall usage levels. Rainwater is safe to drink if the consumers do additional treatments before drinking. Boiling water helps to kill germs. Adding another supplement to the system such as a first flush diverter is also a common procedure to avoid contaminants of the water. <ref> Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013 Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/rainwater-collection.html </ref>\n\n=== Supplemental in drought ===\nWhen drought occurs, rainwater harvested in past months can be used. If rain is scarce but also unpredictable, the use of a rainwater harvesting system can be critical to capturing the rain when it does fall. Many countries with arid environments, use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water. To enhance irrigation in arid environments, ridges of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running down hills. Even in periods of low [[rainfall]], enough water is collected for crops to grow. Water can be collected from roofs and tanks can be constructed to hold large quantities of rainwater.\n\nIn addition, rainwater harvesting decreases the demand for water from wells, enabling groundwater levels to be further sustained rather than depleted.\n\n=== Life-cycle assessment ===\n[[Life-cycle assessment]] is a methodology used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a system from cradle-to-grave of its lifetime. Devkota et al,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Devkota |first1=J. |last2=Schlachter |first2=H. |last3=Anand |first3=C. |last4=Phillips |first4=R. |last5=Apul |first5=Defne |date=November 2013 |title=Development and application of EEAST: A lifecycle-based model for use of harvested rainwater and composting toilets in buildings |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=130 |pages=397\u2013404 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.09.015|pmid=24141064 }}</ref><ref name=\"Devkota 20152\">{{Cite journal |last1=Devkota |first1=Jay |last2=Schlachter |first2=Hannah |last3=Apul |first3=Defne |date=May 2015 |title=Life cycle based evaluation of harvested rainwater use in toilets and for irrigation |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |volume=95 |pages=311\u2013321 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.02.021}}</ref> developed such a methodology for rainwater harvesting, and found that the building design (e.g., dimensions) and function (e.g., educational, residential, etc.) play critical roles in the environmental performance of the system. The Economic and Environmental Analysis of Sanitations Technologies, [https://defneapul.wikispaces.com/Water+sustainability EEAST] model evaluates the greenhouse gas emissions and cost of such systems over the lifetime of a variety of building types.\n\nTo address the functional parameters of rainwater harvesting systems, a new metric was developed - the demand to supply ratio (D/S) - identifying the ideal building design (supply) and function (demand) in regard to the environmental performance of rainwater harvesting for toilet flushing. With the idea that supply of rainwater not only saves the potable water, but also saves the stormwater entering the combined sewer network (thereby requiring treatment), the savings in environmental emissions were higher if the buildings are connected to a combined sewer network compared to separate one.<ref name=\"Devkota 20152\"/>\n\n== System setup ==\n[[File:To Catch the Rain.pdf|thumb|''To Catch the Rain'', a 2017 book on rainwater harvesting]]\nRainwater harvesting systems can range in complexity, from systems that can be installed with minimal skills, to automated systems that require advanced setup and installation. The basic rainwater harvesting system is more of a plumbing job than a technical job, as all the outlets from the building's terrace are connected through a pipe to an underground tank that stores water.\n\nSystems are ideally sized to meet the water demand throughout the dry season, since it must be big enough to support daily water consumption. Specifically, the rainfall capturing area such as a building roof must be large enough to maintain adequate flow of water. The water storage tank size should be large enough to contain the captured water. \nFor low-tech systems, many low-tech methods are used to capture rainwater: rooftop systems, surface water capture and pumping the rainwater that has already soaked into the ground or captured in reservoirs and storing it in tanks (cisterns).\n\nBefore a rainwater harvesting system is built, use of digital tools is useful, for instance to detect if a region has a high rainwater harvesting potential or to estimate how much water is needed to fulfill a community's water needs. These tools can save time and money before a commitment to build a system is undertaken, in addition to making the project sustainable and long lasting.\n\n== Applications of rainwater harvesting ==\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nIn regards to [[Urban agriculture]] rainwater harvesting in urban areas reduces the impact of runoff and flooding.

In addition, the risks associated with flooding and soil erosion during high rainfall seasons would decrease.

The system helps save approximately 1 million cubic meters of water per year. The cost of the system was 1.5 million dm (US$63,000) in 1993. This system collects water from roofs of the new terminal which has an area of 26,800 square metres. The water is collected in the basement of the airport in six tanks with a storage capacity of 100 cubic meters. The water is mainly used for toilet flushing, watering plants and cleaning the air conditioning system.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rainwaterharvesting.org/international/germany.htm |title=The Rainwater Harvesting System at Mira Model School |website=www.rainwaterharvesting.org |access-date=2018-04-24}}</ref>\n\nRainwater harvesting was adopted at The Velodrome \u2013 The [[Olympic Park, London|London Olympic Park]] \u2013 in order to increase the sustainability of the facility.

Prefiltration is a common practice used in the industry to keep the system healthy and ensure that the water entering the tank is free of large sediments.\n\nA very interesting concept of rain water harvesting and cleaning it with solar energy for rural household drinking purposes has been developed by [[Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute]]. <ref>[https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/118/06/0872.pdf Low cost drinking water technology \u2013 rainwater harvesting with solar purification.

However, in most of the developed world, high-quality potable water is used for all end uses. This approach wastes money and energy and imposes unnecessary impacts to the environment. Supplying rainwater that has gone through preliminary filtration measures for nonpotable water uses, such as toilet flushing, irrigation and laundry, may be a significant part of a sustainable water management strategy.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Ecology}}\n* {{annotated link|Air well (condenser)}}\n* {{annotated link|Atmospheric water generator}} \n* {{annotated link|Deepwater rice}}\n* {{annotated link|Detention basin}} \n* {{annotated link|Peak water}} \n* {{annotated link|Retention basin}}\n* {{annotated link|Water conservation}}\n* [https://www.schoolproject.in/working-model-of-rainwater-harvesting-for-school-project/ DIY Rainwater Harvesting Project for students]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links | wikt=no | n=no | q=no | s=no |v=no}}\n{{Wikiversity}}\n\n[[Category:Rainwater harvesting|*]]\n[[Category:Water supply]]\n[[Category:Water conservation]]\n[[Category:Irrigation]]\n[[Category:Appropriate technology]]\n[[Category:Hydrology and urban planning]]\n[[Category:DIY culture]]\n[[Category:Aquifers]]\n[[Category:Sustainable gardening]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Accumulation of rainwater for reuse}}\n[[File:03242012Taller sostenibilidad lore037.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Rainwater capture and storage system at the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City]]]]\n'''Rainwater harvesting''' is a type of harvest in which the rain drops are collected and stored for the future use, rather than allowing them to run off.

It provides water when a drought occurs, can help mitigate flooding of low-lying areas, and reduces demand on wells which may enable groundwater levels to be sustained. It also helps in the availability of potable water, as rainwater is substantially free of salinity and other salts.

In areas where clean water is costly, or difficult to come by, rainwater harvesting is a critical source of clean water. In developed countries, rainwater is often harvested to be used as a supplemental source of water rather than the main source, but the harvesting of rainwater can also decrease a household's water costs or overall usage levels. Rainwater is safe to drink if the consumers do additional treatments before drinking. Boiling water helps to kill germs. Adding another supplement to the system such as a first flush diverter is also a common procedure to avoid contaminants of the water. <ref> Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013 Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/rainwater-collection.html </ref>\n\n=== Supplemental in drought ===\nWhen drought occurs, rainwater harvested in past months can be used. If rain is scarce but also unpredictable, the use of a rainwater harvesting system can be critical to capturing the rain when it does fall. Many countries with arid environments, use rainwater harvesting as a cheap and reliable source of clean water. To enhance irrigation in arid environments, ridges of soil are constructed to trap and prevent rainwater from running down hills. Even in periods of low [[rainfall]], enough water is collected for crops to grow. Water can be collected from roofs and tanks can be constructed to hold large quantities of rainwater.\n\nIn addition, rainwater harvesting decreases the demand for water from wells, enabling groundwater levels to be further sustained rather than depleted.\n\n=== Life-cycle assessment ===\n[[Life-cycle assessment]] is a methodology used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a system from cradle-to-grave of its lifetime.

The Economic and Environmental Analysis of Sanitations Technologies, [https://defneapul.wikispaces.com/Water+sustainability EEAST] model evaluates the greenhouse gas emissions and cost of such systems over the lifetime of a variety of building types.\n\nTo address the functional parameters of rainwater harvesting systems, a new metric was developed - the demand to supply ratio (D/S) - identifying the ideal building design (supply) and function (demand) in regard to the environmental performance of rainwater harvesting for toilet flushing. With the idea that supply of rainwater not only saves the potable water, but also saves the stormwater entering the combined sewer network (thereby requiring treatment), the savings in environmental emissions were higher if the buildings are connected to a combined sewer network compared to separate one.<ref name=\"Devkota 20152\"/>\n\n== System setup ==\n[[File:To Catch the Rain.pdf|thumb|''To Catch the Rain'', a 2017 book on rainwater harvesting]]\nRainwater harvesting systems can range in complexity, from systems that can be installed with minimal skills, to automated systems that require advanced setup and installation. The basic rainwater harvesting system is more of a plumbing job than a technical job, as all the outlets from the building's terrace are connected through a pipe to an underground tank that stores water.\n\nSystems are ideally sized to meet the water demand throughout the dry season, since it must be big enough to support daily water consumption. Specifically, the rainfall capturing area such as a building roof must be large enough to maintain adequate flow of water. The water storage tank size should be large enough to contain the captured water. \nFor low-tech systems, many low-tech methods are used to capture rainwater: rooftop systems, surface water capture and pumping the rainwater that has already soaked into the ground or captured in reservoirs and storing it in tanks (cisterns).\n\nBefore a rainwater harvesting system is built, use of digital tools is useful, for instance to detect if a region has a high rainwater harvesting potential or to estimate how much water is needed to fulfill a community's water needs. These tools can save time and money before a commitment to build a system is undertaken, in addition to making the project sustainable and long lasting.\n\n== Applications of rainwater harvesting ==\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nIn regards to [[Urban agriculture]] rainwater harvesting in urban areas reduces the impact of runoff and flooding.

Improved water quality can also be obtained by using a floating draw-off mechanism (rather than from the base of the tank) and by using a series of tanks, withdraw from the last in series. Prefiltration is a common practice used in the industry to keep the system healthy and ensure that the water entering the tank is free of large sediments.\n\nA very interesting concept of rain water harvesting and cleaning it with solar energy for rural household drinking purposes has been developed by [[Nimbkar Agricultural Research Institute]]. <ref>[https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/118/06/0872.pdf Low cost drinking water technology \u2013 rainwater harvesting with solar purification.

However, in most of the developed world, high-quality potable water is used for all end uses. This approach wastes money and energy and imposes unnecessary impacts to the environment. Supplying rainwater that has gone through preliminary filtration measures for nonpotable water uses, such as toilet flushing, irrigation and laundry, may be a significant part of a sustainable water management strategy.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Ecology}}\n* {{annotated link|Air well (condenser)}}\n* {{annotated link|Atmospheric water generator}} \n* {{annotated link|Deepwater rice}}\n* {{annotated link|Detention basin}} \n* {{annotated link|Peak water}} \n* {{annotated link|Retention basin}}\n* {{annotated link|Water conservation}}\n* [https://www.schoolproject.in/working-model-of-rainwater-harvesting-for-school-project/ DIY Rainwater Harvesting Project for students]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links | wikt=no | n=no | q=no | s=no |v=no}}\n{{Wikiversity}}\n\n[[Category:Rainwater harvesting|*]]\n[[Category:Water supply]]\n[[Category:Water conservation]]\n[[Category:Irrigation]]\n[[Category:Appropriate technology]]\n[[Category:Hydrology and urban planning]]\n[[Category:DIY culture]]\n[[Category:Aquifers]]\n[[Category:Sustainable gardening]]\n", "name_user": "Tanvir Sahu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory of rain water harvesting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainwater_harvesting"}

Son of Shri B L Mishra, Maj Bhukant was commissioned into 15 battalions of the Kumaon Regiment on 4 April 1970.\n\n== Operation Blue Star ==\nThe terrorism was at its peak in Punjab during 1984, and the terrorists had captured the sacred Golden Temple in Amritsar. A decision was taken by the Indian Government to launch a military operation to evacuate the temple and this operation was code-named  as Op Blue Star.\n\nOn  6 June 1984, a Company commanded by  Major Bhukant Mishra was tasked to clear a temple complex. The Complex was very heavily fortified and was converted into impregnable bastion. Earlier attempts to clear the building during the night had suffered very heavy casualties. At 0440 hours one company led by Major Bhukant Mishra advanced behind an Armoured Personnel Carrier, which was soon hit by anti-tank gun fire. At the same time the company came under very heavy fire and suffered eight casualties, including the JCO of the leading platoon.\n\nRealizing the loss of command and control in the leading platoon, Major Bhukant Mishra rushed forward, irrespective of the heavy fire all around and soon established command and control. Two companies were launched at 0530 hours on the next day. Both the companies advanced at the given time but soon came under very heavy fire. Major Bhukant Mishra's company once again suffered very heavy casualties and the advance of this company stalled. Major Bhukant Mishra at this stage stood in front of the company and asked them to follow him and charged at the base of the Complex. This daring act by Major Bhukant Mishra inspired the company and they rushed behind him and gained a foothold.\n\nA light machine gun firing through a pot hole in the base was interfering in the further advance. Major Bhukant Mishra, without bothering for his safety, now crawled towards the base and destroyed the light machine gun and the crew by lobbing a grenade through the pot hole. Immediately after destroying the light machine gun, Major Bhukant Mishra rushed to the steps leading into the Complex. As he was about to enter the Complex, he was hit by a burst of Medium Machine Gun and was martyred.\n\n== Ashok Chakra awardee ==\nMajor Bhukant Mishra displayed courage, bravery and outstanding leadership skills during the entire operation.

The main thoroughfare is [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], which runs north\u2013south through the neighborhood.\n\nMorningside Heights, located on a high plateau between Morningside and Riverside Parks, was hard to access until the late 19th century, and was sparsely developed except for the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum|Bloomingdale]] and [[Leake and Watts Services|Leake and Watts]] asylums. Morningside Heights, along with the Upper West Side, was considered part of the [[Bloomingdale District]] until Morningside Park was finished in the late 19th century. Large-scale development started in the 1890s with the construction of academic and cultural institutions. By the 1900s, the construction of public transportation and the neighborhood's first [[New York City Subway|subway]] line led to Morningside Heights being developed into a residential neighborhood. Morningside Heights was mostly developed by the 1930s. During the mid-20th century, as the institutions within Morningside Heights expanded, cultural tensions grew between the two groups. After a period of decline, the neighborhood started to [[Gentrification|gentrify]] in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nMuch of Morningside Heights is part of the campus of [[Columbia University]], a private [[Ivy League]] research university that also owns much of the neighborhood's off-campus real estate. Morningside Heights contains numerous other educational institutions such as [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], [[Barnard College]], the [[Manhattan School of Music]], [[Bank Street College of Education]], [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], and the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]. Additionally, Morningside Heights includes several religious institutions, including the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]], [[Riverside Church]], the [[Church of Notre Dame (New York City)|Church of Notre Dame]], [[Corpus Christi Church (New York City)|Corpus Christi Church]], and [[Interchurch Center]]. The neighborhood also contains other architectural landmarks, such as St. Luke's Hospital (now [[Mount Sinai Morningside]]) and [[Grant's Tomb]].\n\nMorningside Heights is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 9|Manhattan Community District 9]].<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\" /> It is patrolled by the 26th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]]. Fire services are provided by the [[New York City Fire Department]]'s Engine Company 47 and Engine Company 37/Ladder Company 40. Politically it is represented by the [[New York City Council]]'s 7th District.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Precolonial and colonial period ===\nInitially, [[Manhattan]] was settled by the [[Lenape]] Native Americans,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/newyorkcityinin00bolt/newyorkcityinin00bolt_djvu.txt|title=New York City in Indian possession|last=Bolton|first=Reginald Pelham|date=1975|access-date=July 29, 2019|via=Internet Archive|page=12}}</ref> who referred to the area nearby as \"Muscota\" or \"Muscoota\", meaning \"place of rushes\".<ref name=\"NYC_Parks_Morningside2\" /><ref name=\"NYCL 2008 p. 2\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2008|ps=.|p=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Native American place names in New York City|last=Grumet|first=Robert|publisher=Museum of the City of New York Produced by Pub.

One of the three neighborhoods comprising [[West Harlem]], Morningside Heights is bounded by [[Central Harlem]] and [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]] to the east, at [[Morningside Drive (Manhattan)|Morningside Drive]]; [[Manhattanville]] to the north, at [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]]; the [[Manhattan Valley]] section of the [[Upper West Side]] to the south, at [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]]; and [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]] to the west, at [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]]. The main thoroughfare is [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], which runs north\u2013south through the neighborhood.\n\nMorningside Heights, located on a high plateau between Morningside and Riverside Parks, was hard to access until the late 19th century, and was sparsely developed except for the [[Bloomingdale Insane Asylum|Bloomingdale]] and [[Leake and Watts Services|Leake and Watts]] asylums. Morningside Heights, along with the Upper West Side, was considered part of the [[Bloomingdale District]] until Morningside Park was finished in the late 19th century. Large-scale development started in the 1890s with the construction of academic and cultural institutions. By the 1900s, the construction of public transportation and the neighborhood's first [[New York City Subway|subway]] line led to Morningside Heights being developed into a residential neighborhood. Morningside Heights was mostly developed by the 1930s. During the mid-20th century, as the institutions within Morningside Heights expanded, cultural tensions grew between the two groups. After a period of decline, the neighborhood started to [[Gentrification|gentrify]] in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nMuch of Morningside Heights is part of the campus of [[Columbia University]], a private [[Ivy League]] research university that also owns much of the neighborhood's off-campus real estate. Morningside Heights contains numerous other educational institutions such as [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], [[Barnard College]], the [[Manhattan School of Music]], [[Bank Street College of Education]], [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], and the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]]. Additionally, Morningside Heights includes several religious institutions, including the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]], [[Riverside Church]], the [[Church of Notre Dame (New York City)|Church of Notre Dame]], [[Corpus Christi Church (New York City)|Corpus Christi Church]], and [[Interchurch Center]]. The neighborhood also contains other architectural landmarks, such as St. Luke's Hospital (now [[Mount Sinai Morningside]]) and [[Grant's Tomb]].\n\nMorningside Heights is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 9|Manhattan Community District 9]].<ref name=\"NYCPlanning\" /> It is patrolled by the 26th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]]. Fire services are provided by the [[New York City Fire Department]]'s Engine Company 47 and Engine Company 37/Ladder Company 40. Politically it is represented by the [[New York City Council]]'s 7th District.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Precolonial and colonial period ===\nInitially, [[Manhattan]] was settled by the [[Lenape]] Native Americans,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/newyorkcityinin00bolt/newyorkcityinin00bolt_djvu.txt|title=New York City in Indian possession|last=Bolton|first=Reginald Pelham|date=1975|access-date=July 29, 2019|via=Internet Archive|page=12}}</ref> who referred to the area nearby as \"Muscota\" or \"Muscoota\", meaning \"place of rushes\".<ref name=\"NYC_Parks_Morningside2\" /><ref name=\"NYCL 2008 p. 2\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2008|ps=.|p=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Native American place names in New York City|last=Grumet|first=Robert|publisher=Museum of the City of New York Produced by Pub.
