Being part of the [[List of original Shortland Street characters|original cast]], she was portrayed by [[Elizabeth McRae]] from the show's first season in 1992 up until 1996. She returned as a guest character in 1998, 2002, as part of the show's [[Shortland Street 20th anniversary|20th anniversary]] in May 2012 and again for the show's 25th anniversary in 2017.\n\nMatriarch of the original family unit \u2013 the Neilsons, Marj was the mother of four sons; [[Patrick Neilson (Shortland Street)|Patrick]] (Uncredited), [[Damien Neilson|Damien]] ([[Mark Ferguson]]), the villainous [[Darryl Neilson|Darryl]] (Mark Ferguson) and [[Stuart Neilson|Stuart]] ([[Martin Henderson]]) alongside a daughter [[Jane Fitzgerald|Jane]] (Katherine McRae). She was staunchly Catholic and often found herself fighting for her beliefs and her family. The character also resonated the archetypical soap opera gossip, something which McRae suggested was integral to the show. Originally married to [[Tom Neilson|Tom]] (Adrian Keeling), Marj soon became a widow and married boyfriend [[Laurie Brasch]] ([[Chic Littlewood]]) before leaving the show in 1996, to become a politician. She returned in 1998 to aide in the exit of [[Jenny Harrison (Shortland Street)|Jenny Harrison]] (Maggie Harper), briefly in 2002 to attend good friend [[Nick Harrison|Nick]]'s ([[Karl Burnett]]) wedding, in 2012 to support [[Rachel McKenna]] ([[Angela Bloomfield]]), and in 2017 for her onscreen death. Throughout Marj's run, she maintained several long lasting character relationships, primarily with; Jenny Harrison, [[Kirsty Knight (Shortland Street)|Kirsty Knight]] ([[Angela Dotchin]]) and Rachel McKenna, some of which have had on-lasting effects on archetypical character moulds.\n\nThe character was used largely for comedic scenes but as she developed, she was also used for dramatic effect, with numerous storylines being fronted by Marj. She was hugely popular and iconic, being named as the most iconic character to feature on the soap of all time.\n\n==Creation and casting==\nOne of the goals of creating ''Shortland Street'', was to have strong powerful women as primary characters to counter stereotype the weak and vulnerable women often portrayed in dramas.<ref name=production>{{cite book |author= Barbara Cairns & Helen Martin|title=Shortland Street \u2013 Production, Text and Audience|edition= First|year=1996 |month= |origyear= |publisher= Macmillan Publishers New Zealand|location= Auckland}}</ref> Marj was created as one of the characters to fulfill this role.<ref name=production/> A family unit was needed to pull in a broader audience and so Marj was written with a husband and two children.<ref name=production/> [[Elizabeth McRae]] was cast in the role and was delivered an initial 30 scripts in February 1992.<ref name=goodmorning>{{cite episode|date=23 May 2012|series=[[Good Morning (New Zealand show)|Good Morning]]|station=[[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]]|network=[[Television New Zealand]]}}</ref> McRae was sceptical the show would last over a year and was curious how her character could develop over such a long period.<ref name=goodmorning/> She went on to realise the writers craft, stating; \"You learn quite quickly that your character can do \u2013 anything.

It was quickly revealed that Stuart's eldest brother [[Darryl Neilson|Darryl]] ([[Mark Ferguson]]) was the real father. Marj never discovered this, though Tom had his suspicions. Marj suspected Tom was having an affair with [[Irene Raynor]] (Jan Saussey) but was embarrassed when it turned out not to be the case and apologetically nursed Tom through his health scares. In late 1992, Marj's illegitimate daughter [[Jane Fitzgerald|Jane]] (Katherine McRae) who she adopted out at birth, made contact, infuriating Tom. Tom fled Ferndale and an upset Marj began to date the policeman behind his disappearance \u2013 [[Laurie Brasch|Laurie]] ([[Chic Littlewood]]). \n[[File:Helenclarkeshortlandstreet.jpg|thumb|right|Marj's final scenes saw the character meet future [[Prime minister of New Zealand|prime ministers]] \u2013 [[Helen Clark]] and [[Jenny Shipley]].

Marj reunited with Laurie and after he accidentally poisoned her with chemicals on his farm, they married in 1994. The two became foster parents to [[Lulu Chatfield]] ([[Meighan Desmond]]) and Marj was devastated when her son Darryl drowned. Marj began to tire of community services in Ferndale and put herself forward firstly to the council, much to the amusement of her co-workers, before deciding to run for parliament in the 1996 election. Marj won the majority vote to sit for Ferndale in the New Zealand parliament. She, Laurie and Lulu departed Ferndale.\n\nMarj returned to Ferndale and hired best friend \u2013 [[Jenny Harrison (Shortland Street)|Jenny Harrison]] (Maggie Harper) as her personal assistant. She attended the funeral for [[Tiffany Pratt|Tiffany Marinovich]] (Alison James) before she and Jenny departed to Wellington.\n\nThe two returned in 2002 to attend Jenny's son, [[Nick Harrison|Nick]]'s ([[Karl Burnett]]) wedding to [[Waverley Wilson]] ([[Claire Chitham]]). Marj felt deeply betrayed when Jenny announced her retirement and the two fell out. It was only through the love of Nick and Waverley that the two finally reconciled. As she again departed Ferndale, Marj offered Jenny's position to [[Rachel McKenna]] ([[Angela Bloomfield]]), who declined. The following year Marj helped secure Rachel a job in the government, leading to her leaving Ferndale. Marj briefly returned in May 2012 to support Rachel following [[Chris Warner|Chris]]' ([[Michael Galvin]]) arrest for murder.\n\nMarj returned to Ferndale for Chris' 50th birthday but was hospitalised for an [[aortic aneurysm]], leading to Stuart arriving to visit her. Marj revealed that she had retired from politics 12 years previously after winning three consecutive elections. A volcanic eruption saw Marj step in and return to the front desk of the hospital before suffering an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack whilst stuck in the elevator. Following words of advice to Nick and Waverley on being parents for the 6th time, Marj fell into cardiac arrest in the hospital reception and died. Chris and Stuart discovered her body and expressed joy that she had died in her \"home\".\n\n==Character development==\n\n===Characterisation===\nInstantly upon introduction, Marj was shown to be a stern Catholic mother busybody, who loved to gossip and cares deeply for her family. She has been described as \"bossy, opinionated, a terrible gossip. She was everyone's favourite Aunt, with the flapping mouth and the big heart.\"<ref name=10bestcharacters>{{cite news|title=Shortland Street: The 10 best characters|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=1942424|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News & Media]]|date=May 2002|author=Hewitson, Michelle|access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref> Marj has also been described as the \"big-hearted office gossip\".<ref name=atoz>{{cite news|title=The A-Z of Shortland Street|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11858353|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News & Media]]|date=21 May 2017}}</ref> The character did not mind saying what she thought, including in 1992 when she was openly hostile towards [[Jaki Manu]] (Nancy Brunning) who feared she had AIDS.

I can understand this\".<ref name=10bestcharacters/> McRae enjoyed the characterisation but acknowledged Marj had her flaws, stating; \"She stands up for family and is quite perceptive and forgiving.

Being part of the [[List of original Shortland Street characters|original cast]], she was portrayed by [[Elizabeth McRae]] from the show's first season in 1992 up until 1996. She returned as a guest character in 1998, 2002, as part of the show's [[Shortland Street 20th anniversary|20th anniversary]] in May 2012 and again for the show's 25th anniversary in 2017.\n\nMatriarch of the original family unit \u2013 the Neilsons, Marj was the mother of four sons; [[Patrick Neilson (Shortland Street)|Patrick]] (Uncredited), [[Damien Neilson|Damien]] ([[Mark Ferguson]]), the villainous [[Darryl Neilson|Darryl]] (Mark Ferguson) and [[Stuart Neilson|Stuart]] ([[Martin Henderson]]) alongside a daughter [[Jane Fitzgerald|Jane]] (Katherine McRae). She was staunchly Catholic and often found herself fighting for her beliefs and her family. The character also resonated the archetypical soap opera gossip, something which McRae suggested was integral to the show. Originally married to [[Tom Neilson|Tom]] (Adrian Keeling), Marj soon became a widow and married boyfriend [[Laurie Brasch]] ([[Chic Littlewood]]) before leaving the show in 1996, to become a politician. She returned in 1998 to aide in the exit of [[Jenny Harrison (Shortland Street)|Jenny Harrison]] (Maggie Harper), briefly in 2002 to attend good friend [[Nick Harrison|Nick]]'s ([[Karl Burnett]]) wedding, in 2012 to support [[Rachel McKenna]] ([[Angela Bloomfield]]), and in 2017 for her onscreen death. Throughout Marj's run, she maintained several long lasting character relationships, primarily with; Jenny Harrison, [[Kirsty Knight (Shortland Street)|Kirsty Knight]] ([[Angela Dotchin]]) and Rachel McKenna, some of which have had on-lasting effects on archetypical character moulds.\n\nThe character was used largely for comedic scenes but as she developed, she was also used for dramatic effect, with numerous storylines being fronted by Marj. She was hugely popular and iconic, being named as the most iconic character to feature on the soap of all time.\n\n==Creation and casting==\nOne of the goals of creating ''Shortland Street'', was to have strong powerful women as primary characters to counter stereotype the weak and vulnerable women often portrayed in dramas.<ref name=production>{{cite book |author= Barbara Cairns & Helen Martin|title=Shortland Street - Production, Text and Audience|edition= First|year=1996 |month= |origyear= |publisher= Macmillan Publishers New Zealand|location= Auckland}}</ref> Marj was created as one of the characters to fulfill this role.<ref name=production/> A family unit was needed to pull in a broader audience and so Marj was written with a husband and two children.<ref name=production/> [[Elizabeth McRae]] was cast in the role and was delivered an initial 30 scripts in February 1992.<ref name=goodmorning>{{cite episode|date=23 May 2012|series=[[Good Morning (New Zealand show)|Good Morning]]|station=[[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]]|network=[[Television New Zealand]]}}</ref> McRae was skeptical the show would last over a year and was curious how her character could develop over such a long period.<ref name=goodmorning/> She went on to realise the writers craft, stating; \"You learn quite quickly that your character can do - anything.

It was quickly revealed that Stuart's eldest brother [[Darryl Neilson|Darryl]] ([[Mark Ferguson]]) was the real father. Marj never discovered this, though Tom had his suspicions. Marj suspected Tom was having an affair with [[Irene Raynor]] (Jan Saussey) but was embarrassed when it turned out not to be the case and apologetically nursed Tom through his health scares. In late 1992, Marj's illegitimate daughter [[Jane Fitzgerald|Jane]] (Katherine McRae) who she adopted out at birth, made contact, infuriating Tom. Tom fled Ferndale and an upset Marj began to date the policeman behind his disappearance \u2013 [[Laurie Brasch|Laurie]] ([[Chic Littlewood]]). \n[[File:Helenclarkeshortlandstreet.jpg|thumb|right|Marj's final scenes saw the character meet future [[Prime minister of New Zealand|prime ministers]] \u2013 [[Helen Clark]] and [[Jenny Shipley]].

Marj reunited with Laurie and after he accidentally poisoned her with chemicals on his farm, they married in 1994. The two became foster parents to [[Lulu Chatfield]] ([[Meighan Desmond]]) and Marj was devastated when her son Darryl drowned. Marj began to tire of community services in Ferndale and put herself forward firstly to the council, much to the amusement of her co-workers, before deciding to run for parliament in the 1996 election. Marj won the majority vote to sit for Ferndale in the New Zealand parliament. She, Laurie and Lulu departed Ferndale.\n\nMarj returned to Ferndale and hired best friend \u2013 [[Jenny Harrison (Shortland Street)|Jenny Harrison]] (Maggie Harper) as her personal assistant. She attended the funeral for [[Tiffany Pratt|Tiffany Marinovich]] (Alison James) before she and Jenny departed to Wellington.\n\nThe two returned in 2002 to attend Jenny's son, [[Nick Harrison|Nick]]'s ([[Karl Burnett]]) wedding to [[Waverley Wilson]] ([[Claire Chitham]]). Marj felt deeply betrayed when Jenny announced her retirement and the two fell out. It was only through the love of Nick and Waverley that the two finally reconciled. As she again departed Ferndale, Marj offered Jenny's position to [[Rachel McKenna]] ([[Angela Bloomfield]]), who declined. The following year Marj helped secure Rachel a job in the government, leading to her leaving Ferndale. Marj briefly returned in May 2012 to support Rachel following [[Chris Warner|Chris]]' ([[Michael Galvin]]) arrest for murder.\n\nMarj returned to Ferndale for Chris' 50th birthday but was hospitalised for an [[aortic aneurysm]], leading to Stuart arriving to visit her. Marj revealed that she had retired from politics 12 years previously after winning three consecutive elections. A volcanic eruption saw Marj step in and return to the front desk of the hospital before suffering an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack whilst stuck in the elevator. Following words of advice to Nick and Waverley on being parents for the 6th time, Marj fell into cardiac arrest in the hospital reception and died. Chris and Stuart discovered her body and expressed joy that she had died in her \"home\".\n\n==Character development==\n\n===Characterisation===\nInstantly upon introduction, Marj was shown to be a stern Catholic mother busybody, who loved to gossip and cares deeply for her family.

{"title_page": "Credit score", "text_new": "{{About|an individual's credit score|organization's credit rating|credit rating}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2011}}\nA '''credit score''' is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the [[creditworthiness]] of an individual. A credit score is primarily based on a [[credit report]], information typically sourced from [[credit bureau]]s.\n\nLenders, such as [[bank]]s and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to [[bad debt]].  Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what [[interest rate]], and what credit limits.  Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or [[identity scoring]] prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a [[trusted system]].\n\nCredit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nAlthough [[logistic function|logistic]] (or [[non-linear]]) probability modelling is still the most popular means by which to develop scorecards, various other methods offer powerful alternatives, including [[Multivariate adaptive regression splines|MARS]], [[Predictive analytics#Classification and regression trees|CART]], [[CHAID]], and [[random forest]]s.\n\nPrior to 12 March 2014 [[Veda Advantage]], the main provider of credit file data, provided only a negative credit reporting system containing information on applications for credit and adverse listings indicating a default under a credit contract. Veda was acquired by Equifax in Feb 2016,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.equifax.com.au/news-media/equifax-completes-acquisition-australias-leading-credit-information-company-veda-group|title=Equifax Completes Acquisition of Australia\u2019s Leading Credit Information Company, Veda Group Limited, for Total Consideration of USD$1.9 Billion|date=25 February 2016|work=Equifax Australia|access-date=6 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> making Equifax the largest credit agency in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/52.%20Overview%3A%20Credit%20Reporting/credit-reporting-agencies|title=Credit reporting agencies|last=Anonymous|date=17 August 2010|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the subsequent introduction of positive reporting, lending companies have begun an uptake of its usage with some implementing [[Risk-based pricing|risk based pricing]] to set lending rates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McGeorge|first1=Noah|title=fico ratings|url=https://aaacreditguide.com/fico-credit-score-range/|accessdate=28 February 2013|agency=Barff|issue=Atlanta|publisher=Marcus Arnold}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], credit scoring is done as a blacklist. Consumers who did not pay bills end up on the blacklists that are held by different [[credit bureau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |title=Fragen & Antworten |accessdate=31 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101180603/http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |archive-date=1 January 2011 |df= }}</ref> Having an entry on the black list may result in the denial of contracts. Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis. Banks also use these lists, but rather inquire about security and income when considering loans. Beside these lists several agencies and credit bureaus provide credit scoring of consumers.\n\nAccording to the [[Data Protection Directive|Austrian Data Protection Act]], consumers must opt-in for the use of their private data for any purpose. Consumers can also withhold permission to use the data later, making illegal any further distribution or use of the collected data.<ref>\u00a7 8 Abs 1 Z2 DSG</ref> Consumers also have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year.<ref>\u00a7 26 DSG</ref> Wrong or unlawfully collected data must be deleted or corrected.<ref>\u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28 DSG</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nCredit scoring is relatively new in Brazil. Previously, credit reporting was done as a blacklist and each lender used to assess potential borrowers on their own criteria. Nowadays, the system of credit reports and scores in Brazil is very similar to that in the United States.\n\nA credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit information, which represents the creditworthiness of that person. It is the most important tool used by financial institutions during a credit analysis that aims to assist the decision-making process of granting credit and conducting business, in order to verify the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: [[Experian|Serasa Experian]], [[:pt:Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os|Boa Vista]] (previously [[Equifax|Equifax do Brasil]]) and [[SPC Brasil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foregon.com/blog/voce-sabe-o-que-e-score/|title=Score de cr\u00e9dito: o que \u00e9 e como ele funciona|first=Leonardo|last=Jacomini|date=9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores in Brazil. In general, scores range from 0 to 1000 indicating what is the chance of a certain profile of consumers paying their bills on time in the next 12 months. The score is calculated from several factors, but practically it analyzes a person's trajectory as a consumer, what includes up to date payments of bills, history of negative debts, financial relationships with companies and updated personal data on credit protection agencies, such as Serasa Experian, Boa Vista, SPC, Quod and Foregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |title=Tudo sobre score de cr\u00e9dito |language=es |trans-title=All about credit score |access-date=29 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529030645/https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |archive-date=29 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/br/blog/conceitos-financas/entenda-como-funciona-o-score-de-credito-do-consumidor|title=Entenda Como Funciona o Score de Cr\u00e9dito do Consumidor|date=24 April 2015|website=QuickBooks}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe system of credit reports and scores in Canada is very similar to that in the United States and India, with two of the same reporting agencies active in the country:  [[Equifax]] and [[TransUnion]]. ([[Experian]], which entered the Canadian market with the purchase of Northern Credit Bureaus in 2008, announced the closing of its Canadian operations as of 18 April 2009).\n\nThere are, however, some key differences. One is that, unlike in the United States, where a consumer is allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, as long as the request is made in writing, and as long as the consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/ecm/canada/EFXCreditReportRequestForm.pdf Equifax form] (Canada)</ref><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/its-easy-to-get-a-free-credit-report-honest/article620190/ TransUnion form] (Canada)</ref> Borrowell and CreditKarma offers free credit report and credit check and this request by the consumer is noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', so it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.\n\nThe Government of [[Canada]] offers a free publication called ''Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score''.<ref>[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/creditLoans/Pages/Understa-Comprend.aspx Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score] (Canada)</ref>  This publication provides sample credit report and credit score documents, with explanations of the notations and codes that are used. It also contains general information on how to build or improve credit history, and how to check for signs that [[identity theft]] has occurred. The publication is available online at the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]. Paper copies can also be ordered at no charge for residents of Canada.\n\n===China===\nPrivate companies have developed credit score systems, these systems include [[Sesame Credit]], which is provided by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/china-social-credit-system-ant-financials-sesame-credit-and-others-give-scores-that-go-beyond-fico.html|title=FICO with Chinese characteristics: Nice rewards, but punishing penalties|last=Ming|first=Cheang|date=2017|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tencent|Tencent Credit]]. Part of the government's [[Social Credit System]] uses credit information about citizens.\n\n===Denmark===\nThe credit scoring is widely used in Denmark by the banks and a number of private companies within telco and others. The credit scoring is split in two:\n* Private: The probability of defaulting\n* Businesses: The probability of bankruptcy\nFor privates, the credit scoring is always made by the creditor. For businesses it is either made by the creditor or by a third party.\n\nThere are a few companies who have specialized in developing credit scorecards in Denmark:\n* [[Experian]] (generic rating for business)\n* [[Bisnode]] (generic rating for business)\n\nThe credit scorecards in Denmark are mainly based on information provided by the applicant and publicly available data. It is very restricted by legislation compared to its neighbouring countries.\n\n===Germany===\n\nIn Germany, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nConsumers have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year. At present [[Schufa]], the main provider of credit file data, provides scores for about three-quarters of the German population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9343.html|title=Lecture: Court in the Akten &#124; Sunday &#124; Schedule 35th Chaos Communication Congress|website=fahrplan.events.ccc.de}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], there are four credit information companies licensed by [[Reserve Bank of India]]. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited ([[CIBIL]]) has functioned as a Credit Information Company from January 2001.<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5540&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2010, [[Experian]],<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\"/> [[Equifax]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5598&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> and [[CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services|CRIF High Mark]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6137&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> were given licenses by [[Reserve Bank of India]] to operate as Credit Information Companies in India.\n\nAlthough all the four credit information companies have developed their individual credit scores, the most popular is [[CIBIL]] credit score. The [[CIBIL]] credit score is a three  digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. [[CIBIL]] credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.\n\n===Norway===\nIn [[Norway]], credit scoring services are provided by three credit scoring agencies: [[Dun & Bradstreet]], [[Experian]] and Lindorff Decision. Credit scoring is based on publicly available information such as demographic data, tax returns, taxable income and any ''Betalingsanmerkning'' (non-payment records) that might be registered on the credit-scored individual. Upon being scored, an individual will receive a notice (written or by e-mail) from the scoring agency stating who performed the credit score as well as any information provided in the score. In addition, many credit institutions use custom scorecards based on any number of parameters. Credit scores range between 300 and 999.\n\n===South Africa===\nCredit scoring is used throughout the credit industry in [[South Africa]], with the likes of banks, micro-lenders, clothing retailers, furniture retailers, specialized lenders and insurers all using credit scores.  Currently all four retail [[credit bureau]] offer credit bureau scores.  The data stored by the credit bureaus include both positive and negative data, increasing the predictive power of the individual scores.  [[TransUnion]] (formerly ITC) offer the Empirica Score which is, as of mid-2010, in its 4th generation.  The Empirica score is segmented into two suites: the account origination (AO) and account management (AM).  [[Experian]] South Africa likewise has a Delphi credit score with their fourth generation about to be released (late 2010). In 2011, [[Compuscan]] released Compuscore ABC, a scoring suite which predicts the probability of customer default throughout the credit life cycle. Six years later, Compuscan introduced Compuscore PSY, a 3-digit psychometric-based credit bureau score used by lenders to make informed lending decisions on thin files or marginal declines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.compuscan.co.za/introducing-newest-service-offering-compuscore-psy/|title=Introducing our newest service offering: Compuscore PSY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nAccording to the provisions of Credit Information Bureau Act No 18 of 1990 (as amended by Act No 42 of 2008), [[Credit Information Bureau, Inc.|CRIB]] has been delegated with power to issue credit reports to any subject to whom that information is related to. The Bureau commenced to issue Self Inquiry Credit Reports in December 2009.<ref>[http://www.crib.lk/en/index.php/customer-help-desk/obtain-your-own-credit-report Crib.lk] (Sri Lanks)</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSweden has a system for credit scoring that aims to find people with a history of neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make payments after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish [[Enforcement Authority]] which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning|url=https://www.kronofogden.se/Betalningsanmarkning2.html|website=kronofogden.se|publisher=[[Enforcement Authority]]|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liljemalm|first1=Anna|title=S\u00e5 minskar skulder chansen att f\u00e5 l\u00e4genhet|trans-title=Debts reduce chances to get an apartment|url=http://www.gp.se/ekonomi/1.2618214-sa-minskar-skulder-chansen-att-fa-lagenhet|website=gp.se|publisher=[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]|date=3 February 2015|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIf a person gets an injunction to pay issued by the Enforcement Authority, it is possible to dispute it. Then the party requesting the payment must show its correctness in district court. Failure to dispute is seen as admitting the debt. If the debtor loses the court trial, costs for the trial are added to the debt. Taxes and authority fees must always be paid on demand unless payment has already been made.\n\nEvery person with a Swedish [[national identification number]] must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut [[Christer Fuglesang]] got a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the [[Stockholm congestion tax]]. At the time, he was living in the USA training for his first [[STS-116|Space Shuttle mission]] and had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olsson|first1=Caroline|title=Fuglesang hamnar hos kronofogden|trans-title=Fuglesang at the Swedish Enforcement Administration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11372512.ab|website=aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Credit scorecards}}\nCredit scoring in the United Kingdom is very different to that of the United States and other nations. There is no such thing as a universal credit score or credit rating in the UK.

Most lenders instead use their own internal scoring mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe most popular statistical technique used is [[logistic regression]] to predict a binary outcome: bad debt or no bad debt.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Some banks also build regression models that predict the amount of bad debt a customer may incur. Typically this is much harder to predict, and most banks focus only on the binary outcome.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated only by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] when used for the purposes of the Advanced approach to Capital Adequacy under [[Basel II]] regulations.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated in the UK, with the industry regulator being the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Consumers can also send complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they experience problems with any Credit Reference Agency.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hulland|first=Louise|title=Credit Reference Agencies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/credit-reference-agency|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIt is very difficult for a consumer to know in advance whether they have a high enough credit score to be accepted for credit with a given lender.  This situation is due to the complexity and structure of credit scoring, which differs from one lender to another.\n\nLenders need not reveal their credit score head, nor need they reveal the minimum credit score required for the applicant to be accepted, because there may not be such a minimum score.\n\nIf the applicant is declined for credit, the lender is not obliged to reveal the exact reason why. However industry associations including the [[Finance and Leasing Association]] oblige their members to provide a satisfactory reason. Credit-bureau data sharing agreements also require that an applicant declined based on credit-bureau data is told that this is the reason and the address of the credit bureau must be provided.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Credit score in the United States}}\nIn the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the [[creditworthiness]] of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills.  A credit score is primarily based on [[credit report]] information, typically from one of the three major [[credit bureau]]s: [[Experian]], [[TransUnion]], and [[Equifax]]. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores. [[FICO score]]s, the most widely used type of credit score, is a credit score developed by [[FICO]], previously known as [[Fair Isaac|Fair Isaac Corporation]].  As of 2018, there are currently 29 different versions of FICO scores in use in the United States. Some of these versions are \"industry specific\" scores, that is, scores produced for particular market segments, including automotive lending and bankcard (credit card) lending. Industry-specific FICO scores produced for automotive lending are formulated differently than FICO scores produced for bankcard lending. Nearly every consumer will have different FICO scores depending upon which type of FICO score is ordered by a lender; for example, a consumer with several paid-in-full car loans but no reported credit card payment history will generally score better on a FICO automotive-enhanced score than on a FICO bankcard-enhanced score. FICO also produces several \"general purpose\" scores which are not tailored to any particular industry. Industry-specific FICO scores range from 250 to 900, whereas general purpose scores range from 300 to 850.\n\nFICO scores are used by many mortgage lenders that use a risk-based system to determine the possibility that the borrower may default on financial obligations to the mortgage lender. For most mortgages originated in the United States, three credit scores are obtained on a consumer: a Beacon 5.0 score (Beacon is a trademark of FICO) which is calculated from the consumer's Equifax credit history, a FICO Model II score, which is calculated from the consumer's Experian credit history, and a Classic04 score, which is calculated from the consumer's Trans Union history.\n\n[[Credit bureau]]s also often re-sell FICO scores directly to consumers, often a general-purpose FICO 8 score. Previously, the credit bureaus also sold their own credit scores which they developed themselves, and which did not require payment to FICO to utilize: [[Equifax]]'s RISK score and [[Experian]]'s PLUS score. However, as of 2018, these scores are no longer sold by the credit bureaus. Trans Union offers a Vantage 3.0 score for sale to consumers, which is a version of the [[VantageScore]] credit score. In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit card issuers, have developed their own proprietary scoring models.\n\nStudies have shown scores to be predictive of risk in the underwriting of both credit and insurance.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/creditscore/creditscore.pdf Report to the Congress on credit scoring and its effects on the availability and affordability of credit]</ref><ref name=insurance>[http://www2.ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf Credit-based insurance scores: Impacts on consumers of automobile insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511204147/http://ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.org/media/presentations/creditscoringtexas/|title=No Evidence of Disparate Impact in Texas Due to Use of Credit Information by Personal Lines Insurers - III|author=|date=|website=iii.org}}</ref>  Some studies even suggest that most consumers are the beneficiaries of lower credit costs and insurance premiums due to the use of credit scores.<ref name=insurance/><ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2003/0203lead.pdf An overview of consumer data and credit reporting]</ref>\n\nNew credit scores have been developed in the last decade by companies such as Scorelogix, [[PRBC (company)|PRBC]], L2C, [[Innovis]] etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIt is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nUsage of credit histories in employment screenings has increased from 19% in 1996 to 42% in 2006.<ref name=wernau>{{cite news|last=Wernau|first=Julie|title=TransUnion battling attempts to ban employment credit checks|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-28/business/ct-biz-0429-credit-checks-transunion--20100428_1_credit-checks-transunion-credit-bureaus|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>{{rp|1}}  However, credit reports for employment screening purposes do not include credit scores.<ref name=wernau />{{rp|2}}\n\nAmericans are entitled to one free credit report in every 12-month period from each of the three credit bureaus, but are not entitled to receive a free credit score. The three credit bureaus run [[Annualcreditreport.com]], where users can get their free credit reports. Credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee. If the consumer disputes an item on a credit report obtained using the free system, under the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/answers/correct-credit-report-errors/en_cp Equifax Credit Report Dispute FAQs] retrieved on 18 December 2008</ref>\n\nAlternatively, consumers wishing to obtain their credit scores can in some cases purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from [[FICO]]. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available free by subscription to one of the many [[credit report monitoring]] services available from the credit bureaus or other third parties, although to actually get the scores free from most such services, one must use a credit card to sign up for a free trial subscription of the service and then cancel before the first monthly charge. Websites like [[WalletHub]], [[Credit Sesame]] and [[Credit Karma]] provide free credit scores with no credit card required, using the [[TransUnion]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Credit.com uses the [[Experian]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Until March 2009, holders of credit cards issued by [[Washington Mutual]] were offered a free FICO score each month through the bank's Web site. ([[Chase (bank)|Chase]], which took over Washington Mutual in 2008, discontinued this practice in March 2009.)<ref>[http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/credit-card-update.asp Chase drops WaMu secured card, FICO score] retrieved on 17 January 2009</ref> [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] resumed the practice of offering a free FICO score in March 2010 of select card members to the exclusion of the majority of former WAMU card holders.\n\nUnder the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], a consumer is entitled to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g., being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken as a result of their credit score. Under the [[Wall Street reform]] bill passed on 22 July 2010, a consumer is entitled to receive a free credit score if they are denied a loan or insurance due to their credit score.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/15/president-obama-final-passage-wall-street-reform-end-bailouts-a-beginning-accountabi President Obama on Final Passage of Wall Street Reform: An End to Bailouts, a Beginning for Accountability] published 15 July 2010, retrieved on 26 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe generic or classic FICO credit score ranges between 300 and 850. The VantageScore 3.0 score ranges from 300-850. The old VantageScore was between 501 and 990.\n\nThe first step to interpreting a score is to identify the source of the credit score and its use. There are numerous scores based on various scoring models sold to lenders and other users. The most common was created by FICO and is called FICO score. [[FICO]] is a publicly traded corporation (under the ticker symbol FICO) that created the best-known and most widely used credit score model in the United States. FICO produces scoring models which are installed at and distributed by the three largest national credit repositories in the U.S (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) and the two national credit repositories in Canada (TransUnion Canada and Equifax Canada).  FICO controls the vast majority of the credit score market in the United States and Canada although there are several other competing players that collectively share a very small percentage of the market.\n\nIn the United States, the [[median]] generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fico.com/en/blogs/tag/score-distributions/|title=Score Distributions|author=|date=|website=FICO}}</ref>  The performance definition of the FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict the likelihood that a consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use.  For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving credit card debt when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.\n\nThe interpretation of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and the economy as a whole.  While 640 has been a divider between \"prime\" and \"subprime\", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated.  In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile.  In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. Furthermore, private mortgage insurance companies will not even provide mortgage insurance for borrowers with scores below 660. Therefore, \"prime\" is a product of the lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower is asking for the loan.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSeveral factors affect individual's credit scores. One factor is the amount an individual borrowed as compared to the amount of credit available to the individual. As an individual borrows, or leverages, more money, the individual's credit score decreases.\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\nCredit Scores in UAE are issued by AECB, a Federal Government-held company. Individual Credit Scores are three-digit numbers used to predict the likelihood of an individual making their loan and credit card payments on time, based on previous credit and payment behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneymall.ae/credit-score/|title=Credit Score in UAE|last=|first=|date=|website=moneymall.ae|publisher='MoneyMall' leading personal finance portal in UAE|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Credit Score number in UAE ranges from 300 to 900.

As per UAE Federal Law No. (6) of 2010 concerning Credit Information, the company is mandated to regularly collect credit information from financial and non-financial institutions in the UAE.\n\nAl Etihad Credit Bureau aggregates and analyzes this data to calculate Credit Scores and produce Credit Reports that are made available to individuals and companies in the UAE.\n\nCredit Scoring is relatively new in UAE, But All major banks started using the same which shows its high importance hence\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Alternative data]]\n* [[Bank statement]]\n* [[Credit bureau]]\n* [[Credit history]]\n* [[Credit reference]]\n* [[Credit repair software]]\n* [[Credit scorecards]]\n* [[Social Credit System]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre24.shtm|title=FTC Guide to Credit Scores}}\n* {{cite web|title=Credit Scores Video - Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iliZgmqgRRE}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.fcac.gc.ca|title=Financial Consumer Agency of Canada}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/credit-score.htm|title=How Credit Scores Work}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/economic-commentary-archives/2010-economic-commentaries/ec-201016-your-credit-score-is-a-ranking-not-a-score.aspx|title=Your Credit Score Is a Ranking, Not a Score}}\n*<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaecashloans.com/banking-and-finance/credit-score-in-uae/|title=Credit Score in UAE {{!}} AECB Report {{!}} Uae Cash Loans|date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Credit Score}}\n[[Category:Credit scoring| ]]\n[[Category:Personal finance]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|an individual's credit score|organization's credit rating|credit rating}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2011}}\nA '''credit score''' is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the [[creditworthiness]] of an individual. A credit score is primarily based on a [[credit report]], information typically sourced from [[credit bureau]]s.\n\nLenders, such as [[bank]]s and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to [[bad debt]].  Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what [[interest rate]], and what credit limits.  Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or [[identity scoring]] prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a [[trusted system]].\n\nCredit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nAlthough [[logistic function|logistic]] (or [[non-linear]]) probability modelling is still the most popular means by which to develop scorecards, various other methods offer powerful alternatives, including [[Multivariate adaptive regression splines|MARS]], [[Predictive analytics#Classification and regression trees|CART]], [[CHAID]], and [[random forest]]s.\n\nPrior to 12 March 2014 [[Veda Advantage]], the main provider of credit file data, provided only a negative credit reporting system containing information on applications for credit and adverse listings indicating a default under a credit contract. Veda was acquired by Equifax in Feb 2016,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.equifax.com.au/news-media/equifax-completes-acquisition-australias-leading-credit-information-company-veda-group|title=Equifax Completes Acquisition of Australia\u2019s Leading Credit Information Company, Veda Group Limited, for Total Consideration of USD$1.9 Billion|date=25 February 2016|work=Equifax Australia|access-date=6 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> making Equifax the largest credit agency in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/52.%20Overview%3A%20Credit%20Reporting/credit-reporting-agencies|title=Credit reporting agencies|last=Anonymous|date=17 August 2010|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the subsequent introduction of positive reporting, lending companies have begun an uptake of its usage with some implementing [[Risk-based pricing|risk based pricing]] to set lending rates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McGeorge|first1=Noah|title=fico ratings|url=https://aaacreditguide.com/fico-credit-score-range/|accessdate=28 February 2013|agency=Barff|issue=Atlanta|publisher=Marcus Arnold}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], credit scoring is done as a blacklist. Consumers who did not pay bills end up on the blacklists that are held by different [[credit bureau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |title=Fragen & Antworten |accessdate=31 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101180603/http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |archive-date=1 January 2011 |df= }}</ref> Having an entry on the black list may result in the denial of contracts. Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis. Banks also use these lists, but rather inquire about security and income when considering loans. Beside these lists several agencies and credit bureaus provide credit scoring of consumers.\n\nAccording to the [[Data Protection Directive|Austrian Data Protection Act]], consumers must opt-in for the use of their private data for any purpose. Consumers can also withhold permission to use the data later, making illegal any further distribution or use of the collected data.<ref>\u00a7 8 Abs 1 Z2 DSG</ref> Consumers also have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year.<ref>\u00a7 26 DSG</ref> Wrong or unlawfully collected data must be deleted or corrected.<ref>\u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28 DSG</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nCredit scoring is relatively new in Brazil. Previously, credit reporting was done as a blacklist and each lender used to assess potential borrowers on their own criteria. Nowadays, the system of credit reports and scores in Brazil is very similar to that in the United States.\n\nA credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit information, which represents the creditworthiness of that person. It is the most important tool used by financial institutions during a credit analysis that aims to assist the decision-making process of granting credit and conducting business, in order to verify the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: [[Experian|Serasa Experian]], [[:pt:Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os|Boa Vista]] (previously [[Equifax|Equifax do Brasil]]) and [[SPC Brasil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foregon.com/blog/voce-sabe-o-que-e-score/|title=Score de cr\u00e9dito: o que \u00e9 e como ele funciona|first=Leonardo|last=Jacomini|date=9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores in Brazil. In general, scores range from 0 to 1000 indicating what is the chance of a certain profile of consumers paying their bills on time in the next 12 months. The score is calculated from several factors, but practically it analyzes a person's trajectory as a consumer, what includes up to date payments of bills, history of negative debts, financial relationships with companies and updated personal data on credit protection agencies, such as Serasa Experian, Boa Vista, SPC, Quod and Foregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |title=Tudo sobre score de cr\u00e9dito |language=es |trans-title=All about credit score |access-date=29 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529030645/https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |archive-date=29 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/br/blog/conceitos-financas/entenda-como-funciona-o-score-de-credito-do-consumidor|title=Entenda Como Funciona o Score de Cr\u00e9dito do Consumidor|date=24 April 2015|website=QuickBooks}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe system of credit reports and scores in Canada is very similar to that in the United States and India, with two of the same reporting agencies active in the country:  [[Equifax]] and [[TransUnion]]. ([[Experian]], which entered the Canadian market with the purchase of Northern Credit Bureaus in 2008, announced the closing of its Canadian operations as of 18 April 2009).\n\nThere are, however, some key differences. One is that, unlike in the United States, where a consumer is allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, as long as the request is made in writing, and as long as the consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/ecm/canada/EFXCreditReportRequestForm.pdf Equifax form] (Canada)</ref><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/its-easy-to-get-a-free-credit-report-honest/article620190/ TransUnion form] (Canada)</ref> Borrowell and CreditKarma offers free credit report and credit check and this request by the consumer is noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', so it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.\n\nThe Government of [[Canada]] offers a free publication called ''Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score''.<ref>[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/creditLoans/Pages/Understa-Comprend.aspx Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score] (Canada)</ref>  This publication provides sample credit report and credit score documents, with explanations of the notations and codes that are used. It also contains general information on how to build or improve credit history, and how to check for signs that [[identity theft]] has occurred. The publication is available online at the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]. Paper copies can also be ordered at no charge for residents of Canada.\n\n===China===\nPrivate companies have developed credit score systems, these systems include [[Sesame Credit]], which is provided by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/china-social-credit-system-ant-financials-sesame-credit-and-others-give-scores-that-go-beyond-fico.html|title=FICO with Chinese characteristics: Nice rewards, but punishing penalties|last=Ming|first=Cheang|date=2017|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tencent|Tencent Credit]]. Part of the government's [[Social Credit System]] uses credit information about citizens.\n\n===Denmark===\nThe credit scoring is widely used in Denmark by the banks and a number of private companies within telco and others. The credit scoring is split in two:\n* Private: The probability of defaulting\n* Businesses: The probability of bankruptcy\nFor privates, the credit scoring is always made by the creditor. For businesses it is either made by the creditor or by a third party.\n\nThere are a few companies who have specialized in developing credit scorecards in Denmark:\n* [[Experian]] (generic rating for business)\n* [[Bisnode]] (generic rating for business)\n\nThe credit scorecards in Denmark are mainly based on information provided by the applicant and publicly available data. It is very restricted by legislation compared to its neighbouring countries.\n\n===Germany===\n\nIn Germany, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nConsumers have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year. At present [[Schufa]], the main provider of credit file data, provides scores for about three-quarters of the German population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9343.html|title=Lecture: Court in the Akten &#124; Sunday &#124; Schedule 35th Chaos Communication Congress|website=fahrplan.events.ccc.de}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], there are four credit information companies licensed by [[Reserve Bank of India]]. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited ([[CIBIL]]) has functioned as a Credit Information Company from January 2001.<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5540&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2010, [[Experian]],<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\"/> [[Equifax]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5598&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> and [[CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services|CRIF High Mark]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6137&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> were given licenses by [[Reserve Bank of India]] to operate as Credit Information Companies in India.\n\nAlthough all the four credit information companies have developed their individual credit scores, the most popular is [[CIBIL]] credit score. The [[CIBIL]] credit score is a three  digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. [[CIBIL]] credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.\n\n===Norway===\nIn [[Norway]], credit scoring services are provided by three credit scoring agencies: [[Dun & Bradstreet]], [[Experian]] and Lindorff Decision. Credit scoring is based on publicly available information such as demographic data, tax returns, taxable income and any ''Betalingsanmerkning'' (non-payment records) that might be registered on the credit-scored individual. Upon being scored, an individual will receive a notice (written or by e-mail) from the scoring agency stating who performed the credit score as well as any information provided in the score. In addition, many credit institutions use custom scorecards based on any number of parameters. Credit scores range between 300 and 999.\n\n===South Africa===\nCredit scoring is used throughout the credit industry in [[South Africa]], with the likes of banks, micro-lenders, clothing retailers, furniture retailers, specialized lenders and insurers all using credit scores.  Currently all four retail [[credit bureau]] offer credit bureau scores.  The data stored by the credit bureaus include both positive and negative data, increasing the predictive power of the individual scores.  [[TransUnion]] (formerly ITC) offer the Empirica Score which is, as of mid-2010, in its 4th generation.  The Empirica score is segmented into two suites: the account origination (AO) and account management (AM).  [[Experian]] South Africa likewise has a Delphi credit score with their fourth generation about to be released (late 2010). In 2011, [[Compuscan]] released Compuscore ABC, a scoring suite which predicts the probability of customer default throughout the credit life cycle. Six years later, Compuscan introduced Compuscore PSY, a 3-digit psychometric-based credit bureau score used by lenders to make informed lending decisions on thin files or marginal declines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.compuscan.co.za/introducing-newest-service-offering-compuscore-psy/|title=Introducing our newest service offering: Compuscore PSY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nAccording to the provisions of Credit Information Bureau Act No 18 of 1990 (as amended by Act No 42 of 2008), [[Credit Information Bureau, Inc.|CRIB]] has been delegated with power to issue credit reports to any subject to whom that information is related to. The Bureau commenced to issue Self Inquiry Credit Reports in December 2009.<ref>[http://www.crib.lk/en/index.php/customer-help-desk/obtain-your-own-credit-report Crib.lk] (Sri Lanks)</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSweden has a system for credit scoring that aims to find people with a history of neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make payments after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish [[Enforcement Authority]] which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning|url=https://www.kronofogden.se/Betalningsanmarkning2.html|website=kronofogden.se|publisher=[[Enforcement Authority]]|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liljemalm|first1=Anna|title=S\u00e5 minskar skulder chansen att f\u00e5 l\u00e4genhet|trans-title=Debts reduce chances to get an apartment|url=http://www.gp.se/ekonomi/1.2618214-sa-minskar-skulder-chansen-att-fa-lagenhet|website=gp.se|publisher=[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]|date=3 February 2015|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIf a person gets an injunction to pay issued by the Enforcement Authority, it is possible to dispute it. Then the party requesting the payment must show its correctness in district court. Failure to dispute is seen as admitting the debt. If the debtor loses the court trial, costs for the trial are added to the debt. Taxes and authority fees must always be paid on demand unless payment has already been made.\n\nEvery person with a Swedish [[national identification number]] must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut [[Christer Fuglesang]] got a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the [[Stockholm congestion tax]]. At the time, he was living in the USA training for his first [[STS-116|Space Shuttle mission]] and had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olsson|first1=Caroline|title=Fuglesang hamnar hos kronofogden|trans-title=Fuglesang at the Swedish Enforcement Administration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11372512.ab|website=aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Credit scorecards}}\nCredit scoring in the United Kingdom is very different to that of the United States and other nations. There is no such thing as a universal credit score or credit rating in the UK. Each lender will assess potential borrowers on their own criteria, and these algorithms are effectively trade secrets.<ref>https://www.equifax.co.uk/resources/loans_and_credit/credit-myths-the-truth-about-credit.html</ref>\n\n\"Credit scores\" which are available for individuals to see and provided from [[Credit Reference Agencies]] such as Call Credit, [[Equifax]], [[Experian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/video/heres-what-your-credit-score-is-according-to-an-experian-executive-14819049|title=Here's What Your Credit Score Is According to an Experian Executive|first=Katherine|last=Ross|date=27 December 2018|website=TheStreet}}</ref> and [[TransUnion]] are marketed to consumers and are not usually used by lenders. Most lenders instead use their own internal scoring mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe most popular statistical technique used is [[logistic regression]] to predict a binary outcome: bad debt or no bad debt.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Some banks also build regression models that predict the amount of bad debt a customer may incur. Typically this is much harder to predict, and most banks focus only on the binary outcome.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated only by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] when used for the purposes of the Advanced approach to Capital Adequacy under [[Basel II]] regulations.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated in the UK, with the industry regulator being the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Consumers can also send complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they experience problems with any Credit Reference Agency.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hulland|first=Louise|title=Credit Reference Agencies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/credit-reference-agency|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIt is very difficult for a consumer to know in advance whether they have a high enough credit score to be accepted for credit with a given lender.  This situation is due to the complexity and structure of credit scoring, which differs from one lender to another.\n\nLenders need not reveal their credit score head, nor need they reveal the minimum credit score required for the applicant to be accepted, because there may not be such a minimum score.\n\nIf the applicant is declined for credit, the lender is not obliged to reveal the exact reason why. However industry associations including the [[Finance and Leasing Association]] oblige their members to provide a satisfactory reason. Credit-bureau data sharing agreements also require that an applicant declined based on credit-bureau data is told that this is the reason and the address of the credit bureau must be provided.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Credit score in the United States}}\nIn the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the [[creditworthiness]] of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills.  A credit score is primarily based on [[credit report]] information, typically from one of the three major [[credit bureau]]s: [[Experian]], [[TransUnion]], and [[Equifax]]. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores. [[FICO score]]s, the most widely used type of credit score, is a credit score developed by [[FICO]], previously known as [[Fair Isaac|Fair Isaac Corporation]].  As of 2018, there are currently 29 different versions of FICO scores in use in the United States. Some of these versions are \"industry specific\" scores, that is, scores produced for particular market segments, including automotive lending and bankcard (credit card) lending. Industry-specific FICO scores produced for automotive lending are formulated differently than FICO scores produced for bankcard lending. Nearly every consumer will have different FICO scores depending upon which type of FICO score is ordered by a lender; for example, a consumer with several paid-in-full car loans but no reported credit card payment history will generally score better on a FICO automotive-enhanced score than on a FICO bankcard-enhanced score. FICO also produces several \"general purpose\" scores which are not tailored to any particular industry. Industry-specific FICO scores range from 250 to 900, whereas general purpose scores range from 300 to 850.\n\nFICO scores are used by many mortgage lenders that use a risk-based system to determine the possibility that the borrower may default on financial obligations to the mortgage lender. For most mortgages originated in the United States, three credit scores are obtained on a consumer: a Beacon 5.0 score (Beacon is a trademark of FICO) which is calculated from the consumer's Equifax credit history, a FICO Model II score, which is calculated from the consumer's Experian credit history, and a Classic04 score, which is calculated from the consumer's Trans Union history.\n\n[[Credit bureau]]s also often re-sell FICO scores directly to consumers, often a general-purpose FICO 8 score. Previously, the credit bureaus also sold their own credit scores which they developed themselves, and which did not require payment to FICO to utilize: [[Equifax]]'s RISK score and [[Experian]]'s PLUS score. However, as of 2018, these scores are no longer sold by the credit bureaus. Trans Union offers a Vantage 3.0 score for sale to consumers, which is a version of the [[VantageScore]] credit score. In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit card issuers, have developed their own proprietary scoring models.\n\nStudies have shown scores to be predictive of risk in the underwriting of both credit and insurance.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/creditscore/creditscore.pdf Report to the Congress on credit scoring and its effects on the availability and affordability of credit]</ref><ref name=insurance>[http://www2.ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf Credit-based insurance scores: Impacts on consumers of automobile insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511204147/http://ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.org/media/presentations/creditscoringtexas/|title=No Evidence of Disparate Impact in Texas Due to Use of Credit Information by Personal Lines Insurers - III|author=|date=|website=iii.org}}</ref>  Some studies even suggest that most consumers are the beneficiaries of lower credit costs and insurance premiums due to the use of credit scores.<ref name=insurance/><ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2003/0203lead.pdf An overview of consumer data and credit reporting]</ref>\n\nNew credit scores have been developed in the last decade by companies such as Scorelogix, [[PRBC (company)|PRBC]], L2C, [[Innovis]] etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIt is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nUsage of credit histories in employment screenings has increased from 19% in 1996 to 42% in 2006.<ref name=wernau>{{cite news|last=Wernau|first=Julie|title=TransUnion battling attempts to ban employment credit checks|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-28/business/ct-biz-0429-credit-checks-transunion--20100428_1_credit-checks-transunion-credit-bureaus|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>{{rp|1}}  However, credit reports for employment screening purposes do not include credit scores.<ref name=wernau />{{rp|2}}\n\nAmericans are entitled to one free credit report in every 12-month period from each of the three credit bureaus, but are not entitled to receive a free credit score. The three credit bureaus run [[Annualcreditreport.com]], where users can get their free credit reports. Credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee. If the consumer disputes an item on a credit report obtained using the free system, under the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/answers/correct-credit-report-errors/en_cp Equifax Credit Report Dispute FAQs] retrieved on 18 December 2008</ref>\n\nAlternatively, consumers wishing to obtain their credit scores can in some cases purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from [[FICO]]. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available free by subscription to one of the many [[credit report monitoring]] services available from the credit bureaus or other third parties, although to actually get the scores free from most such services, one must use a credit card to sign up for a free trial subscription of the service and then cancel before the first monthly charge. Websites like [[WalletHub]], [[Credit Sesame]] and [[Credit Karma]] provide free credit scores with no credit card required, using the [[TransUnion]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Credit.com uses the [[Experian]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Until March 2009, holders of credit cards issued by [[Washington Mutual]] were offered a free FICO score each month through the bank's Web site. ([[Chase (bank)|Chase]], which took over Washington Mutual in 2008, discontinued this practice in March 2009.)<ref>[http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/credit-card-update.asp Chase drops WaMu secured card, FICO score] retrieved on 17 January 2009</ref> [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] resumed the practice of offering a free FICO score in March 2010 of select card members to the exclusion of the majority of former WAMU card holders.\n\nUnder the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], a consumer is entitled to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g., being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken as a result of their credit score. Under the [[Wall Street reform]] bill passed on 22 July 2010, a consumer is entitled to receive a free credit score if they are denied a loan or insurance due to their credit score.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/15/president-obama-final-passage-wall-street-reform-end-bailouts-a-beginning-accountabi President Obama on Final Passage of Wall Street Reform: An End to Bailouts, a Beginning for Accountability] published 15 July 2010, retrieved on 26 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe generic or classic FICO credit score ranges between 300 and 850. The VantageScore 3.0 score ranges from 300-850. The old VantageScore was between 501 and 990.\n\nThe first step to interpreting a score is to identify the source of the credit score and its use. There are numerous scores based on various scoring models sold to lenders and other users. The most common was created by FICO and is called FICO score. [[FICO]] is a publicly traded corporation (under the ticker symbol FICO) that created the best-known and most widely used credit score model in the United States. FICO produces scoring models which are installed at and distributed by the three largest national credit repositories in the U.S (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) and the two national credit repositories in Canada (TransUnion Canada and Equifax Canada).  FICO controls the vast majority of the credit score market in the United States and Canada although there are several other competing players that collectively share a very small percentage of the market.\n\nIn the United States, the [[median]] generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fico.com/en/blogs/tag/score-distributions/|title=Score Distributions|author=|date=|website=FICO}}</ref>  The performance definition of the FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict the likelihood that a consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use.  For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving credit card debt when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.\n\nThe interpretation of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and the economy as a whole.  While 640 has been a divider between \"prime\" and \"subprime\", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated.  In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile.  In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. Furthermore, private mortgage insurance companies will not even provide mortgage insurance for borrowers with scores below 660. Therefore, \"prime\" is a product of the lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower is asking for the loan.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSeveral factors affect individual's credit scores. One factor is the amount an individual borrowed as compared to the amount of credit available to the individual. As an individual borrows, or leverages, more money, the individual's credit score decreases.\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\nCredit Scores in UAE are issued by AECB, a Federal Government-held company. Individual Credit Scores are three-digit numbers used to predict the likelihood of an individual making their loan and credit card payments on time, based on previous credit and payment behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneymall.ae/credit-score/|title=Credit Score in UAE|last=|first=|date=|website=moneymall.ae|publisher='MoneyMall' leading personal finance portal in UAE|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Credit Score number in UAE ranges from 300 to 900. A low score indicates a higher risk, whereas a higher score indicates a lower risk.\n\nIssuer of Credit Score is Al Etihad Credit Bureau.  its a Public Joint Stock Company wholly owned by the UAE Federal Government. As per UAE Federal Law No. (6) of 2010 concerning Credit Information, the company is mandated to regularly collect credit information from financial and non-financial institutions in the UAE.\n\nAl Etihad Credit Bureau aggregates and analyzes this data to calculate Credit Scores and produce Credit Reports that are made available to individuals and companies in the UAE.\n\nCredit Scoring is relatively new in UAE, But All major banks started using the same which shows its high importance hence\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Alternative data]]\n* [[Bank statement]]\n* [[Credit bureau]]\n* [[Credit history]]\n* [[Credit reference]]\n* [[Credit repair software]]\n* [[Credit scorecards]]\n* [[Social Credit System]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre24.shtm|title=FTC Guide to Credit Scores}}\n* {{cite web|title=Credit Scores Video - Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iliZgmqgRRE}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.fcac.gc.ca|title=Financial Consumer Agency of Canada}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/credit-score.htm|title=How Credit Scores Work}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/economic-commentary-archives/2010-economic-commentaries/ec-201016-your-credit-score-is-a-ranking-not-a-score.aspx|title=Your Credit Score Is a Ranking, Not a Score}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Credit Score}}\n[[Category:Credit scoring| ]]\n[[Category:Personal finance]]\n", "name_user": "109.177.195.92", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added info)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score"}

A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility.

At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]].

Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) or [[Biologics License Application]] application for a vaccine.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/><ref name=cdc-vacc/>  If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase,<ref name=fda-ddp/> and the progress of performance in humans &ndash; if a vaccine under development in the United States &ndash; is monitored by the FDA in a \"vaccine approval process.\"<ref name=\"fda-vacc\">{{cite web |title=Vaccine Product Approval Process |url=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-product-approval-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |access-date=21 March 2020 |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Efforts to streamline drug discovery ===\nOver 2018\u201320, new initiatives to stimulate vaccine and antiviral drug development included partnerships between governmental organizations and industry, such as the European [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]],<ref name=\"imi\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imi.europa.eu/about-imi|title=About the Innovative Medicines Initiative|date=2020|publisher=European Innovative Medicines Initiative|access-date=24 January 2020}}</ref> the US ''Critical Path Initiative'' to enhance innovation of drug development,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/science-research/science-and-research-special-topics/critical-path-initiative|title=Critical Path Initiative|date=23 April 2018|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|access-date=24 January 2020}}</ref> and the ''[[Breakthrough Therapy]]'' designation to expedite development and regulatory review of promising candidate drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/breakthrough-therapy|title=Breakthrough Therapy|date=4 January 2018|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|access-date=24 January 2020}}</ref> To accelerate refinement of [[Medical diagnosis|diagnostics]] for detecting COVID-19 infection, a global diagnostic pipeline tracker was formed.<ref name=\"find\">{{cite web|url=https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/pipeline/|title=SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostic Pipeline|date=2020|publisher=Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics|access-date=4 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Clinical trial phases===\n{{Main|Clinical trial}}\n\n[[Clinical trial]] programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=\"aziz\">{{cite web |last=Kaiser J. |first=Aziz | name-list-format = vanc |title=FDA update (2018) \u2013 The FDA's new drug approval process: Development and premarket applications |url=https://drug-dev.com/fda-update-the-fdas-new-drug-approval-process-development-premarket-applications/ |publisher=Drug Development and Delivery |access-date=25 March 2020 |date=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.\n* Phase II trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the NCE.\n* Phase III trials are [[Randomized controlled trial|large, pivotal trials]] to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the COVID-19 infection.

He was executed after being implicated in a plot to dethrone [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]] (r. 1455\u20131468) and restore his predecessor [[Danjong of Joseon|King Danjong]] (r. 1452\u20131455), and is known as one of the ''sayuksin'' (\uc0ac\uc721\uc2e0, the [[six martyred ministers]]) with reference to this plot.\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Korea-Seong Sammun-Calligraphy-01.jpg|thumb|left|A calligraphic work written by Seong Sammun]]\nSeong Sammun was born in [[Hongseong]] (then Hongju), [[South Chungcheong]] province to a [[yangban]] family of the Changnyeong [[Seong]] lineage.  He passed the lower [[gwageo|examination]] at the regular triennial administration in 1438.  He soon gained the favor of [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong]], and was appointed to the [[Hall of Worthies]].   From 1442 to 1446, he cooperated with other members of that body to compose the ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]]'', in which the [[hangul]] alphabet was first presented to the world.  The level of his involvement in the creation of the Korean alphabet [[Hangul]] (and that of other Hall of Worthies scholars) is disputed, although he and other scholars were sent on trips to consult with a [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Chinese]] phoneticist several times, presumably because one of the first uses the new alphabet was put to was to transcribe the sounds of [[hanja]], or Sino-Korean characters.  In 1447, Seong achieved the highest score on the higher literary examination.\n\nIn 1455, Prince Suyang (one of Sejong's sons) forced the young [[Danjong of Joseon|King Danjong]], his nephew, to abdicate, taking the throne instead as [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]]. Following secret orders from his father Seong Seung, Seong Sammun along with [[Bak Jungrim]], [[Bak Paengnyeon]] and others plotted to assassinate the new king and restore King Danjong to the throne. The plot was exposed and the plotters all arrested. Seong Sammun and his father were executed along with other plotters. Before his execution, Seong Sammun condemned the king as a pretender. The ''sayuksin'' and the ''saengyuksin'' (\uc0dd\uc721\uc2e0, the six retainers who lived), who refused to accept King Sejo as the legitimate king, were praised by later generations for holding fast to the Confucian value of staying loyal to the true king.\n\n==Poems for his loyalty==\nHe made several poems during imprisonment and before his execution.

Since 2003, its Australian sites became a joint venture between [[Village Roadshow]] and [[Event Cinemas|Amalgamated Holdings Limited (AHL)]] (Now known as Event Hospitality and Entertainment), forming [[Australian Theatres]]. Previous to this, Village Cinemas was the founding entity of [[parent company]], Village Roadshow from 1954 when the first [[drive-in theatre]] was established, and from 1988 [[Warner Bros.]] owned a third share in the chain.<ref name=\"Ketupa Village\">{{cite web | url=http://ketupa.net/village2.htm | title=Village Roadshow Group: Landmarks | publisher=Ketupa.net | accessdate=8 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403075243/http://ketupa.net/village2.htm | archive-date=3 April 2013 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Ketupa AHL/GU\">{{cite web | url=http://ketupa.net/ahl2.htm | title=AHL and Greater Union: Chronology | publisher=Ketupa.net | accessdate=8 October 2013 }}</ref> The Village Cinemas brand also operates in various forms within some international markets, either as a joint venture with Village Roadshow, or under [[licence]], where they also operate within [[Event Hospitality and Entertainment]]'s [[Event Cinemas|Event Cinemas/Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle]], and many international cinema chains.

The drive-in was adjacent to the shopping strip, Croydon Village; hence the company adopted the 'Village' name. Kirby had already operated traditional indoor cinemas, under the Kirby Theatres name, but the outdoor Village-brand concept was to provide the motor for the company's growth. The original Village Drive-In featured capacity for 454 cars, later being redeveloped to offer features such as a swimming pool and a [[go-cart]] track, as well as a walk-in area for customers without cars. Kirby's company also built and operated a motel facing the theatre.<ref name=\"Ketupa Village\"/><ref name=\"Funding Universe\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/village-roadshow-ltd-history/ | title=Village Roadshow Ltd. History | publisher=Funding Universe | accessdate=25 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nKirby rapidly expanded Village Drive-In Pty Limited through the late 1950s, with the circuit opening in the Melbourne suburbs of [[Rowville, Victoria|Rowville]] and [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]]; Victorian regional areas of [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]], [[Wangaratta]] and [[Stawell, Victoria|Stawell]]; and regional Tasmania in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]. Village also went into its first partnership with [[Greater Union]] to build a [[Geelong]] drive-in, and by the beginning of the 1960s, operated 27 [[drive-in theatres]] throughout the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]]. Village Drive-In Pty Limited then began to expand throughout the rest of Australia, particularly after the company began adding so-called \"hard-top\" (enclosed) cinemas in the 1960s. While drive-ins catered to Australia's suburban and vast regional markets, the hard-top theatres targeted the country's growing inner-city areas where their populations were less reliant on private automobile ownership.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref name=\"Flinders University\">{{cite web | url=http://caarp.flinders.edu.au/company/view/10 | title=Village Roadshow Limited / Village Drive-In Pty Ltd / Village Theatres Limited | publisher=[[Flinders University]] | accessdate=29 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nJoining Roc Kirby in the company's expansion were his sons, Robert and John, who helped out by serving popcorn and soft drinks, and Graham Burke, who commenced with the company in 1960 sweeping floors at one of its theatres. Burke later became integral to the business, joining the Kirbys in Village Roadshow's expansion beyond exhibition. In 1967, the company entered the film distribution side, founding Roadshow Distributors. That operation later grew into Australia's largest, while also adding film production to its portfolio during the 1970s.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\nThe advent of [[home video]] in the late-1970s, however, spelled the end of the drive-in theatres. Although Village Roadshow continued to operate a number of drive-ins until the 1990s, the format itself faded quickly with the growing availability of [[videocassettes]] and [[VCRs]] (the original Croydon drive-in closed in 1990). However, Village Coburg Drive-In, within the inner-Melbourne suburb of [[Coburg North, Victoria|Coburg North]], survived this period and is the last drive-in still operated by Village to this day. However, Village Roadshow responded to these new trends, adding its own video distribution and video rental operations in 1985.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref name=\"Flinders University\"/>\n\nVillage Roadshow responded to another expanding trend, that of the [[multiplex cinema]] in the 1980s and '90s. Multiplexes were a reaction by the movie exhibition industry to the rise of video; the multiplex offered a choice of screenings in a single building, some containing up to 20 screens. Village Roadshow became a pioneer in building and converting its existing single or 'twin' screen cinemas into the multiplex concept, investing in new sound and projection technologies and introducing new features, such as stadium-style seating. By this change in business operations, Village Roadshow and their competitor cinema operators were able to attract audiences back into their theatres and were the forerunners to the multiplexes of today.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\n[[File:WarnerVillageLeicesterSquare.jpg|thumb|right|A former [[Warner Village Cinemas|Warner Village Cinema]] in [[Leicester Square]], in the [[West End of London]], United Kingdom. These cinemas operated from 1996 until 2004, and are now part of the [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]] network of multiplexes.]]\n\nIn 1988, Village Roadshow sold two-thirds in Village Cinemas and entered into an equal [[joint-venture]] partnership with [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Greater Union]] to develop a new chain of multiplex cinemas throughout Australia. The partnership, called the Australian Multiplex Joint Venture, grew quickly through the 1990s, establishing a chain of nearly 30 theatres with nearly 320 screens. The first joint-venture multiplex opened in Melbourne's [[Westfield Airport West|Airport West]] as 'Village Greater Union 8' in 1989.<ref name=\"Ketupa Village\"/><ref name=\"Ketupa AHL/GU\"/><ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref name=\"Flinders University\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/35356 | title=Village Airport West | publisher=Cinema Treasures | accessdate=29 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Village Roadshow added a new retail format from the creation of joint-venture, Village Nine Leisure, with [[Publishing & Broadcasting Limited]] and [[Westfield Holdings]], to open a string of 'virtual entertainment' shops known as, [[Intencity]]. These [[video arcades]] expanded to most states and territories throughout Australia, usually co-locating with most Village Cinema sites in Victoria and Tasmania, and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle sites in other states (replacing some rival Timezone video arcade locations). Village Roadshow wholly acquired the chain in 1999, and since 2005, [[rationalization (economics)|rationalised]] most locations down to the current nine arcades.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intencity.com.au/Footer/About-Intencity.htm|title=About Intencity \u2013 Intencity|work=intencity.com.au}}</ref>\n\nWith the company being led by John and Robert Kirby (who alternated in the chairman's position) and Graham Burke, who undertook the managing director's position, Village Roadshow began expanding its cinemas overseas in the 1990s. This saw [[New Zealand]] (Village Force and Village Rialto) became the company's first foreign market in 1991 after it established its first cinema in [[Manukau]] (the original Village Force cinema closed in late-2008 to open a new Skycity Cinema in [[Westfield Manukau City]], now an [[Event Cinemas|Event Cinema]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.doubleb.co.nz/skycity_cinemas/faq.html | title=Skycity Cinemas: About Us | publisher=Double B Studios | accessdate=4 October 2013 }}</ref> In 1992, the company entered Singapore with Hong Kong-based joint-venture partner, [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]], to form the [[Golden Village]] chain. Golden Village's success in Singapore further fuelled its international expansion in the mid-90s. In 1994, the company entered [[Thailand]] (Entertain Golden Village and Mongkol Golden Harvest), followed by [[Malaysia]] ([[Tanjong Golden Village]] and [[Golden Screen Cinemas]]) in 1995. By 1996, the company was actively expanding its cinema circuit in 20 different markets, including Hong Kong (Golden Village), joining with Orange Sky Golden Harvest again. In Europe, the company's purchase of half ownership in Warner International Theatres gave it a stake in 135 screens within the United Kingdom and 17 more in Germany, forming [[Warner Village Cinemas]]. By the end of 1996, the company had entered [[Fiji]] (Damodar Village Cinemas), [[Hungary]] (Hollywood Cinemas), and [[Argentina]] (Village Cines) as well. Also in 1996, Village Roadshow turned to its shareholders to fund further international expansion, raising $A216&nbsp;million. The company added a number of new foreign markets, including [[Greece]] (Village Cinemas), Italy (Warner Village Cinemas), and [[India]] in 1997 (the Indian operations were a 60/40 joint-venture with local firm, Priya Exhibitors Private Limited to form [[PVR Cinemas]] \u2013 Priya Village Roadshow Limited). In 1998, it also moved into [[Taiwan]] (Golden Village), [[South Korea]] (CJ Golden Village), and France (Village Cinemas).<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref name=\"Village 1999 Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.villageroadshow.com.au/upload/Document/1999_VillageARentire.pdf|title=1999 Annual Report|date=July 1999|work=Village Roadshow Limited|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1997, Village Cinemas and Warner Bros. partnered again to open Australia's first 24-hour cinema in Melbourne's new [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]] complex when it also opened (it reverted to normal cinema hours in 2001). It also included another new type of cinema, four Gold Class auditoriums, a luxury cinema format. By July 1999, Gold Class had already expanded to three auditoriums in Village Cinemas at [[Southland Shopping Centre]]; two at [[Kingsway, Glen Waverley|Century City Walk]]; three at [[Sunshine Marketplace]]; and one at [[The Jam Factory]]. Also by that time, the concept broadened to [[Birch Carroll & Coyle]] sites in [[Brisbane]]; with two screens at [[Indooroopilly Shopping Centre]]; and another two at [[Westfield Garden City|Garden City]].<ref name=\"Village 1999 Report\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/32360 | title=Village Crown Centre 14 | publisher=Cinema Treasures | accessdate=25 September 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cinema In Australia\">{{cite web | url=http://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/docs/SISR_CinemaInAustraliaAnIndustryProfile_June2013.pdf | title=Cinema in Australia | publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]] | accessdate=25 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 1998, the Cinema Europa concept was introduced when three auditoriums were added to the Village Cinemas in The Jam Factory, closely followed by another three screens in Village Southland. As with Gold Class, this type of cinema would later be rolled out across other Village Cinemas in Melbourne before expanding overseas.<ref name=\"Village 1999 Report\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/32317 | title=Village Jam Factory | publisher=Cinema Treasures | accessdate=28 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pvr saket.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[PVR Cinemas|PVR Cinema]] in [[Select Citywalk]], [[Saket District Centre]], within New Delhi.

Village Force, Village Rialto and Hoyts remained separate brands (similar to the Australian arrangements between joint venture partners, Village Cinemas and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle), yet merged back-office operations and marketing, leaving half-a-dozen staff redundant. The ownership structure saw Village Roadshow and Force Corporation keep 25% each, with Hoyts holding the remaining 50%. It was estimated by some business analysts that the combined group controlled more than two-thirds of all box office sales in New Zealand which concerned the [[Commerce Commission]]. However, after months of negotiations and legal threats from the Commission, Village Force and Hoyts jointly announced in September 2000 that they would unwind the new partnership going back to their original ownership structures. Both companies said the courts would have upheld the alliance in the end, but conceded the costs and time required in legal actions meant it was not worth battling the Commerce Commission over the issue. Village Force chief executive, Joe Moodabe told ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', \"there were so many uncertainties and frustrations and the cost as well, it's just time to say, 'We gave it a good shot and let's put it behind us.\" He added that, \"everybody's fed up with the whole thing now and wants to get on with life.\" This left Hoyts NZ to find another head office location, while Force Corporation would later be subject to an acquisition by [[Skycity Entertainment Group]] in March 2001, resulting in the cinema chain being renamed to Village Skycity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villageroadshow.com.au/upload/Document/market_nz_merger.pdf|title=Village Force and Hoyts announce NZ cinema merger|date=23 August 1999|work=Village Roadshow Limited|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villageroadshow.com.au/upload/document/nz_alliance_unwinds.pdf|title=Village Force and Hoyts unwind New Zealand alliance|date=7 September 2000|work=Village Roadshow Limited|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=150567|title=Village Force and Hoyts agree on split|first=Karyn|last=Scherer|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=8 September 2000|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0102/S00094.htm|title=Sky City Intends To Acquire Force Corporation|first=Press|last=Release|work=[[Scoop Independent News]]|date=14 February 2001|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Skycity History\">{{cite web | url=http://ir.skycityentertainmentgroup.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=162796&p=irol-homeprofile_pf | title=Skycity Entertainment Group: Company History | publisher=[[Skycity Entertainment Group]] | accessdate=3 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nYet, the international market remained the company's clear priority as growth opportunities within its home market remained limited. Graham Burke told the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', \"We will be a worldwide entertainment giant \u2013 if we are not already \u2013 in five years.\" By the end of 2000, the Village Cinemas brand had entered a number of new foreign markets, including [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Czech Republic]].<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\nIn early 2001, Village Roadshow's swift international cinema expansion had not convinced investors, and amid falling profits and a floundering share price, the public company was forced to abandon its ambition of establishing a global cinema empire. The company began exiting a number of foreign markets, with plans to drop back to just ten of its more profitable country markets. Village Roadshow also began shedding a number of its other non-core operations at the time while giving greater focus to its film distribution and production arms which included more major co-productions with [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\nIn late 2001, the company continued its international rationalisation, selling off its Swiss and Hungarian theatres. Germany and France followed, and, by the end of 2002, the company had sold off its cinema businesses in Malaysia, India, and Thailand as well. Not all the company's cinema businesses were in regression, however, as the company added extra theatres to its existing chains in the Czech Republic, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom that year.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\nIn early 2003, Burke and the Kirby brothers admitted that they saw Village Roadshow's future chiefly in film production, particularly given the seemingly saturated status of the exhibition market.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/> That year, Warner Bros. sold their 33.3% share in the Australian Multiplex Joint Venture back to [[Village Roadshow]] and Amalgamated Holdings Limited who increased their stakes to 50/50, forming [[Australian Theatres]], the overall owner of Village Cinemas and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle ([[Event Cinemas]] would be later introduced outside Village's Vic/Tas markets in 2009).<ref name=\"Ketupa Village\"/><ref name=\"Ketupa AHL/GU\"/>\n\n[[File:Villagecinemas Andel.jpg|thumb|right|A former Village Cinema on [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|And\u011bl]], Prague, the capitol of the Czech Republic.

They feature mostly [[arthouse]], [[foreign language film|foreign language]], and documentary films (some [[Australian films]] also show within Australian Cinema Europa locations) which are typically not shown in regular/traditional Village Cinema screens. Each Europa location features separate toilets and a [[liquor license|licensed]] lounge bar and caf\u00e9. Some Europa auditoriums are upholstered in blue, as opposed to red in the regular/traditional auditoriums. Village Cinemas' [[Albury]] affiliate, Regent Cinemas, operates a similar brand called, Showcase Cinema which is also upholstered in blue. However, since 2010, Village has scaled back the Cinema Europa brand and stopped staffing and promoting the screens at [[The Jam Factory|Jam Factory]], [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster]] and [[Centro Karingal|Karingal]] although some of these locations are still screening Europa-type films. In Melbourne, [[Rivoli Cinemas (Melbourne)|Rivoli Cinemas]] is used by Village as the main outlet for films with very limited screenings such as, ''[[Frances Ha]]'' and ''[[The Turning (2013 film)|The Turning]]''. In [[Hobart]], the regular Village Cinema at [[Eastlands Shopping Centre|Eastlands]] is occasionally used this way \u2013 it was the only cinema in Tasmania to screen ''[[Spring Breakers]]'' and ''[[Thanks for Sharing]]''. Current Cinema Europa locations are:\n\n* [[Westfield Knox]] ''(Cinema Europa Knox)'' (2 auditoriums)\n* [[Westfield Southland]] ''(Cinema Europa Southland)'' (4 auditoriums)\n* [[VivoCity]] ''([[Golden Village|Cinema Europa VivoCity]])'' (1 auditorium)\n* [[The Mall Athens]] ''(Cinema Europa The Mall)'' (2 auditoriums)\n* [[Palaio Faliro]] ''(Cinema Europa Faliro)'' (1 auditorium)\n* Ambience Mall ''([[PVR Cinemas|Cinema Europa Gurgaon]])''<ref name=\"Malls Market\"/>\n\n===Vmax===\n\nVmax cinemas feature enhanced film display, picture quality and digital sound. The screens at Vmax are all of width 22 metres or greater (the largest being 28 metres at Westfield Knox) and are placed in large auditoriums which feature larger seats, stadium seating and wider armrests. Some locations also feature [[Dolby Atmos]]. The Vmax format is also provided at many [[Event Cinemas|Event Cinemas/Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle]] sites. Village Vmax locations are:\n\n* [[Centro Karingal]] ''(Vmax Karingal)'' (1 auditorium)\n* [[Westfield Knox]] ''(Vmax Knox)'' (1 auditorium, 28m screen)\n* [[Westfield Southland]] ''(Vmax Southland)'' (2 auditoriums)\n* [[Westfield Doncaster]] ''(Vmax Doncaster)'' (1 auditorium, 22m screen)\n* [[Westfield Fountain Gate]] ''(Vmax Fountain Gate)'' (2 auditoriums)\n* Village Cinemas Hobart (1 auditorium)\n* [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]] ''(Vmax Crown)'' (Features Dolby Atmos)\n* [[VivoCity]] ''([[Golden Village|GVmax VivoCity]])'' (1 auditorium, 22.4m screen)\n* [[The Mall Athens]] ''(Vmax The Mall)'' (1 auditorium)\n* [[Palaio Faliro]] ''(Vmax Faliro)'' (1 auditorium)\n* [[Mediterranean Cosmos]] ''(Vmax Mediterranean Cosmos)'' (1 auditorium)\n\n===Coburg Drive-In===\nOpening in November 1965, Coburg is the last Village operated drive-in and one of only three remaining in operation in Victoria. The grand opening night's features were [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' and ''[[McHale's Navy]]''. Today, a variety of blockbusters are projected onto three 33-metre wide screens. Sound is available via FM stereo broadcast. A retro 1950s style diner is also on site, which offers an SMS ordering service, which delivers food and drinks to your car.\n\n===Digital 3D===\nIn early 2011 Village Cinemas Australia converted all of their auditoriums and cinemas to Digital Projectors, seeing traditional film and prints become extinct. The installation of these projectors means that all auditoriums are now [[RealD Cinema]] 3D capable.

Since 2003, its Australian sites became a joint venture between [[Village Roadshow]] and [[Event Cinemas|Amalgamated Holdings Limited (AHL)]] (Now known as Event Hospitality and Entertainment), forming [[Australian Theatres]]. Previous to this, Village Cinemas was the founding entity of [[parent company]], Village Roadshow from 1954 when the first [[drive-in theatre]] was established, and from 1988 [[Warner Bros.]] owned a third share in the chain.<ref name=\"Ketupa Village\">{{cite web | url=http://ketupa.net/village2.htm | title=Village Roadshow Group: Landmarks | publisher=Ketupa.net | accessdate=8 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403075243/http://ketupa.net/village2.htm | archive-date=3 April 2013 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Ketupa AHL/GU\">{{cite web | url=http://ketupa.net/ahl2.htm | title=AHL and Greater Union: Chronology | publisher=Ketupa.net | accessdate=8 October 2013 }}</ref> The Village Cinemas brand also operates in various forms within some international markets, either as a joint venture with Village Roadshow, or under [[licence]], where they also operate within [[Event Hospitality and Entertainment]]'s [[Event Cinemas|Event Cinemas/Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle]], and many international cinema chains.

The drive-in was adjacent to the shopping strip, Croydon Village; hence the company adopted the 'Village' name. Kirby had already operated traditional indoor cinemas, under the Kirby Theatres name, but the outdoor Village-brand concept was to provide the motor for the company's growth. The original Village Drive-In featured capacity for 454 cars, later being redeveloped to offer features such as a swimming pool and a [[go-cart]] track, as well as a walk-in area for customers without cars. Kirby's company also built and operated a motel facing the theatre.<ref name=\"Ketupa Village\"/><ref name=\"Funding Universe\">{{cite web | url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/village-roadshow-ltd-history/ | title=Village Roadshow Ltd. History | publisher=Funding Universe | accessdate=25 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nKirby rapidly expanded Village Drive-In Pty Limited through the late 1950s, with the circuit opening in the Melbourne suburbs of [[Rowville, Victoria|Rowville]] and [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]]; Victorian regional areas of [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]], [[Wangaratta]] and [[Stawell, Victoria|Stawell]]; and regional Tasmania in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]. Village also went into its first partnership with [[Greater Union]] to build a [[Geelong]] drive-in, and by the beginning of the 1960s, operated 27 [[drive-in theatres]] throughout the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]]. Village Drive-In Pty Limited then began to expand throughout the rest of Australia, particularly after the company began adding so-called \"hard-top\" (enclosed) cinemas in the 1960s. While drive-ins catered to Australia's suburban and vast regional markets, the hard-top theatres targeted the country's growing inner-city areas where their populations were less reliant on private automobile ownership.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref name=\"Flinders University\">{{cite web | url=http://caarp.flinders.edu.au/company/view/10 | title=Village Roadshow Limited / Village Drive-In Pty Ltd / Village Theatres Limited | publisher=[[Flinders University]] | accessdate=29 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nJoining Roc Kirby in the company's expansion were his sons, Robert and John, who helped out by serving popcorn and soft drinks, and Graham Burke, who commenced with the company in 1960 sweeping floors at one of its theatres. Burke later became integral to the business, joining the Kirbys in Village Roadshow's expansion beyond exhibition. In 1967, the company entered the film distribution side, founding Roadshow Distributors. That operation later grew into Australia's largest, while also adding film production to its portfolio during the 1970s.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\nThe advent of [[home video]] in the late-1970s, however, spelled the end of the drive-in theatres. Although Village Roadshow continued to operate a number of drive-ins until the 1990s, the format itself faded quickly with the growing availability of [[videocassettes]] and [[VCRs]] (the original Croydon drive-in closed in 1990). However, Village Coburg Drive-In, within the inner-Melbourne suburb of [[Coburg North, Victoria|Coburg North]], survived this period and is the last drive-in still operated by Village to this day. However, Village Roadshow responded to these new trends, adding its own video distribution and video rental operations in 1985.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref name=\"Flinders University\"/>\n\nVillage Roadshow responded to another expanding trend, that of the [[multiplex cinema]] in the 1980s and '90s. Multiplexes were a reaction by the movie exhibition industry to the rise of video; the multiplex offered a choice of screenings in a single building, some containing up to 20 screens. Village Roadshow became a pioneer in building and converting its existing single or 'twin' screen cinemas into the multiplex concept, investing in new sound and projection technologies and introducing new features, such as stadium-style seating. By this change in business operations, Village Roadshow and their competitor cinema operators were able to attract audiences back into their theatres and were the forerunners to the multiplexes of today.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\n[[File:WarnerVillageLeicesterSquare.jpg|thumb|right|A former [[Warner Village Cinemas|Warner Village Cinema]] in [[Leicester Square]], in the [[West End of London]], United Kingdom. These cinemas operated from 1996 until 2004, and are now part of the [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]] network of multiplexes.]]\n\nIn 1988, Village Roadshow sold two-thirds in Village Cinemas and entered into an equal [[joint-venture]] partnership with [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Greater Union]] to develop a new chain of multiplex cinemas throughout Australia. The partnership, called the Australian Multiplex Joint Venture, grew quickly through the 1990s, establishing a chain of nearly 30 theatres with nearly 320 screens. The first joint-venture multiplex opened in Melbourne's [[Westfield Airport West|Airport West]] as 'Village Greater Union 8' in 1989.<ref name=\"Ketupa Village\"/><ref name=\"Ketupa AHL/GU\"/><ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref name=\"Flinders University\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/35356 | title=Village Airport West | publisher=Cinema Treasures | accessdate=29 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Village Roadshow added a new retail format from the creation of joint-venture, Village Nine Leisure, with [[Publishing & Broadcasting Limited]] and [[Westfield Holdings]], to open a string of 'virtual entertainment' shops known as, [[Intencity]]. These [[video arcades]] expanded to most states and territories throughout Australia, usually co-locating with most Village Cinema sites in Victoria and Tasmania, and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle sites in other states (replacing some rival Timezone video arcade locations). Village Roadshow wholly acquired the chain in 1999, and since 2005, [[rationalization (economics)|rationalised]] most locations down to the current nine arcades.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intencity.com.au/Footer/About-Intencity.htm|title=About Intencity \u2013 Intencity|work=intencity.com.au}}</ref>\n\nWith the company being led by John and Robert Kirby (who alternated in the chairman's position) and Graham Burke, who undertook the managing director's position, Village Roadshow began expanding its cinemas overseas in the 1990s. This saw [[New Zealand]] (Village Force and Village Rialto) became the company's first foreign market in 1991 after it established its first cinema in [[Manukau]] (the original Village Force cinema closed in late-2008 to open a new Skycity Cinema in [[Westfield Manukau City]], now an [[Event Cinemas|Event Cinema]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.doubleb.co.nz/skycity_cinemas/faq.html | title=Skycity Cinemas: About Us | publisher=Double B Studios | accessdate=4 October 2013 }}</ref> In 1992, the company entered Singapore with Hong Kong-based joint-venture partner, [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]], to form the [[Golden Village]] chain. Golden Village's success in Singapore further fuelled its international expansion in the mid-90s. In 1994, the company entered [[Thailand]] (Entertain Golden Village and Mongkol Golden Harvest), followed by [[Malaysia]] ([[Tanjong Golden Village]] and [[Golden Screen Cinemas]]) in 1995. By 1996, the company was actively expanding its cinema circuit in 20 different markets, including Hong Kong (Golden Village), joining with Orange Sky Golden Harvest again. In Europe, the company's purchase of half ownership in Warner International Theatres gave it a stake in 135 screens within the United Kingdom and 17 more in Germany, forming [[Warner Village Cinemas]]. By the end of 1996, the company had entered [[Fiji]] (Damodar Village Cinemas), [[Hungary]] (Hollywood Cinemas), and [[Argentina]] (Village Cines) as well. Also in 1996, Village Roadshow turned to its shareholders to fund further international expansion, raising $A216&nbsp;million. The company added a number of new foreign markets, including [[Greece]] (Village Cinemas), Italy (Warner Village Cinemas), and [[India]] in 1997 (the Indian operations were a 60/40 joint-venture with local firm, Priya Exhibitors Private Limited to form [[PVR Cinemas]] \u2013 Priya Village Roadshow Limited). In 1998, it also moved into [[Taiwan]] (Golden Village), [[South Korea]] (CJ Golden Village), and France (Village Cinemas).<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/><ref name=\"Village 1999 Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.villageroadshow.com.au/upload/Document/1999_VillageARentire.pdf|title=1999 Annual Report|date=July 1999|work=Village Roadshow Limited|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1997, Village Cinemas and Warner Bros. partnered again to open Australia's first 24-hour cinema in Melbourne's new [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]] complex when it also opened (it reverted to normal cinema hours in 2001). It also included another new type of cinema, four Gold Class auditoriums, a luxury cinema format. By July 1999, Gold Class had already expanded to three auditoriums in Village Cinemas at [[Southland Shopping Centre]]; two at [[Kingsway, Glen Waverley|Century City Walk]]; three at [[Sunshine Marketplace]]; and one at [[The Jam Factory]]. Also by that time, the concept broadened to [[Birch Carroll & Coyle]] sites in [[Brisbane]]; with two screens at [[Indooroopilly Shopping Centre]]; and another two at [[Westfield Garden City|Garden City]].<ref name=\"Village 1999 Report\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/32360 | title=Village Crown Centre 14 | publisher=Cinema Treasures | accessdate=25 September 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"Cinema In Australia\">{{cite web | url=http://apo.org.au/sites/default/files/docs/SISR_CinemaInAustraliaAnIndustryProfile_June2013.pdf | title=Cinema in Australia | publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]] | accessdate=25 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 1998, the Cinema Europa concept was introduced when three auditoriums were added to the Village Cinemas in The Jam Factory, closely followed by another three screens in Village Southland. As with Gold Class, this type of cinema would later be rolled out across other Village Cinemas in Melbourne before expanding overseas.<ref name=\"Village 1999 Report\"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/32317 | title=Village Jam Factory | publisher=Cinema Treasures | accessdate=28 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pvr saket.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[PVR Cinemas|PVR Cinema]] in [[Select Citywalk]], [[Saket District Centre]], within New Delhi.

Village Force, Village Rialto and Hoyts remained separate brands (similar to the Australian arrangements between joint venture partners, Village Cinemas and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle), yet merged back-office operations and marketing, leaving half-a-dozen staff redundant. The ownership structure saw Village Roadshow and Force Corporation keep 25% each, with Hoyts holding the remaining 50%. It was estimated by some business analysts that the combined group controlled more than two-thirds of all box office sales in New Zealand which concerned the [[Commerce Commission]]. However, after months of negotiations and legal threats from the Commission, Village Force and Hoyts jointly announced in September 2000 that they would unwind the new partnership going back to their original ownership structures. Both companies said the courts would have upheld the alliance in the end, but conceded the costs and time required in legal actions meant it was not worth battling the Commerce Commission over the issue. Village Force chief executive, Joe Moodabe told ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', \"there were so many uncertainties and frustrations and the cost as well, it's just time to say, 'We gave it a good shot and let's put it behind us.\" He added that, \"everybody's fed up with the whole thing now and wants to get on with life.\" This left Hoyts NZ to find another head office location, while Force Corporation would later be subject to an acquisition by [[Skycity Entertainment Group]] in March 2001, resulting in the cinema chain being renamed to Village Skycity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villageroadshow.com.au/upload/Document/market_nz_merger.pdf|title=Village Force and Hoyts announce NZ cinema merger|date=23 August 1999|work=Village Roadshow Limited|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villageroadshow.com.au/upload/document/nz_alliance_unwinds.pdf|title=Village Force and Hoyts unwind New Zealand alliance|date=7 September 2000|work=Village Roadshow Limited|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=150567|title=Village Force and Hoyts agree on split|first=Karyn|last=Scherer|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=8 September 2000|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0102/S00094.htm|title=Sky City Intends To Acquire Force Corporation|first=Press|last=Release|work=[[Scoop Independent News]]|date=14 February 2001|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Skycity History\">{{cite web | url=http://ir.skycityentertainmentgroup.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=162796&p=irol-homeprofile_pf | title=Skycity Entertainment Group: Company History | publisher=[[Skycity Entertainment Group]] | accessdate=3 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nYet, the international market remained the company's clear priority as growth opportunities within its home market remained limited. Graham Burke told the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', \"We will be a worldwide entertainment giant \u2013 if we are not already \u2013 in five years.\" By the end of 2000, the Village Cinemas brand had entered a number of new foreign markets, including [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Czech Republic]].<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\nIn early 2001, Village Roadshow's swift international cinema expansion had not convinced investors, and amid falling profits and a floundering share price, the public company was forced to abandon its ambition of establishing a global cinema empire. The company began exiting a number of foreign markets, with plans to drop back to just ten of its more profitable country markets. Village Roadshow also began shedding a number of its other non-core operations at the time while giving greater focus to its film distribution and production arms which included more major co-productions with [[Warner Bros.]]<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\nIn late 2001, the company continued its international rationalisation, selling off its Swiss and Hungarian theatres. Germany and France followed, and, by the end of 2002, the company had sold off its cinema businesses in Malaysia, India, and Thailand as well. Not all the company's cinema businesses were in regression, however, as the company added extra theatres to its existing chains in the Czech Republic, South Korea, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom that year.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/>\n\nIn early 2003, Burke and the Kirby brothers admitted that they saw Village Roadshow's future chiefly in film production, particularly given the seemingly saturated status of the exhibition market.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\"/> That year, Warner Bros. sold their 33.3% share in the Australian Multiplex Joint Venture back to [[Village Roadshow]] and Amalgamated Holdings Limited who increased their stakes to 50/50, forming [[Australian Theatres]], the overall owner of Village Cinemas and Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle ([[Event Cinemas]] would be later introduced outside Village's Vic/Tas markets in 2009).<ref name=\"Ketupa Village\"/><ref name=\"Ketupa AHL/GU\"/>\n\n[[File:Villagecinemas Andel.jpg|thumb|right|A former Village Cinema on [[And\u011bl (neighborhood)|And\u011bl]], Prague, the capitol of the Czech Republic.

They feature mostly [[arthouse]], [[foreign language film|foreign language]], and documentary films (some [[Australian films]] also show within Australian Cinema Europa locations) which are typically not shown in regular/traditional Village Cinema screens. Each Europa location features separate toilets and a [[liquor license|licensed]] lounge bar and caf\u00e9. Some Europa auditoriums are upholstered in blue, as opposed to red in the regular/traditional auditoriums. Village Cinemas' [[Albury]] affiliate, Regent Cinemas, operates a similar brand called, Showcase Cinema which is also upholstered in blue. However, since 2010, Village has scaled back the Cinema Europa brand and stopped staffing and promoting the screens at [[The Jam Factory|Jam Factory]], [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster]] and [[Centro Karingal|Karingal]] although some of these locations are still screening Europa-type films. In Melbourne, [[Rivoli Cinemas (Melbourne)|Rivoli Cinemas]] is used by Village as the main outlet for films with very limited screenings such as, ''[[Frances Ha]]'' and ''[[The Turning (2013 film)|The Turning]]''. In [[Hobart]], the regular Village Cinema at [[Eastlands Shopping Centre|Eastlands]] is occasionally used this way \u2013 it was the only cinema in Tasmania to screen ''[[Spring Breakers]]'' and ''[[Thanks for Sharing]]''. Current Cinema Europa locations are:\n\n* [[Westfield Knox]] ''(Cinema Europa Knox)'' (2 auditoriums)\n* [[Westfield Southland]] ''(Cinema Europa Southland)'' (4 auditoriums)\n* [[VivoCity]] ''([[Golden Village|Cinema Europa VivoCity]])'' (1 auditorium)\n* [[The Mall Athens]] ''(Cinema Europa The Mall)'' (2 auditoriums)\n* [[Palaio Faliro]] ''(Cinema Europa Faliro)'' (1 auditorium)\n* Ambience Mall ''([[PVR Cinemas|Cinema Europa Gurgaon]])''<ref name=\"Malls Market\"/>\n\n===Vmax===\n\nVmax cinemas feature enhanced film display, picture quality and digital sound. The screens at Vmax are all of width 22 metres or greater (the largest being 28 metres at Westfield Knox) and are placed in large auditoriums which feature larger seats, stadium seating and wider armrests. Some locations also feature [[Dolby Atmos]]. The Vmax format is also provided at many [[Event Cinemas|Event Cinemas/Greater Union/Birch Carroll & Coyle]] sites. Village Vmax locations are:\n\n* [[Centro Karingal]] ''(Vmax Karingal)'' (1 auditorium)\n* [[Westfield Knox]] ''(Vmax Knox)'' (1 auditorium, 28m screen)\n* [[Westfield Southland]] ''(Vmax Southland)'' (2 auditoriums)\n* [[Westfield Doncaster]] ''(Vmax Doncaster)'' (1 auditorium, 22m screen)\n* [[Westfield Fountain Gate]] ''(Vmax Fountain Gate)'' (2 auditoriums)\n* Village Cinemas Hobart (1 auditorium)\n* [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]] ''(Vmax Crown)'' (Features Dolby Atmos)\n* [[VivoCity]] ''([[Golden Village|GVmax VivoCity]])'' (1 auditorium, 22.4m screen)\n* [[The Mall Athens]] ''(Vmax The Mall)'' (1 auditorium)\n* [[Palaio Faliro]] ''(Vmax Faliro)'' (1 auditorium)\n* [[Mediterranean Cosmos]] ''(Vmax Mediterranean Cosmos)'' (1 auditorium)\n\n===Coburg Drive-In===\nOpening in November 1965, Coburg is the last Village operated drive-in and one of only three remaining in operation in Victoria. The grand opening night's features were [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' and ''[[McHale's Navy]]''. Today, a variety of blockbusters are projected onto three 33-metre wide screens. Sound is available via FM stereo broadcast. A retro 1950s style diner is also on site, which offers an SMS ordering service, which delivers food and drinks to your car.\n\n===Digital 3D===\nIn early 2011 Village Cinemas Australia converted all of their auditoriums and cinemas to Digital Projectors, seeing traditional film and prints become extinct. The installation of these projectors means that all auditoriums are now [[RealD Cinema]] 3D capable. Initially the price of the 3D glasses required to watch films in 3D were included in the ticket price, however this has recently changed and the $1 cost of the glasses is being changed separately, making it cheaper for guests as it encourages people to keep and re-use their glasses for future sessions.\n\n==VPremium==\n\nThere are VPremium auditoriums at the following sites:\n\n* Hobart (2 auditoriums)\n* Jam Factory\n* Southland\n\n== 4DX ==\nOn 27 October 2017, the first [[4DX]] screen owned by Village was opened. 4DX allows a motion picture presentation to be augmented with environmental effects such as seat motion, wind, rain, fog, lights, and scents along with the standard video and audio. As such, theaters must be specially designed for and equipped with 4DX technology.\n\nThere are 4DX screens at the following sites:\n\n* Century City\n\n== Partnerships ==\nIn April 2015, BMW Australia and Village Gold Class Cinemas, in joint venture with AHL, announced a partnership where BMW Australia was named as the presenting partner for Village Gold Class Cinemas.
