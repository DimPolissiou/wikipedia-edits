''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment, and that is intolerable-to accept parental failures, force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting oObject in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation, which was to search for a good object, and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model was not a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world, and simultaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once there it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child's needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individual's life.     \n\nOnce these \"bad-object\" memories are dissociated and repressed they become the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote can exacerbate or mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, they will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                    \n\nFairbairn noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\". Once again the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.          \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, of different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents by their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                                    \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here he begins to think about the effects of a Good Object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects (which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway, and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently the patient stubbornly clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through, is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn's 1944 article described his structural theory in terms of six structures, including two conscious structures, '''The Central Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''', and two '''pairs''' of unconscious structures. The unconscious structures are: '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Rejecting object''', and:  '''The Libidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Exciting Object'''. The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates. The simple reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community,as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different than the the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships and there are dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized includes the typical dialogues that were originally in the external world, but now continue in the internal world.  \n\nAs described in previous sections the neglected child solves the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. Prior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>convinced him that  children separated from their families experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. \n\n==== Fairbairn's Structural Model and the Splitting of the Ego ====\nIn families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent called the Rejecting Object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions which was called  the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2010)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego '''relates only to the''' Rejecting Object''',''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent, called the Ideal Object, and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  never develops '''\"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no memory of the other ego state which is repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref> \n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego. A powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn.  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairburn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics. <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment, and that  that the intolerable-to accept parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of  \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the developmental proceeds, the child gradually realizes that is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has been validated by the  millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues.  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought , is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation which was to search for a good object and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's\"challenge\" of the Freudian model was not a problem for the analytic community despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world  and simultaneously forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life.     \n\nOnce these \"bad-object\" memories are dissociated and repressed they become the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, they will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                    \n\nFairbairn noticed that children whom had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" Once again, the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a  loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife..         <blockquote>It become obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that  one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good'. In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so,he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family.. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being  lazy, disrespectful, or of being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that he parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.          \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to  his earlier discussion that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers of different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic.Here, he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated.        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also,and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents by their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5,6,7,8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                                    \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in he same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper which will be described in the next section). The two topics were his theory of treatment and his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the bad object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here, he begins to think about the effects of a good object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects (which ideally should be present in every child's life)  have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved-albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship  with he analyst as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69) .<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn  identifies one of the key mutaive factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus, a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently, the patient stubbornly clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests the Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is  coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and too the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for, when such bad objects are released the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of he chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe\"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released , however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actual reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through is absolutely correct.Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced  divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn's 1944 article described his structural theory in terms of six structures, including two conscious structures, '''The Central Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''', and two '''pairs''' of unconscious structures. The unconscious structures are: '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Rejecting object''', and:  '''The Libidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Exciting Object'''. The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates. The simple reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community,as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different than the the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships and there are dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized includes the typical dialogues that were originally in the external world, but now continue in the internal world.  \n\nAs described in previous sections the neglected child solves the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. Prior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>convinced him that  children separated from their families experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. \n\n==== Fairbairn's Structural Model and the Splitting of the Ego ====\nIn families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent called the Rejecting Object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions which was called  the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2010)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego '''relates only to the''' Rejecting Object''',''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent, called the Ideal Object, and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  never develops '''\"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no memory of the other ego state which is repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref> \n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego. A powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

Lucas also began to change the prequels status relative to the originals; at first, they were supposed to be a \"filling-in\" of history tangential to the originals, but now he saw that they could form the beginning of one long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death.

Photo taken in 1907]]\n\n'''Anti-Qing sentiment''' refers to a sentiment principally held by [[Han_Chinese|Han Chinese]] against the [[Manchu]] ruling class during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636\u20131912), which was accused by a number of opponents of being barbarian. The Qing was accused of destroying traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] culture by forcing Han to wear their hair in a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] style. It was blamed for suppressing Chinese science, [[Qing conquest theory|causing China to be transformed]] from the world's premiere power to a poor, extremely backwards nation teared apart by a club of faraway imperialist powers.

This put Joseon in a dilemma when both [[Nurhaci]] and the Ming requested support. [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting the Ming, a longstanding ally.\n\nIn 1623 King Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by [[Injo of Joseon|King Injo]] (r. 1623\u20131649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters. Reversing his predecessor's foreign policy, the new king decided to support the Ming openly, but a rebellion led by military commander [[Yi Gwal]] erupted in 1624 and wrecked Joseon's military defenses in the north. Even after the rebellion had been suppressed, King Injo had to devote military forces to ensure the stability of the capital, leaving fewer soldiers to defend the northern borders.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\">{{harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=349}}</ref>\n\nThe Manchus invaded Korea twice, in 1627 and 1636, eventually forcing Joseon to sever its ties with the Ming and instead to become a tributary of the Manchus.

Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son [[Ejei Khan]] surrendered to the Qing in 1636 and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, \u89aa\u738b), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in [[Shenyang]] and the [[Kangxi Emperor]] gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.\n\nThe Khalkha Mongols were more reluctant to come under Qing rule, only submitting to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] after they came under an invasion from the Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar Khanate]] under its leader [[Galdan]].\n\nThe Oirat [[Khoshut]] [[Upper Mongols]] in [[Qinghai]] rebelled against the Qing during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] but were crushed and defeated.\n\n[[File:Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue.JPG|thumb|Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue in Ulan-Bator]]\n\nThe Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] in the [[Dzungar Khanate]] offered outright resistance and war against the Qing for decades until they Qing annihilated the Dzungars in the [[Dzungar genocide]]. Khalkha Mongol rebels under Prince [[Ching\u00fcnjav]] had plotted with the Dzungar leader [[Amursana]] and led a rebellion against the Qing at the same time as the Dzungars. The Qing crushed the rebellion and executed Ching\u00fcnjav and his entire family.\n\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution, the Outer Khalkha Mongols staged an uprising against the Qing and expelled the Manchu [[Amban]]s.\n\n=== Taiping Rebellion ===\n{{Main|Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Hong Xiuquan.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Hong Xiuquan as the \"Heavenly King\" (ca. 1860)]]\n\n[[Hong Xiuquan]] was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Chinese who was the leader of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850\u20131864) against the Qing dynasty.

One Qing loyalist observed in the province of [[Hunan]] of the genocidal massacres committed by Taiping forces against the Manchus and wrote of the \"pitiful Manchus\", the Manchu men, women and children who were exterminated by the Taiping with their swords. Once [[Hefei]] capitulated, the Taiping forces rushed into the Manchu quarter shouting \"Kill the demons (Manchus)!\" while exterminating all the Manchus living there.

The Qing was accused of destroying traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] culture by forcing Han to wear their hair in a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] style. It was blamed for suppressing Chinese science, [[Qing conquest theory|causing China to be transformed]] from the world's premiere power to a poor, backwards nation. The people of the [[Eight Banners]] lived off [[Social welfare in China|government pensions]] unlike the general Han civilian population.\n\nThe rallying slogan of anti-Qing activists was \"F\u01cen Q\u012bng f\u00f9 M\u00edng\" (simplified Chinese: \u53cd\u6e05\u590d\u660e; traditional Chinese: \u53cd\u6e05\u5fa9\u660e; literally: \"Oppose Qing and restore [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]\"), related to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] slogan \"Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners\" (\"\u6276\u6e05\u6ec5\u6d0b f\u00fa Q\u012bng mi\u00e8 y\u00e1ng\").\n\nIn the broadest sense, an anti-Qing activist was anyone who engaged in anti-Manchu [[direct action]]. This included people from many mainstream political movements and uprisings, such as [[Taiping Rebellion]], the [[Xinhai Revolution]], the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], the [[Revive China Society]], the [[Tongmenghui]], the [[Panthay Rebellion]], [[White Lotus Rebellion]], and others.\n\n== Ming loyalism in the early Qing ==\n[[File:Zheng Chenggong.JPG|thumb|Statue of Zheng Chenggong on [[Gulangyu Island]] in [[Xiamen]], one of many in mainland China and Taiwan.]]\n\n=== Muslim Ming loyalists ===\n[[Hui people|Hui Muslim]] Ming loyalists under Mi Layin and Ding Guodong fought against the Qing to restore a Ming prince to the throne from 1646\u20131650.

This put Joseon in a dilemma when both [[Nurhaci]] and the Ming requested support. [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting the Ming, a longstanding ally.\n\nIn 1623 King Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by [[Injo of Joseon|King Injo]] (r. 1623\u20131649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters. Reversing his predecessor's foreign policy, the new king decided to support the Ming openly, but a rebellion led by military commander [[Yi Gwal]] erupted in 1624 and wrecked Joseon's military defenses in the north. Even after the rebellion had been suppressed, King Injo had to devote military forces to ensure the stability of the capital, leaving fewer soldiers to defend the northern borders.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\">{{harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=349}}</ref>\n\nThe Manchus invaded Korea twice, in 1627 and 1636, eventually forcing Joseon to sever its ties with the Ming and instead to become a tributary of the Manchus. However, popular opposition to the Manchus remained in Korea. Joseon continued to use the Ming calendar rather than the Qing calendar, and Koreans continued to wear Ming-style clothing and hairstyles, rather than the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]]. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Joseon Koreans saw themselves as continuing the traditions of [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name=\"Holcombe\">{{harvnb|Holcombe|2011|p=176}}</ref>\n\n== Anti-Qing rebellions ==\n\n=== Mongol Rebellions ===\nThe [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Mongols under Qing rule]] were divided into three primary groups- the Inner Mongols, the Outer [[Khalkha Mongols]], and the [[Oirats|Eastern Oirat Mongols]].\n\nThe Inner Mongolian [[Chahar Mongols|Chahar]] Khan [[Ligdan Khan]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son [[Ejei Khan]] surrendered to the Qing in 1636 and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, \u89aa\u738b), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in [[Shenyang]] and the [[Kangxi Emperor]] gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.\n\nThe Khalkha Mongols were more reluctant to come under Qing rule, only submitting to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] after they came under an invasion from the Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar Khanate]] under its leader [[Galdan]].\n\nThe Oirat [[Khoshut]] [[Upper Mongols]] in [[Qinghai]] rebelled against the Qing during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] but were crushed and defeated.\n\n[[File:Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue.JPG|thumb|Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue in Ulan-Bator]]\n\nThe Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] in the [[Dzungar Khanate]] offered outright resistance and war against the Qing for decades until they Qing annihilated the Dzungars in the [[Dzungar genocide]]. Khalkha Mongol rebels under Prince [[Ching\u00fcnjav]] had plotted with the Dzungar leader [[Amursana]] and led a rebellion against the Qing at the same time as the Dzungars. The Qing crushed the rebellion and executed Ching\u00fcnjav and his entire family.\n\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution, the Outer Khalkha Mongols staged an uprising against the Qing and expelled the Manchu [[Amban]]s.\n\n=== Taiping Rebellion ===\n{{Main|Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Hong Xiuquan.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Hong Xiuquan as the \"Heavenly King\" (ca. 1860)]]\n\n[[Hong Xiuquan]] (\u6d2a\u79c0\u5168, H\u00f3ng Xi\u00f9qu\u00e1n) was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Chinese who was the leader of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850\u20131864) against the Qing dynasty.

One Qing loyalist observed in the province of [[Hunan]] of the genocidal massacres committed by Taiping forces against the Manchus and wrote of the \"pitiful Manchus\", the Manchu men, women and children who were exterminated by the Taiping with their swords. Once [[Hefei]] capitulated, the Taiping forces rushed into the Manchu quarter shouting \"Kill the demons (Manchus)!\" while exterminating all the Manchus living there.

He gradually became interested in Western ideas and went to Japan to study in 1901, where he was exposed to radical revolutionary and anti-Manchu ideas.\n\nHere are some quotations of Zou Rong:\n\n\"Sweep away millennia of despotism in all its forms, throw off millennia of slavishness, annihilate the five million and more of the furry and horned Manchu race, cleanse ourselves of 260 years of harsh and unremitting pain\"<br />\n\"I do not begrudge repeating over and over again that internally we are slaves of the Manchus and suffering from their tyranny, externally we are being harassed by the Powers, and we are doubly enslaved.\"<br />\n\"Kill the emperor set up by the Manchus as a warning to the myriad generations that despotic government is not to be revived.\"<br />\n\"Settle the name of the country as the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chss.iup.edu/baumler/zourong.html |title=Zou Rong The Revolutionary Army |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926224557/http://www.chss.iup.edu/baumler/zourong.html |archivedate=2008-09-26 }}</ref>\n\n== Overthrow of the Qing ==\n{{Main|Xinhai Revolution}}\n[[File:Xinhai Revolution in Shanghai.jpg|right|thumb|450px| Celebrations in Nanjing Road, Shanghai during the Xinhai Revolution, 1911]]\n\nThe [[Xinhai Revolution]] ({{zh |c = \u8f9b\u4ea5\u9769\u547d |p = X\u012bnh\u00e0i g\u00e9m\u00ecng}}) of 1911 was catalysed by the triumph of the [[Wuchang Uprising]], when the victorious Wuchang revolutionaries telegraphed the other provinces asking them to declare their independence, and 15 provinces in [[Southern China]] and [[Central China]] did so.<ref>Liu, Haiming.

In places where the earth's crust slowly rises or where mountainous land areas are destroyed for a long time, a plateau is formed. On the Northern slopes of the [[Zailiysky Alatau]] mountains, the [[Mynzhylki]] mountain plateau is located at the source of the [[Malaya Almaatinka]] river at an altitude of 3000 meters above sea level. Translated from the [[Kazakh language]], '''''Means a thousand mares'''''. That is, a place suitable for grazing many horses. From Mynzhylki you can climb to the glaciological station [[Tuyuksu]]-1 (3400 m), to [[Alpengrad]] (3450 m), from where climbers make ascents to the peaks of the [[Maloalmatinsky]] node, to the [[Titova]] pass (3630 m).\n\n==Description==\nIf you walk along the plateau to the final moraine of the Tuyuksu glacier and climb a little along the serpentine, you can see the famous Tuyuksu Horseshoe - the four-thousandth peaks that form the horseshoe. Climate mountain average annual temperature -2.7 degrees, 237 days a year there is snow, precipitation falls 743 millimeters a year. Here, at an altitude of 3020 meters above sea level, the Malaya Almatinsk river is blocked by an anti-settlement dam - a metal mesh filled with stones 17.0 m high, 300 meters long and with a storage capacity of 0.23 million m3. Next to the dam is the hydrometeorological station Mynzh, which has been conducting its observations since 1936. From the dam, it is impossible to see the entire panorama of the circus of the Tuyuksu glacier, because it is closed by a high moraine shaft in the upper reaches of the tract. Only Ordzhonikidze and Tuyuksu peaks are visible. In the North direction from the mynzhilki tract, the rock Bastion of the Yoshkar-Ola peak is visible on the right in the ridge above the road. From the weather station on the trail you can climb to the popular Parking lot called \"Alpingrad\", located in the circus of the glacier M. Mametova at the foot of the peaks of Amangeldy and Pioner.\nIt offers a panorama of the Central part of the Tuyuksu glacier and the Kumbel spur in the West, where the tops of Lokomotiv, Kosmodemyanskaya, Molodezhnaya, and Titova are located. There are three passes in the Kumbel spur: Lokomotiv and Molodezhny, leading to The kumbelsu gorge, and Titova pass, leading to the Gorelnik gorge.\nFrom the Alpingrad Parking lot, through the Pioner and Uchitel passes, you can get to the Bogdanovich glacier, which gives rise to the Sauruksai river, which flows into the Left Talgar river. [[Manshuk Mametova]] pass leads to The left Talgar gorge on the \"Sunny glade\".{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} From the Parking lot \"Alpingrad\" ascents are made to the peaks of Amangeldy, the pioneer-Teacher array, Panfilov Heroes, Manshuk Mametova, Antikainen. Then there is the well-known moraine lake No. 6.\nThe Mynzhylki mountain plateau is located at the source of the Little (Malaya) Almaatinka river, 28 kilometers South of [[Almaty]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The tract is surrounded by Tuyuksu glaciers. To get to mynzhilki, first you need to get to Medeo, then it is convenient to continue on the cable car to cimbulak, and then on foot-5.7&nbsp;km. the Road goes all the way to the plateau, the climb is not steep, starting from the \"Tuyuksu Gate\", it becomes harder to go \u2014 the height and slope increases. The weather, as elsewhere in the mountains, can change suddenly, especially outside the \"Gate\", where tourists are often met by a strong headwind. Above the beginning of the trail to \"Alpingrad\", between the right slope and the moraines of the Tuyuksu glacier, there are two more Parking lots - \"Tashkent\" and\"Black stone\". Parking \"Tashkent\" is a small enclosed grassy area, not blown by the winds. That's why it's warm in the Parking lot. The \"Black stone\" Parking lot is located above and is named after a characteristic large stone of dark color. From these sites, ascents are made to the tops of the Tuyuksu glacier circus, located in the Malo-Almaty spur, or category passes are passed in the Malo-Almaty spur, South of Mametova peak, leading to the Left Talgar gorge.\n\n==Protection and visit==\nThe Ile-Alatau state national natural Park<ref>http://www.ile-alatau.kz</ref> Administration is responsible for the preservation and protection of the monument.

In places where the earth's crust slowly rises or where mountainous land areas are destroyed for a long time, a plateau is formed. On the Northern slopes of the [[Zailiysky Alatau]] mountains, the [[Mynzhylki]] mountain plateau is located at the source of the [[Malaya Almaatinka]] river at an altitude of 3000 meters above sea level. Translated from the [[Kazakh language]], '''''Means a thousand mares'''''. That is, a place suitable for grazing many horses. From Mynzhylki you can climb to the glaciological station [[Tuyuksu]]-1 (3400 m), to [[Alpengrad]] (3450 m), from where climbers make ascents to the peaks of the [[Maloalmatinsky]] node, to the [[Titova]] pass (3630 m).\n\n==Description==\nIf you walk along the plateau to the final moraine of the Tuyuksu glacier and climb a little along the serpentine, you can see the famous Tuyuksu Horseshoe - the four-thousandth peaks that form the horseshoe. Climate mountain average annual temperature -2.7 degrees, 237 days a year there is snow, precipitation falls 743 millimeters a year. Here, at an altitude of 3020 meters above sea level, the Malaya Almatinsk river is blocked by an anti-settlement dam - a metal mesh filled with stones 17.0 m high, 300 meters long and with a storage capacity of 0.23 million m3. Next to the dam is the hydrometeorological station Mynzh, which has been conducting its observations since 1936. From the dam, it is impossible to see the entire panorama of the circus of the Tuyuksu glacier, because it is closed by a high moraine shaft in the upper reaches of the tract. Only Ordzhonikidze and Tuyuksu peaks are visible. In the North direction from the mynzhilki tract, the rock Bastion of the Yoshkar-Ola peak is visible on the right in the ridge above the road. From the weather station on the trail you can climb to the popular Parking lot called \"Alpingrad\", located in the circus of the glacier M. Mametova at the foot of the peaks of Amangeldy and Pioner.\nIt offers a panorama of the Central part of the Tuyuksu glacier and the Kumbel spur in the West, where the tops of Lokomotiv, Kosmodemyanskaya, Molodezhnaya, and Titova are located. There are three passes in the Kumbel spur: Lokomotiv and Molodezhny, leading to The kumbelsu gorge, and Titova pass, leading to the Gorelnik gorge.\nFrom the Alpingrad Parking lot, through the Pioner and Uchitel passes, you can get to the Bogdanovich glacier, which gives rise to the Sauruksai river, which flows into the Left Talgar river. [[Manshuk Mametova]] pass leads to The left Talgar gorge on the \"Sunny glade\".{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} From the Parking lot \"Alpingrad\" ascents are made to the peaks of Amangeldy, the pioneer-Teacher array, Panfilov Heroes, Manshuk Mametova, Antikainen. Then there is the well-known moraine lake No. 6.\nThe Mynzhylki mountain plateau is located at the source of the Little (Malaya) Almaatinka river, 28 kilometers South of [[Almaty]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The tract is surrounded by Tuyuksu glaciers. To get to mynzhilki, first you need to get to Medeo, then it is convenient to continue on the cable car to cimbulak, and then on foot-5.7&nbsp;km. the Road goes all the way to the plateau, the climb is not steep, starting from the \"Tuyuksu Gate\", it becomes harder to go \u2014 the height and slope increases. The weather, as elsewhere in the mountains, can change suddenly, especially outside the \"Gate\", where tourists are often met by a strong headwind. Above the beginning of the trail to \"Alpingrad\", between the right slope and the moraines of the Tuyuksu glacier, there are two more Parking lots - \"Tashkent\" and\"Black stone\". Parking \"Tashkent\" is a small enclosed grassy area, not blown by the winds. That's why it's warm in the Parking lot. The \"Black stone\" Parking lot is located above and is named after a characteristic large stone of dark color. From these sites, ascents are made to the tops of the Tuyuksu glacier circus, located in the Malo-Almaty spur, or category passes are passed in the Malo-Almaty spur, South of Mametova peak, leading to the Left Talgar gorge.\n\n==Protection and visit==\nThe Ile-Alatau state national natural Park<ref>http://www.ile-alatau.kz</ref> Administration is responsible for the preservation and protection of the monument. It has a favorable acoustic environment (silence, melodic sounds in nature). Recommended visiting periods: may - October.

Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a [[Italian Jews|Jewish Italian]] bookshop owner, who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a [[Nazi concentration camp]]. The film was partially inspired by the book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'' by [[Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec]] and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in a German labour camp during [[World War II]].\n\nThe film grossed over $230 million worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of highest-grossing non-English films|highest-grossing non-English language movies of all time]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.wonderslist.com/10-highest-grossing-non-english-movies/\n|title=Top 10 Highest Grossing Non-English Movies of All Time\n|last=John\n|first=Adriana\n|date=\n|website=Wonderslist\n|publisher=\n|access-date=January 7, 2018\n}}</ref> and received widespread acclaim (despite some criticisms of using the subject matter for comedic purposes). It won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]], nine [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]] (including [[David di Donatello for Best Film|Best Film]]), five [[Nastro d'Argento]] Awards in Italy, two [[European Film Awards]], and three [[71st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Benigni).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1939, in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], Guido Orefice is a young [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish]] man who arrives to work in the city (Arezzo, in Tuscany) where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fianc\u00e9 and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosu\u00e8, and run a bookstore.\n\nWhen [[World War II]] breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosu\u00e8 are seized on Giosu\u00e8's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a [[concentration camp]]. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages\u2014symbolic or literal\u2014to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a [[gas chamber]] shortly after their arrival. Giosu\u00e8 narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.\n\nIn the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosu\u00e8 that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosu\u00e8 is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. At one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosu\u00e8 that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosu\u00e8 is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosu\u00e8 are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian.\n\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosu\u00e8 one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosu\u00e8 emerges from the sweat-box, just as a [[United States Army|US Army]] unit led by a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosu\u00e8 is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosu\u00e8 to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosu\u00e8 soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosu\u00e8 excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosu\u00e8, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Guido Orefice\n* [[Nicoletta Braschi]] as Dora Orefice\n* [[Giorgio Cantarini]] as Giosu\u00e8 Orefice\n* [[Giustino Durano]] as Uncle Eliseo\n* [[Horst Buchholz]] as Doctor Lessing\n* [[Marisa Paredes]] as Dora's mother\n* [[Sergio Bustric]] as Ferruccio\n* [[Amerigo Fontani]] as Rodolfo\n* [[Lydia Alfonsi]] as Guicciardini\n* [[Giuliana Lojodice]] as the Headmistress\n* [[Pietro Desilva]] as Bartolomeo\n* [[Francesco Guzzo]] as Vittorino\n* [[Raffaella Lebboroni]] as Elena\n* [[Claudio Alfonsi]] as Amico Rodolfo\n* [[Gil Baroni]] as the Prefect\n* [[Ennio Consalvi]] as General Graziosi\n* [[Aaron Craig (actor)|Aaron Craig]] as the tank driver\n* [[Alfiero Falomi]] as [[Victor Emmanuel III |King of Italy]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Badia delle sante flora e lucilla, arezzo, 02.JPG|thumb|The film was shot in [[Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]], including by the [[Badia delle Sante Flora e Lucilla]].]]\nDirector [[Roberto Benigni]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Vincenzo Cerami]], was inspired by the story of [[Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec]] and his book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'', which incorporates elements of irony and [[black comedy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |title=Life Is Beautiful Nazi death camp survivor dies aged 91 |last=Squires |first=Nick |date=11 July 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323074652/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |archive-date=23 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Salmoni was an Italian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, survived and was reunited with his parents, but found his brothers were murdered.

directed by and starring [[Roberto Benigni]], who co-wrote the film with [[Vincenzo Cerami]]. Benigni plays Guido Orefice, a [[Italian Jews|Jewish Italian]] bookshop owner, who employs his fertile imagination to shield his son from the horrors of internment in a [[Nazi concentration camp]]. The film was partially inspired by the book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'' by [[Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec]] and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in a German labour camp during [[World War II]].\n\nThe film was a critical and financial success.

It won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]], nine [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Awards]] (including [[David di Donatello for Best Film|Best Film]]), five [[Nastro d'Argento]] Awards in Italy, two [[European Film Awards]], and three [[71st Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Benigni).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1939, in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], Guido Orefice is a young [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish]] man who arrives to work in the city (Arezzo, in Tuscany) where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fianc\u00e9 and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosu\u00e8, and run a bookstore.\n\nWhen [[World War II]] breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosu\u00e8 are seized on Giosu\u00e8's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a [[concentration camp]]. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages\u2014symbolic or literal\u2014to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a [[gas chamber]] shortly after their arrival. Giosu\u00e8 narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.\n\nIn the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosu\u00e8 that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosu\u00e8 is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. At one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosu\u00e8 that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosu\u00e8 is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosu\u00e8 are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say \"Thank you\" in Italian.\n\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosu\u00e8 one last time and winks, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosu\u00e8 emerges from the sweat-box, just as a [[United States Army|US Army]] unit led by a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosu\u00e8 is overjoyed about winning the game (unaware that his father is dead), thinking that he won the tank, and an American soldier allows Giosu\u00e8 to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosu\u00e8 soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosu\u00e8 excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosu\u00e8, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him and his story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Roberto Benigni]] as Guido Orefice\n* [[Nicoletta Braschi]] as Dora Orefice\n* [[Giorgio Cantarini]] as Giosu\u00e8 Orefice\n* [[Giustino Durano]] as Uncle Eliseo\n* [[Horst Buchholz]] as Doctor Lessing\n* [[Marisa Paredes]] as Dora's mother\n* [[Sergio Bustric]] as Ferruccio\n* [[Amerigo Fontani]] as Rodolfo\n* [[Lydia Alfonsi]] as Guicciardini\n* [[Giuliana Lojodice]] as the Headmistress\n* [[Pietro Desilva]] as Bartolomeo\n* [[Francesco Guzzo]] as Vittorino\n* [[Raffaella Lebboroni]] as Elena\n* [[Claudio Alfonsi]] as Amico Rodolfo\n* [[Gil Baroni]] as the Prefect\n* [[Ennio Consalvi]] as General Graziosi\n* [[Aaron Craig (actor)|Aaron Craig]] as the tank driver\n* [[Alfiero Falomi]] as [[Victor Emmanuel III |King of Italy]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Badia delle sante flora e lucilla, arezzo, 02.JPG|thumb|The film was shot in [[Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]], including by the [[Badia delle Sante Flora e Lucilla]].]]\nDirector [[Roberto Benigni]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Vincenzo Cerami]], was inspired by the story of [[Rubino Romeo Salmon\u00ec]] and his book ''In the End, I Beat Hitler'', which incorporates elements of irony and [[black comedy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |title=Life Is Beautiful Nazi death camp survivor dies aged 91 |last=Squires |first=Nick |date=11 July 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2016 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323074652/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/8631266/Life-Is-Beautiful-Nazi-death-camp-survivor-dies-aged-91.html |archive-date=23 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Salmoni was an Italian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz, survived and was reunited with his parents, but found his brothers were murdered.

Pop music, on the other hand, has primarily come into usage to describe music that evolved out of the [[rock 'n roll]] revolution of the mid-1950s and continues in a definable path to today.}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nAccording to author John Storey, there are various definitions of popular culture.<ref>John Storey. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRN59zg9t9AC ''Cultural Theory and Popular Culture''], pp. 4\u20138</ref> The [[quantitative property|quantitative]] definition of culture has the problem that much \"[[high culture]]\" (e.g., [[television]] dramatizations of [[Jane Austen]]) is also \"popular.\" \"Pop culture\" is also defined as the culture that is \"leftover\" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Charles Dickens]],[[Leo Tolstoy]], and [[George Orwell]].\n\nA third definition equates pop culture with \"[[mass culture]]\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, [[mass production|mass-produced]] for mass consumption by [[mass media]].<ref>S\u00e9rgio Campos Gon\u00e7alves, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20190127163020/https://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/ea000713.pdf Cultura e Sociedade de Consumo: um olhar em retrospecto]\", InRevista \u2013 N\u00facleo de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica em Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 UNAERP (Ribeir\u00e3o Preto), v. 3, pp. 18\u201328, 2008, {{ISSN|1980-6418}}.</ref> From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\"{{page needed|date=August 2012}} Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; [[Neo-Gramscianism#Hegemony|neo-Gramscian hegemony]] theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A [[postmodern]]ist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"\n\nStorey claims that popular culture emerged from the [[urbanization]] of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}\n\nPopular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Levels===\nWithin the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>\n\n===Folklore===\nAdaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A.

With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.\n\nAlthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves. \n\n== Criticism ==\nMany people say that popular culture is a tool that higher-ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Postmodernist Baudrillard argued that the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion, since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful. Baudrillard stated in an interview: \n\"The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction. Basically, its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself. On this point it is worth recalling Marshall McLuhan: the medium is the message.

Studies of [[Shakespeare]] (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in [[Renaissance]] popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like [[Dario Fo]] and [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]] use popular culture in its [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the [[commedia dell'arte]] for example).<ref>{{ill|Robert Weimann|de}}, ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition'' (1967)</ref><ref>Robert Shaughnessy, ''The Cambridge companion to Shakespeare and popular culture'' (2007) p. 24</ref>{{qn|date=August 2012}}\n\nPopular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in [[Cultural heritage tourism|place]] and [[Contemporary history|time]]. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a [[subculture]], representing perspectives with which the [[mainstream]] popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the [[Germany|German]] researcher [[Ronald Daus]], who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in [[North America]], [[Asia]], and especially in [[Latin America]].\n\n===Levels===\nWithin the realm of popular culture, there exists a [[organizational culture]]. From its beginning, popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push-back between them. Within popular culture, there are three levels that have emerged, high and low. ''High'' culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value, historically, aesthetically and socially. ''Low'' culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes, historically.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danesi |first=Marcel |author-link= |date=2018-07-12 |title=Popular Culture: Introductory Perspectives |url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/tamucs/reader.action?docID=5430391 |location=TAMU Libraries |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |page=6,7 |isbn=9781538107447}}</ref>\n\n===Folklore===\nAdaptations based on traditional [[folklore]] provide a source of popular culture.<ref>On the Ambiguity of the Three Wise Monkeys A. W. Smith ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'', Vol. 104, No. 1/2 (1993), pp. 144\u2013150</ref>\nThis early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today, in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of [[joke]]s or [[urban legend]]s. With the widespread use of the [[Internet]] from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and [[word-of-mouth]] has become blurred.\n\nAlthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the [[commerce|commercial]] element, communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by [[word of mouth|word-of-mouth]], and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves. \n\n== Criticism ==\nMany people say that popular culture is a tool that higher-ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/popular-culture-definition-3026453|title=How Did Pop Culture Originate?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Postmodernist Baudrillard argued that the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion, since they are still complicit in a system controlled by the powerful. Baudrillard stated in an interview: \n\"The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower, like we see today, and then collaborates in its refraction. Basically, its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself. On this point it is worth recalling Marshall McLuhan: the medium is the message.

Named \"the culinary oracle of 100 cookbooks\" by noted American restaurant critic and journalist, [[Gael Greene]], Chalmers was recognized as the pioneer of the single subject cookbook. Her life story revealed an unlikely journey to becoming a ''James Beard Foundation \"Who's Who\" of Food and Beverage in America''<ref>[http://www.jamesbeard.org/search/site/Irena+Chalmers/ James Beard Foundation \"Who's Who\"]<</ref> 1988 Award Recipient.\n\nHer cause of death was esophageal cancer. At the time of her death, she was working on her memoir, ''Spilling The Beans.''\n\n \n\n==Biography==\n\nChalmers began her career as a nurse and midwife. After completing her graduate work at the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery|Neurological Institute]] in Queens Square, London, she moved to the [[United States]] in 1959 to teach [[neuroanatomy]] and [[neurophysiology]] at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital's [[Neurological Institute of New York]].\n\nReturning briefly to London to attend the Le Cordon Bleu London<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcblondon.com/|title=Le Cordon Bleu London|publisher=}}</ref> (originally, the London Cordon Bleu School of Cookery), Chalmers opened her own cooking school first in Baltimore, MD, then in Greensboro, NC. She went on to become a gourmet shop owner and wine importer, pioneer author of the single subject cookbook, awarding-winning publisher, restaurant consultant, adjunct professor, columnist and mentor. Renowned for her wit and captivating insights, she continues to be a frequent commentator and keynote speaker on food and food trends. Her work has appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Food & Wine]]'', ''[[Gourmet Magazine|Gourmet]]'', ''[[Gastronomica]]'', ''Food Arts'' and ''[[Nation's Restaurant News]]''.\n\nChalmers was a food essayist, ''The Last Word'' columnist for ''Chef Magazine'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chefmagazine.com/digital.htm |title=''Chef Magazine'' |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083901/http://www.chefmagazine.com/digital.htm |archive-date=2015-11-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as well as a commentator on [[WAMC]]/Northeast Public Radio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wamc.org/|title=WAMC - Northeast Public Radio|publisher=}}</ref> while serving as a consultant, food blogger,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodjobsbook.com/blog/|title=Blogging - Food Jobs by Irena Chalmers|date=20 February 2012|publisher=}}</ref> and mentor to many embarking on their culinary adventures.

This cooking demonstration led to the publication of a 48-page ''Fondue'' cookbook, ''Chocolate Surprises'' cookbook and the creation of Potpourri Press.\n\nChalmers then wrote other specialty food cookbooks, including the first microwave cookbook for Litton, the first ice cream cookbook for [[Donvier]] ice cream machines and several cookbooks commissioned by Le Creuset. The most successful of these small books was ''[https://diatropebooks.com/chalmers-i-napkin-folds/ Napkin Folds]'' for the Lillian Vernon catalog, responsible for sales of more than one million copies. Estimated total sales of the small cookbooks exceeded seven million copies worldwide.\n\nAs an editor, publisher and packager, Chalmers oversaw and contributed to many award-winning titles, successful cookbook series and food guides, including: the 'Round the World cookbooks (8 million copies sold); The Great American Cooking Schools 12-book series (designed by renowned graphic designer, [[Milton Glaser]]), winner of the Art Directors Club Award and eight R.

Named \"the culinary oracle of 100 cookbooks\" by noted American restaurant critic and journalist, [[Gael Greene]], Chalmers was recognized as the pioneer of the single subject cookbook. Her life story revealed an unlikely journey to becoming a ''James Beard Foundation \"Who's Who\" of Food and Beverage in America''<ref>[http://www.jamesbeard.org/search/site/Irena+Chalmers/ James Beard Foundation \"Who's Who\"]<</ref> 1988 Award Recipient.\n\nHer cause of death was esophageal cancer. At the time of her death, she was working on her memoir, ''Spilling The Beans.''\n\n \n\n==Biography==\n\nChalmers began her career as a nurse and midwife. After completing her graduate work at the [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery|Neurological Institute]] in Queens Square, London, she moved to the [[United States]] in 1959 to teach [[neuroanatomy]] and [[neurophysiology]] at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital's [[Neurological Institute of New York]].\n\nReturning briefly to London to attend the Le Cordon Bleu London<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lcblondon.com/|title=Le Cordon Bleu London|publisher=}}</ref> (originally, the London Cordon Bleu School of Cookery), Chalmers opened her own cooking school first in Baltimore, MD, then in Greensboro, NC. She went on to become a gourmet shop owner and wine importer, pioneer author of the single subject cookbook, awarding-winning publisher, restaurant consultant, adjunct professor, columnist and mentor. Renowned for her wit and captivating insights, she continues to be a frequent commentator and keynote speaker on food and food trends. Her work has appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Food & Wine]]'', ''[[Gourmet Magazine|Gourmet]]'', ''[[Gastronomica]]'', ''Food Arts'' and ''[[Nation's Restaurant News]]''.\n\nChalmers was a food essayist, ''The Last Word'' columnist for ''Chef Magazine'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chefmagazine.com/digital.htm |title=''Chef Magazine'' |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108083901/http://www.chefmagazine.com/digital.htm |archive-date=2015-11-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> as well as a commentator on [[WAMC]]/Northeast Public Radio,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wamc.org/|title=WAMC - Northeast Public Radio|publisher=}}</ref> while serving as a consultant, food blogger,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodjobsbook.com/blog/|title=Blogging - Food Jobs by Irena Chalmers|date=20 February 2012|publisher=}}</ref> and mentor to many embarking on their culinary adventures. She retired from [[The Culinary Institute of America]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciachef.edu/|title=The Culinary Institute of America : The World's Premier Culinary College|publisher=}}</ref> after teaching Professional Food Writing, Food Jobs and Gastronomy for nearly 16 years. Chalmers died on April 4, 2020.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/irena.chalmers/posts/2503957459708464?__tn__=-R]</ref>\n\n==Author and publisher==\n\nIn 1968, when faced with how to get rid of six fondue pots languishing in her cooking school/wine and cheese shop, La Bonne Femme, Chalmers demonstrated the 'fine art' of melting cheese. This cooking demonstration led to the publication of a 48-page ''Fondue'' cookbook, ''Chocolate Surprises'' cookbook and the creation of Potpourri Press.\n\nChalmers then wrote other specialty food cookbooks, including the first microwave cookbook for Litton, the first ice cream cookbook for [[Donvier]] ice cream machines and several cookbooks commissioned by Le Creuset. The most successful of these small books was ''Napkin Folds'' for the Lillian Vernon catalog, responsible for sales of more than one million copies. Estimated total sales of the small cookbooks exceeded seven million copies worldwide.\n\nAs an editor, publisher and packager, Chalmers oversaw and contributed to many award-winning titles, successful cookbook series and food guides, including: the 'Round the World cookbooks (8 million copies sold); The Great American Cooking Schools 12-book series (designed by renowned graphic designer, [[Milton Glaser]]), winner of the Art Directors Club Award and eight R. T. French Tastemaker Awards; Books by Cooks, a 24-book series; and the Creative Cook volumes. Chalmers was the first to publish the work of many American culinary leaders, among them: ''Romantic & Classic Cakes'' by Rose Levy Beranbaum, ''American Food & California Wine'' by Barbara Kafka, ''Quiche & P\u00e2t\u00e9'' by Peter Kump and ''Christmas Feasts from History'' by Lorna Sass.
