Retrieved July 18, 2014.</ref>\n}}\n'''''American Hot Wax''''' is a 1978 [[biographical film]] directed by [[Floyd Mutrux]] with a screenplay [[John Kaye (screenwriter)|John Kaye]] from a story by [[Art Linson]]. The film tells the story of pioneering [[disc jockey]] [[Alan Freed]], who in the 1950s helped introduce and popularize [[rock and roll]], and is often credited with coining the term \"Rock 'n' Roll.\" The film starred [[Tim McIntire]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Laraine Newman]], [[Jeff Altman]], and [[Moosie Drier]]. It also featured musical performances by [[Chuck Berry]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Frankie Ford]], [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], and [[Brooklyn Dreams (group)|Brooklyn Dreams]] as \"Professor La Plano and The Planotones\". The film was not a box-office success.\n  \n[[A&M Records]] released a two-record [[soundtrack album]] featuring the Brooklyn Paramount performances from the movie on record one (in stereo) and original recordings used throughout the film on record two (all in mono). The soundtrack reached number 31 on the ''Billboard'' charts, leaving some to wonder {{who|date = September 2018}} just how that was possible with such meager public exposure.\n\nProducer [[Art Linson]] discusses the movie's production and failure at the box office in his book ''What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn late-1950s New York City, WROL disc jockey Alan Freed (Tim McIntire) promotes his upcoming rock n' roll show at the [[Brooklyn Paramount Theater]], headlined by Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. Freed's radio program is hugely popular with teenagers, and the Paramount show is expected to sell out, despite concern that the police will shut it down as they did with Freed's previous show in Boston. Local law enforcement, led by D.A. Coleman (John Lehne), targets Freed for allegedly inciting teenagers to wild and immoral behavior by broadcasting raucous and sexually suggestive rock n' roll songs, many of them by black musicians. WROL station management also dislike Freed's unconventional programming habits, including playing songs that the station has banned such as [[Tutti Frutti (song)|\"Tutti Frutti\"]] by [[Little Richard]]. Freed nevertheless rejects all suggestions that he change his programming style and feature more socially acceptable musical acts, such as [[Pat Boone]]. He also refuses to sign a statement declaring that he never accepted anything in return for playing a record, on the grounds that signing it would be a lie and that all disc jockeys, including those who have signed the statement, take such bribes. \n\nBecause Freed has the power to make a record a hit by playing it on his show, he is constantly besieged by record promoters and artist managers.  He avoids most of these people, but takes an interest in those who share his love for rock n' roll. He repeatedly rebuffs the aggressive record promoter Lennie Richfield (Jeff Altman), but is kind to Artie Moress (Moosie Drier), a young boy who is the president of a [[Buddy Holly]] fan club, and even puts Artie on the air to talk about his idol Holly. Freed also encourages Louise (Laraine Newman), a white teenage songwriter whose parents ignore her talent and disapprove of her associating with the Chesterfields, a black [[doo-wop]] group who perform her songs. Freed himself suffers discrimination when he takes a racially mixed group of teenagers with him to look at a luxury home he wants to buy; the owner refuses to sell to him at any price. Freed's own father back in [[Akron, Ohio]] also rejects him, returning a check Freed sent him and refusing to talk on the telephone with his son. \n\nThe Paramount show goes on despite Coleman's attempts to stop it, including a failed attempt at a drug bust. Louise is moved to tears after the Chesterfields, a late addition to the show, perform her songs to thunderous applause from the capacity crowd. Freed's feisty young secretary Sheryl (Fran Drescher) and his chauffeur Mookie (Jay Leno), who have constantly bickered on the job, finally bond over their shared love of Freed and rock n' roll, and begin a romance. Mid-show, [[IRS]] agents appear and seize all the proceeds from the box office, leaving Freed with no money to pay his artists. However, Chuck Berry saves the day by doing Freed the favor of performing for free. Jerry Lee Lewis, who initially had said he was not coming, then arrives at the last minute and closes the show as the police try to shut it down because teenagers are \"dancing in the aisles\". As the police begin clearing the theater with Lewis still performing onstage, chaos breaks out and the film abruptly ends, with an epilogue stating that this was Freed's last performance, and that he was taken off the air, indicted, moved to California, and died five years later, penniless, but that rock n' roll lives on.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tim McIntire]]\u2014[[Alan Freed]]\n*[[Fran Drescher]]\u2014Sheryl\n*[[Jay Leno]]\u2014Mookie (Michael)\n*[[Laraine Newman]]\u2014Teenaged Louise\n*[[Moosie Drier]]\u2014Artie Moress\n*[[Jeff Altman]]\u2014Lennie Richfield\n*John Lehne\u2014D.A.

So she, along with Artemis, [[Mulch Diggums]], and Commander Julius Root are informed by [[Foaly]] that [[Opal Koboi]] and [[List of characters in Artemis Fowl#C|Briar Cudgeon]] are behind the uprising. They break into Koboi Laboratories, where Cudgeon is killed and Koboi is incapacitated. After the goblins are contained, she travels to Murmansk to rescue Artemis's father, as they previously agreed in return for Artemis's help in capturing Cudgeon and Koboi.\n\n===In ''The Eternity Code''===\nIn ''[[Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code]]'', Artemis requests Holly's help to heal Domovoi Butler and retrieve his [[List of concepts in Artemis Fowl#C Cube|C Cube]] from American businessman [[Jon Spiro#Jon Spiro|Jon Spiro]]. Together with [[Mulch Diggums]], [[Juliet Butler]], and [[Foaly]] directing technological elements of the mission, they break into the Spiro Needle and retrieve the Cube. Artemis is mind wiped at the end of the mission under the directions of Julius Root.\n\n===In ''The Opal Deception''===\nIn ''[[Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception]]'', Holly is with Commander Root, a paternal figure to her, when [[Opal Koboi]] kills him. She is subsequently framed for the Commander's death and is forced to flee from fairy authorities. She later collaborates with Artemis Fowl, Butler, and Mulch Diggums to expose Koboi and prevent her plans for destroying [[Fairy (Artemis Fowl)|fairy]] civilization. Koboi is locked up in a secure facility. At the end of the book, Holly resigns from the [[Lower Elements Police|LEP]].\n\n===In ''The Lost Colony''===\nIn ''[[Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony]]'', Holly is working as a private detective since her resignation from the LEP, along with Mulch Diggums. Though it was not going well and now they are bounty hunters, which are considered even less trustworthy then the criminals they track. Holly is informed about the [[Demon (Artemis Fowl)|demon]] race, a species of fairy that left earth and are now inhabiting an island in Limbo between earth and time, and is recruited to [[Section Eight (Artemis Fowl)|Section Eight]], which monitors them. When it becomes apparent that Artemis has encountered a demon, they encounter Minerva Paradizo, another child genius who has managed to obtain a demon, and the deranged Billy Kong. Artemis and Holly, along with two demons, [[List of characters in Artemis Fowl#N|\u21161]] and [[List of characters in Artemis Fowl#Q|Qwan]], are forced to go to Hybras to save demon civilization.

The pair are forced to outwit Artemis's younger self and Damon Kronski, president of the \"Extinctionists\" organization. They eventually encounter [[Opal Koboi]], who needs the silky sifaka lemur to increase her own power. In the novel, Holly kisses Artemis, and quickly attributes it to the effects of time travel as she is now an adolescent fairy.\n\n===In ''The Atlantis Complex''===\nIn ''[[Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex]]'', Artemis is mentally ill; his dabbles with magic have resulted in his developing Atlantis Complex; a fairy disease equivalent to OCD and multiple-personality disorder. Atlantis Complex also gives the victim a large amount of paranoia. He arranges for Holly and her fairy companions to meet him at a glacier in Iceland. Later, however, when Artemis proceeds to demonstrate his invention- a means of curing global warming- outdoors, a hacked martian probe gone rogue descends and attacks the LEP ship on the glacier, killing several marines and Commander Raine Vinyaya, then heads towards Atlantis, the underwater fairy metropolis. Entangled in a conspiracy planned by Holly's old nemesis, the impending crisis and Artemis's rapid deterioration into a soppy alter-ego called Orion who perceives Holly as his 'fair princess' forces Holly to take the lead and find a way to bring back Artemis before it is too late.\n\n===In ''The Last Guardian''===\nIn ''[[Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian]]'', Artemis' condition has improved, with he and Holly having formed a certain friendship with 'Nopal', the near-brain-dead clone of Opal Koboi. When Opal's plan for revenge results in her releasing ancient fairy guardians, Artemis is forced to apparently sacrifice himself and Nopal to stop her, but provides Holly with a sample of his DNA that she can use to clone a new body for his discorporated soul. As the series concludes, Holly is sharing her history with Artemis with his revived but amnesic self.\n\n===In ''The Fowl Twins''===\nIn ''The Fowl Twins''- a spin-off sequel series focusing on Artemis's younger brothers Myles and Beckett- Holly is revealed to have been promoted to Commodore, and also served as the (initially unknowing) template for NANNI, an artificial intelligence designed by Artemis and Myles to be the twins' guardian in the absence of the senior Fowls. She is also the mentor of Lieutenant Lazuli, a pixie-elf hybrid LEP officer who becomes associated with the Fowl twins during the crisis. At the conclusion of the novel, Lazuli is promoted to the position of head of the Fowl-fairy liaison office to maintain contact with the twins, after it is determined that the magic they retained following their possession by guardian spirits in ''Last Guardian'' legally qualifies them as magical creatures under fairy law.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artemis Fowl II]]\n* [[Whitewashing in film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Holly Short.ogg|2008-11-13}}\n\n{{Artemis Fowl}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Short, Holly}}\n[[Category:Artemis Fowl characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Fictional elves]]\n[[Category:Fictional police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional private investigators]]\n[[Category:Fictional bounty hunters]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 2001]]\n\n[[fr:Personnages de Artemis Fowl#Holly Short]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox character\n| name        = Holly Short\n| series      = [[Artemis Fowl]]\n| image       = HollyMediumCloseup.png\n| image_size  = 150px\n| caption     = Holly Short as depicted in ''[[Artemis Fowl: The Graphic Novel]]''\n| first       = ''[[Artemis Fowl (novel)|Artemis Fowl]]''\n| last        = ''[[The Fowl Twins]]''\n| creator     = [[Eoin Colfer]]\n| portrayer   = [[Lara McDonnell]]\n| species     = Elf\n| gender      = Female\n| occupation  = Captain of the [[Lower Elements Police#LEPrecon|LEPrecon]]<br>Commodore (''The Fowl Twins'')\n}}\n'''Captain Holly Short''' is a character of the ''[[Artemis Fowl]]'' novel series by [[Eoin Colfer]].\n\n==Character outline==\nHolly Short is a weird and quirky [[Elf (Artemis Fowl)|elf]] with an auburn [[crew cut]] (although she later grows a fringe) and 1 hazel and 1 blue eye, as well as the pointy ears typical of her species and nut-brown skin of a [[coffee]] complexion.

They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference system or [[geodetic datum]].\n\nDatums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be local, meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal [[Earth tide|Earth tidal]] movement caused by the [[Moon]] and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to {{nowrap|10 cm}} a year, or {{nowrap|10 m}} in a century. A [[weather system]] high-pressure area can cause a sinking of {{nowrap|5 mm}}. [[Scandinavia]] is rising by {{nowrap|1 cm}} a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the [[quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], but neighboring [[Scotland]] is rising by only {{nowrap|0.2 cm}}.

The [[North Pole]] is 90\u00b0&nbsp;N; the [[South Pole]] is 90\u00b0&nbsp;S.

The meridian of the [[UK|British]] [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in [[Greenwich, England|Greenwich]], in southeast London, England, is the international [[prime meridian]], although some organizations\u2014such as the French [[Institut G\u00e9ographique National]]\u2014continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere]]s, although maps often divide these hemispheres further west in order to keep the [[Old World]] on a single side. The [[Antipodes|antipodal]] meridian of Greenwich is both 180\u00b0W and 180\u00b0E. This is not to be conflated with the [[International Date Line]], which diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western [[Aleutian Islands]].\n\nThe combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of [[altitude]] or depth.

The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of reference locations, establishes a ''grid system'' for plotting locations. Common map projections in current use include the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM), the [[Military Grid Reference System]] (MGRS), the [[United States National Grid]] (USNG), the [[Global Area Reference System]] (GARS) and the [[World Geographic Reference System]] (GEOREF).<ref name=NGA_grids>{{cite web |title=Grids and Reference Systems |url = http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/grids/referencesys.html |publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency |access-date=4 March 2014 }}</ref>\nCoordinates on a map are usually in terms [[northing]] N and [[easting]] E offsets relative to a specified origin.\n\nMap projection formulas depend on the geometry of the projection as well as parameters dependent on the particular location at which the map is projected. The set of parameters can vary based on the type of project and the conventions chosen for the projection. For the [[transverse Mercator projection]] used in UTM, the parameters associated are the latitude and longitude of the natural origin, the false northing and false easting, and an overall scale factor.<ref name=OGP7_2>{{cite web |title=Geomatics Guidance Note Number 7, part 2 Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas |url = http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf |publisher=International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP) |access-date=5 March 2014 |pages=9\u201310 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005736/http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2014 }}</ref> Given the parameters associated with particular location or grin, the projection formulas for the transverse Mercator are a complex mix of algebraic and trigonometric functions.{{r|OGP7_2|page1=45-54}}\n\n====UTM and UPS systems====\n{{Main|Universal Transverse Mercator|Universal Polar Stereographic}}\n\nThe [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM) and [[Universal Polar Stereographic]] (UPS) coordinate systems both use a metric-based Cartesian grid laid out on a [[Map projection#Projections by preservation of a metric property|conformally projected]] surface to locate positions on the surface of the Earth.

The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is sometimes known as a ''local tangent'' or ''local geodetic'' plane.

The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of reference locations, establishes a ''grid system'' for plotting locations. Common map projections in current use include the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM), the [[Military Grid Reference System]] (MGRS), the [[United States National Grid]] (USNG), the [[Global Area Reference System]] (GARS) and the [[World Geographic Reference System]] (GEOREF).<ref name=NGA_grids>{{cite web |title=Grids and Reference Systems |url = http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/grids/referencesys.html |publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency |access-date=4 March 2014 }}</ref>\nCoordinates on a map are usually in terms [[northing]] N and [[easting]] E offsets relative to a specified origin.\n\nMap projection formulas depend on the geometry of the projection as well as parameters dependent on the particular location at which the map is projected. The set of parameters can vary based on the type of project and the conventions chosen for the projection. For the [[transverse Mercator projection]] used in UTM, the parameters associated are the latitude and longitude of the natural origin, the false northing and false easting, and an overall scale factor.<ref name=OGP7_2>{{cite web |title=Geomatics Guidance Note Number 7, part 2 Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas |url = http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf |publisher=International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP) |access-date=5 March 2014 |pages=9\u201310 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005736/http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2014 }}</ref> Given the parameters associated with particular location or grin, the projection formulas for the transverse Mercator are a complex mix of algebraic and trigonometric functions.{{r|OGP7_2|page1=45-54}}\n\n====UTM and UPS systems====\n{{Main|Universal Transverse Mercator|Universal Polar Stereographic}}\n\nThe [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM) and [[Universal Polar Stereographic]] (UPS) coordinate systems both use a metric-based Cartesian grid laid out on a [[Map projection#Projections by preservation of a metric property|conformally projected]] surface to locate positions on the surface of the Earth. The UTM system is not a single [[map projection]] but a series of sixty, each covering 6-degree bands of longitude. The UPS system is used for the polar regions, which are not covered by the UTM system.\n\n====Stereographic coordinate system====\n{{Further|Stereographic projection}}\n\nDuring medieval times, the stereographic coordinate system was used for navigation purposes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The stereographic coordinate system was superseded by the latitude-longitude system.

Given the dimensions of the ellipsoid, the conversion from lat/lon/height-above-ellipsoid coordinates to X-Y-Z is straightforward\u2014calculate the X-Y-Z for the given lat-lon on the surface of the ellipsoid and add the X-Y-Z vector that is perpendicular to the ellipsoid there and has length equal to the point's height above the ellipsoid. The reverse conversion is harder: given X-Y-Z we can immediately get longitude, but no closed formula for latitude and height exists. <!--, However, --> See \"[[Geodetic system#Geodetic to/from ECEF coordinates|Geodetic system]].\" Using Bowring's formula in 1976 ''Survey Review'' the first iteration gives latitude correct within 10{{sup|-11}} degree as long as the point is within 10000 meters above or 5000 meters below the ellipsoid.\n\n=== Local tangent plane ===\n[[File:ECEF ENU Longitude Latitude relationships.svg|thumb|Earth centered Earth fixed and East, North, up coordinates.]]\n{{Main|Local tangent plane}}\n{{Further|Geographic coordinate conversion#From ECEF to ENU}}\n\nA local tangent plane can be defined based on the [[vertical and horizontal]] dimensions. The [[vertical coordinate]] can point either up or down. There are two kinds of conventions for the frames:\n* East, North, up (ENU), used in geography\n* North, East, down (NED), used specially in aerospace\n\nIn many targeting and tracking applications the local ENU Cartesian coordinate system is far more intuitive and practical than ECEF or geodetic coordinates. The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is sometimes known as a ''local tangent'' or ''local geodetic'' plane. By convention the east axis is labeled <math>x</math>, the north <math>y</math> and the up <math>z</math>.\n\nIn an airplane, most objects of interest are below the aircraft, so it is sensible to define down as a positive number. The NED coordinates allow this as an alternative to the ENU. By convention, the north axis is labeled <math>x'</math>, the east <math>y'</math> and the down <math>z'</math>. To avoid confusion between <math>x</math> and <math>x'</math>, etc. in this article we will restrict the local coordinate frame to ENU.\n\n== On other celestial bodies ==\nSimilar coordinate systems are defined for other celestial bodies such as:\n\n* The cartographic coordinate systems for almost all of the solid bodies in the [[Solar System]] were established by [[Merton E.
