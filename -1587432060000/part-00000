Performing first as Shane Fenton in the 1960s, Jewry had a moderately successful career in the pre-Beatles era, hitting the UK top 40 with four singles in 1961\u201362. However, he became better known for singles released in the 1970s and 1980s as Alvin Stardust, a character he began in the [[glam rock]] era, with hits including the [[UK Singles Chart]]-topper \"[[Jealous Mind]]\", as well as later hits such as \"Pretend\" and \"[[I Feel Like Buddy Holly]]\".\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBernard William Jewry was born 27 September 1942 in [[Muswell Hill]], then in [[Middlesex]] (now in [[north London]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/11182348/Alvin-Stardust-the-great-reinventor.html |title=Alvin Stardust: the great reinventor |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/alvin-stardust-dead-singer-passes-away-following-short-illness-aged-72-9813196.html |title=Alvin Stardust dead: Singer passes away following short battle with cancer aged 72 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=23 October 2014 |accessdate=23 October 2014 |author=Selby, Jenn}}</ref> Having moved at a young age to [[Mansfield]], [[Nottinghamshire]], where his mother ran a [[boarding house]] frequented by musicians and entertainers appearing locally,<ref>[http://www.alvinstardust.co.uk/timelimeblankframe.html?ifrm_3=time42-59.html Alvin Stardust official online encyclopedia, Timeline] Retrieved 29 October 2014</ref> Jewry attended the Southwell Minster Collegiate Grammar School (now [[Southwell Minster School]]) in [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire]], near [[Newark-on-Trent]], as a boarder. He made his stage debut in [[pantomime]] at the age of four.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]] were an unknown teenage band who recorded a demo tape and mailed it in to a BBC programme with the hope of being picked to appear on television. While awaiting a reply from the BBC, the band's 17-year-old singer Shane Fenton (whose real name was [[Johnny Theakston]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Alvin's life in showbiz |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2008/04/25/alvin_stardust_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC Nottingham |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> died as a result of the [[rheumatic fever]] he had suffered in childhood.\n\nThe rest of the band (guitarists Jerry Wilcock and Mick Eyre, bassist Graham George Squires and drummer Tony Hinchcliffe) decided to break up, but then unexpectedly received a letter from the BBC inviting them to come to London to audition in person for the programme. Theakston's mother asked the band to stay together, and to keep its name, in honour of her son's memory. Jewry, who was a [[road crew|roadie]] with them at the time, was asked to join the band and to use Shane Fenton as a pseudonym.<ref name=\"Sweeting\">{{cite news |last=Sweeting |first=Adam |title=Alvin Stardust obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/23/alvin-stardust |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 October 2014}}</ref> The combo had a few hits in the [[UK Singles Chart]]:<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums 1\"/> \"I'm A Moody Guy\", \"Walk Away\", \"It's All Over Now\" and their biggest hit, \"Cindy's Birthday\".

During the early 1970s, however, he acquired a new persona, Alvin Stardust, cashing in on the [[glam rock]] bandwagon. Alvin Stardust was clearly a reference to [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]], a [[David Bowie]] character based on the \"C-list\" rocker [[Vince Taylor]]. The Alvin Stardust character looked remarkably like Taylor with sideburns and black leather outfit.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-bowie-names-the-real-ziggy-stardust-1315631.html |title=David Bowie names the 'real' Ziggy Stardust |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref> His new name was given to him by [[Peter Shelley]], the co-founder (with [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|Michael Levy]]) of [[Magnet Records]]. Shelley originated the persona of Alvin Stardust, writing, recording and singing the first Stardust single, \"[[My Coo Ca Choo]]\", in 1973. Shelley, however, had no interest in performing live or making public appearances, so even as \"My Coo Ca Choo\" was climbing the charts, he was on the lookout for someone to take over the role of Alvin Stardust. Hal Carter, Jewry's manager, suggested his client as a substitute.<ref name=\"Sweeting\"/> Jewry took over as Stardust in time to lip-synch \"My Coo Ca Choo\" on its first ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' appearance.\n\nAll further Alvin Stardust records were sung by Jewry.

Performing first as Shane Fenton in the 1960s, Jewry had a moderately successful career in the pre-Beatles era, hitting the UK top 40 with four singles in 1961\u201362. However, he became better known for singles released in the 1970s and 1980s as Alvin Stardust, a character he began in the [[glam rock]] era, with hits including the [[UK Singles Chart]]-topper \"[[Jealous Mind]]\", as well as later hits such as \"Pretend\" and \"[[I Feel Like Buddy Holly]]\".\n\n== Early life and career ==\nBernard William Jewry was born 27 September 1942 in [[Muswell Hill]], then in [[Middlesex]] (now in [[north London]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/11182348/Alvin-Stardust-the-great-reinventor.html |title=Alvin Stardust: the great reinventor |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/alvin-stardust-dead-singer-passes-away-following-short-illness-aged-72-9813196.html |title=Alvin Stardust dead: Singer passes away following short battle with cancer aged 72 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=23 October 2014 |accessdate=23 October 2014 |author=Selby, Jenn}}</ref> Having moved at a young age to [[Mansfield]], [[Nottinghamshire]], where his mother ran a [[boarding house]] frequented by musicians and entertainers appearing locally,<ref>[http://www.alvinstardust.co.uk/timelimeblankframe.html?ifrm_3=time42-59.html Alvin Stardust official online encyclopedia, Timeline] Retrieved 29 October 2014</ref> Jewry attended the Southwell Minster Collegiate Grammar School (now [[Southwell Minster School]]) in [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire]], near [[Newark-on-Trent]], as a boarder. He made his stage debut in [[pantomime]] at the age of four.\n\nIn the early 1960s, [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]] were an unknown teenage band who recorded a demo tape and mailed it in to a BBC programme with the hope of being picked to appear on television. While awaiting a reply from the BBC, the band's 17-year-old singer Shane Fenton (whose real name was [[Johnny Theakston]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Alvin's life in showbiz |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2008/04/25/alvin_stardust_feature.shtml |publisher=BBC Nottingham |accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref> died as a result of the [[rheumatic fever]] he had suffered in childhood.\n\nThe rest of the band (guitarists Jerry Wilcock and Mick Eyre, bassist Graham George Squires and drummer Tony Hinchcliffe) decided to break up, but then unexpectedly received a letter from the BBC inviting them to come to London to audition in person for the programme. Theakston's mother asked the band to stay together, and to keep its name, in honour of her son's memory. Jewry, who was a [[road crew|roadie]] with them at the time, was asked to join the band and to use Shane Fenton as a pseudonym.<ref name=\"Sweeting\">{{cite news |last=Sweeting |first=Adam |title=Alvin Stardust obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/23/alvin-stardust |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 October 2014}}</ref> The combo had a few hits in the [[UK Singles Chart]]:<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums 1\"/> \"I'm A Moody Guy\", \"Walk Away\", \"It's All Over Now\" and their biggest hit, \"Cindy's Birthday\".

During the early 1970s, however, he acquired a new persona, Alvin Stardust, cashing in on the [[glam rock]] bandwagon. Alvin Stardust was clearly a reference to [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]], a [[David Bowie]] character based on the \"C-list\" rocker [[Vince Taylor]]. The Alvin Stardust character looked remarkably like Taylor with sideburns and black leather outfit.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-bowie-names-the-real-ziggy-stardust-1315631.html |title=David Bowie names the 'real' Ziggy Stardust |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref> His new name was given to him by [[Peter Shelley]], the co-founder (with [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|Michael Levy]]) of [[Magnet Records]]. Shelley originated the persona of Alvin Stardust, writing, recording and singing the first Stardust single, \"[[My Coo Ca Choo]]\", in 1973. Shelley, however, had no interest in performing live or making public appearances, so even as \"My Coo Ca Choo\" was climbing the charts, he was on the lookout for someone to take over the role of Alvin Stardust. Hal Carter, Jewry's manager, suggested his client as a substitute.<ref name=\"Sweeting\"/> Jewry took over as Stardust in time to lip-synch \"My Coo Ca Choo\" on its first ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' appearance.\n\nAll further Alvin Stardust records were sung by Jewry.

Conceptually, citizenship is focused on the internal political life of the country and [[nationality]] is a matter of international dealings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|chapter=17.

This is defined exclusively by national laws, which can vary and conflict with each other. Multiple citizenship arises because different countries use different, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, criteria for citizenship. Colloquially, people may \"hold\" multiple citizenship but, technically, each nation makes a claim that a particular person is considered its national.\n\nA person holding multiple citizenship is, generally, entitled to the rights of citizenship in each country whose citizenship he or she is holding (such as right to a passport, right to enter the country, right to residence and work, right to vote, etc.), but may also be subject to obligations of citizenship (such as a potential obligation for national service, becoming subject to taxation on worldwide income, etc.). \n\nSome countries do not permit dual citizenship. This may be by requiring an applicant for [[naturalization]] to renounce all existing citizenship, or by withdrawing its citizenship from someone who voluntarily acquires another citizenship, or by other devices. Some countries permit a [[renunciation of citizenship]], while others do not. Some countries permit a general dual citizenship while others permit dual citizenship but only of a limited number of countries.\n\nCountries which allow dual citizenship may still not recognize the other citizenship of its nationals within its own territory (for example, in relation to entry into the country, [[national service]], [[Compulsory voting|duty to vote]], etc.). Similarly, it may not permit [[Consular assistance|consular access]] by another country for a person who is also its national. Some countries prohibit dual citizenship holders from serving in their [[military|armed forces]] or on [[Police|police forces]] or holding certain [[Public administration|public offices]].<ref>See, for example, [[Egyptian nationality law#Dual citizenship]]</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nUp until the late 19th century, nations often decided whom they claimed as their citizens or subjects, and did not recognize any other nationalities they held. Many states did not recognize the right of their citizens to renounce their citizenship without permission, due to policies that originated with the feudal theory of perpetual allegiance to the sovereign. This meant that people could hold multiple citizenships, with none of their nations recognizing any other of their citizenships. Until the early modern era, when levels of migration were insignificant, this was not a serious issue. However, when non-trivial levels of migration began, this state of affairs sometimes led to international incidents, with countries of origin refusing to recognize the new nationalities of natives who had migrated, and when possible, conscripting natives who had naturalized as citizens of another country into military service. The most notable example was the [[War of 1812]], triggered by British impressment into naval service of American seamen who were alleged to be British subjects. <ref name=virginia/><ref name=oup>{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/8/1/111/682643|title=Dual citizenship as human right|first=Peter J.|last=Spiro|date=1 January 2010|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|volume=8|issue=1|pages=111\u2013130|via=academic.oup.com|doi=10.1093/icon/mop035|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1867 [[Fenian Rising]], Irish-Americans who had gone to [[Ireland]] to participate in the uprising and were caught were charged with [[treason]], as the British authorities considered them to be British subjects. This outraged many Irish-Americans, to which the British responded by pointing out that, just like British law, American law also recognized perpetual allegiance.<ref name=virginia/> As a result, Congress passed the [[Expatriation Act of 1868]], which granted Americans the right to freely renounce their U.S. citizenship. Britain followed suit with a similar law, and years later, signed a treaty agreeing to treat British subjects who had become U.S. citizens as no longer holding British nationality. During this time, diplomatic incidents had also arisen between the United States and several other European countries over their tendency to conscript naturalized American citizens visiting their former homelands. In response, the US government negotiated agreements with various European states known as the [[Bancroft Treaties]], under which the signatories pledged to treat the voluntary naturalization of a former citizen or national with another sovereign nation as a renunciation of their citizenship.<ref name=virginia/>\n\nAs a result, the theory of perpetual allegiance largely fell out of favor with governments during the late 19th century. With the consensus of the time being that dual citizenship would only lead to diplomatic problems, more governments began prohibiting it and revoking the nationality of citizens holding another nationality. By the mid-20th century, dual nationality was largely prohibited worldwide, although there were exceptions. For example, a series of [[U.S. Supreme Court]] rulings permitted Americans born with citizenship in another country to keep it without losing their U.S. citizenship.<ref name=virginia>[http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/alumni/uvalawyer/sp05/martin_lecture.htm Dual Nationality: TR's \"Self-Evident Absurdity\"], virginia.edu; accessed September 7, 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.richw.org/dualcit/cases.html#Kawakita Dual citizenship] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204111011/http://www.richw.org/dualcit/cases.html#Kawakita |date=2010-02-04 }}, richw.org; accessed September 7, 2015.</ref>\n\nAt the [[League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930|1930 League of Nations Codification Conference]], an attempt was made to codify nationality rules into a universal worldwide treaty, the 1930 Hague Convention, whose chief aims would be to completely abolish both statelessness and dual citizenship. The 1930 [[Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws]] proposed laws that would have reduced both, but in the end, was ratified by only twenty nations.<ref name=virginia/>\n\nHowever, the consensus against dual nationality began to erode due to changes in social mores and attitudes. By the late 20th century it was becoming gradually accepted again.<ref name=virginia/> Many states were lifting restrictions on dual citizenship. For example, the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] removed restrictions on dual citizenship in the United Kingdom, the 1967 ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court prohibited the U.S. government from involuntarily stripping citizenship from Americans over dual citizenship, and the Canadian Citizenship Act, 1976, removed restrictions on dual citizenship in [[Canada]]. The number of states allowing multiple citizenships further increased after a treaty in Europe requiring signatories to limit dual citizenship lapsed in the 1990s, and countries with high emigration rates began permitting it to maintain links with their respective diasporas.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/21542394 \"Dutchmen grounded\"], economist.com; accessed September 7, 2015.</ref>\n\n== Citizenship of multiple countries ==\n{{main|Citizenship|Naturalization}}\n[[File:Dual Citizenship, Two Passports.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Picture of two passport documents.|Dual citizenship means persons can have or travel with two passports]]\n\nEach country sets its own criteria for citizenship and the rights of citizenship, which change from time to time, often becoming more restrictive. For example, [[British nationality law#Before 1983|until 1982 a person born in the UK was automatically a British citizen]]; this was subjected to restrictions from 1983. These laws may create situations where a person may satisfy the citizenship requirements of more than one country simultaneously. This would, in the absence of laws of one country or the other, allow the person to hold multiple citizenships. National laws may include criteria as to the circumstances, if any, in which a person may concurrently hold another citizenship. A country may withdraw its own citizenship if a person acquires a citizenship of another country, for example:\n* Citizenship by descent (''[[jus sanguinis]]''). Historically, citizenship was traced through the father, but today most countries permit the tracing through either parent and some also through a grandparent. Today, the citizenship laws of most countries are based on ''jus sanguinis''. In many cases, this basis for citizenship also extends to children born outside the country, and sometimes even when the parent has [[loss of citizenship|lost citizenship]].\n* Citizenship by birth on the country's territory (''[[jus soli]]''). The United States, Canada, and many Latin American countries grant unconditional birthright citizenship. To stop [[birth tourism]], most countries have abolished it; while Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom have a modified ''jus soli'', which requires at least one parent to be a citizen of the country (''jus sanguinis'') or a legal permanent resident who has lived in the country for several years. In the majority of such countries\u2014for example, in Canada\u2014children born to diplomats and under people outside the jurisdiction of the soil are not granted citizenship at birth. It is usually conferred automatically on the children once one of the parents obtain citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/guides/CIT0003ETOC.asp |title=Guide CIT 0003 - Application for Canadian Citizenship - Minors (under 18 years of age) |first=Government of Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Communications |last=Branch}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2015<!-- The paragraph headed \"Exception to citizenship by birth in Canada\" mentions diplomats but does not mention temporary residents, and I didn't find a provision as asserted about temporary residents elsewhere in this source. -->}}\n* Citizenship by marriage (''[[jure matrimonii]]''). Some countries routinely give citizenship to spouses of its citizens or may shorten the time for naturalization, but only in a few countries is citizenship granted on the wedding day (e.g., Iran).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rsd/rsddocview.htm?tbl=RSDLEGAL&id=3ae6b5a68 |title=Civil Code of Iran (last amended 1985) |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |accessdate=2007-06-24 |quote=Article 976 - The following persons are considered to be Iranian subjects: [...] (6) Every woman of foreign nationality who marries an Iranian husband.}}</ref> Some countries have regulations against so-called [[sham marriage]]s (e.g., the United States), and some revoke the spouse's citizenship if the marriage terminates within a specified time (e.g., Algeria).\n* Citizenship by [[naturalization]].\n* Citizenship by adoption. A [[age of majority|minor]] [[international adoption|adopted from another country]] when at least one adoptive parent is a citizen.<ref>For example, this is the case in the United States. Citizenship is automatic when the adoption becomes final, with no need for the naturalization process. See {{cite web |url=http://adoption.state.gov/visas/citizenship.html|title=Information about the Child Citizenship Act |work=Intercountry Adoption |publisher=Office of Children's Issues, United States Department of State |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>\n* Citizenship by investment. Some countries give citizenship to people who make a substantial monetary investment in their country. There are three countries in Europe, where this is possible: [[Malta]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Austria]]; and several in the Caribbean, including [[Antigua and Barbuda]],  [[Grenada]], [[Dominica]], [[St. Kitts & Nevis]], and [[St. Lucia]]. These countries all grant citizenship immediately, provided that due diligence is passed, without a requirement for any physical presence in the country. In Asia, [[Cambodia]] has laws enacted that allow foreigners to obtain citizenship through investment, but it is difficult to receive without fluency in [[Khmer language|Khmer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/86094/96932/F2069641919/KHM86094.pdf |title=Preah Reach Kram NS/RKM/1096/30 \u2013 Law on Nationality |publisher=ilo.org}}</ref>\n* Some countries grant citizenship based on ethnicity and on religion: Israel gives all Jews the right to immigrate to Israel, by the [[Law of Return]], and fast-tracked citizenship. Dual citizenship is permitted, but when entering the country the Israeli passport must be used.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n* Citizenship by holding an office (''jus officii''). In the case of [[Vatican City]], citizenship is based on holding an office, with [[Vatican citizenship]] held by the Pope, cardinals residing in Vatican City, active members of the Holy See's diplomatic service, and other directors of Vatican offices and services. Vatican citizenship is lost when the term of office comes to an end, and children cannot inherit it from their parents. Since Vatican citizenship is time-limited, dual citizenship is allowed, and persons who would become stateless because of loss of Vatican citizenship automatically become Italian citizens.<ref name=\"hansenweill\">{{cite book |title=Dual Nationality, Social Rights and Federal Citizenship in the U.S. and Europe: The Reinvention of Citizenship |publisher=Berghahn Books |editor=Randall Hansen, Patrick Weil |isbn=978-1-57181-804-1 |date=January 2002}}</ref>\n\nOnce a country bestows citizenship, it may or may not consider a voluntary renunciation of that citizenship to be valid. In the case of naturalization, some countries require applicants for naturalization to renounce their former citizenship. For example, the United States [[Chief Justice]] [[John Rutledge]] ruled \"a man may, at the same time, enjoy the rights of citizenship under two governments\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USCC_CR_0003_0133_ZO4.html|title=''Talbot v.

(''Responsibilities'', page 2).</ref> However, some countries do not recognise one of its citizens renouncing their citizenship. Effectively, the person in question may still possess both citizenships, notwithstanding the technical fact that he or she may have explicitly renounced one of the country's citizenships before officials of the other. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] recognises a renunciation of citizenship only if it is done with competent UK authorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/givingupcitizenship/ |title=Give up (renounce) British citizenship or nationality - GOV.UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/ |title=UK Visas and Immigration - GOV.UK}}</ref> Consequently, British citizens naturalized in the United States remain British citizens in the eyes of the British government even after they renounce British allegiance to the satisfaction of United States authorities.<ref name=\"hansenweill\"/>\n\n[[Irish nationality law]] applies to \"the [[island of Ireland]]\", which extends citizenship to [[Northern Ireland]], which is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. Therefore, anyone born in Northern Ireland who meets the requirements for being an Irish citizen through birth on the \"island of Ireland\" (or a child born outside Ireland but with a qualifying parent) can exercise rights accorded only to Irish citizens, including that of traveling under an [[Irish passport]]. Under Irish law, even that such a person has not acted in this way does not necessarily mean that they are not entitled to Irish citizenship. (See [[Irish nationality law]] and [[British nationality law]].) People born in Northern Ireland are also British citizens on the same basis as people born elsewhere in the UK. People born in Northern Ireland may generally choose to hold a [[British passport]], an Irish passport, or both.<ref name=\"hansenweill\"/>\n\n=== Multiple citizenship avoided ===\nSome countries may take measures to avoid creation of multiple citizenship. Since a country has control only over who has its citizenship, but has no control over who has any other country's citizenship, the only way for a country to avoid multiple citizenship is to deny its citizenship to people in cases when they would have another citizenship. This may take the following forms:\n\n* Automatic loss of citizenship if another citizenship is acquired voluntarily, such as [[Austrian nationality law|Austria]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmeia.gv.at/botschaft/auslandsoesterreicher/ratgeber/staatsbuergerschaft/verlust.html |title=Verlust der \u00f6sterreichischen Staatsb\u00fcrgerschaft |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Austria |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826181821/http://www.bmeia.gv.at/botschaft/auslandsoesterreicher/ratgeber/staatsbuergerschaft/verlust.html |archive-date=August 26, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Azerbaijani nationality law|Azerbaijan]],<ref>[http://www.multiplecitizenship.com/wscl/ws_AZERBAIJAN.html Azerbaijani law on citizenship]</ref> [[Bahraini nationality law|Bahrain]], [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] (excluding Hong Kong and Macau, which allow multiple citizenship in parallel with Chinese citizenship at the expense of losing consular protection from the country involved in Hong Kong, Macau and China),<ref>Chinese Nationality Law explanation on May 15, 1996 by National Peoples Congress</ref> [[Indian nationality law|India]], [[Indonesian nationality law|Indonesia]],<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url=http://id.wikisource.org/wiki/Undang-Undang_Republik_Indonesia_Nomor_23_Tahun_2006 |title=Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 23 Tahun 2006 - Wikisource bahasa Indonesia}}</ref> [[Japanese nationality law|Japan]],<ref>Article 11, [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tnl-01.html The Nationality Law], Ministry of Justice of Japan.</ref> [[Kazakhstani nationality law|Kazakhstan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://egov.kz/cms/en/articles/double_citizenship |title=Dual citizenship {{!}} Electronic government of the Republic of Kazakhstan |website=egov.kz |language=en-uk |access-date=2018-04-05}}</ref> [[Malaysian nationality law|Malaysia]]<ref>Article 24 of [[Constitution of Malaysia]]</ref>, [[Nepal citizenship law|Nepal]],<ref>Section 10.1 of Nepal Citizenship Act 2063 (2006)</ref> [[Dutch nationality law|the Netherlands]] (unless [[Dutch nationality law#Dual citizenship|certain conditions]] are met) and [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore]].<ref>Article 134(1)(a) Constitution of the Republic of Singapore</ref> [[Saudi Arabian nationality law|Saudi Arabian]] citizenship may be withdrawn if a Saudi citizen obtains a foreign citizenship without the permission of the [[Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/wcm/connect/121c03004d4bb7c98e2cdfbed7ca8368/EN_saudi_nationality_system.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=121c03004d4bb7c98e2cdfbed7ca8368 |title=1954 Saudi Arabian Citizenship System |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |at=Articles 11 and 13}}</ref>\n* Possible (but not automatic) loss of citizenship if another citizenship is acquired voluntarily, such as [[South African nationality law|South Africa]] and [[Brazilian nationality law|Brazil]].<ref name=\"dha.gov.za\">{{cite web |title=South African Department of Home Affairs: Citizenship |url=http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/civic-services/citizenship |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}</ref>\n* Possible (but not automatic) loss of citizenship if people with multiple citizenships do not renounce their other citizenships after reaching the [[age of majority]] or within a certain period of time after obtaining multiple citizenships, such as [[Japanese nationality law|Japan]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tcon-01.html |title=The Choice Of Nationality |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Japan Ministry Of Justice}}</ref> and Montenegro.

If they have different citizenships or are multiple citizens themselves, the child may gain multiple citizenships, depending on whether and how ''[[jus soli]]'' and ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' apply for each citizenship.\n* Some countries (e.g., Canada, the United States of America and many other countries in the Americas) regard all children born there automatically to be eligible to be citizens (''jus soli'') even if the parents are not legally present. For example, a child born in the United States to Austrian parents automatically has dual citizenship with the United States and Austria, even though Austria usually restricts or forbids dual citizenship. There are exceptions, such as the child of a foreign diplomat living in the United States. Such a child would be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident, but not a citizen-based on the U.S. birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/other-ways-get-green-card/green-card-person-born-foreign-diplomat-united-states/green-card-person-born-united-states-foreign-diplomat|title=Green Card for a Person Born in the United States to a Foreign Diplomat|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}</ref>{{paragraph break}}This has led to [[birth tourism]], so some countries have abolished ''jus soli'' or restricted it (i.e., at least one parent must be a citizen or a legal, permanent resident who has lived in the country for several years).

However, for voting, being voted and working for the public sector or the national security in a country, citizenship of the country concerned is almost always required.\n\n* Since 2008, Poland has granted the \"[[Polish Card]]\" (''Karta Polaka'') to ethnic Poles who are citizens of the successor states of the former Soviet Union and can prove they have Polish ancestors and knowledge of the Polish language and declare their Polish ethnicity in written form. Holders of the Card are not regarded as citizens, but enjoy some privileges other foreigners do not, e.g. entry visa, right to work, education, or healthcare in Poland. As stated above, Poland currently has no specific laws on dual citizenship; second citizenship is tolerated, but not recognized.\n* Turkey allows its citizens to have dual citizenship if they inform the authorities before acquiring the second citizenship (see above), and former Turkish citizens who have given up their Turkish citizenship (for example, because they have naturalized in a country that usually does not permit dual citizenship, such as Germany, Austria or the Netherlands) can apply for the \"Blue Card\" (''Mavi Kart''), which gives them some citizens' rights back, e.g. the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess land or the right to inherit, but not, for example, the right to vote.\n* Overseas citizenship of India: The [[Constitution of India]] does not permit dual citizenship or dual nationality, except for minors where the second nationality was involuntarily acquired. Indian authorities interpreted this to mean a person cannot have another country's passport while simultaneously holding an Indian one, even for a child claimed by another country as its citizen, who may be required by the laws of this country to use the corresponding passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in the United States to Indian parents).

Moreover, people who have acquired citizenship in Pakistan or Bangladesh are not eligible for overseas citizenship.\n* Many countries (e.g. United States, Canada, all EU countries and Switzerland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore) issue [[permanent residency]] status to foreigners deemed eligible. This status generally authorises a person to live and work in the issuing country indefinitely. There is not always any right to vote in the host country, and there may be other restrictions (no consular protection) and rights (not subject to military conscription). Permanent residents may usually apply for citizenship after several years of residency. Depending both on the home country and the guest country, dual citizenship may or may not be permitted.\n* Some countries have concluded treaties regulating travel and access to employment: A citizen of an EU country can live and work indefinitely in other EU countries and the four EFTA countries, and citizens of the EFTA countries can live and work in EU countries. Such EU citizens can vote in EU, but not national or local, elections. The [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] between Australia and New Zealand allows their citizens to live and work in the other country. A citizen of a GCC member state (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates) can live and work in other member states, but dual citizenship (even with another GCC state) is not allowed. Indian citizens do not need a visa to travel to and work in Nepal or Bhutan (and [[vice versa]]), but none of the three countries allow dual citizenship.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dual Citizenship in Global Perspective: From Unitary to Multiple Citizenship|publisher=Houndmills, UK: Palgrave Macmillan|editor=Thomas Faist, Peter Kivisto|isbn=978-0-230-00654-6|date=November 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple citizenship \"not recognized\" ===\n{{See also|Master Nationality Rule}}\nA statement that a country \"does not recognize\" multiple citizenship is confusing and ambiguous. Often, it is simply a restatement of the Master Nationality Rule, whereby a country treats a person who is a citizen of both that country and another in the same way as one who is a citizen only of the country. In other words, the country \"does not recognize\" that the person has any other citizenship for the purposes of the country's laws. In particular, citizens of a country may not be permitted to use another country's passport or travel documents to enter or leave the country, or be entitled to consulate assistance from the other country.<ref name=immigrationbarrister-20190820>{{cite web |url=https://immigrationbarrister.co.uk/multiple-nationality-and-multiple-citizenship/ |title=Multiple nationality and multiple citizenship (including dual nationality and dual citizenship) |last=Rahman |first=Zarina |publisher=Richmond Chambers |date=20 August 2019 |access-date=7 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830155327/https://immigrationbarrister.co.uk/multiple-nationality-and-multiple-citizenship |archive-date=30 August 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>  Also, the dual national may be subject to compulsory military service in countries where they are considered to be nationals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual-Nationality/Loss-US-Nationality-and-Foreign-Military-Service.html|title=Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Nationality and Foreign Military Service|accessdate=January 21, 2020|website=travel.state.gov}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Dormant\" citizenship and \"right of return\" ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\nThe concept of a \"dormant citizenship\" means that a person has the citizenships of two countries, but as long as while living permanently in one country, their status and [[civil and political rights|citizen's rights]] in the other country are \"inactive\". They will be \"reactivated\" when they move back to live permanently in the other country. This means, in spite of dual citizenship, only one citizenship can be exercised at a time.\n\nThe \"dormant citizenship\" exists, for example, in Spain: Spanish citizens who have naturalized in an Iberoamerican country and have kept their Spanish citizenship are dual citizens, but have lost many of the rights of Spanish citizens resident in Spain\u2014and hence the EU\u2014until they move back to Spain. Some countries offer former citizens or citizens of former colonies of the country a simplified (re-)naturalization process. Depending on the laws of the two countries in question, dual citizenship may or may not be allowed.

Most of these countries still{{clarify timeframe|date=February 2020}} grant unconditional birthright citizenship (even for children of illegal immigrants). There have been some calls to change the laws, but, so far{{clarify timeframe|date=February 2020}}, they have not been successful. [[Brazilian nationality law|Brazil]] has such policies; the only people born in Brazil who do not automatically acquire Brazilian citizenship are those whose parents are residing in Brazil while serving their own countries (as diplomats, military attach\u00e9s, cultural attach\u00e9s and the like).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK, a child born there is regarded as a citizen only if at least one parent is either a citizen or a legal permanent resident who has lived there for several years. (Germany usually restricts dual citizenship, so non-EU/non-Swiss citizens born and grown up abroad must usually renounce their old citizenship when naturalizing.) Some countries (e.g. Liechtenstein) allow only citizens by descent to have dual citizenship, but require naturalized citizens to renounce their old citizenship.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n== Subnational citizenship ==\n* Under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are [[United States nationality law|citizens of the United States]] {{em|and of the [[U.S. state|State]] wherein they are deemed to reside}}. Certain rights accrue as an incident of state citizenship and access to federal courts [[Diversity jurisdiction|can sometimes be determined]] on State citizenship. In addition, [[tribal sovereignty]] affords members (\"citizens\") of [[federally recognized tribes]] (\"nations\") a status comparable to local citizenship.\n* Switzerland has a [[Swiss nationality law|three-tier system of citizenship]] - Confederation, canton and commune (municipality).\n* Although considered part of the United Kingdom for [[British nationality law|British nationality]] purposes, the Crown Dependencies of [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] have local legislation restricting certain employment and housing rights to those with \"local status\". Although the British citizenship of people from these islands gives them full citizenship rights when in the United Kingdom, it does not give them the rights that British citizenship generally confers when in other parts of the [[European Union]] (for example, the right to reside and work). In a similar way, a number of British Overseas Territories have a concept of \"[[belonger status]]\" for their citizens, in addition to their existing British citizenship.\n* Citizens of the People's Republic of China may be permanent residents of the Hong Kong or Macau [[Special Administrative Region]]s, or have [[hukou system|household registration ''(hukou)'']] somewhere in [[mainland China]]. School enrollment, work permission, and other civic rights and privileges (such as whether one may apply for a [[Hong Kong SAR passport]], [[Macau SAR passport]], or [[People's Republic of China passport]]) are tied to the region in which the citizen has permanent residence or household registration. Although within mainland China the ''hukou'' system has loosened in recent years, movement ''between'' Macau, Hong Kong, and the mainland remains controlled.

Singapore citizenship continued to exist as a subnational citizenship, and continued to be legislated by the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore]] subject to the approval of the [[Parliament of Malaysia]]. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, Malaysian citizenship was withdrawn from Singapore citizens, and all Singapore citizens became citizens of the new Republic of Singapore.\n\n* The Constitution of [[Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu & Kashmir]] allowed on citizens of the state special privileges i.e. purchase of property, government jobs etc. However the Government of India [[Indian revocation of Jammu and_Kashmir's special status|revoked]] [[article 370|Article 370 of the Constitution of India]] which lead to single citizenship over the country.\n\n== Supra-national citizenship ==\n* In [[European Union]] law, there is the concept of [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizenship]] which flows from the Maastricht treaty which created a legal identity for the European Community and granted citizenship to all current and future citizens of a member state. An EU citizen is [[Freedom of movement for workers|free to live and to work]] in another EU country for an unlimited period of time, but member states may reserve the right to vote in national elections, stand for national election, become a public servant in highly sensitive ministries (Defence for example), etc. only for their citizens, and in highly limited circumstances, may deport or refuse entry to citizens of other EU states. An EU state may place restrictions on the free movement rights of citizens of newly admitted states for several years, such provisions remain in force mostly for nationals of [[Croatia]] (no later than 2020); in the past, and to a lesser extent, such provisions also affected [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]].\n* The [[Nordic Passport Union]], containing [[Denmark]] (including Faroe Islands and Greenland, unlike the EU), [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] (including Svalbard Islands) and [[Finland]], allow citizens of members to travel across their borders without requiring Passports (just IDs), although this has been frozen for some borders (mainly between Denmark and the respective country) in response to the [[European migrant crisis]]. However, other provisions allowing citizens of members to live, study and work in each other's countries is still active. Citizens of members are often eligible for fast track processing to citizenships of other Members, with varying degrees of recognition/tolerance of dual citizenship among the states.\n* The [[United Kingdom]] recognises a [[Commonwealth citizen]]ship for the citizens of the member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The United Kingdom allows non-nationals who are Commonwealth citizens to vote and stand for election while resident there, while most other Commonwealth countries make little or no distinction between citizens of other Commonwealth nations and citizens of non-Commonwealth nations.\n* [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] nations (the republics of the former [[Soviet Union]]) are often eligible for fast track processing to citizenships of other CIS countries, with varying degrees of recognition/tolerance of dual citizenship among the states.\n\n== Effects and potential issues ==\nIt is often observed that dual citizenship may strengthen ties between migrants and their countries of origin and increase their propensity to [[Remittance|remit]] funds to their communities of origin.<ref>Schuck, Peter H. 2002.

As a bundle of rights, dual citizenship (a) enables dual citizens by granting special privileges, (b) affects their expectations about privileges in the decision-making process, and (c) eases the transaction process and reducing costs and risks, for example in the case of investing and conducting business. In addition, a dual legal status can have positive effects on diasporic identification and commitment to causes in the homeland, as well as to a higher naturalization rate of immigrants in their countries of residence.<ref>Naujoks, Daniel. 2013.

They assert that the fact that a second citizenship can be obtained without giving anything up (such as the loss of public benefits, welfare, healthcare, retirement funds, and job opportunities in the country of origin in exchange for citizenship in a new country) both trivializes what it means to be a citizen<ref>[http://www.cis.org/articles/2001/paper20/renshondual.pdf Renshon, Stanley; \"Dual Citizenship and American National Identity\"] Center for Immigration Studies 2001.</ref> and nullifies the consequential, transformational, and psychological change that occurs in an individual when they go through the naturalization process.<ref>[http://www.davechen.net/2010/03/naturalization-oath-ceremony-and-what.html \"The Naturalization Oath Ceremony, and What It Means To Be a U.S. Citizen\"], davechen.net; accessed October 25, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn effect, this approach argues, the self-centered taking of an additional citizenship contradicts what it means to be a citizen in that it becomes a convenient and painless means of attaining improved economic opportunity without any real consequences and can just as easily be discarded when it is no longer beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elecpress.monash.edu.au/pnp/cart/download/free.php?paper=16|title=Monash University Research Repository - People and Place}}</ref> Proponents argue that dual citizenship can actually encourage political activity providing an avenue for immigrants who are unwilling to forsake their country of origin either out of loyalty or due to a feeling of separation from the mainstream society because of language, culture, religion, or ethnicity.<ref>[http://www.migrationpolicy.org/transatlantic/docs/Faist-FINAL.pdf Faist, Thomas; Gerdes, Jurgen (Bielefeld University) \"Dual Citizenship in an Age of Mobility\"], migrationpolicy.org, 2008; accessed October 25, 2015.</ref>\n\nAlthough, it may be noted that some countries have discriminatory immigration policies towards Citizens of a Single Citizen state. For example, Singaporean Citizens of Indian descent (A rather large part of Singaporean demographics) can apply for PIO (Person of Indian Origin) and then OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) cards, which gives the same rights as Indian Citizenship apart from voting and standing for election.

New Zealand's \"Permanent Resident Visa\" does not ever expire, for example, but there are very few countries that do this. Most countries make keeping Permanent Residence conditional on you showing \"sufficient ties\" to the country in question. This varies wildly, for example, the UK just ask for you to be present in the United Kingdom once every two years, Belgium is 1 year (extended to 6 if the person holding Type B PR is residing in the EU) and Singapore requires permission to leave, and has a time limit on this permission (if either of these are ignored, PR expires){{citation needed|date=January 2019|reason=See [[WP:V]]. Also, since this para makes time sensitive assertions, [[WP:DATED]] needs to be complied with -- including the use of {{tl|as of}} templates.}}\n\nA 2007 academic study concluded that dual citizens had a negative effect on the assimilation and political connectedness of first-generation Latino immigrants to the United States:<ref name=2007study />\n\n* 32% less likely to be fluent in English\n* 18% less likely to identify as \"American\"\n* 19% less likely to consider the US as their homeland\n* 18% less likely to express high levels of civic duty\n* 9% less likely to register to vote\n* 15% less likely to have ever voted in a national election\n\nThe study also noted that although dual nationality is likely to disconnect immigrants from the American political system and impede assimilation, the initial signs suggest that these effects seem to be limited almost exclusively to the first generation (although it is mentioned that a full assessment of dual nationality beyond the first generation is not possible with present data).<ref name=2007study>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121006164103/http://mailer.fsu.edu/~jstaton/costlyc.pdf Staton, Jeffrey K.

The reason for this is twofold:\n* The United States is a \"civic\" nation and not an \"ethnic\" nation. American citizenship is not based on belonging to a particular ethnicity, but on political loyalty to American democracy and values. Regimes based on ethnicity, which support the doctrine of perpetual allegiance as one is always a member of the ethnic nation, are not concerned with assimilating non-ethnics since they can never become true citizens. In contrast, the essence of a civic nation makes it imperative that immigrants assimilate into the greater whole as there is not an \"ethnic\" cohesiveness uniting the populace.<ref name=\"commdocs.house.gov\">[http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju23690.000/hju23690_0.htm 2006 Dual Citizenship, Birthright Citizenship, and the meaning of Sovereignty] Hearing before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims of the Committee on the Judiciary. 109th Congress, First Session, September 29, 2005, Serial No. 109\u201363.</ref>\n* The United States is an immigrant nation. As immigration is primarily directed at family reunification and refugee status rather than education and job skills, the pool of candidates tends to be poorer, less educated,<ref>[http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/jtf/JTF_ImmigrantsEducationJTF.pdf Public Policy Institute of California: \"Immigrants and Education\"] June 2008.</ref> and consistently from less stable countries (either non-democracies or fragile ones) with less familiarity or understanding of American values, making their assimilation both more difficult and more important.<ref name=\"commdocs.house.gov\"/>\n\nThe degree of angst over the effects of dual citizenship seemingly corresponds to a country's model for managing immigration and ethnic diversity:\n* The differential exclusionary model, which accepts immigrants as temporary \"guestworkers\" but is highly restrictive with regard to other forms of immigration and to naturalisation of immigrants. Many countries in Asia such as [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and the countries of the [[Middle East]] tend to follow this approach.\n* The [[assimilationist]] model, which accepts that immigrants obtain citizenship, but on the condition that they give up some or all cultural, linguistic, or social characteristics that differ from those of the majority population. [[Europe]] is the primary example of this model, where immigrants are usually required to learn the official language, and cultural traditions such as [[Islamic dress]] are often barred in public spaces (see [[Immigration to Europe]]).<ref>''[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/11/religion.uk Netherlands moves toward total ban on Muslim veils]'', Guardian, November 11, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110406075143/http://business.highbeam.com/2165/article-1G1-90102843/globalisation-multiculturalism-and-individualism-swedish Globalisation, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies: \"Multiculturalism and Individualism: the Swedish Debate on Dual Citizenship\"] July 1, 2002.</ref> \n* The [[multicultural]] model, which grants immigrants access to citizenship and to equal rights without demanding that they give up cultural, linguistic, or intermarriage restrictions or otherwise pressure them to integrate or inter-mix with the mainstream population. [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the United States have historically taken this approach, as exemplified by the fact that the United States has no official language, allowing official documents such as election ballots to be printed in a variety of languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/voting_accessibility.aspx|title=Voting Accessibility - The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC)}}</ref> (See [[Immigration to the United States]].)\n\n=== Appearance of foreign allegiance ===\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=June 2009}}\nPeople with multiple citizenship may be viewed as having dual loyalty, having the potential to act contrary to a government's interests, and this may lead to difficulties in acquiring government employment where security clearance may be required.\n\nIn the United States, dual citizenship is associated with two categories of security concerns: foreign influence and foreign preference. Contrary to common misconceptions, dual citizenship in itself is not the major problem in obtaining or retaining [[security clearance]] in the United States. As a matter of fact, if a security clearance applicant's dual citizenship is \"based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country\", that can be a mitigating condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/security/blforeignpref.htm |title=Security Clearance Guidelines: Foreign Preference |publisher = military.about.com|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> However, taking advantage of the entitlements of a non-US citizenship can cause problems. For example, possession or use of a foreign [[passport]] is a condition disqualifying one from security clearance and \"is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country\" as is explicitly clarified in a Department of Defense policy memorandum which defines a guideline requiring that \"any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official permission for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/doha/policyinterpmemo.pdf|title=Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign preference Adjucitative Guideline|date=August 16, 2000|author=Arthur L.

They are required to be residents of that country for a minimum of 5 years; after which they are free from any tax obligations.\n\nU.S. persons living outside the United States are still subject to tax on their worldwide income, although [[Internal Revenue Code|US law]] provides [[Double taxation#U.S. citizens and resident aliens abroad|measures]] to reduce or eliminate double taxation issues for some. It has been reported that some US citizens have relinquished US citizenship in order to avoid possible taxes, the expense and complexity of compliance, or because they have been deemed unacceptable to financial institutions in the wake of [[FATCA]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/world/americas/17iht-expat.3928621.html |title=Americans abroad are giving up citizenship for lower taxes|newspaper=International Herald Tribune |author=Doreen Carvajal|date=December 17, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1983238,00.html |title=Why More U.S. Expatriates Are Turning In Their Passports|author=Helena Bachmann|date=April 20, 2010|publisher=time.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/opinion/an-american-tax-nightmare.html?_r=0 |title=An American Tax Nightmare|author=Stu Haugen|date=May 13, 2015 |newspaper=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nA person with multiple citizenship may have a tax liability to his country of residence and also to one or more of his countries of citizenship; or worse, if unaware that one of his citizenships created a tax liability, that country may consider the person to be a tax evader. Many countries and territories have signed [[tax treaty|tax treaties]] or agreements for avoiding [[double taxation]].\n\nStill, there are cases in which a person with multiple citizenship will owe tax solely on the basis of holding one such citizenship. For example, consider a person who holds both Australian and United States citizenship, lives and works in Australia. He would be subject to Australian taxation, because Australia taxes its residents, and he would be subject to U.S. taxation because he holds US citizenship. In general, he would be allowed to subtract the Australian income tax he paid from the US tax that would be due. In addition, the US will allow some parts of foreign income to be exempt from taxation; for instance, in 2006 the [[foreign earned income#2555|foreign earned income exclusion]] allowed up to US$82,400 of foreign salaried income to be exempt from [[income tax]] (in 2014, this was increased to US$97,600).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=97130,00.html |title=Foreign Earned Income Exclusion}}</ref> This exemption, plus the credit for foreign taxes paid mentioned above, often results in no US taxes being owed, although a US tax return would still have to be filed. In instances where the Australian tax was less than the US tax, and if there was income that could not be exempted from US tax, the US would expect any tax due to be paid.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] has excluded some regulations such as [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] (AMT) from tax treaties that protect double taxation. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In its current format even if US citizens are paying income taxes at a rate of 56%, far above the maximum US marginal tax rate, the citizen can be subject to US taxes because the calculation of the AMT does not allow full deduction for taxes paid to a foreign country. Other regulations such as the post date of foreign mailed tax returns are not recognized and can result in penalties for late filing if they arrive at the IRS later than the filing date. However, the filing date for overseas citizens has a two-month automatic extension to June 15.<ref>US Internal Revenue Service: U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad</ref>\n\n\"If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien residing overseas, or are in the military on duty outside the U.S., on the regular due date of your return, you are allowed an automatic 2-month extension to file your return and pay any amount due without requesting an extension.

If you are unable to file your return by the automatic 2-month extension date, you can request an additional extension to October 15 by filing Form 4868 before the automatic 2-month extension date. However, any tax due payments made after June 15 will be subject to both interest charges and failure to pay penalties.\" (IRS, 2012){{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n=== Issues with international travel ===\nMany countries, even those that permit multiple citizenship, do not explicitly recognise multiple citizenship under their laws: individuals are treated either as citizens of that country or not, and their citizenship with respect to other countries is considered to have no bearing.

The right of countries to act in this fashion is protected via the [[Master Nationality Rule]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nMultiple citizens who travel to a country that claims them as a citizen may be required to enter or leave the country on that country's passport. For example, a [[United States Department of State]] web page on dual nationality contains the information that most US citizens, including dual nationals, must use a US passport to enter and leave the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/citizenship-and-dual-nationality/dual-nationality.html|accessdate=2015-01-19|title=US State Department Services Dual Nationality|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref> Under the terms of the South African Citizenship Act, it is an offence for someone aged at least 18 with South African citizenship and another citizenship to enter or depart the Republic of South Africa using the passport of another country.

Several countries have entered into a ''Protocol relating to Military Obligations in Certain Cases of Double Nationality'' established at [[The Hague]], 12 April 1930. The protocol states \"A person possessing two or more nationalities who habitually resides in one of the countries whose nationality he possesses, and who is in fact most closely connected with that country, shall be exempt from all military obligations in the other country or countries. This exemption may involve the loss of the nationality of the other country or countries.\" The protocol has several provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b38c10.html|title=Refworld - Protocol Relating to Military Obligations in Certain Cases of Double Nationality|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|website=Refworld}}</ref>\n\n===Healthcare===\nThe right to healthcare in countries with a [[public health]] service is often discussed in relation to immigration but is a non-issue as far as nationality is concerned. The right to use public health services may be conditioned on nationality and/or on legal residency. For example, anyone legally resident and employed in the UK is entitled to use the [[National Health Service]]; non-resident British citizens visiting Britain do not have this right, unless they are UK state pensioners who hold a UK S1 form.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Dominant and effective nationality ==\nThe potential issues that dual nationality can pose in international affairs has long been recognized, and as a result, international law recognizes the concept of \"dominant and effective nationality\", under which a dual national will hold only one dominant and effective nationality for the purposes of international law to one nation that holds their primary national allegiance, while any other nationalities are subordinate. The theory of dominant and effective nationality emerged as early as 1834. Customary international law and precedent have since recognized the idea of dominant and effective nationality, with the [[Nottebohm case]] providing an important shift. The [[International Court of Justice]] defines effective nationality as a \"legal bond having as its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties\". International tribunals have adopted and used the principle. Under customary international law, tribunals dealing with questions involving dual nationality must determine the effective nationality of the dual national by determining to which nation the individual has more of a \"genuine link\". Unlike dual nationality, one may only be the effective national of a single nation, and different factors are taken into consideration to determine effective nationality, including habitual residence, family ties, financial and economic ties, cultural integration, participation in public life, armed forces service, and evidence of sentiment of national allegiance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.emory.edu/eilr/content/volume-25/issue-3/comments/nationalities-citizenship-case-anwar-al-aulaqi.html|title=Dueling Nationalities: Dual Citizenship, Dominant and Effective Nationality, and the Case of Anwar al-Aulaqi - Emory University School of Law - Atlanta, GA|first=Abraham U.|last=Kannof|website=Emory University School of Law}}</ref>\n\n== Dual citizenship by region ==\n=== Africa ===\nDual citizenship is allowed in Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Cabo Verde, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zambia.

Some countries (e.g., Argentina, Bolivia) do not allow their citizens to renounce their citizenship, so they keep it even when naturalizing in a country that forbids dual citizenship. Most countries in the region observe unconditional ''jus soli'', i.e. a child born there is regarded as a citizen even if the parents are not. Some countries, such as the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Uruguay, allow renunciation of citizenship only if it was involuntarily acquired by birth to non-citizen parents. \n\nDual citizenship is restricted or forbidden in Cuba, Haiti, [[Suriname]], and Guyana.\n\n=== Asia-Pacific ===\nMost countries in the Asia-Pacific region restrict or forbid dual citizenship.

Conceptually, citizenship is focused on the internal political life of the country and [[nationality]] is a matter of international dealings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sassen|first=Saskia|chapter=17.

This is defined exclusively by national laws, which can vary and conflict with each other. Multiple citizenship arises because different countries use different, and not necessarily mutually exclusive, criteria for citizenship. Colloquially, people may \"hold\" multiple citizenship but, technically, each nation makes a claim that a particular person is considered its national.\n\nA person holding multiple citizenship is, generally, entitled to the rights of citizenship in each country whose citizenship he or she is holding (such as right to a passport, right to enter the country, right to residence and work, right to vote, etc.), but may also be subject to obligations of citizenship (such as a potential obligation for national service, becoming subject to taxation on worldwide income, etc.). \n\nSome countries do not permit dual citizenship. This may be by requiring an applicant for [[naturalization]] to renounce all existing citizenship, or by withdrawing its citizenship from someone who voluntarily acquires another citizenship, or by other devices. Some countries permit a [[renunciation of citizenship]], while others do not. Some countries permit a general dual citizenship while others permit dual citizenship but only of a limited number of countries.\n\nCountries which allow dual citizenship may still not recognize the other citizenship of its nationals within its own territory (for example, in relation to entry into the country, [[national service]], [[Compulsory voting|duty to vote]], etc.). Similarly, it may not permit [[Consular assistance|consular access]] by another country for a person who is also its national. Some countries prohibit dual citizenship holders from serving in their [[military|armed forces]] or on [[Police|police forces]] or holding certain [[Public administration|public offices]].<ref>See, for example, [[Egyptian nationality law#Dual citizenship]]</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nUp until the late 19th century, nations often decided whom they claimed as their citizens or subjects, and did not recognize any other nationalities they held. Many states did not recognize the right of their citizens to renounce their citizenship without permission, due to policies that originated with the feudal theory of perpetual allegiance to the sovereign. This meant that people could hold multiple citizenships, with none of their nations recognizing any other of their citizenships. Until the early modern era, when levels of migration were insignificant, this was not a serious issue. However, when non-trivial levels of migration began, this state of affairs sometimes led to international incidents, with countries of origin refusing to recognize the new nationalities of natives who had migrated, and when possible, conscripting natives who had naturalized as citizens of another country into military service. The most notable example was the [[War of 1812]], triggered by British impressment into naval service of American seamen who were alleged to be British subjects. <ref name=virginia/><ref name=oup>{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/8/1/111/682643|title=Dual citizenship as human right|first=Peter J.|last=Spiro|date=1 January 2010|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|volume=8|issue=1|pages=111\u2013130|via=academic.oup.com|doi=10.1093/icon/mop035|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1867 [[Fenian Rising]], Irish-Americans who had gone to [[Ireland]] to participate in the uprising and were caught were charged with [[treason]], as the British authorities considered them to be British subjects. This outraged many Irish-Americans, to which the British responded by pointing out that, just like British law, American law also recognized perpetual allegiance.<ref name=virginia/> As a result, Congress passed the [[Expatriation Act of 1868]], which granted Americans the right to freely renounce their U.S. citizenship. Britain followed suit with a similar law, and years later, signed a treaty agreeing to treat British subjects who had become U.S. citizens as no longer holding British nationality. During this time, diplomatic incidents had also arisen between the United States and several other European countries over their tendency to conscript naturalized American citizens visiting their former homelands. In response, the US government negotiated agreements with various European states known as the [[Bancroft Treaties]], under which the signatories pledged to treat the voluntary naturalization of a former citizen or national with another sovereign nation as a renunciation of their citizenship.<ref name=virginia/>\n\nAs a result, the theory of perpetual allegiance largely fell out of favor with governments during the late 19th century. With the consensus of the time being that dual citizenship would only lead to diplomatic problems, more governments began prohibiting it and revoking the nationality of citizens holding another nationality. By the mid-20th century, dual nationality was largely prohibited worldwide, although there were exceptions. For example, a series of [[U.S. Supreme Court]] rulings permitted Americans born with citizenship in another country to keep it without losing their U.S. citizenship.<ref name=virginia>[http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/alumni/uvalawyer/sp05/martin_lecture.htm Dual Nationality: TR's \"Self-Evident Absurdity\"], virginia.edu; accessed September 7, 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.richw.org/dualcit/cases.html#Kawakita Dual citizenship] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204111011/http://www.richw.org/dualcit/cases.html#Kawakita |date=2010-02-04 }}, richw.org; accessed September 7, 2015.</ref>\n\nAt the [[League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930|1930 League of Nations Codification Conference]], an attempt was made to codify nationality rules into a universal worldwide treaty, the 1930 Hague Convention, whose chief aims would be to completely abolish both statelessness and dual citizenship. The 1930 [[Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws]] proposed laws that would have reduced both, but in the end, was ratified by only twenty nations.<ref name=virginia/>\n\nHowever, the consensus against dual nationality began to erode due to changes in social mores and attitudes. By the late 20th century it was becoming gradually accepted again.<ref name=virginia/> Many states were lifting restrictions on dual citizenship. For example, the [[British Nationality Act 1948]] removed restrictions on dual citizenship in the United Kingdom, the 1967 ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court prohibited the U.S. government from involuntarily stripping citizenship from Americans over dual citizenship, and the Canadian Citizenship Act, 1976, removed restrictions on dual citizenship in [[Canada]]. The number of states allowing multiple citizenships further increased after a treaty in Europe requiring signatories to limit dual citizenship lapsed in the 1990s, and countries with high emigration rates began permitting it to maintain links with their respective diasporas.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/21542394 \"Dutchmen grounded\"], economist.com; accessed September 7, 2015.</ref>\n\n== Citizenship of multiple countries ==\n{{main|Citizenship|Naturalization}}\n[[File:Dual Citizenship, Two Passports.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=Picture of two passport documents.|Dual citizenship means persons can have or travel with two passports]]\n\nEach country sets its own criteria for citizenship and the rights of citizenship, which change from time to time, often becoming more restrictive. For example, [[British nationality law#Before 1983|until 1982 a person born in the UK was automatically a British citizen]]; this was subjected to restrictions from 1983. These laws may create situations where a person may satisfy the citizenship requirements of more than one country simultaneously. This would, in the absence of laws of one country or the other, allow the person to hold multiple citizenships. National laws may include criteria as to the circumstances, if any, in which a person may concurrently hold another citizenship. A country may withdraw its own citizenship if a person acquires a citizenship of another country, for example:\n* Citizenship by descent (''[[jus sanguinis]]''). Historically, citizenship was traced through the father, but today most countries permit the tracing through either parent and some also through a grandparent. Today, the citizenship laws of most countries are based on ''jus sanguinis''. In many cases, this basis for citizenship also extends to children born outside the country, and sometimes even when the parent has [[loss of citizenship|lost citizenship]].\n* Citizenship by birth on the country's territory (''[[jus soli]]''). The United States, Canada, and many Latin American countries grant unconditional birthright citizenship. To stop [[birth tourism]], most countries have abolished it; while Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom have a modified ''jus soli'', which requires at least one parent to be a citizen of the country (''jus sanguinis'') or a legal permanent resident who has lived in the country for several years. In the majority of such countries\u2014for example, in Canada\u2014children born to diplomats and under people outside the jurisdiction of the soil are not granted citizenship at birth. It is usually conferred automatically on the children once one of the parents obtain citizenship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/guides/CIT0003ETOC.asp |title=Guide CIT 0003 - Application for Canadian Citizenship - Minors (under 18 years of age) |first=Government of Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Communications |last=Branch}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2015<!-- The paragraph headed \"Exception to citizenship by birth in Canada\" mentions diplomats but does not mention temporary residents, and I didn't find a provision as asserted about temporary residents elsewhere in this source. -->}}\n* Citizenship by marriage (''[[jure matrimonii]]''). Some countries routinely give citizenship to spouses of its citizens or may shorten the time for naturalization, but only in a few countries is citizenship granted on the wedding day (e.g., Iran).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rsd/rsddocview.htm?tbl=RSDLEGAL&id=3ae6b5a68 |title=Civil Code of Iran (last amended 1985) |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |accessdate=2007-06-24 |quote=Article 976 - The following persons are considered to be Iranian subjects: [...] (6) Every woman of foreign nationality who marries an Iranian husband.}}</ref> Some countries have regulations against so-called [[sham marriage]]s (e.g., the United States), and some revoke the spouse's citizenship if the marriage terminates within a specified time (e.g., Algeria).\n* Citizenship by [[naturalization]].\n* Citizenship by adoption. A [[age of majority|minor]] [[international adoption|adopted from another country]] when at least one adoptive parent is a citizen.<ref>For example, this is the case in the United States. Citizenship is automatic when the adoption becomes final, with no need for the naturalization process.

Some countries give citizenship to people who make a substantial monetary investment in their country. There are three countries in Europe, where this is possible: [[Malta]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Austria]]; and several in the Caribbean, including [[Antigua and Barbuda]],  [[Grenada]], [[Dominica]], [[St. Kitts & Nevis]], and [[St. Lucia]]. These countries all grant citizenship immediately, provided that due diligence is passed, without a requirement for any physical presence in the country. In Asia, [[Cambodia]] has laws enacted that allow foreigners to obtain citizenship through investment, but it is difficult to receive without fluency in [[Khmer language|Khmer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/86094/96932/F2069641919/KHM86094.pdf |title=Preah Reach Kram NS/RKM/1096/30 \u2013 Law on Nationality |publisher=ilo.org}}</ref>\n* Some countries grant citizenship based on ethnicity and on religion: Israel gives all Jews the right to immigrate to Israel, by the [[Law of Return]], and fast-tracked citizenship. Dual citizenship is permitted, but when entering the country the Israeli passport must be used.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n* Citizenship by holding an office (''jus officii''). In the case of [[Vatican City]], citizenship is based on holding an office, with [[Vatican citizenship]] held by the Pope, cardinals residing in Vatican City, active members of the Holy See's diplomatic service, and other directors of Vatican offices and services. Vatican citizenship is lost when the term of office comes to an end, and children cannot inherit it from their parents. Since Vatican citizenship is time-limited, dual citizenship is allowed, and persons who would become stateless because of loss of Vatican citizenship automatically become Italian citizens.<ref name=\"hansenweill\">{{cite book |title=Dual Nationality, Social Rights and Federal Citizenship in the U.S. and Europe: The Reinvention of Citizenship |publisher=Berghahn Books |editor=Randall Hansen, Patrick Weil |isbn=978-1-57181-804-1 |date=January 2002}}</ref>\n\nOnce a country bestows citizenship, it may or may not consider a voluntary renunciation of that citizenship to be valid. In the case of naturalization, some countries require applicants for naturalization to renounce their former citizenship. For example, the United States [[Chief Justice]] [[John Rutledge]] ruled \"a man may, at the same time, enjoy the rights of citizenship under two governments\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USCC_CR_0003_0133_ZO4.html|title=''Talbot v.

(''Responsibilities'', page 2).</ref> However, some countries do not recognise one of its citizens renouncing their citizenship. Effectively, the person in question may still possess both citizenships, notwithstanding the technical fact that he or she may have explicitly renounced one of the country's citizenships before officials of the other. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] recognises a renunciation of citizenship only if it is done with competent UK authorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/givingupcitizenship/ |title=Give up (renounce) British citizenship or nationality - GOV.UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/ |title=UK Visas and Immigration - GOV.UK}}</ref> Consequently, British citizens naturalized in the United States remain British citizens in the eyes of the British government even after they renounce British allegiance to the satisfaction of United States authorities.<ref name=\"hansenweill\"/>\n\n[[Irish nationality law]] applies to \"the [[island of Ireland]]\", which extends citizenship to [[Northern Ireland]], which is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. Therefore, anyone born in Northern Ireland who meets the requirements for being an Irish citizen through birth on the \"island of Ireland\" (or a child born outside Ireland but with a qualifying parent) can exercise rights accorded only to Irish citizens, including that of traveling under an [[Irish passport]]. Under Irish law, even that such a person has not acted in this way does not necessarily mean that they are not entitled to Irish citizenship. (See [[Irish nationality law]] and [[British nationality law]].) People born in Northern Ireland are also British citizens on the same basis as people born elsewhere in the UK. People born in Northern Ireland may generally choose to hold a [[British passport]], an Irish passport, or both.<ref name=\"hansenweill\"/>\n\n=== Multiple citizenship avoided ===\nSome countries may take measures to avoid creation of multiple citizenship. Since a country has control only over who has its citizenship, but has no control over who has any other country's citizenship, the only way for a country to avoid multiple citizenship is to deny its citizenship to people in cases when they would have another citizenship. This may take the following forms:\n\n* Automatic loss of citizenship if another citizenship is acquired voluntarily, such as [[Austrian nationality law|Austria]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmeia.gv.at/botschaft/auslandsoesterreicher/ratgeber/staatsbuergerschaft/verlust.html |title=Verlust der \u00f6sterreichischen Staatsb\u00fcrgerschaft |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Austria |accessdate=August 25, 2014 |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826181821/http://www.bmeia.gv.at/botschaft/auslandsoesterreicher/ratgeber/staatsbuergerschaft/verlust.html |archive-date=August 26, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Azerbaijani nationality law|Azerbaijan]],<ref>[http://www.multiplecitizenship.com/wscl/ws_AZERBAIJAN.html Azerbaijani law on citizenship]</ref> [[Bahraini nationality law|Bahrain]], [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] (excluding Hong Kong and Macau, which allow multiple citizenship in parallel with Chinese citizenship at the expense of losing consular protection from the country involved in Hong Kong, Macau and China),<ref>Chinese Nationality Law explanation on May 15, 1996 by National Peoples Congress</ref> [[Indian nationality law|India]], [[Indonesian nationality law|Indonesia]],<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url=http://id.wikisource.org/wiki/Undang-Undang_Republik_Indonesia_Nomor_23_Tahun_2006 |title=Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 23 Tahun 2006 - Wikisource bahasa Indonesia}}</ref> [[Japanese nationality law|Japan]],<ref>Article 11, [http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tnl-01.html The Nationality Law], Ministry of Justice of Japan.</ref> [[Kazakhstani nationality law|Kazakhstan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://egov.kz/cms/en/articles/double_citizenship |title=Dual citizenship {{!}} Electronic government of the Republic of Kazakhstan |website=egov.kz |language=en-uk |access-date=2018-04-05}}</ref> [[Malaysian nationality law|Malaysia]]<ref>Article 24 of [[Constitution of Malaysia]]</ref>, [[Nepal citizenship law|Nepal]],<ref>Section 10.1 of Nepal Citizenship Act 2063 (2006)</ref> [[Dutch nationality law|the Netherlands]] (unless [[Dutch nationality law#Dual citizenship|certain conditions]] are met) and [[Singaporean nationality law|Singapore]].<ref>Article 134(1)(a) Constitution of the Republic of Singapore</ref> [[Saudi Arabian nationality law|Saudi Arabian]] citizenship may be withdrawn if a Saudi citizen obtains a foreign citizenship without the permission of the [[Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moi.gov.sa/wps/wcm/connect/121c03004d4bb7c98e2cdfbed7ca8368/EN_saudi_nationality_system.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CACHEID=121c03004d4bb7c98e2cdfbed7ca8368 |title=1954 Saudi Arabian Citizenship System |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |at=Articles 11 and 13}}</ref>\n* Possible (but not automatic) loss of citizenship if another citizenship is acquired voluntarily, such as [[South African nationality law|South Africa]] and [[Brazilian nationality law|Brazil]].<ref name=\"dha.gov.za\">{{cite web |title=South African Department of Home Affairs: Citizenship |url=http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/civic-services/citizenship |accessdate=May 12, 2014}}</ref>\n* Possible (but not automatic) loss of citizenship if people with multiple citizenships do not renounce their other citizenships after reaching the [[age of majority]] or within a certain period of time after obtaining multiple citizenships, such as [[Japanese nationality law|Japan]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/information/tcon-01.html |title=The Choice Of Nationality |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Japan Ministry Of Justice}}</ref> and Montenegro.

For example, a child born in the United States to Austrian parents automatically has dual citizenship with the United States and Austria, even though Austria usually restricts or forbids dual citizenship. There are exceptions, such as the child of a foreign diplomat living in the United States. Such a child would be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident, but not a citizen-based on the U.S. birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/other-ways-get-green-card/green-card-person-born-foreign-diplomat-united-states/green-card-person-born-united-states-foreign-diplomat|title=Green Card for a Person Born in the United States to a Foreign Diplomat|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}</ref>{{paragraph break}}This has led to [[birth tourism]], so some countries have abolished ''jus soli'' or restricted it (i.e., at least one parent must be a citizen or a legal, permanent resident who has lived in the country for several years).

Such overseas citizens are exempt from the rule forbidding dual citizenship; they may not vote, run for office, join the army, or take up government posts, though these evolving principles are subject to revolving political discretions {{clarify|date=October 2012}} for those born in India with birthrights. Moreover, people who have acquired citizenship in Pakistan or Bangladesh are not eligible for overseas citizenship.\n* Many countries (e.g. United States, Canada, all EU countries and Switzerland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore) issue [[permanent residency]] status to foreigners deemed eligible. This status generally authorises a person to live and work in the issuing country indefinitely. There is not always any right to vote in the host country, and there may be other restrictions (no consular protection) and rights (not subject to military conscription). Permanent residents may usually apply for citizenship after several years of residency. Depending both on the home country and the guest country, dual citizenship may or may not be permitted.\n* Some countries have concluded treaties regulating travel and access to employment: A citizen of an EU country can live and work indefinitely in other EU countries and the four EFTA countries, and citizens of the EFTA countries can live and work in EU countries. Such EU citizens can vote in EU, but not national or local, elections. The [[Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement]] between Australia and New Zealand allows their citizens to live and work in the other country. A citizen of a GCC member state (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates) can live and work in other member states, but dual citizenship (even with another GCC state) is not allowed. Indian citizens do not need a visa to travel to and work in Nepal or Bhutan (and [[vice versa]]), but none of the three countries allow dual citizenship.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dual Citizenship in Global Perspective: From Unitary to Multiple Citizenship|publisher=Houndmills, UK: Palgrave Macmillan|editor=Thomas Faist, Peter Kivisto|isbn=978-0-230-00654-6|date=November 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple citizenship \"not recognized\" ===\n{{See also|Master Nationality Rule}}\nA statement that a country \"does not recognize\" multiple citizenship is confusing and ambiguous.

In other words, the country \"does not recognize\" that the person has any other citizenship for the purposes of the country's laws.

They will be \"reactivated\" when they move back to live permanently in the other country. This means, in spite of dual citizenship, only one citizenship can be exercised at a time.\n\nThe \"dormant citizenship\" exists, for example, in Spain: Spanish citizens who have naturalized in an Iberoamerican country and have kept their Spanish citizenship are dual citizens, but have lost many of the rights of Spanish citizens resident in Spain\u2014and hence the EU\u2014until they move back to Spain. Some countries offer former citizens or citizens of former colonies of the country a simplified (re-)naturalization process.

There have been some calls to change the laws, but, so far{{clarify timeframe|date=February 2020}}, they have not been successful.

(Germany usually restricts dual citizenship, so non-EU/non-Swiss citizens born and grown up abroad must usually renounce their old citizenship when naturalizing.) Some countries (e.g. Liechtenstein) allow only citizens by descent to have dual citizenship, but require naturalized citizens to renounce their old citizenship.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n== Subnational citizenship ==\n* Under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are [[United States nationality law|citizens of the United States]] {{em|and of the [[U.S. state|State]] wherein they are deemed to reside}}. Certain rights accrue as an incident of state citizenship and access to federal courts [[Diversity jurisdiction|can sometimes be determined]] on State citizenship. In addition, [[tribal sovereignty]] affords members (\"citizens\") of [[federally recognized tribes]] (\"nations\") a status comparable to local citizenship.\n* Switzerland has a [[Swiss nationality law|three-tier system of citizenship]] - Confederation, canton and commune (municipality).\n* Although considered part of the United Kingdom for [[British nationality law|British nationality]] purposes, the Crown Dependencies of [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]] and the [[Isle of Man]] have local legislation restricting certain employment and housing rights to those with \"local status\". Although the British citizenship of people from these islands gives them full citizenship rights when in the United Kingdom, it does not give them the rights that British citizenship generally confers when in other parts of the [[European Union]] (for example, the right to reside and work). In a similar way, a number of British Overseas Territories have a concept of \"[[belonger status]]\" for their citizens, in addition to their existing British citizenship.\n* Citizens of the People's Republic of China may be permanent residents of the Hong Kong or Macau [[Special Administrative Region]]s, or have [[hukou system|household registration ''(hukou)'']] somewhere in [[mainland China]].

Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, Malaysian citizenship was withdrawn from Singapore citizens, and all Singapore citizens became citizens of the new Republic of Singapore.\n\n* The Constitution of [[Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir|Jammu & Kashmir]] allowed on citizens of the state special privileges i.e. purchase of property, government jobs etc. However the Government of India [[Indian revocation of Jammu and_Kashmir's special status|revoked]] [[article 370|Article 370 of the Constitution of India]] which lead to single citizenship over the country.\n\n== Supra-national citizenship ==\n* In [[European Union]] law, there is the concept of [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizenship]] which flows from the Maastricht treaty which created a legal identity for the European Community and granted citizenship to all current and future citizens of a member state. An EU citizen is [[Freedom of movement for workers|free to live and to work]] in another EU country for an unlimited period of time, but member states may reserve the right to vote in national elections, stand for national election, become a public servant in highly sensitive ministries (Defence for example), etc. only for their citizens, and in highly limited circumstances, may deport or refuse entry to citizens of other EU states. An EU state may place restrictions on the free movement rights of citizens of newly admitted states for several years, such provisions remain in force mostly for nationals of [[Croatia]] (no later than 2020); in the past, and to a lesser extent, such provisions also affected [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]].\n* The [[Nordic Passport Union]], containing [[Denmark]] (including Faroe Islands and Greenland, unlike the EU), [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] (including Svalbard Islands) and [[Finland]], allow citizens of members to travel across their borders without requiring Passports (just IDs), although this has been frozen for some borders (mainly between Denmark and the respective country) in response to the [[European migrant crisis]]. However, other provisions allowing citizens of members to live, study and work in each other's countries is still active. Citizens of members are often eligible for fast track processing to citizenships of other Members, with varying degrees of recognition/tolerance of dual citizenship among the states.\n* The [[United Kingdom]] recognises a [[Commonwealth citizen]]ship for the citizens of the member states of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The United Kingdom allows non-nationals who are Commonwealth citizens to vote and stand for election while resident there, while most other Commonwealth countries make little or no distinction between citizens of other Commonwealth nations and citizens of non-Commonwealth nations.\n* [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] nations (the republics of the former [[Soviet Union]]) are often eligible for fast track processing to citizenships of other CIS countries, with varying degrees of recognition/tolerance of dual citizenship among the states.\n\n== Effects and potential issues ==\nIt is often observed that dual citizenship may strengthen ties between migrants and their countries of origin and increase their propensity to [[Remittance|remit]] funds to their communities of origin.<ref>Schuck, Peter H. 2002.

They assert that the fact that a second citizenship can be obtained without giving anything up (such as the loss of public benefits, welfare, healthcare, retirement funds, and job opportunities in the country of origin in exchange for citizenship in a new country) both trivializes what it means to be a citizen<ref>[http://www.cis.org/articles/2001/paper20/renshondual.pdf Renshon, Stanley; \"Dual Citizenship and American National Identity\"] Center for Immigration Studies 2001.</ref> and nullifies the consequential, transformational, and psychological change that occurs in an individual when they go through the naturalization process.<ref>[http://www.davechen.net/2010/03/naturalization-oath-ceremony-and-what.html \"The Naturalization Oath Ceremony, and What It Means To Be a U.S. Citizen\"], davechen.net; accessed October 25, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn effect, this approach argues, the self-centered taking of an additional citizenship contradicts what it means to be a citizen in that it becomes a convenient and painless means of attaining improved economic opportunity without any real consequences and can just as easily be discarded when it is no longer beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elecpress.monash.edu.au/pnp/cart/download/free.php?paper=16|title=Monash University Research Repository - People and Place}}</ref> Proponents argue that dual citizenship can actually encourage political activity providing an avenue for immigrants who are unwilling to forsake their country of origin either out of loyalty or due to a feeling of separation from the mainstream society because of language, culture, religion, or ethnicity.<ref>[http://www.migrationpolicy.org/transatlantic/docs/Faist-FINAL.pdf Faist, Thomas; Gerdes, Jurgen (Bielefeld University) \"Dual Citizenship in an Age of Mobility\"], migrationpolicy.org, 2008; accessed October 25, 2015.</ref>\n\nAlthough, it may be noted that some countries have discriminatory immigration policies towards Citizens of a Single Citizen state. For example, Singaporean Citizens of Indian descent (A rather large part of Singaporean demographics) can apply for PIO (Person of Indian Origin) and then OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) cards, which gives the same rights as Indian Citizenship apart from voting and standing for election.

New Zealand's \"Permanent Resident Visa\" does not ever expire, for example, but there are very few countries that do this. Most countries make keeping Permanent Residence conditional on you showing \"sufficient ties\" to the country in question. This varies wildly, for example, the UK just ask for you to be present in the United Kingdom once every two years, Belgium is 1 year (extended to 6 if the person holding Type B PR is residing in the EU) and Singapore requires permission to leave, and has a time limit on this permission (if either of these are ignored, PR expires){{citation needed|date=January 2019|reason=See [[WP:V]]. Also, since this para makes time sensitive assertions, [[WP:DATED]] needs to be complied with -- including the use of {{tl|as of}} templates.}}\n\nA 2007 academic study concluded that dual citizens had a negative effect on the assimilation and political connectedness of first-generation Latino immigrants to the United States:<ref name=2007study />\n\n* 32% less likely to be fluent in English\n* 18% less likely to identify as \"American\"\n* 19% less likely to consider the US as their homeland\n* 18% less likely to express high levels of civic duty\n* 9% less likely to register to vote\n* 15% less likely to have ever voted in a national election\n\nThe study also noted that although dual nationality is likely to disconnect immigrants from the American political system and impede assimilation, the initial signs suggest that these effects seem to be limited almost exclusively to the first generation (although it is mentioned that a full assessment of dual nationality beyond the first generation is not possible with present data).<ref name=2007study>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121006164103/http://mailer.fsu.edu/~jstaton/costlyc.pdf Staton, Jeffrey K.

The reason for this is twofold:\n* The United States is a \"civic\" nation and not an \"ethnic\" nation. American citizenship is not based on belonging to a particular ethnicity, but on political loyalty to American democracy and values. Regimes based on ethnicity, which support the doctrine of perpetual allegiance as one is always a member of the ethnic nation, are not concerned with assimilating non-ethnics since they can never become true citizens. In contrast, the essence of a civic nation makes it imperative that immigrants assimilate into the greater whole as there is not an \"ethnic\" cohesiveness uniting the populace.<ref name=\"commdocs.house.gov\">[http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/judiciary/hju23690.000/hju23690_0.htm 2006 Dual Citizenship, Birthright Citizenship, and the meaning of Sovereignty] Hearing before the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims of the Committee on the Judiciary. 109th Congress, First Session, September 29, 2005, Serial No. 109\u201363.</ref>\n* The United States is an immigrant nation. As immigration is primarily directed at family reunification and refugee status rather than education and job skills, the pool of candidates tends to be poorer, less educated,<ref>[http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/jtf/JTF_ImmigrantsEducationJTF.pdf Public Policy Institute of California: \"Immigrants and Education\"] June 2008.</ref> and consistently from less stable countries (either non-democracies or fragile ones) with less familiarity or understanding of American values, making their assimilation both more difficult and more important.<ref name=\"commdocs.house.gov\"/>\n\nThe degree of angst over the effects of dual citizenship seemingly corresponds to a country's model for managing immigration and ethnic diversity:\n* The differential exclusionary model, which accepts immigrants as temporary \"guestworkers\" but is highly restrictive with regard to other forms of immigration and to naturalisation of immigrants. Many countries in Asia such as [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and the countries of the [[Middle East]] tend to follow this approach.\n* The [[assimilationist]] model, which accepts that immigrants obtain citizenship, but on the condition that they give up some or all cultural, linguistic, or social characteristics that differ from those of the majority population. [[Europe]] is the primary example of this model, where immigrants are usually required to learn the official language, and cultural traditions such as [[Islamic dress]] are often barred in public spaces (see [[Immigration to Europe]]).<ref>''[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/11/religion.uk Netherlands moves toward total ban on Muslim veils]'', Guardian, November 11, 2006.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110406075143/http://business.highbeam.com/2165/article-1G1-90102843/globalisation-multiculturalism-and-individualism-swedish Globalisation, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies: \"Multiculturalism and Individualism: the Swedish Debate on Dual Citizenship\"] July 1, 2002.</ref> \n* The [[multicultural]] model, which grants immigrants access to citizenship and to equal rights without demanding that they give up cultural, linguistic, or intermarriage restrictions or otherwise pressure them to integrate or inter-mix with the mainstream population.

Contrary to common misconceptions, dual citizenship in itself is not the major problem in obtaining or retaining [[security clearance]] in the United States. As a matter of fact, if a security clearance applicant's dual citizenship is \"based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country\", that can be a mitigating condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/security/blforeignpref.htm |title=Security Clearance Guidelines: Foreign Preference |publisher = military.about.com|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> However, taking advantage of the entitlements of a non-US citizenship can cause problems. For example, possession or use of a foreign [[passport]] is a condition disqualifying one from security clearance and \"is not mitigated by reasons of personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country\" as is explicitly clarified in a Department of Defense policy memorandum which defines a guideline requiring that \"any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official permission for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/doha/policyinterpmemo.pdf|title=Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign preference Adjucitative Guideline|date=August 16, 2000|author=Arthur L.

It has been reported that some US citizens have relinquished US citizenship in order to avoid possible taxes, the expense and complexity of compliance, or because they have been deemed unacceptable to financial institutions in the wake of [[FATCA]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/world/americas/17iht-expat.3928621.html |title=Americans abroad are giving up citizenship for lower taxes|newspaper=International Herald Tribune |author=Doreen Carvajal|date=December 17, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1983238,00.html |title=Why More U.S. Expatriates Are Turning In Their Passports|author=Helena Bachmann|date=April 20, 2010|publisher=time.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/14/opinion/an-american-tax-nightmare.html?_r=0 |title=An American Tax Nightmare|author=Stu Haugen|date=May 13, 2015 |newspaper=nytimes.com}}</ref>\n\nA person with multiple citizenship may have a tax liability to his country of residence and also to one or more of his countries of citizenship; or worse, if unaware that one of his citizenships created a tax liability, that country may consider the person to be a tax evader. Many countries and territories have signed [[tax treaty|tax treaties]] or agreements for avoiding [[double taxation]].\n\nStill, there are cases in which a person with multiple citizenship will owe tax solely on the basis of holding one such citizenship. For example, consider a person who holds both Australian and United States citizenship, lives and works in Australia. He would be subject to Australian taxation, because Australia taxes its residents, and he would be subject to U.S. taxation because he holds US citizenship. In general, he would be allowed to subtract the Australian income tax he paid from the US tax that would be due. In addition, the US will allow some parts of foreign income to be exempt from taxation; for instance, in 2006 the [[foreign earned income#2555|foreign earned income exclusion]] allowed up to US$82,400 of foreign salaried income to be exempt from [[income tax]] (in 2014, this was increased to US$97,600).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=97130,00.html |title=Foreign Earned Income Exclusion}}</ref> This exemption, plus the credit for foreign taxes paid mentioned above, often results in no US taxes being owed, although a US tax return would still have to be filed. In instances where the Australian tax was less than the US tax, and if there was income that could not be exempted from US tax, the US would expect any tax due to be paid.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe United States [[Internal Revenue Service]] has excluded some regulations such as [[Alternative Minimum Tax]] (AMT) from tax treaties that protect double taxation. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In its current format even if US citizens are paying income taxes at a rate of 56%, far above the maximum US marginal tax rate, the citizen can be subject to US taxes because the calculation of the AMT does not allow full deduction for taxes paid to a foreign country. Other regulations such as the post date of foreign mailed tax returns are not recognized and can result in penalties for late filing if they arrive at the IRS later than the filing date. However, the filing date for overseas citizens has a two-month automatic extension to June 15.<ref>US Internal Revenue Service: U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad</ref>\n\n\"If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien residing overseas, or are in the military on duty outside the U.S., on the regular due date of your return, you are allowed an automatic 2-month extension to file your return and pay any amount due without requesting an extension.

If you are unable to file your return by the automatic 2-month extension date, you can request an additional extension to October 15 by filing Form 4868 before the automatic 2-month extension date.

The right of countries to act in this fashion is protected via the [[Master Nationality Rule]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nMultiple citizens who travel to a country that claims them as a citizen may be required to enter or leave the country on that country's passport. For example, a [[United States Department of State]] web page on dual nationality contains the information that most US citizens, including dual nationals, must use a US passport to enter and leave the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/citizenship-and-dual-nationality/dual-nationality.html|accessdate=2015-01-19|title=US State Department Services Dual Nationality|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref> Under the terms of the South African Citizenship Act, it is an offence for someone aged at least 18 with South African citizenship and another citizenship to enter or depart the Republic of South Africa using the passport of another country.

Several countries have entered into a ''Protocol relating to Military Obligations in Certain Cases of Double Nationality'' established at [[The Hague]], 12 April 1930. The protocol states \"A person possessing two or more nationalities who habitually resides in one of the countries whose nationality he possesses, and who is in fact most closely connected with that country, shall be exempt from all military obligations in the other country or countries. This exemption may involve the loss of the nationality of the other country or countries.\" The protocol has several provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b38c10.html|title=Refworld - Protocol Relating to Military Obligations in Certain Cases of Double Nationality|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|website=Refworld}}</ref>\n\n===Healthcare===\nThe right to healthcare in countries with a [[public health]] service is often discussed in relation to immigration but is a non-issue as far as nationality is concerned. The right to use public health services may be conditioned on nationality and/or on legal residency. For example, anyone legally resident and employed in the UK is entitled to use the [[National Health Service]]; non-resident British citizens visiting Britain do not have this right, unless they are UK state pensioners who hold a UK S1 form.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Dominant and effective nationality ==\nThe potential issues that dual nationality can pose in international affairs has long been recognized, and as a result, international law recognizes the concept of \"dominant and effective nationality\", under which a dual national will hold only one dominant and effective nationality for the purposes of international law to one nation that holds their primary national allegiance, while any other nationalities are subordinate. The theory of dominant and effective nationality emerged as early as 1834. Customary international law and precedent have since recognized the idea of dominant and effective nationality, with the [[Nottebohm case]] providing an important shift. The [[International Court of Justice]] defines effective nationality as a \"legal bond having as its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties\". International tribunals have adopted and used the principle. Under customary international law, tribunals dealing with questions involving dual nationality must determine the effective nationality of the dual national by determining to which nation the individual has more of a \"genuine link\". Unlike dual nationality, one may only be the effective national of a single nation, and different factors are taken into consideration to determine effective nationality, including habitual residence, family ties, financial and economic ties, cultural integration, participation in public life, armed forces service, and evidence of sentiment of national allegiance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.emory.edu/eilr/content/volume-25/issue-3/comments/nationalities-citizenship-case-anwar-al-aulaqi.html|title=Dueling Nationalities: Dual Citizenship, Dominant and Effective Nationality, and the Case of Anwar al-Aulaqi - Emory University School of Law - Atlanta, GA|first=Abraham U.|last=Kannof|website=Emory University School of Law}}</ref>\n\n== Dual citizenship by region ==\n=== Africa ===\nDual citizenship is allowed in Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Cabo Verde, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zambia.

Some countries (e.g., Argentina, Bolivia) do not allow their citizens to renounce their citizenship, so they keep it even when naturalizing in a country that forbids dual citizenship. Most countries in the region observe unconditional ''jus soli'', i.e. a child born there is regarded as a citizen even if the parents are not. Some countries, such as the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Uruguay, allow renunciation of citizenship only if it was involuntarily acquired by birth to non-citizen parents. \n\nDual citizenship is restricted or forbidden in Cuba, Haiti, [[Suriname]], and Guyana.\n\n=== Asia-Pacific ===\nMost countries in the Asia-Pacific region restrict or forbid dual citizenship.

However, under EU rules, a citizen of one EU or EFTA country can live and work indefinitely in the other EU and EFTA countries.

On September 15, 2015, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that [[EU countries]] can refuse to pay unemployment benefits to immigrants who have lost their job even if they are citizens of other EU countries. The judge stated that EU rules allow member states to refuse unemployment benefits to people from other EU nations to stop them becoming \"an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State\". This backs up a November 2014 ruling, in which the court ruled that \"poverty immigrants\" who came to Germany just to receive social security benefits were not entitled to receive them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-can-cut-welfare-for-jobless-eu-nationals-court-rules/a-18715169|title=Germany can cut welfare for jobless EU nationals, court rules |date=15 September 2015|author=Deutsche Welle|publisher=dw.com}}</ref>\n\nWithin the EU, mandatory military service exists, at least in peacetime, only in Austria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, and Greece (In all countries but Cyprus, alternative service is available).

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

Later author's notes claimed that someone hacked into Gilesbie's account and wrote chapters 39 and 40.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nThe true identity of the author became subject to wide speculation, and since the publication of the final chapter, various individuals have claimed to have written the work in jest or as a hoax.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Due to its \"systematically terrible\" quality, the work is often believed to be a [[satire]] or [[parody]] of fan fiction.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nAt the same time, the \"exceedingly complicated\" details of the work, including a series of related online accounts outside of FanFiction.net and the effort of writing a work of such length, led to a \"consensus\" among users of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] \u2014 a website notorious for online trolling and dedicated to cataloging \"internet culture\" \u2014 that it would be too difficult to fake and that Gilesbie was writing sincerely, a sentiment apparently shared by other online communities who mocked the author.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> [[Brad Kim]], editor of [[Know Your Meme]], supported the work as genuine, citing his experiences with writing workshops on [[LiveJournal]] and [[Xanga]] where he encountered similar works, as \"these were the kinds of things that would be formulated by a high-school teenager in the early 2000s\".<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Writing for [[Vulture.com]], Abraham Riesman wrote that \"[t]he mystery of the authorship of 'My Immortal' \u2014 even in this privacy-averse age \u2014 appears unsolvable.\"<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nA series of videos were uploaded to a [[YouTube]] account named ''xXblo0dyxkissxX'' in 2008 and 2009, with their most recent video being uploaded in 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJWq0j9vfGc|title=Guess Who's Back?|date=15 January 2016}}</ref> in which two [[goth (subculture)|goths]] named Tara and Raven discuss their lives.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice. In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet's most beloved \u2014 and notorious \u2014 fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''[[Handbook for Mortals]]'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html|title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list?|work=LA Times|author=Jessica Roy|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Italie>{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

In 1968, an American journalist, [[Jonathan Schell]], wrote that in the Vietnamese province of Quang Ngai, where the M\u1ef9 Lai massacre occurred, up to 70% of all villages were destroyed by the air strikes and artillery bombardments, including the use of napalm; 40% percent of the population were refugees, and the overall civilian casualties were close to 50,000 a year.<ref>Schell, Jonathan.

Two other letters to this effect from enlisted soldiers to military leaders in 1971, all signed \"Concerned Sergeant\", were uncovered within declassified National Archive documents. The letters describe common occurrences of civilian killings during population pacification operations. Army policy also stressed very high body counts and this resulted in dead civilians being marked down as combatants. Alluding to indiscriminate killings described as unavoidable, the commander of the 9th Infantry Division, then Major General [[Julian Ewell]], in September 1969, submitted a confidential report to Westmoreland and other generals describing the countryside in some areas of Vietnam as resembling the [[Battle of Verdun|battlefields of Verdun]].<ref name=\"Turse\">{{cite journal|last=Turse|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick Turse|title=A My Lai a Month|journal=The Nation|year=2008|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/my-lai-month}}</ref><ref name=\"Nelson\">{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Deborah|title=The War Behind Me: Vietnam Veterans Confront the Truth about '''U.S.''' War Crimes|publisher=Basic Books|date=3 November 2008|location=New York|isbn=0-465-00527-6|url=https://archive.org/details/warbehindmevietn00nels_0}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1969, the [[United States Army Provost Marshal General|Office of Provost Marshal General of the Army]] began to examine the evidence collected by the Peers inquiry regarding possible criminal charges.

Although the entire pizza is very thick, in traditional Chicago-style deep-dish pizzas, the crust itself is thin to medium in thickness.\n\nDeep-dish pizza is baked in an iron skillet or a round, steel pan that is more similar to a cake or pie pan than a typical pizza pan. The pan is oiled in order to allow for easy removal as well as to create a [[deep frying|fried]] effect on the outside of the crust. In addition to ordinary wheat flour, the pizza dough may contain corn meal, [[semolina]], or food coloring, giving the crust a distinctly yellowish tone. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.\n\nThe thick layer of toppings used in deep-dish pizza requires a longer baking time (typically 30\u201345 minutes), which could burn cheese or other toppings if they were used as the top layer of the pizza. Because of this, the toppings are assembled \"upside-down\" from their usual order on a pizza. The crust is covered with cheese (generally sliced [[mozzarella]]), followed by various meat options such as [[pepperoni]] or [[Italian sausage|sausage]], the latter of which sometimes is in a solid patty-like layer. Other toppings such as [[onion]]s, [[mushroom]]s, and [[bell pepper]]s are then also used. An uncooked sauce, typically made from crushed canned tomatoes, is added as the finishing layer; though sometimes, a sprinkling of [[Parmesan]] cheese is added for extra flavor.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> It is typical that when ordered for carry-out or delivery, the pizza is uncut, as this prevents moisture from the sauce and toppings from soaking into the crust, causing the pie to become soggy.\n\nSome Chicago deep-dish pizza restaurants ship their pizzas, partially baked and frozen, within the continental United States.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chicago: city guide|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Karla|last2=Cavalieri|first2=Nate|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2008|isbn=1-74104-767-6|pages=122}}<!--| accessdate = 2010-09-06 --></ref><ref>[http://www.tastesofchicago.com/category/Lou_Malnatis_Pizza Lou Malnati's Deep Dish Pizza]</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Deep-dish pizza\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Pizzeria Uno Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from [[Pizzeria Uno]]\nFile:Chicago-style-pizza-03.jpg |Deep-dish pizza from [[Lou Malnati's]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Stuffed pizza==\n[[File:Chicago-style-pizza-01.jpg|left|thumb|Stuffed pizza from Giordano's]]\nBy the mid-1970s, two Chicago chains, [[Chicago Franchise Systems, Inc.|Nancy's Pizza]], founded by Rocco Palese,<ref>{{cite news |first=Louisa |last=Chu |date=September 19, 2016 |title=Family's Stuffed-Pizza Dynasty Began with a Fight |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/foodfocus/ct-nancys-pizza-profile-food-0921-20160916-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |access-date=September 21, 2016}}</ref> and [[Giordano's Pizzeria]], operated by brothers Efren and Joseph Boglio, began experimenting with deep-dish pizza and created the stuffed pizza.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Pollack | first = Penny |author2=Jeff Ruby | title = Everybody Loves Pizza | publisher = Emmis Books | date = 2005 | pages = 33 | isbn = 1-57860-218-1 }}</ref> Palese based his creation on his mother's recipe for scarciedda, an Italian [[Easter]] pie from his hometown of [[Potenza]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nancyspizza.com/our-story.html|title=Our Story|website=Nancy's Pizza|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref> ''Chicago Magazine'' articles featuring Nancy's Pizza and Giordano's stuffed pizza popularized the dish.\n\nStuffed pizzas are often even deeper than deep-dish pizzas, but otherwise, it can be hard to see the difference until it is cut into.
