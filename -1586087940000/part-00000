This migration occurred very early to [[Himachal Pradesh|Himachal]], [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]], the present-day state of Punjab, the Punjab province and the North-West Frontier area. Most Mahajans speak [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Dogri language|Dogri]], and live in the regions of the Punjab, Jammu, Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Mahajans of Jammu and Punjab were landlords, traders, and businessmen who were highly respected and had a major influence in their society. The Mahajan community of [[North India]] were considered to be high caste and consequently given the name Mahajan. These Mahajans were powerful both economically and socially. Many of them engaged in money lending. In present-day India, Mahajans are primarily concentrated in the Jammu region of the state. The majority of Mahajans in Punjab came from [[Pakistan]] after the [[Partition of India|Partition of]] India. Mahajans of Punjab were farmers. Most Punjabi Mahajans took part in sending their oldest son to the [[khalsa]] army, hence there are some [[Sikhs|Sikh]] Mahajans e.g. Tarlochan Singh Mahajan.

Many individuals of these sub-castes gather at their respective religious centers. Each sub caste believes in its own deity, known as devte. Mahajans created temples at these centers, the temples being located in many locations such as Batala, Punjab to Jammu and Gurdaspur. Temple for Lanagrs is at Kalith in Jammu. This gathering is called a Mail of Mahajans. At this gathering, Mahajans worship their deity after taking a bath at the temple. These temples are managed by a managing committee called sabha. This committee organizes langar on the day of gathering. Certain other family ceremonies are also performed in these temples by the persons belonging to the caste such as sutra and mundan ceremonies. There is no particular day fixed for these ceremonies. This day of mail (gathering) is celebrated on the occasion of Sri Guru Nanak Dev's Birthday, usually in November. Like Phagetra Mahajans gather at Changia village in Arnia sector (R.S. Pura) for their Mail on Dussehra and beotra family gather in Batala on Guru Nanak's birthday every year.

[[Genealogical Office|The Chief Herald of Ireland's Office is part of the National Library of Ireland.]] The arms granted to McAuliffe are described as; Per Fess Wavy Or and Azure, in chief two mermaids supporting a tower Proper and in base a bar wavy of the first and on a wreath of the colours the Crest a garb Or surmounted by a salmon naient Proper. The motto Semper Anticus, Semler Apertus. \n\nThe design of the grant is made in consultation with the grantee and each element is symbolic. On many tours of the Mansion House to the public, McAuliffe explained that the wavy lines represent the Rivers Feale (where is paternal grandfather is from in Co.Kerry, the river Fionnghlas where the family moved to in Finglas and the river Liffey representing his time as Lord Mayor. The Tower acts as a heraldic charge representing the city and it is supported by two mermaids. The mermaids are taken from a previous grant of arms to Dermot McAuliffe of the McAuliffe Regiment of Spain. The arms were granted in 1709 when Dermot McAuliffe and many other Gaelic exiles sought to join armies in Europe. The arms provided proof of his status as a gentleman, which seems to have been a necessary qualification for officers in the Spanish army. The Mermaids were brought into Paul McAuliffe's grant of arms on the advice of the Herald as they are an uncommon charge in Irish heraldry and provided a historic reference.  \n\nThe Crest which surmounts the helmet and wreath is a sheaf of wheat representing the generations of bakers in his mother's family and the salmon representing the generations of fishermen on the river Feale in his father family. The motto Semper Anticus, Semper Apertus is translated as Always Forward, Always Open.  \n\nThe Shield, Crest and Motto of each Lord Mayor since Daniel O'Connell have been hung in the Oak Room of the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House on Dawson Street]] and remain there on permanent display to the public. \n<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-civ}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[Nial Ring]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title  = [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]]\n       |years  = 2019\u20132020}}\n{{s-aft|after  = Tom Brabazon}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Current TDs}}\n{{Fianna F\u00e1il}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McAuliffe, Paul}}\n[[Category:Local councillors in Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:People from Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:Lord Mayors of Dublin]]\n[[Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the National College of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Progressive Democrats politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the 33rd D\u00e1il]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Irish politician}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Use Irish English|date=May 2016}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| name                = Paul McAuliffe\n| image               = File:Paul McAuliffe in eu.jpg\n| office              = [[Teachta D\u00e1la]]\n| constituency        = [[Dublin North-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-West]]\n| birth_name          = \n| birth_date          = 1977\n| birth_place         = [[Finglas]], [[Dublin]], Ireland\n| death_date          = \n| death_place         = \n| nationality         = [[Irish people|Irish]]\n| party               = [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]\n| children            = \n| alma_mater          = [[National College of Ireland]]|\n| termstart           = February 2020\n| termend             = End of the 33rd D\u00e1il\n| termstart2          = June 2019\n| termend2            = Februray 2020\n| preceding2          = Niall Ring\n| succeeded2          = Tom Brabazon\n| office2             = 350th Lord Mayor of Dublin\n}}\n\n'''Paul McAuliffe''' (born 8 February 1977) is an Irish [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] politician who has been a [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) for the [[Dublin North-West (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-West]] constituency since the [[2020 Irish general election|2020 general election]].<ref name=\"oireachtas_db\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Paul-McAuliffe.D.2020-02-08/|title=Paul McAuliffe|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref> He also served as the 350th [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]] from June 2019 to February 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your North West Area Councillors|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/main-menu-your-council-your-area-north-west-area-north-west-area-committee/your-north-west-area|work=Dublin City Council|accessdate=15 May 2017|language=en}}</ref> and Dublin City Councillor from 2009 - 2020. \n\n==Dublin City Council==\nMcAuliffe was first elected to [[Dublin City Council]] in [[2009 Irish local elections|2009]], for [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] in the [[Ballymun]]-[[Finglas]] local electoral area.<ref>{{cite web|title=2009 Local - Ballymun Finglas|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2009L&cons=1977|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=15 May 2017}}</ref> He was re-elected following the [[2014 Irish local elections|2014]] local election for the enlarged Ballymun local electoral area.

She was joined by other recipents including Greta Thorburg whose award was collected by Irish Fridays for Future activists, Dublin Bus Disability Access Programme, Colum Bell, Karen and Joe Hughes and the 100th Liffey Swim.\n\n==Grant of Arms==\n\nAs with all Lord Mayors of Dublin, McAuliffe received a coat of arms or more properly a grant of arms from the Chief Herald of Ireland in 2019. [[Genealogical Office|The Chief Herald of Ireland's Office is part of the National Library of Ireland.]] The arms granted to McAuliffe are described as; Per Fess Wavy Or and Azure, in chief two mermaids supporting a tower Proper and in base a bar wavy of the first and on a wreath of the colours the Crest a garb Or surmounted by a salmon naient Proper. The motto Semper Anticus, Semler Apertus. \n\nThe design of the grant is made in consultation with the grantee and each element is symbolic. On many tours of the Mansion House to the public, McAuliffe explained that the wavy lines represent the Rivers Feale (where is paternal grandfather is from in Co.Kerry, the river Fionnghlas where the family moved to in Finglas and the river Liffey representing his time as Lord Mayor. The Tower acts as a heraldic charge representing the city and it is supported by two mermaids. The mermaids are taken from a previous grant of arms to Dermot McAuliffe of the McAuliffe Regiment of Spain. The arms were granted in 1709 when Dermot McAuliffe and many other Gaelic exiles sought to join armies in Europe. The arms provided proof of his status as a gentleman, which seems to have been a necessary qualification for officers in the Spanish army. The Mermaids were brought into Paul McAuliffe's grant of arms on the advice of the Herald as they are an uncommon charge in Irish heraldry and provided a historic reference.  \n\nThe Crest which surmounts the helmet and wreath is a sheaf of wheat representing the generations of bakers in his mother's family and the salmon representing the generations of fishermen on the river Feale in his father family. The motto Semper Anticus, Semper Apertus is translated as Always Forward, Always Open.  \n\n[[File:McauliffepaulCoatofArms.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|the grant of arms or coat of arms of Paul McAuliffe]]\n\nThe Shield, Crest and Motto of each Lord Mayor since Daniel O'Connell have been hung in the Oak Room of the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House on Dawson Street]] and remain there on permanent display to the public. \n\n[[File:CoatofarmsMH.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Oak Room of the Mansion House,Dublin. ]]\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-civ}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[Nial Ring]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title  = [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]]\n       |years  = 2019\u20132020}}\n{{s-aft|after  = Tom Brabazon}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Current TDs}}\n{{Fianna F\u00e1il}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McAuliffe, Paul}}\n[[Category:Local councillors in Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:People from Dublin (city)]]\n[[Category:Lord Mayors of Dublin]]\n[[Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the National College of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Progressive Democrats politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the 33rd D\u00e1il]]\n", "name_user": "S.Didam", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo, Images", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McAuliffe"}

'''2012\u201313 [[HockeyAllsvenskan]] season''' was the 8th season of the HockeyAllsvenskan (14th including seasons under the name \"Allsvenskan\"), the second-highest level of [[ice hockey in Sweden]]. The regular season began on 12 September 2012 and ended on 2 March 2013, with the following playoffs and Kvalserien tournaments running until 5 April 2013.<ref name=\"Regular season schedule\">http://stats.swehockey.se/ScheduleAndResults/Schedule/3005 ([[Swedish Ice Hockey Association]]).

Meanwhile, 13th- and 14th-ranked [[Tingsryds AIF]] and [[Karlskrona HK]] were forced to defend their places in HockeyAllsvenskan for the 2013\u201314 season.\n\nThis HockeyAllsvenskan season is notable for the participation of players from the [[National Hockey League]] during the [[2012\u201313 NHL lockout]].\n\nHockeyAllsvenskan had an average attendance of 3,227 spectators in 2012\u201313, comfortably the highest attendance of any second-tier league in Europe (beating the [[2nd Bundesliga (ice hockey)|2nd Bundesliga]] with 2267), also making HockeyAllsvenskan the eighth most attended European hockey league. It was a 23.8 percent increase over the [[2011\u201312 HockeyAllsvenskan season|2011\u201312 season's]] attendance average.<ref name=\"IIHF Attendance\">IIHF.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were about 400 Jain temples. The ancient Jain temples of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of Jain temples in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the Jain temples at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15th century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to Nagda. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><br>\nAs on 2017, three main Jain temples remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of Rishabhdevbhagwan and one of Parshvnathbhagwan. Jain temples at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why Jain temples at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara Jain temples? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\"/> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujaratvisited these temples during 11th and 13th centuries ADand were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the Jain temples. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022\u201364), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the Jain temples designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11th and 13th century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) Jain temples. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11th century founded Amber, [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12th century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10th century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12th century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. <br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra.

Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15th Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14th century till Jhalas came in 15th century?

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were about 400 Jain temples. The ancient Jain temples of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of Jain temples in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the Jain temples at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15th century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to Nagda. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><br>\nAs on 2017, three main Jain temples remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of Rishabhdevbhagwan and one of Parshvnathbhagwan. Jain temples at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, Rishabhdev and Parshvnath. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 Tirthankara with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why Jain temples at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara Jain temples? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\"/> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujaratvisited these temples during 11th and 13th centuries ADand were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the Jain temples. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022\u201364), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the Jain temples designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11th and 13th century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) Jain temples. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11th century founded Amber, [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12th century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10th century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12th century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. <br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13th century.

People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14th Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting MaharanaHamir Singh I.Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15th Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14th century till Jhalas came in 15th century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet tobe researched and established.<br>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Rajasthan]]\n", "name_user": "Berek", "label": "safe", "comment": "Rajasthan", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delwara"}

In a recurring role in the 1990s, Winters played the title character's grandmother on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Roseanne]]''.\n\nHer final film roles were supporting ones: she played a restaurant owner and mother of an overweight cook in ''[[Heavy (film)|Heavy]]'' (1995) with [[Liv Tyler]] and [[Debbie Harry]] for [[James Mangold]], an aristocrat in ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1996), starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[John Malkovich]], and an embittered nursing home administrator in 1999's ''[[Gideon (film)|Gideon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/208074%7C139852/Shelley-Winters/|work=Turner Classic Movies|title=Overview for Shelley Winters|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}</ref> She was also in comedies such as ''Backfire!''

Her stormy marriages, her romances with famous stars, her forays into politics and feminist causes kept her name before the public. She delighted in giving provocative interviews and seemed to have an opinion on everything.\" That led to a second career as a writer. Though not a conventional beauty, she claimed that her acting, wit, and \"chutzpah\" gave her a love life to rival Monroe's. Her alleged \"conquests\" included [[William Holden]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Errol Flynn]], and [[Marlon Brando]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shelley: Also known as Shirley|author=Winters, Shelley|publisher=Morrow|year=1980|isbn=978-0-688-03638-6|url=https://archive.org/details/shelleyalsoknown00wint}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Shelley Winters by John Engstead.png|thumb|Winters in publicity photo, circa 1950]]\n\nWinters was married four times.

Kirkland, a minister of the [[Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness]], also performed non-denominational last rites for Winters.\n\nWinters also had a much-publicized romance with [[Farley Granger]] that became a long-term friendship (according to their respective autobiographies).{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} She starred with him in the 1951 film ''[[Behave Yourself!]]'', as well as in a 1957 television production of [[A.

Her stormy marriages, her romances with famous stars, her forays into politics and feminist causes kept her name before the public. She delighted in giving provocative interviews and seemed to have an opinion on everything.\" That led to a second career as a writer. Though not a conventional beauty, she claimed that her acting, wit, and \"chutzpah\" gave her a love life to rival Monroe's. Her alleged \"conquests\" included [[William Holden]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Errol Flynn]], and [[Marlon Brando]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shelley: Also known as Shirley|author=Winters, Shelley|publisher=Morrow|year=1980|isbn=978-0-688-03638-6|url=https://archive.org/details/shelleyalsoknown00wint}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Shelley Winters by John Engstead.png|thumb|Winters in publicity photo, circa 1950]]\n\nWinters was married four times.
