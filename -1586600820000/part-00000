Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers.<ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp. 3\u201322</ref>\n\nThe nation's small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders.

The number of colleges skyrocketed in waves, during the early and mid 20th century. State universities grew from small institutions of fewer than 1000 students to campuses with 40,000 more students, with networks of regional campuses around the state. In turn, regional campuses broke away and became separate universities. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nTo handle the explosive growth of K\u201312 education, every state set up a network of teachers' colleges, beginning with Massachusetts in the 1830s. After 1950, they became state colleges and then state universities with a broad curriculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMajor new trends included the development of the [[Junior college#United States|junior colleges]]. They were usually set up by City school systems starting in the 1920s.<ref>Leonard V. Koos, ''The Junior College Movement'' (1924).</ref> By the 1960s they were renamed as \"community colleges.\"\n\nJunior colleges grew from 20 in number In 1909, to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each. Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students. The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white-collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four-year colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however, many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis. Community colleges continue as open-enrollment, low-cost institutions with a strong component of vocational education, as well as a low-cost preparation for transfer students into four-year schools. They appeal to a poorer, older, less prepared element.<ref>Jesse P. Bogue, ed.

Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers.<ref>Frederick Rudolph, ''The American College and University: A History'' (1991) pp. 3\u201322</ref>\n\nThe nation's small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders. Elite colleges became increasingly exclusive and contributed little upward social mobility.

The number of colleges skyrocketed in waves, during the early and mid 20th century. State universities grew from small institutions of fewer than 1000 students to campuses with 40,000 more students, with networks of regional campuses around the state. In turn, regional campuses broke away and became separate universities. {{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nTo handle the explosive growth of K\u201312 education, every state set up a network of teachers' colleges, beginning with Massachusetts in the 1830s. After 1950, they became state colleges and then state universities with a broad curriculum.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMajor new trends included the development of the [[Junior college#United States|junior colleges]]. They were usually set up by City school systems starting in the 1920s.<ref>Leonard V. Koos, ''The Junior College Movement'' (1924).</ref> By the 1960s they were renamed as \"community colleges.\"\n\nJunior colleges grew from 20 in number In 1909, to 170 in 1919. By 1922, 37 states had set up 70 junior colleges, enrolling about 150 students each. Meanwhile, another 137 were privately operated, with about 60 students each. Rapid expansion continued in the 1920s, with 440 junior colleges in 1930 enrolling about 70,000 students. The peak year for private institutions came in 1949, when there were 322 junior colleges in all; 180 were affiliated with churches, 108 were independent non-profit, and 34 were private Schools run for-profit.<ref>Cohen and Brawer, ''The American Community College'' (4th ed. 2003) pp. 13\u201314</ref>\n\nMany factors contributed to rapid growth of community colleges. Students parents and businessmen wanted nearby, low-cost schools to provide training for the growing white-collar labor force, as well as for more advanced technical jobs in the blue collar sphere. Four-year colleges were also growing, albeit not as fast; however, many of them were located in rural or small-town areas away from the fast-growing metropolis. Community colleges continue as open-enrollment, low-cost institutions with a strong component of vocational education, as well as a low-cost preparation for transfer students into four-year schools. They appeal to a poorer, older, less prepared element.<ref>Jesse P. Bogue, ed.

Additionally, the first tier is characterized by selective participation, since only the elite programs in their sport are able to participate; some colleges offer [[athletic scholarship]]s to intercollegiate sports competitors. The second tier includes [[intramural]] and recreational sports clubs, which are available to more of the student body. Competition between student clubs from different colleges, not organized by and therefore not representing the institutions or their faculties, may also be called \"intercollegiate\" athletics or simply college sports.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosandich|first=Thomas|title=Collegiate Sports Programs: A Comparative Analysis|page=476|publisher=Education|date=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe largest collegiate sport governing body in the first tier is the NCAA, which regulates athletes of 1,268 institutions across the US and Canada.

The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:\n*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.\n*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric \"L\" letter, which stands for Laude.\n*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.\n*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The ''Velodromo'' uses a [[geothermal exchange heat pump]] as its [[air conditioning]] system, which provides [[energy conservation]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.comune.milano.it/pls/milano/!turismo?pid=21504&_first=8 Milano per Me - Itinerari - Conoscere Milano - Ravizza<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[marble]] statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.\n*Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the [[Library]] building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus [[chapel]] ''\"San Ferdinando\"'', and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other [[extracurricular]] activities.\n*In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielm\u00f6 R\u00f6ntgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice [[Grafton Architects]] which designed the innovative building.

The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:\n*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.\n*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric \"L\" letter, which stands for Laude.\n*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.\n*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The ''Velodromo'' uses a [[geothermal exchange heat pump]] as its [[air conditioning]] system, which provides [[energy conservation]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.comune.milano.it/pls/milano/!turismo?pid=21504&_first=8 Milano per Me - Itinerari - Conoscere Milano - Ravizza<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[marble]] statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.\n*Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the [[Library]] building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus [[chapel]] ''\"San Ferdinando\"'', and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other [[extracurricular]] activities.\n*In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielm\u00f6 R\u00f6ntgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice [[Grafton Architects]] which designed the innovative building.

It opened in U.S. theaters in September 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nSixty-year-old magnate Robert Miller ([[Richard Gere]]) manages a [[hedge fund]] with his daughter Brooke ([[Brit Marling]]) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit. It's revealed he's having an affair with a much younger woman, gallery owner Julie Cote ([[Laetitia Casta]]), whom he has also helped financially. \n\nHowever, unbeknownst to his daughter, wife Ellen ([[Susan Sarandon]]) and most of his other employees, Miller has [[cooking the books|cooked his company's books]] and borrowed money from an associate in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud. The associate who lent him $412 million wants to call in the loan, but Miller says he needs the money to stay in his account until the audit for the sale is complete. The company who he's in talks with to purchase his company appears to be stalling the process. They schedule a meeting at a restaurant during which contracts are to be signed, and it's the same night as Julie's gallery show, which Robert has promised to attend. Julie continually texts and calls Miller throughout the meeting, which drags on as they wait for James Mayfield ([[Graydon Carter]]) to arrive. When it's clear Mayfield won't be attending the meeting, Robert leaves in disgust, but not before his daughter informs him that she's found some financial discrepancies in old ledgers.\n\nMiller finally goes to Julie's opening, but she tells him to leave. He comes back and they fight, but he asks her to drive her car with him to a place of his upstate, and they leave to do so. When Miller dozes off briefly, the car crashes and Julie is killed. An injured Miller almost calls 911, then realizes he must cover up his involvement. He flees the scene as the car bursts into flames. \n\nMiller calls Jimmy Grant ([[Nate Parker]]), a twenty-three-year-old man from [[Harlem]] with a criminal record, who is the son of Robert's driver (now deceased). After being driven home by Grant, Miller removes security camera DVDs that show him coming home, burns his bloody clothing, then drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife. The next day, Miller immediately discusses the \"hypothetical\" situation he's in with his friend and lawyer (Stuart Margolin), who advises the hypothetical person to turn themselves in, as the lies required to keep the story a secret will pile up. The lawyer also mentions that he's heard through the grapevine that Miller's wife has visited an estate lawyer, which surprises Miller. Later Miller is questioned by police detective Bryer ([[Tim Roth]]). Bryer is keen on arresting Robert for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together. \n\nBrooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.\n\nJimmy is arrested and placed before a [[grand jury]] but still refuses to admit to helping Miller. Miller once again contemplates turning himself in. Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good. Eventually, the sale is closed, but Miller finds a way to avoid being charged. He proves that Bryer had fabricated evidence. The case against Jimmy is dismissed, and the detective is ordered not to go near him. \n\nMiller meets with someone who tells him that the audit is complete and puts his company in the clear for the sale. Later, Miller's wife confronts Miller and offers him a deal: if he signs a separation agreement that gives all voting rights and money to her foundation and their daughter, she'll lie and say she was with him all night of the accident. If he refuses, she'll tell the truth. Miller protests the situation.\n\nThe scene switches to Mayfield discussing a secondary audit that has been performed on Miller's company. The report does show a problem, but Mayfield chooses to ignore it and go forward with the purchase of Miller's company.\n\nIn the final scene, Robert addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter. As Robert approaches the podium to deliver his speech the screen cuts to black, leaving his decision ambiguous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/richard-gere-why-his-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-56736|title=Richard Gere: Why My Cheating 'Arbitrage' Financier Is Like Bill Clinton|first=Steve|last=Pond|work=The Wrap|accessdate=2012-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/arbitrage/user-reviews/Richard+Gere+movie-56UKB42KYADOBOAAAR4ZB23W3Y.html|first=Jeannie|last=M|title=Richard Gere movie|work=Yahoo Movies|date=2012-09-26|accessdate=2012-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Robert Miller\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Ellen Miller\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Det.

It opened in U.S. theaters in September 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nSixty-year-old magnate Robert Miller ([[Richard Gere]]) manages a [[hedge fund]] with his daughter Brooke ([[Brit Marling]]) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit. It's revealed he's having an affair with a much younger woman, gallery owner Julie Cote ([[Laetitia Casta]]), whom he has also helped financially. \n\nHowever, unbeknownst to his daughter, wife Ellen ([[Susan Sarandon]]) and most of his other employees, Miller has [[cooking the books|cooked his company's books]] and borrowed money from an associate in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud. The associate who lent him $412 million wants to call in the loan, but Miller says he needs the money to stay in his account until the audit for the sale is complete. The company who he's in talks with to purchase his company appears to be stalling the process. They schedule a meeting at a restaurant during which contracts are to be signed, and it's the same night as Julie's gallery show, which Robert has promised to attend. Julie continually texts and calls Miller throughout the meeting, which drags on as they wait for James Mayfield ([[Graydon Carter]]) to arrive. When it's clear Mayfield won't be attending the meeting, Robert leaves in disgust, but not before his daughter informs him that she's found some financial discrepancies in old ledgers.\n\nMiller finally goes to Julie's opening, but she tells him to leave. He comes back and they fight, but he asks her to drive her car with him to a place of his upstate, and they leave to do so. When Miller dozes off briefly, the car crashes and Julie is killed. An injured Miller almost calls 911, then realizes he must cover up his involvement. He flees the scene as the car bursts into flames. \n\nMiller calls Jimmy Grant ([[Nate Parker]]), a twenty-three-year-old man from [[Harlem]] with a criminal record, who is the son of Robert's driver (now deceased). After being driven home by Grant, Miller removes security camera DVDs that show him coming home, burns his bloody clothing, then drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife. The next day, Miller immediately discusses the \"hypothetical\" situation he's in with his friend and lawyer,(Stuart Margolin)  who advises the hypothetical person to turn themselves in, as the lies required to keep the story a secret will pile up. The lawyer also mentions that he's heard through the grapevine that Miller's wife has visited an estate lawyer, which surprises Miller. Later Miller is questioned by police detective Bryer ([[Tim Roth]]). Bryer is keen on arresting Robert for manslaughter and begins to put the pieces together. \n\nBrooke discovers the financial irregularities, realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.\n\nJimmy is arrested and placed before a [[grand jury]] but still refuses to admit to helping Miller. Miller once again contemplates turning himself in. Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good. Eventually, the sale is closed, but Miller finds a way to avoid being charged. He proves that Bryer had fabricated evidence. The case against Jimmy is dismissed, and the detective is ordered not to go near him. \n\nMiller meets with someone who tells him that the audit is complete and puts his company in the clear for the sale. Later, Miller's wife confronts Miller and offers him a deal: if he signs a separation agreement that gives all voting rights and money to her foundation and their daughter, she'll lie and say she was with him all night of the accident. If he refuses, she'll tell the truth. Miller protests the situation.\n\nThe scene switches to Mayfield discussing a secondary audit that has been performed on Miller's company. The report does show a problem, but Mayfield chooses to ignore it and go forward with the purchase of Miller's company.\n\nIn the final scene, Robert addresses a banquet honoring him for his successful business, with his wife at his side and his daughter introducing him to the audience but their false embrace on the stage signifies that he has lost the respect and admiration of his daughter. As Robert approaches the podium to deliver his speech the screen cuts to black, leaving his decision ambiguous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/richard-gere-why-his-cheating-arbitrage-financier-bill-clinton-56736|title=Richard Gere: Why My Cheating 'Arbitrage' Financier Is Like Bill Clinton|first=Steve|last=Pond|work=The Wrap|accessdate=2012-12-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/arbitrage/user-reviews/Richard+Gere+movie-56UKB42KYADOBOAAAR4ZB23W3Y.html|first=Jeannie|last=M|title=Richard Gere movie|work=Yahoo Movies|date=2012-09-26|accessdate=2012-12-23}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Robert Miller\n* [[Susan Sarandon]] as Ellen Miller\n* [[Tim Roth]] as Det.

Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone [[angiotensin]]ogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten [[amino acid]] residues known as [[angiotensin I]]. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]] (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into [[angiotensin II]].

ATI increases for the same reason; ATII and aldosterone decrease. [[Bradykinin]] increases because of less inactivation by ACE.\n\nUnder normal conditions, angiotensin II has these effects:\n* Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (enlargement) induced by ATII may lead to increased blood pressure and hypertension. Further, constriction of the [[efferent arteriole]]s of the kidney leads to increased perfusion pressure in the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]].\n* It contributes to [[ventricular remodeling]] and [[ventricular hypertrophy]] of the heart through stimulation of the [[proto-oncogene]]s [[c-fos]], [[c-jun]], [[c-myc]], [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-B), through fibrogenesis and apoptosis (programmed cell death). \n* Stimulation by ATII of the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[aldosterone]], a hormone that acts on kidney tubules, causes sodium and chloride ions retention and potassium excretion. Sodium is a \"water-holding\" ion, so water is also retained, which leads to increased blood volume, hence an increase in blood pressure.\n* Stimulation of the posterior pituitary to release [[vasopressin]] (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention.

ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, leaving AT<sub>2</sub> receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.\n\n===Use in combination===\nThe combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. This 'dual blockade' may be more effective than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways.

The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, [[Kevin K. F. Ng]] and [[John R.

Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF [[teprotide]] (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect ''in vivo''. Teprotide had limited clinical value as a result of its peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. [[David Cushman]], [[Miguel Ondetti]] and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.\n\nCaptopril was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.\n\nIn 1991, Japanese scientists created the first milk-based ACE inhibitor, in the form of a fermented milk drink, using specific cultures to liberate the [[tripeptide]] [[isoleucine]]-[[proline]]-proline (IPP) from the dairy protein.

Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as [[hypotension]], low [[Distal convoluted tubule|distal tubule]] [[Sodium in biology|sodium]] concentration, decreased blood volume and high [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] tone trigger the release of the enzyme [[renin]] from the cells of [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone [[angiotensin]]ogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten [[amino acid]] residues known as [[angiotensin I]]. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]] (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into [[angiotensin II]]. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]] is found in the [[pulmonary circulation]] and in the [[endothelium]] of many blood vessels.<ref>Human Physiology, Silverthorn (Pearson Benjamin Cummings 2004){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent [[vasoconstrictor]]).\n\n===Effects===\nACE inhibitors block the conversion of Angiotensin I (ATI) to Angiotensin II (ATII).<ref name=\"Ogbru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm |title=ACE Inhibitors (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) |accessdate=2010-03-20 |author =Ogbru O |work=MedicineNet.com |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc. | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100326095902/http://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm| archivedate= 26 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> They thereby lower [[arteriole|arteriolar]] resistance and increase venous capacity; decrease [[cardiac output]], [[cardiac index]], stroke work, and [[stroke volume|volume]]; lower resistance in blood vessels in the kidneys; and lead to increased [[natriuresis]] (excretion of sodium in the urine).\nRenin increases in concentration in the blood as a result of negative feedback of conversion of ATI to ATII. ATI increases for the same reason; ATII and aldosterone decrease. [[Bradykinin]] increases because of less inactivation by ACE.\n\nUnder normal conditions, angiotensin II has these effects:\n* Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (enlargement) induced by ATII may lead to increased blood pressure and hypertension. Further, constriction of the [[efferent arteriole]]s of the kidney leads to increased perfusion pressure in the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]].\n* It contributes to [[ventricular remodeling]] and [[ventricular hypertrophy]] of the heart through stimulation of the [[proto-oncogene]]s [[c-fos]], [[c-jun]], [[c-myc]], [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-B), through fibrogenesis and apoptosis (programmed cell death). \n* Stimulation by ATII of the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[aldosterone]], a hormone that acts on kidney tubules, causes sodium and chloride ions retention and potassium excretion. Sodium is a \"water-holding\" ion, so water is also retained, which leads to increased blood volume, hence an increase in blood pressure.\n* Stimulation of the posterior pituitary to release [[vasopressin]] (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention. If ADH production is excessive in heart failure, Na<sup>+</sup> level in the plasma may fall (hyponatremia), and this is a sign of increased risk of death in heart failure patients.\n* A decrease renal protein kinase C\n\nDuring the course of ACE inhibitor use, the production of ATII is decreased,{{noteTag|name=|1=ACE inhibitors don't appear to permanently reduce ATII plasma level after cessation of taking it.

ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, leaving AT<sub>2</sub> receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.\n\n===Use in combination===\nThe combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. This 'dual blockade' may be more effective than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways.

Skeggs]] and his colleagues in 1956. Brazilian scientist [[S\u00e9rgio Henrique Ferreira]] reported a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) present in the venom of ''[[Bothrops jararaca]]'', a South American pit viper, in 1965.<ref name=\"pmid14302350\">{{cite journal | author = Ferreira SH | title = A bradykinin-potentiating factor (bpf) present in the venom of bothrops jararaca | journal = Br J Pharmacol Chemother | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 163\u20139 | date = February 1965 | pmid = 14302350 | pmc = 1704050 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1965.tb02091.x | url =  }}</ref> Ferreira then went to [[John Vane]]'s laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow with his already-isolated BPF. The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, [[Kevin K. F. Ng]] and [[John R. Vane]] showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II ''in vivo''. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.<ref name=\"Kevin\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II | journal = Nature | volume = 216 | issue = 5117 | pages = 762\u20136 | year = 1967 | pmid = 4294626 | doi = 10.1038/216762a0 | bibcode = 1967Natur.216..762N }}</ref>\n\nBradykinin is rapidly inactivated in the circulating blood, and it disappears completely in a single pass through the pulmonary circulation. Angiotensin I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation because of its conversion to angiotensin II. Furthermore, angiotensin II passes through the lungs without any loss. The inactivation of bradykinin and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme.<ref name=\"Kevin2\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Fate of Angiotensin I in the Circulation | journal = Nature | volume = 218 | issue = 5137 | pages = 144\u201350 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4296306 | doi = 10.1038/218144a0 | bibcode = 1968Natur.218..144N }}</ref> In 1970, Ng and Vane, using BPF provided by Ferreira, showed the conversion is inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.<ref name=\"Kevin3\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Some Properties of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme in the Lung in vivo | journal = Nature | volume = 225 | issue = 5238 | pages = 1142\u20134 | year = 1970 | pmid = 4313869 | doi = 10.1038/2251142b0 | bibcode = 1970Natur.225.1142N }}</ref>\n\nBPFs are members of a family of peptides whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF [[teprotide]] (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect ''in vivo''. Teprotide had limited clinical value as a result of its peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. [[David Cushman]], [[Miguel Ondetti]] and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.\n\nCaptopril was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.\n\nIn 1991, Japanese scientists created the first milk-based ACE inhibitor, in the form of a fermented milk drink, using specific cultures to liberate the [[tripeptide]] [[isoleucine]]-[[proline]]-proline (IPP) from the dairy protein. [[Valine]]-proline-proline (VPP) is also liberated in this process\u2014another milk tripeptide with a very similar chemical structure to IPP. Together, these peptides are now often referred to as [[lactotripeptides]]. In 1996, the first human study confirmed the blood pressure-lowering effect of IPP in fermented milk.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hata Y, Yamamoto M, Ohni M, Nakajima K, Nakamura Y, Takano T | title = A placebo-controlled study of the effect of sour milk on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 767\u201371 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8901799 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/64.5.767 }}</ref> Although twice the amount of VPP is needed to achieve the same ACE-inhibiting activity as the originally discovered IPP, VPP also is assumed to add to the total blood pressure lowering effect.<ref name=\"pmid7673515\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura Y, Yamamoto N, Sakai K, Takano T | title = Antihypertensive effect of sour milk and peptides isolated from it that are inhibitors to angiotensin I-converting enzyme | journal = [[Journal of Dairy Science]] | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1253\u20137 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7673515 | doi = 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(95)76745-5 }}</ref>\nSince the first lactotripeptides discovery, more than 20 human clinical trials have been conducted in many different countries.<ref name=\"pmid19061526\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Boelsma E, Kloek J | title = Lactotripeptides and antihypertensive effects: a critical review | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 101 | issue = 6 | pages = 776\u201386 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19061526 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114508137722 }}</ref>\n\n==Note==\n{{notefoot}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Angiotensin II receptor blocker]]\n** [[Discovery and development of angiotensin receptor blockers]]\n* [[Loop diuretic]], also used to treat [[congestive heart failure (CHF)|CHF]]\n* [[Renin inhibitor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|ACE inhibitors}}\n* [http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ahtpdb AHTPDB] a comprehensive platform for analysis and presentation of antihypertensive peptides.
