Also known as \"Tecno Soft\", the company was founded in February 1980 as '''Sasebo Microcomputer Center''', before changing its name to Technosoft in 1982. The company primarily dealt with software for Japanese personal computers, including graphic toolsets and image processing software. Technosoft's first ventures into the video game market were with ''Snake & Snake'' and ''Feedback'', both released in 1982, before seeing success with titles such as ''[[Thunder Force (video game)|Thunder Force]]'' (1983) and ''Plasma Line'' (1984).\n\nTechnosoft became largely profitable during the late-1980s and early-1990s, largely in part due to the widespread popularity of their ''Thunder Force'' and ''Herzog'' franchises. However, later in the decade, Technosoft began to largely diminish as profits began to slump, before ultimately being acquired and folded into Japanese pachinko manufacturer Twenty-One Company in late 2001. Twenty-One began to release products in 2008 under the Technosoft brand, and sold the entirety of its video game library to [[Sega Sammy]] in 2016. The Technosoft name continues to be in use in the present day as the name for Twenty-One's research and development division, and as a brand name for various products such as soundtrack albums.\n\n== History ==\nSome staff members left Technosoft to start the game development companies [[Arsys Software]] in 1985 (founded by Kotori Yoshimura, creator of ''[[Thunder Force]]'' and ''Plazma Line''), CAProduction in 1993, and [[Ganbarion]] in 1999.\n\nIn 2006, the URL for Technosoft was registered and updated.

The first match played under the name FC Ruggell was in the Liechtenstein Junior Tournament in Triesen, which Ruggell's Youth C-Team took place in, with their first match happening on 7 September 1958. The following year the club competed in a senior league match for the first time, spending the 1959/60 season in the [[4. Liga (Switzerland)|Swiss 4. Liga]]. In 1963 the club reached the final of the Liechtenstein Cup for the first time, losing 3:1 against [[FC Schaan]]. The team won its first honour in 1970, winning the league title in 4.

Liga for the first time in their history. The club remained in the 3. Liga for several years after, never getting into any promotion playoffs, however did have some success in the [[Swiss Cup]] (which clubs from Liechtenstein were allowed to participate in at the time. In 1975, they beat the second division teams of Altst\u00e4tten and Rorschach but were knocked out in the third round by [[FC Triesen]]. During the 1980s Ruggell's youth teams had more success, with the youth C, D and E teams winning their competitions, however the senior team wasn't performing as well, typically finishing in the lower end of the 3. Liga table. In 1981 they reached the Liechtenstein Cup Final for the fourth time, after a 5\u20130 victory over [[FC Vaduz|Vaduz]] in the semi final, but lost to FC Balzers 3-0 after [[Extra Time|extra time]].\n\n=== Playoffs and Decline (1983\u20132000) ===\n1983 was the 25th anniversary of the founding of FC Ruggell, with several sporting events done in celebration. At the end of the 1984\u201385 season, the club was joint on points with the league leaders FC [[Diepoldsau]], after winning a crucial final day match against local rivals FC Schann. This meant that a final match between the two teams was scheduled to decide who had won the division, with Ruggell winning the match, giving them their first 3. Liga title and their first time in the playoffs for promotion to the 2. Liga, however they failed to get promoted. In the 1988\u201389 season, the club had a women's team for the first time.\n\nIn the 1994\u201395 season, the club was relegated back to the 4. Liga, however was promoted back to the 3.

Upon release, the film received mainly unfavourable reviews but was a moderate financial success, grossing $37.5 million on a $12 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in modern-day, four childhood friends, anti-social sci-fi author Samantha \"Sam\" Albertson ([[Demi Moore]]), glitz and glamour-loving actress Tina \"Teeny\" Tercell ([[Melanie Griffith]]), dry humored gynecologist Dr. Roberta Martin ([[Rosie O'Donnell]]), and content homemaker Chrissy DeWitt ([[Rita Wilson]]), reunite in their small [[Indiana]] hometown of Shelby, to support Chrissy, heavily pregnant and expected to give birth to her first child any day. Narrated by Sam, the story focuses on the summer of 1970, when the group, lead by her twelve-year-old self ([[Gaby Hoffmann]]) sought to earn enough money to purchase a [[tree house]] to place in the backyard of Chrissy's parents' home in their affluent suburban neighborhood, called the Gaslight Addition, and how they overcame major personal struggles, Sam in her parents' divorce and her mother's subsequent dating, Teeny ([[Thora Birch]]) in her pursuit of stardom and good looks, Roberta in overcoming the death of her mother and the [[body dysmorphia]] she experiences due to her developing [[breast]]s, and Chrissy's naivety about sex and life in general due to her mother's overprotective nature. Also, the girls, motivated by Sam's interest in the occult, regularly participate in seances, and that summer in particular, they focused on contacting the spirit of young man whose gravestone read simply \"Dear Johnny,\" who died 25 years prior, in 1945.\n\nThe story flashes back to 1970 when the girls had two goals: saving enough money to buy a treehouse and avoiding the Wormer brothers. One night, they sneak out to the cemetery to perform a seance. A cracked tombstone convinces them they have resurrected the spirit of a young boy identified only as Dear Johnny, who died in 1945 at the age of 12. Intrigued, they search for information at the library but find nothing.\n\nLater, while heading for the library in a nearby town, the girls spy the Wormer brothers skinny-dipping in the lake. To retaliate for a prank the boys played on them, the girls steal their clothes, tossing them onto the road while riding off. At the library, Roberta discovers an article about her mother being killed in a car accident: she was hit head on, trapped in the car for an hour, and then later died of massive head trauma and internal bleeding- facts previously unknown to her. Samantha finds an obituary that briefly mentions Dear Johnny and his mother tragically dying, but many pages are missing, leaving the cause of their deaths a mystery.\n\nWhile riding back to their town, the girls encounter a hitchhiking Vietnam veteran. The girls ask him questions about the war and his time there, he is predominantly evasive and tells them their parents aren\u2019t always right- something that Samantha loudly agrees with.\n\nThe girls then visit local psychic Wiladene, who determines Dear Johnny was murdered. On their way home, the girls meet up with local neighborhood kids at a pick up game of softball. A local boy insults Roberta who begins fighting him; after the fight is broken up, the boy insults Roberta\u2019s deceased mother and Samantha tackles him to begin fighting again.\n\nSamantha goes home and unexpectedly meets Bud Kent, a man her newly single mother invited to dinner for their first date. Samantha is stand offish to Bud who accidentally spills wine on his shirt; Samantha\u2019s mother gives Bud one of Samantha's father's old bowling shirts he had left behind. Upset, Sam storms out and flees to Teeny's house where she is on the roof of her house watching Love Story at the next door drive-in theater. They hang out in the treehouse display at the store, where Samantha confesses her parents are getting divorced. Teeny comforts her, then breaks her favorite necklace in two, giving one half to Samantha as a \"best friends for life\" bracelet. On their way home during a thunderstorm, Samantha loses her bracelet in a storm drain. When she climbs down to retrieve it, the water rises, trapping her. Crazy Pete, a local old man who only comes out at night to ride his bicycle, pulls her out. He asks them why they\u2019re afraid of him, and after they tell him it\u2019s creepy that he only comes out at night, he says he prefers not to be around people. Grateful for his actions, the girls now see him differently. At the same time, Roberta is playing basketball in her driveway when Scott Wormer suddenly arrives. They briefly play ball, and question why they fight all the time before sharing a kiss. Later, adult Samantha notes that Roberta has stopped taping her breasts after this happened. \n \nThe girls consult Samantha's grandmother about Dear Johnny's death. Her grandmother declines to discuss the murders, saying it took her a long time to forget about that tragedy. After her grandmother leaves with friends to play bingo, Samantha and the others climb through a window to get into the attic where Samantha's grandfather had collected and saved old newspapers. They discover from a newspaper article that Johnathan Simms and his mother Beverly Anne Simms were shot and killed when they interrupted a burglary; father and husband Peter Simms came home to find the bodies. Roberta becomes upset and angry that two innocent people were killed and that her mother died violently, contrary to what she was told. Samantha announces that her parents are getting divorced, and the girls make a pact to always be there for one another.\n\nTo put Dear Johnny's soul to rest, the girls go to the cemetery to perform another seance. His tombstone suddenly rises surrounded by bright light. A figure appears from behind, but it is only the groundskeeper who chastises the girls for \"playing\" in the cemetery and explains that the tombstone was damaged and is being replaced and he was the one who cracked it. Realizing they never resurrected Dear Johnny, they agree to stop the seances. While leaving, they notice \u201cCrazy\u201d Pete, and Samantha follows him back to the tombstone. Realizing that he is Dear Johnny's father, Peter Simms, she comforts him, while he advises her not to dwell on things. Some time after, the treehouse is finally bought, and Samantha narrates, \"The treehouse was supposed to bring us more independence. But what the summer actually brought was independence from each other.\"\n\nThe film returns to 1991, and Chrissy goes into labor and gives birth to a baby girl. Later, in their old treehouse, Roberta reveals that Crazy Pete died the previous year. They then discuss how happy they are in life and make another pact to visit more often.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main characters===\n*'''Samantha Albertson''' ([[Gaby Hoffmann]]/[[Demi Moore]]) narrates the film. As a girl, she is considered \"weird\", and believes in the paranormal and conducts the seances in the cemetery with her friends, who for the most part believe it to be all pretend. From the outside, her home life appears normal with her parents and younger sister, Angela. However, her parents had been having marital issues for some time now, much to the point that it had reached a level of consistency that never seemed to bother her. However, this came to an abrupt change when one night, her father moves out, and within a few weeks she learns her mother is seeing another man. As an adult, she is a popular science-fiction author who has commitment issues. At age 12, she was the most invested in the mystery of Dear Johnny, whose spirit the girls believe they have resurrected from his tombstone. She alone learns the truth behind his death, and receives valuable advice that later helps her come to terms with her current struggles in life.\n*'''Roberta Martin''' ([[Christina Ricci]]/[[Rosie O'Donnell]]) is the proclaimed tomboy of the girls, stemming primarily from her upbringing in a family consisting of her father and three older brothers, her mother having died in a car accident when she was four. As a girl, she tapes her breasts to flatten them, plays sports, and never hesitates to fight a boy. She usually leads the girls in their rivalry with the Wormer brothers, but eventually shares a kiss with Scott Wormer. Afterwards, she no longer tapes her breasts, indicating that she accepts that she is growing into a woman. Her struggle to come to terms with her mother's death is highlighted in the film when she fakes her own death before her friends by pretending to have drowned while they were swimming, as well as in another instance in which Samantha recalls her having jumped off the roof and pretended to have broken her neck earlier that summer. As an adult, she is a doctor (an [[obstetrician]]), and lives with her boyfriend. At the end of the film, she delivers Chrissy's baby. Although it is never shown or mentioned who her boyfriend is the film hints that it might be Scott Wormer.\n*'''Chrissy DeWitt''' ([[Ashleigh Aston Moore]]/[[Rita Wilson]]) was raised by an overbearing, fastidious mother (played by [[Bonnie Hunt]]) who sheltered her. Her naivete, particularly about all things sexual, is often laughed at by her friends. She is the \"good girl,\" who chastises the others for cussing (as children and adults). Being the most responsible, she closely monitors the \"tree house money\" they are saving. She always questions the others' schemes, but is fiercely loyal to them.  As an adult, she marries the nerdy Morton Williams, and they live in her childhood home and later have a baby girl. The pending birth of her first child brings Samantha and Teeny back to their hometown.\n*'''Tina \"Teeny\" Tercell''' ([[Thora Birch]]/[[Melanie Griffith]]) lives with her rich country-club parents who are rarely around, which according to Samantha's narration is, \"a typical upbringing for actors and pathological liars.\" She loves glamour, dressing up, and using makeup, and watches the films at the drive-in movie from her rooftop. Among the girls, she is the most interested in sexuality and boys and often flirts. She desires a bigger bust, and has breast implants when she's an adult. She is now a successful actress and has had multiple marriages. The limousine she arrives in is later used to transport Chrissy to the hospital when she goes into labor.\n\n===Supporting===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Devon Sawa]] as Scott Wormer, one of the Wormer brothers who bullies the girls but later reforms and shares a kiss with Roberta.\n*[[Lolita Davidovich]] as Mrs. Albertson, mother of Samantha and Angela who recently gets a divorce from her husband and gets a new boyfriend, Bud Kent.\n*[[Rumer Willis]] as Angela Albertson, (credited as Willa Glen) sister of Samantha who misses her father dearly but takes a quick liking to her mother's new boyfriend, Bud Kent.\n*[[Cloris Leachman]] as Grandma Albertson, mother of Mr. Albertson and grandmother of Samantha and Angela.

Its plot was considered overly familiar, sitcomlike, and too similar to ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]''.

A cracked tombstone convinces them they have resurrected the spirit of a young boy identified only as Dear Johnny, who died in 1945 at the age of 12. Intrigued, they search for information at the library but find nothing.\n\nLater, while heading for the library in a nearby town, the girls spy the Wormer brothers skinny-dipping in the lake. To retaliate for a prank the boys played on them, the girls steal their clothes, tossing them onto the road while riding off. At the library, Roberta discovers an article about her mother being killed in a car accident: she was hit head on, trapped in the car for an hour, and then later died of massive head trauma and internal bleeding- facts previously unknown to her. Samantha finds an obituary that briefly mentions Dear Johnny and his mother tragically dying, but many pages are missing, leaving the cause of their deaths a mystery.\n\nWhile riding back to their town, the girls encounter a hitchhiking Vietnam veteran. The girls ask him questions about the war and his time there, he is predominantly evasive and tells them their parents aren\u2019t always right- something that Samantha loudly agrees with.\n\nThe girls then visit local psychic Wiladene, who determines Dear Johnny was murdered. On their way home, the girls meet up with local neighborhood kids at a pick up game of softball. A local boy insults Roberta who begins fighting him; after the fight is broken up, the boy insults Roberta\u2019s deceased mother and Samantha tackles him to begin fighting again.\n\nSamantha goes home and unexpectedly meets Bud Kent, a man her newly single mother invited to dinner for their first date. Samantha is stand offish to Bud who accidentally spills wine on his shirt; Samantha\u2019s mother gives Bud one of Samantha's father's old bowling shirts he had left behind. Upset, Sam storms out and flees to Teeny's house where she is on the roof of her house watching Love Story at the next door drive-in theater. They hang out in the treehouse display at the store, where Samantha confesses her parents are getting divorced. Teeny comforts her, then breaks her favorite necklace in two, giving one half to Samantha as a \"best friends for life\" bracelet. On their way home during a thunderstorm, Samantha loses her bracelet in a storm drain. When she climbs down to retrieve it, the water rises, trapping her. Crazy Pete, a local old man who only comes out at night to ride his bicycle, pulls her out. He asks them why they\u2019re afraid of him, and after they tell him it\u2019s creepy that he only comes out at night, he says he prefers not to be around people. Grateful for his actions, the girls now see him differently. At the same time, Roberta is playing basketball in her driveway when Scott Wormer suddenly arrives. They briefly play ball, and question why they fight all the time before sharing a kiss. Later, adult Samantha notes that Roberta has stopped taping her breasts after this happened. \n \nThe girls consult Samantha's grandmother about Dear Johnny's death. Her grandmother declines to discuss the murders, saying it took her a long time to forget about that tragedy. After her grandmother leaves with friends to play bingo, Samantha and the others climb through a window to get into the attic where Samantha's grandfather had collected and saved old newspapers. They discover from a newspaper article that Johnathan Simms and his mother Beverly Anne Simms were shot and killed when they interrupted a burglary; father and husband Peter Simms came home to find the bodies. Roberta becomes upset and angry that two innocent people were killed and that her mother died violently, contrary to what she was told. Samantha announces that her parents are getting divorced, and the girls make a pact to always be there for one another.\n\nTo put Dear Johnny's soul to rest, the girls go to the cemetery to perform another seance. His tombstone suddenly rises surrounded by bright light. A figure appears from behind, but it is only the groundskeeper who chastises the girls for \"playing\" in the cemetery and explains that the tombstone was damaged and is being replaced and he was the one who cracked it. Realizing they never resurrected Dear Johnny, they agree to stop the seances. While leaving, they notice \u201cCrazy\u201d Pete, and Samantha follows him back to the tombstone. Realizing that he is Dear Johnny's father, Peter Simms, she comforts him, while he advises her not to dwell on things. Some time after, the treehouse is finally bought, and Samantha narrates, \"The treehouse was supposed to bring us more independence. But what the summer actually brought was independence from each other.\"\n\nThe film returns to 1991, and Chrissy goes into labor and gives birth to a baby girl. Later, in their old treehouse, Roberta reveals that Crazy Pete died the previous year. They then discuss how happy they are in life and make another pact to visit more often.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main characters===\n*'''Samantha Albertson''' ([[Gaby Hoffmann]]/[[Demi Moore]]) narrates the film. As a girl, she is considered \"weird\", and believes in the paranormal and conducts the seances in the cemetery with her friends, who for the most part believe it to be all pretend. From the outside, her home life appears normal with her parents and younger sister, Angela. However, her parents had been having marital issues for some time now, much to the point that it had reached a level of consistency that never seemed to bother her. However, this came to an abrupt change when one night, her father moves out, and within a few weeks she learns her mother is seeing another man. As an adult, she is a popular science-fiction author who has commitment issues. At age 12, she was the most invested in the mystery of Dear Johnny, whose spirit the girls believe they have resurrected from his tombstone. She alone learns the truth behind his death, and receives valuable advice that later helps her come to terms with her current struggles in life.\n*'''Roberta Martin''' ([[Christina Ricci]]/[[Rosie O'Donnell]]) is the proclaimed tomboy of the girls, stemming primarily from her upbringing in a family consisting of her father and three older brothers, her mother having died in a car accident when she was four. As a girl, she tapes her breasts to flatten them, plays sports, and never hesitates to fight a boy. She usually leads the girls in their rivalry with the Wormer brothers, but eventually shares a kiss with Scott Wormer. Afterwards, she no longer tapes her breasts, indicating that she accepts that she is growing into a woman. Her struggle to come to terms with her mother's death is highlighted in the film when she fakes her own death before her friends by pretending to have drowned while they were swimming, as well as in another instance in which Samantha recalls her having jumped off the roof and pretended to have broken her neck earlier that summer. As an adult, she is a doctor (an [[obstetrician]]), and lives with her boyfriend. At the end of the film, she delivers Chrissy's baby. Although it is never shown or mentioned who her boyfriend is the film hints that it might be Scott Wormer.\n*'''Chrissy DeWitt''' ([[Ashleigh Aston Moore]]/[[Rita Wilson]]) was raised by an overbearing, fastidious mother (played by [[Bonnie Hunt]]) who sheltered her. Her naivete, particularly about all things sexual, is often laughed at by her friends. She is the \"good girl,\" who chastises the others for cussing (as children and adults). Being the most responsible, she closely monitors the \"tree house money\" they are saving. She always questions the others' schemes, but is fiercely loyal to them.  As an adult, she marries the nerdy Morton Williams, and they live in her childhood home and later have a baby girl. The pending birth of her first child brings Samantha and Teeny back to their hometown.\n*'''Tina \"Teeny\" Tercell''' ([[Thora Birch]]/[[Melanie Griffith]]) lives with her rich country-club parents who are rarely around, which according to Samantha's narration is, \"a typical upbringing for actors and pathological liars.\" She loves glamour, dressing up, and using makeup, and watches the films at the drive-in movie from her rooftop. Among the girls, she is the most interested in sexuality and boys and often flirts. She desires a bigger bust, and has breast implants when she's an adult. She is now a successful actress and has had multiple marriages. The limousine she arrives in is later used to transport Chrissy to the hospital when she goes into labor.\n\n===Supporting===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Devon Sawa]] as Scott Wormer, one of the Wormer brothers who bullies the girls but later reforms and shares a kiss with Roberta.\n*[[Lolita Davidovich]] as Mrs. Albertson, mother of Samantha and Angela who recently gets a divorce from her husband and gets a new boyfriend, Bud Kent.\n*[[Rumer Willis]] as Angela Albertson, (credited as Willa Glen) sister of Samantha who misses her father dearly but takes a quick liking to her mother's new boyfriend, Bud Kent.\n*[[Cloris Leachman]] as Grandma Albertson, mother of Mr. Albertson and grandmother of Samantha and Angela.

Its plot was considered overly familiar, sitcomlike, and too similar to ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]''. Based on reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it received a 28% approval rating by critics, with an average score of 4.8/10, based on 18 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/now_and_then/|title=Rotten Tomatoes: Now and Then (1995)|work=rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> Despite the critical response, it was acclaimed by audiences and has garnered a large [[cult following]] since its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://decider.com/2019/08/06/now-and-then-stand-by-me-reviews-think-piece/|title=Why Isn\u2019t \u2018Now and Then\u2019 a Classic Like \u2018Stand By Me\u2019?|date=2019-08-06|website=Decider|language=en|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n[[Columbia Records]] released a soundtrack album on October 17, 1995.

Two of the songs are anachronistic for a story set in the summer of 1970: \"''Knock Three Times''\" was released in 1971, and \"''I'll Be There''\" was released on August 28, 1970, so that it would only have gotten airtime on the radio after the summer vacation was over.\n\n# \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\" \u2013 [[The Archies]] (2:45)\n# \"[[Knock Three Times]]\" \u2013 [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]] (2:54)\n# \"[[I Want You Back]]\" \u2013 [[The Jackson 5]] (2:53)\n# \"[[Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours]]\" \u2013 [[Stevie Wonder]] (2:39)\n# \"[[Band of Gold (Freda Payne song)|Band of Gold]]\" \u2013 [[Freda Payne]] (2:53)\n# \"[[Daydream Believer]]\" \u2013 [[The Monkees]] (2:49)\n# \"[[No Matter What (Badfinger song)|No Matter What]]\" \u2013 [[Badfinger]] (2:59)\n# \"[[Hitchin' a Ride (Vanity Fare song)|Hitchin' a Ride]]\" \u2013 [[Vanity Fare]] (2:55)\n# \"[[All Right Now]]\" \u2013 [[Free (band)|Free]] (5:29)\n# \"[[I'm Gonna Make You Love Me]]\" \u2013 [[Supremes]]/[[Temptations]] (3:06)\n# \"[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]\" \u2013 [[The Jackson 5]] (3:56)\n# \"Now and Then\" \u2013 [[Susanna Hoffs]] (5:34)\n\n[[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] issued an album of [[Cliff Eidelman]]'s score on October 24, 1995.\n\n# \"Main Title\" (3:05)\n# \"Remembrance\" (1:57)\n# \"A Secret Meeting\" (2:11)\n# \"On the Swing\" (1:26)\n# \"It's My Mom\" (2:32)\n# \"Spirits Are Here\" (2:17)\n# \"Sam's Dad Leaves\" (1:56)\n# \"It's a Girl\" (1:48)\n# \"Roberta Fakes Death\" (1:26)\n# \"Best Friends for Life\" (3:07)\n# \"Pete Saves Sam\" (2:29)\n# \"The Pact\" (3:10)\n# \"No More Seances\" (1:44)\n# \"Rest in Peace Johnny\" (4:22)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0114011}}\n*{{AllRovi movie|135694}}\n*{{Rotten Tomatoes|id=now_and_then}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Now And Then (Film)}}\n[[Category:1995 films]]\n[[Category:1990s buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:1990s coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:1990s female buddy films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:1990s teen drama films]]\n[[Category:American buddy comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American coming-of-age films]]\n[[Category:American female buddy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American teen comedy films]]\n[[Category:American teen drama films]]\n[[Category:Coming-of-age comedy films]]\n[[Category:Coming-of-age drama films]]\n[[Category:1995 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Demi Moore]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Cliff Eidelman]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1970]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1995]]\n[[Category:Films set in Indiana]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Savannah, Georgia]]\n[[Category:New Line Cinema films]]\n[[Category:Pregnancy films]]\n", "name_user": "REDMS7", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(njni)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_and_Then_(film)"}

The magazine started out as a [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] from the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''. ''National Lampoon'' magazine reached its height of popularity and critical acclaim during the 1970s, when it had a far-reaching effect on American humor and comedy. The magazine spawned [[National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)|films]], [[The National Lampoon Radio Hour|radio]], [[live theatre]], various sound recordings, and print products including books. Many members of the creative staff from the magazine subsequently went on to contribute creatively to successful media of all types.\n\nDuring the magazine's most successful years, [[parody]] of every kind was a mainstay; [[surrealist]] content was also central to its appeal. Almost all the issues included long text pieces, shorter written pieces, a section of actual news items (dubbed \"True Facts\"), [[cartoon]]s and [[comic strip]]s. Most issues also included \"Foto Funnies\" or [[Photonovel|fumetti]], which often featured nudity. The result was an unusual mix of intelligent, cutting-edge wit, combined with some crass, bawdy jesting.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/05/business/new-image-is-sought-by-lampoon.html | work=The New York Times | first=Deirdre | last=Carmody | title=New Image Is Sought By Lampoon | date=1990-12-05}}</ref>\nIn both cases, ''National Lampoon'' humor often pushed far beyond the boundaries of what was generally considered appropriate and acceptable. It was especially anarchic, satirically attacking what was considered holy and sacred. As co-founder [[Henry Beard]] described the experience years later: \"There was this big door that said, 'Thou shalt not.' We touched it, and it fell off its hinges.\"\n\nThe magazine declined during the late 1980s until it came under new management in 1989 when Hollywood producer, Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson, who starred in Animal House, took over the company in a hostile takeover. Against all odds, they increased the value of the company three fold taking the stock from $1.80 to $6.00. They sold the Company in the early 1990s when it became clear that Hollywood was unwilling to help reinvigorate the brand and it was kept alive minimally, but ceased publication altogether, in 1998.\n\n==About the magazine==\n''National Lampoon'' was started by Harvard graduates and ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' alumni [[Douglas Kenney|Doug Kenney]], [[Henry Beard]] and [[Robert Hoffman (businessman)|Robert Hoffman]] in 1969, when they first licensed the \"Lampoon\" name for a monthly national publication. [[The Harvard Lampoon]] was established in 1876 as a long-standing tradition of the campus, influencing the later National Lampoon Brand in its evolution from illustration heavy publications to satirical wit, ranging from short fiction to comic strips. The magazine's first issue was dated April 1970. The company that owned the magazine was called Twenty First Century Communications.\n\nAfter a shaky start for a few issues, the magazine rapidly grew in popularity. Like the ''Harvard Lampoon,'' individual issues had themes, including such topics as \"The Future,\" \"Back to School,\" \"Death,\" \"Self-Indulgence,\" and \"Blight.\" The magazine regularly reprinted material in \"best-of\" omnibus collections. Its writers joyfully targeted every kind of phoniness, and had no specific political stance, even though individual staff members had strong political views.\n\nThomas Carney, writing in New Times, traced the history and style of the National Lampoon and the impact it had on comedy's new wave. \"The National Lampoon,\" Carney wrote, \"was the first full-blown appearance of non-Jewish humor in years--not anti-Semitic, just non-Jewish. Its roots were W.A.S.P. and Irish Catholic, with a weird strain of Canadian detachment. . . . This was not Jewish street-smart humor as a defense mechanism; this was slash-and-burn stuff that alternated in pitch but moved very much on the offensive. It was always disrespect everything, mostly yourself, a sort of reverse deism.\"\n\n[[Image:TeddyVWad.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''National Lampoon'''s fake [[Volkswagen Beetle]] print advertisement mocking [[Ted Kennedy]]'s [[Chappaquiddick incident]].]]\n\n''National Lampoon'' was a monthly magazine for most of its publication history. Numerous \"special editions\" were also published and sold simultaneously on [[newsstand]]s. Some of the special editions were anthologies of reprinted material; others were entirely original. Additional projects included a calendar, a songbook, a collection of transfer designs for T-shirts, and a number of books. The magazine sold yellow binders with the Lampoon logo, designed to store a year's worth of issues.\n\n===Cover art===\nThe original art directors were cartoonist Peter Bramley and Bill Skurski, founders of New York's Cloud Studio, an alternative-culture outfit known at the time for its eclectic style. Bramley created the ''Lampoon'''s first cover and induced successful cartoonists [[Arnold Roth]] and [[Gahan Wilson]] to become regular contributors.\n\nBeginning with the eighth issue, the art direction of the magazine was taken over by [[Michael C. Gross]], who directed the look of the magazine until 1974. A number of the ''National Lampoon'''s most acerbic and humorous covers were designed or overseen by Gross, including:\n* Court-martialed [[Vietnam War]] mass-murderer [[William Calley]] sporting the guileless grin of [[Alfred E.

During his'' Lampoon'' tenure, Kleinman was also the art director of [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|''Heavy Metal'']] magazine, published by the same company. The best known of Kleinman's'' Lampoon ''covers were \"Stevie Wonder with 3-D Glasses\" painted by Sol Korby,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lampoon.rwinters.com/Lampoon1975.htm |date=July 1975 | title=rwinters.com}}</ref> a photographed \"Nose to The Grindstone\" cover depicting a man's face being pressed against a spinning grinder wheel for the ''Work'' issue, the \"JFK's First 6000 Days\" issue featuring a portrait of an old [[John F. Kennedy]], the \"Fat Elvis\" cover which appeared a year before [[Elvis Presley]] died, and many of the [[Mara McAfee]] covers done in a classic [[Norman Rockwell]] style. Kleinman designed the logos for ''[[Animal House]]'' and ''Heavy Metal.'' \nKleinman left in 1979 to open an ad agency.\n\nHe was succeeded by [[Skip Johnson]], the designer responsible for the ''[[Sunday Newspaper Parody]]'' and the \"Arab Getting Punched in the Face\" cover of the ''Revenge'' issue. Johnson went on to ''[[The New York Times]].'' He was followed by Michael Grossman, who changed the logo and style of the magazine.\n\nIn 1984, Kleinman returned as creative director and went back to the 1970s logo and style, bringing back many of the artists and writers from the magazine's heyday. He left four years later to pursue a career in corporate marketing. At that time, the ''National Lampoon'' magazine entered a period of precipitous decline.\n\n===Editorial===\nEvery regular monthly issue of the magazine had an editorial at the front of the magazine. This often appeared to be straightforward, but was always a parody. It was written by whoever was the editor of that particular issue, since that role rotated among the staff. A few issues were guest-edited.\n\n===Staff===\nThe magazine was an outlet for some notable writing talents, including [[Douglas Kenney]], [[Henry Beard]], [[George W. S. Trow]], [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]], [[P. J. O'Rourke]], [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[Chris Rush]], [[Sean Kelly (writer)|Sean Kelly]], [[Tony Hendra]], [[Brian McConnachie]], Gerald Sussman, [[Ellis Weiner]], [[Ted Mann]], Chris Cluess, [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Reiss]], Jeff Greenfield, [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and [[Ed Subitzky]].\n\nThe work of many important cartoonists, photographers, and illustrators appeared in the magazine's pages, including [[Neal Adams]], [[Gahan Wilson]], [[Robert Grossman]], Michael Sullivan, [[Ron Barrett]], Peter Bramley, [[Vaughn Bode]], [[Bruce McCall]], [[Rick Meyerowitz]], [[Warren Sattler]], [[M.

McClelland]].\n\nComedy stars [[John Belushi]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Brian Doyle Murray]], [[Harold Ramis]], and [[Richard Belzer]] first gained national attention for their performances in the National Lampoon's stage show and radio show. The first three subsequently went on to become part of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s original wave of [[Saturday Night Live cast|Not Ready for Primetime Players]], Bill Murray replaced Chase when Chase left ''SNL'' after the first season, and Brian Doyle Murray later appeared as an ''SNL'' regular.<ref>''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present'', eight ed. (2003), {{ISBN|9780345455420}}</ref> Harold Ramis went on to be a prolific director and writer working on such films as ''[[Animal House]]'', ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', and many more. Brian Doyle Murray has had roles in dozens of films, and Belzer is an Emmy Award-winning TV actor.\n\n[[Gerald L. Taylor|Gerald L. \"Jerry\" Taylor]]  was the publisher, followed by William T. Lippe. The business side of the magazine was controlled by [[Matty Simmons]], who was [[Chair (official)|chairman of the board]] and [[CEO]] of Twenty First Century Communications, a publishing company.\n\n===True Facts===\n\"True Facts\" was a section near the front of the magazine which contained true but ridiculous items from real life. Together with the [[Masthead (American publishing)|masthead]], it was one of the few parts of the magazine that was factual. \"True Facts\" included photographs of unintentionally funny signage, extracts from ludicrous newspaper reports, strange headlines, and so on. For many years [[John Bendel]] was in charge of the \"True Facts\" section of the magazine. [[Steven Brykman]] edited the \"True Facts\" section of the National Lampoon website. Several \"True Facts\" compilation books were published in the 1980s and early 90s, and several all-True-Facts issues of the magazine were published during the 1980s.\n\n===Foto Funnies===\nMost issues of the magazine featured one or more \"Foto Funny\" or [[Photonovel|fumetti]], comic strips that use photographs instead of drawings as illustrations. The characters who appeared in the Lampoon's Foto Funnies were usually writers, editors, artists, photographers or contributing editors of the magazine, often cast alongside nude or semi-nude models. In 1980, a paperback compilation book, ''[[National Lampoon Foto Funnies]]'' which appeared as a part of [[National Lampoon Comics]], was published.\n\n===Funny Pages===\nThe \"Funny Pages\" was a large section at the back of the magazine that was composed entirely of [[comic strip]]s of various kinds. These included work from a number of artists who also had pieces published in the main part of the magazine, including Gahan Wilson, [[Ed Subitzky]] and [[Vaughn Bode]], as well as artists whose work was only published in this section. The regular strips included \"Dirty Duck\" by [[Bobby London]], \"Trots and Bonnie\" by [[Shary Flenniken]], \"The Appletons\" by [[B. K. Taylor]], \"Politeness Man\" by [[Ron Barrett]], and many other strips. A compilation of Gahan Wilson's \"Nuts\" strip was published in 2011. The Funny Pages logo header art, which was positioned above Gahan Wilson's \"Nuts\" in each issue, and showed a comfortable, old-fashioned family reading newspaper-sized funny papers, was drawn by [[Mike Kaluta]].\n\n====Other merchandise====\nFrom time to time, the magazine advertised Lampoon-related merchandise for sale, including T-shirts that had been especially designed.\n\n==Chronology==\nThe magazine existed from 1970 to 1998. Some consider its finest period was from 1971 to 1975, although it continued to be produced on a monthly schedule throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, and did well during that time.\n\nHowever, during the late 1980s, a much more serious decline set in. In 1989, the company that controlled the magazine and its related projects (which was part of \"Twenty First Century Communications\") was the subject of a [[hostile takeover]] by Daniel Grodnik, a Hollywood Producer, and Tim Matheson, an actor who starred in the Lampoon's first big hit, Animal House. In 1991 it was sold outright to another company, \"J2 Communications\".\n\nAt that point \"National Lampoon\" was considered valuable only as a [[brand|brand name]] that could be licensed out to other companies. The magazine was issued erratically and rarely from 1991 onwards. 1998 saw the last issue.\n\n===1970===\nThe first issue was April 1970; by November of that year, Michael C. Gross had become the art director. He achieved a unified, sophisticated, and integrated look for the magazine, which enhanced its humorous appeal.\n\n===1973\u20131975===\nNational Lampoon's most successful sales period was 1973\u201375. Its national circulation peaked at 1,000,096 copies sold of the October 1974 \"Pubescence\" issue.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7410.html |date = October 1974 |title = National Lampoon Issue #55 \u2013 Pubescence |accessdate = 2008-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723175712/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7410.html |archivedate = 2008-07-23 |df =  }}</ref> The 1974 monthly average was 830,000, which was also a peak. Former ''Lampoon'' editor [[Tony Hendra]]'s book ''Going Too Far'' includes a series of precise circulation figures.\n\nIt was also during this time that [[Lemmings (National Lampoon)]] Show and [[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]] show was broadcast, bringing interest and acclaim to the National Lampoon brand with magazine talent like writer [[Michael O'Donoghue]] that would go on to write for [[Saturday Night Live]] with many of the players transitioning from [[Lemmings (National Lampoon)]] and [[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]].\n\nThe magazine was considered by many to be at its creative zenith during this time. It should however be noted that the publishing industry's newsstand sales were excellent for many other titles during that time: there were sales peaks for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (more than 2 million), ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' (more than 7 million), and ''[[TV Guide]]'' (more than 19 million).\n\n===1975===\nSome fans consider the glory days of National Lampoon to have ended in 1975,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/|title=Mark's Very Large National Lampoon Site / News|publisher=}}</ref> although the magazine remained popular and profitable long after that point. During 1975, the three founders (Kenney, Beard, and Hoffman) took advantage of a buyout clause in their contracts for $7.5 million. About the same time, writers Michael O'Donoghue and [[Anne Beatts]] left to join the [[NBC]] comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). At the same time, the'' National Lampoon Show's ''John Belushi and Gilda Radner left the troupe to join the original septet of'' SNL's'' Not Ready for Primetime Players.\n\nThe magazine was a springboard to the [[cinema of the United States]] for a generation of comedy writers, directors, and performers. Various alumni went on to create and write for ''SNL,'' ''[[The David Letterman Show]],'' SCTV, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Night Court]]'', and various films including ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''.\n\nAs some of the original creators departed, the magazine remained popular and profitable as it had the emergence of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and editor-in-chief [[P.J. O'Rourke]], along with artists and writers such as Gerry Sussman, [[Ellis Weiner]], [[Tony Hendra]], [[Ted Mann]], Peter Kleinman, Chris Cluess, Stu Kreisman, [[John Weidman]], [[Jeff Greenfield]], [[Bruce McCall]], and [[Rick Meyerowitz]].\n\n===1985===\nIn 1985, [[Matty Simmons]] (who had been working only on the business end of the Lampoon up to that point) took over as editor-in-chief. He fired the entire editorial staff, and appointed his two sons, Michael Simmons and Andy Simmons, as editors, Peter Kleinman as creative director and editor, and [[Larry Sloman|Larry \"Ratso\" Sloman]] as executive editor. The magazine was on an increasingly shaky financial footing, and beginning in November 1986, the magazine was published six times a year instead of every month.\n\n===1989===\nIn 1989, the magazine was acquired in a [[hostile takeover]] by a business partnership of producer Daniel Grodnik and actor [[Tim Matheson]] (who played \"Otter\" in the 1978 film ''National Lampoon's [[Animal House]]''). Grodnik and Matheson became the co-Chairmen/co-CEOs. During their tenure, the stock went up from under $2 to $6 and the magazine doubled the monthly ad pages from 7 to 15. The company moved its headquarters from New York to Los Angeles to focus on film and television. The publishing operation stayed in New York.\n\n===1991===\nIn 1991, the magazine (and more importantly, the rights to the [[brand name]] \"National Lampoon\") were bought by a company called [[J2 Communications]] (a company previously known for marketing [[Tim Conway]]'s ''[[Tim Conway#Dorf|Dorf]]'' videos), headed by James P. Jimirro.\n\nJ2 Communications' focus was to make money by licensing out the brand name \"National Lampoon\". The company was contractually obliged to publish at least one new issue of the magazine per year to retain the rights to the Lampoon name. However, the company had very little interest in the magazine itself; throughout the 1990s, the number of issues per year declined precipitously and erratically. In 1991, an attempt at monthly publication was made; nine issues were produced that year. Only two issues were released in 1992. This was followed by one issue in 1993, five in 1994, and three in 1995. For the last three years of its existence, the magazine was published only once a year.\n\n===1998, last issue===\nThe magazine's final print publication was November 1998, after which the contract was renegotiated, and in a sharp reversal, J2 Communications was then prohibited from publishing issues of the magazine. J2, however, still owned the rights to the [[brand name]], which it continued to franchise out to other users. In 2002, the use of the brand name and the rights to republish old material were sold to a new, and otherwise unrelated, company which chose to call itself [[National Lampoon, Incorporated]].\n\n==Related media==\nDuring its most active period, the magazine spun off numerous productions in a wide variety of media.\n''National Lampoon'' released books, special issues, anthologies, and other print pieces, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/booksetc/booksetc.html|title=National Lampoon Books & Anthologies Index|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217205007/http://www.marksverylarge.com/booksetc/booksetc.html|archivedate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\n===Special editions===\n* ''[[The Best of National Lampoon No. 1]]'', 1971, an anthology\n* ''[[The Breast of National Lampoon]]'' (a \"Best of\" No. 2), 1972, an anthology\n* ''[[The Best of National Lampoon No. 3]]'', 1973, an anthology, art directed by Michael Gross\n* ''[[National Lampoon The Best of No. 4|National Lampoon The Best of#4]]'', 1973, an anthology, art directed by Gross\n* ''[[The National Lampoon Encyclopedia of Humor]]'', 1973, edited by Michael O'Donoghue and art directed by Gross.<br>This publication featured the fake [[Volkswagen]] ad seen above, which was written by Anne Beatts.

According to Mark Simonson's \"Very Large National Lampoon Site\": ''\"If you buy a copy of this issue, you may find the ad is missing. As a result of a lawsuit by VW over the ad for unauthorized use of their trademark, NatLamp was forced to remove the page (with razor blades!) from any copies they still had in inventory (which, from what I gather, was about half the first printing of 250,000 copies) and all subsequent reprints.\"''\n* ''[[National Lampoon Comics]]'', an anthology, 1974, art directed by Gross and David Kaestle\n* ''[[National Lampoon The Best of No. 5]]'', 1974, an anthology, art directed by Gross and Kaestle\n* ''[[National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody]]'', 1974, Edited by P.J.

The first theatrical release, and by far the most successful ''National Lampoon'' film was ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978). Starring John Belushi and written by Doug Kenney, Harold Ramis, and [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]], it became the highest-grossing comedy film of that time. Produced on a low budget, it was so enormously profitable that, from that point on for the next two decades, the name \"National Lampoon\" applied to the title of a movie was considered to be a valuable selling point in and of itself.\n\nNumerous movies were subsequently made that had \"National Lampoon\" as part of the title. Many of these were unrelated projects because, by that time, the name \"National Lampoon\" could simply be licensed on a one-time basis, by any company, for a fee. Critics such as the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''\u2032s Roger Moore and ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2032 Andrew Adam Newman have written about the cheapening of the ''National Lampoon''\u2032s movie imprimatur; in 2006, an [[Associated Press]] review said: \"The National Lampoon, once a brand name above nearly all others in comedy, has become shorthand for pathetic frat boy humor.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/25/business/media/25lampoon.html | work=The New York Times | title=National Lampoon Stakes Revival on Making Own Films | date=2007-06-25}}</ref>\n\nThe first of the ''National Lampoon'' movies was a not-very-successful made-for-TV movie:\n* ''[[Disco Beaver from Outer Space]]'', broadcast in 1978.\n\n====''National Lampoon's Animal House''====\nIn 1978, ''National Lampoon's [[Animal House]]'' was released. Made on a small budget, it did phenomenally well at the box office. In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] considered the film \"culturally significant\", and preserved it in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\nThe script had its origins in a series of short stories that had been previously published in the magazine. These included Chris Miller's \"Night of the Seven Fires\", which dramatized a fraternity initiation and included the characters Pinto and Otter, which contained prose versions of the toga party, the \"road trip\", and the dead horse incident. Another source was Doug Kenney's \"First Lay Comics\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/grell.shtml|title=Mike Grell interview|publisher=}}</ref> which included the angel and devil scene and the grocery-cart affair. According to the authors, most of these elements were based on real incidents.\n\nThe film was of great cultural significance to its time, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes the magazine's 1970s period as \"Hedonism {} in full sway and political correctness in its infancy.\" [[Animal House]], as the article describes was a crucial film manifestation of that culture.\n\nAn article from ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' describes how ''Animal House'' captures the struggle between \"elitist {fraternity} who willingly aligned itself with the establishment, and the kind full of kooks who refused to be tamed.\" That concept was a crucial figment of the early National Lampoon Magazine, according to a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article concerning the early years of the Magazine and co-founder Douglas Kenney's brand of comedy as a \"liberating response to a rigid and hypocritical culture.\"\n\n====''National Lampoon's Class Reunion''====\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:National Lampoons Class Reunion movie poster.jpg|thumb|125px|Movie poster of ''National Lampoon's Class Reunion'']] -->\nThis 1982 movie was an attempt by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] to make something similar to ''Animal House''. ''[[National Lampoon's Class Reunion]]'' was not successful, however.\n\n====''National Lampoon's Vacation''====\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Vacation1983.jpg|thumb|125px|Movie poster of ''National Lampoon's Vacation'']] -->\nReleased in 1983, the movie ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' was based upon John Hughes's ''National Lampoon'' story \"Vacation '58\". The movie's financial success gave rise to several follow-up films, including ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation]]'' (1985), ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'' (1989), based on John Hughes's \"Christmas '59\", ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'' (1997), and most recently ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]'' (2015), all featuring [[Chevy Chase]].\n\n====Similar films====\nThe [[Robert Altman]] film ''[[O.C. and Stiggs]]'' (1987) was based on two characters who had been featured in several written pieces in ''National Lampoon'' magazine, including an issue-long story from October 1982 entitled \"The Utterly Monstrous, Mind-Roasting Summer of O.C. and Stiggs.\" Completed in 1984, the film was not released until 1987, when it was shown in a small number of theaters and without the \"National Lampoon\" name. It was not a success.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Animal House'', ''[[mad (magazine)|MAD]]''  magazine lent its name to a 1980 comedy titled ''[[Up the Academy]]''. Although two of ''Animal House''\u2032s co-writers were the ''Lampoon''\u2032s Doug Kenney and Chris Miller, ''Up The Academy'' was strictly a licensing maneuver, with no creative input from ''Mad''\u2032s staff or contributors. It was a critical and commercial failure.\n\n==Film about the magazine==\nIn 2015, a documentary film was released called ''[[National Lampoon: Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead]]''. The film featured a great deal of content from the magazine, as well as interviews with staff members and fans, and it explains how the magazine changed the course of humor.\n\nThe 2018 film ''[[A Futile and Stupid Gesture (film)|A Futile and Stupid Gesture]]'', a biography of co-founder [[Douglas Kenney]], also depicts the magazine's early years. The film was described by a 2018 [[The New York Times]] Article as a \"snapshot of a moment where comedy's freshest counter-culture impulse was gleefully crass and willfully offensive.\" In the same article, [[Douglas Kenney]] was said to \"spot a comical hollowness and rot in the society he and his peers were trained to join.\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''[[Going Too Far]]'', [[Tony Hendra]], 1987, Doubleday, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-385-23223-4}}\n* ''If You Don't Buy This Book, We'll Kill This Dog!

The magazine started out as a [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] from the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]''. ''National Lampoon'' magazine reached its height of popularity and critical acclaim during the 1970s, when it had a far-reaching effect on American humor and comedy. The magazine spawned [[National Lampoon's Vacation (film series)|films]], [[The National Lampoon Radio Hour|radio]], [[live theatre]], various sound recordings, and print products including books. Many members of the creative staff from the magazine subsequently went on to contribute creatively to successful media of all types.\n\nDuring the magazine's most successful years, [[parody]] of every kind was a mainstay; [[surrealist]] content was also central to its appeal. Almost all the issues included long text pieces, shorter written pieces, a section of actual news items (dubbed \"True Facts\"), [[cartoon]]s and [[comic strip]]s. Most issues also included \"Foto Funnies\" or [[Photonovel|fumetti]], which often featured nudity. The result was an unusual mix of intelligent, cutting-edge wit, combined with some crass, bawdy jesting.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/05/business/new-image-is-sought-by-lampoon.html | work=The New York Times | first=Deirdre | last=Carmody | title=New Image Is Sought By Lampoon | date=1990-12-05}}</ref>\nIn both cases, ''National Lampoon'' humor often pushed far beyond the boundaries of what was generally considered appropriate and acceptable. It was especially anarchic, satirically attacking what was considered holy and sacred. As co-founder [[Henry Beard]] described the experience years later: \"There was this big door that said, 'Thou shalt not.' We touched it, and it fell off its hinges.\"\n\nThe magazine declined during the late 1980s until it came under new management in 1989 when Hollywood producer, Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson, who starred in Animal House, took over the company in a hostile takeover. Against all odds, they increased the value of the company three fold taking the stock from $1.80 to $6.00. They sold the Company in the early 1990's when it became clear that Hollywood was unwilling to help reinvigorate the brand and it was kept alive minimally, but ceased publication altogether, in 1998.\n\n==About the magazine==\n''National Lampoon'' was started by Harvard graduates and ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' alumni [[Douglas Kenney|Doug Kenney]], [[Henry Beard]] and [[Robert Hoffman (businessman)|Robert Hoffman]] in 1969, when they first licensed the \"Lampoon\" name for a monthly national publication. [[The Harvard Lampoon]] was established in 1876 as a long-standing tradition of the campus, influencing the later National Lampoon Brand in its evolution from illustration heavy publications to satirical wit, ranging from short fiction to comic strips. The magazine's first issue was dated April 1970. The company that owned the magazine was called Twenty First Century Communications.\n\nAfter a shaky start for a few issues, the magazine rapidly grew in popularity. Like the ''Harvard Lampoon,'' individual issues had themes, including such topics as \"The Future,\" \"Back to School,\" \"Death,\" \"Self-Indulgence,\" and \"Blight.\" The magazine regularly reprinted material in \"best-of\" omnibus collections. Its writers joyfully targeted every kind of phoniness, and had no specific political stance, even though individual staff members had strong political views.\n\nThomas Carney, writing in New Times, traced the history and style of the National Lampoon and the impact it had on comedy's new wave. \"The National Lampoon,\" Carney wrote, \"was the first full-blown appearance of non-Jewish humor in years--not anti-Semitic, just non-Jewish. Its roots were W.A.S.P. and Irish Catholic, with a weird strain of Canadian detachment. . . . This was not Jewish street-smart humor as a defense mechanism; this was slash-and-burn stuff that alternated in pitch but moved very much on the offensive. It was always disrespect everything, mostly yourself, a sort of reverse deism.\"\n\n[[Image:TeddyVWad.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''National Lampoon'''s fake [[Volkswagen Beetle]] print advertisement mocking [[Ted Kennedy]]'s [[Chappaquiddick incident]].]]\n\n''National Lampoon'' was a monthly magazine for most of its publication history. Numerous \"special editions\" were also published and sold simultaneously on [[newsstand]]s. Some of the special editions were anthologies of reprinted material; others were entirely original. Additional projects included a calendar, a songbook, a collection of transfer designs for T-shirts, and a number of books. The magazine sold yellow binders with the Lampoon logo, designed to store a year's worth of issues.\n\n===Cover art===\nThe original art directors were cartoonist Peter Bramley and Bill Skurski, founders of New York's Cloud Studio, an alternative-culture outfit known at the time for its eclectic style. Bramley created the ''Lampoon'''s first cover and induced successful cartoonists [[Arnold Roth]] and [[Gahan Wilson]] to become regular contributors.\n\nBeginning with the eighth issue, the art direction of the magazine was taken over by [[Michael C. Gross]], who directed the look of the magazine until 1974. A number of the ''National Lampoon'''s most acerbic and humorous covers were designed or overseen by Gross, including:\n* Court-martialed [[Vietnam War]] mass-murderer [[William Calley]] sporting the guileless grin of [[Alfred E. Neuman]], complete with the parody catchphrase 'What, [[My Lai]]?\" (August 1971)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7108.html |title = National Lampoon Issue #17 \u2013 Bummer |date = August 1971 |accessdate = 2008-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612141443/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7108.html |archivedate = 2008-06-12 |df =  }}</ref>\n* The iconic Argentinian revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] being splattered with a cream pie (January 1972)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7201.html |title = National Lampoon Issue #22 \u2013 Is Nothing Sacred? |date = January 1972 |accessdate = 2008-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612140529/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7201.html |archivedate = 2008-06-12 |df =  }}</ref>\n* [[Cheeseface|A dog]] looking worriedly at a [[revolver]] pressed to its head, with what became a famous caption: \"If You Don't Buy This Magazine, We'll Kill This Dog\" (January 1973): The cover was conceived by writer Ed Bluestone.<ref name=\"marksverylarge_34\"/>{{efn|\"This month's superb cover idea was conceived by Ed Bluestone, and through skillful art direction and minimal interference from asshole editors, it became the tasteful entity you hold in your hands.\"<ref name=\"marksverylarge_34\"/>}} Photographer Ronald G.

During his'' Lampoon'' tenure, Kleinman was also the art director of [[Heavy Metal (magazine)|''Heavy Metal'']] magazine, published by the same company. The best known of Kleinman's'' Lampoon ''covers were \"Stevie Wonder with 3-D Glasses\" painted by Sol Korby,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://lampoon.rwinters.com/Lampoon1975.htm |date=July 1975 | title=rwinters.com}}</ref> a photographed \"Nose to The Grindstone\" cover depicting a man's face being pressed against a spinning grinder wheel for the ''Work'' issue, the \"JFK's First 6000 Days\" issue featuring a portrait of an old [[John F. Kennedy]], the \"Fat Elvis\" cover which appeared a year before [[Elvis Presley]] died, and many of the [[Mara McAfee]] covers done in a classic [[Norman Rockwell]] style. Kleinman designed the logos for ''[[Animal House]]'' and ''Heavy Metal.'' \nKleinman left in 1979 to open an ad agency.\n\nHe was succeeded by [[Skip Johnson]], the designer responsible for the ''[[Sunday Newspaper Parody]]'' and the \"Arab Getting Punched in the Face\" cover of the ''Revenge'' issue. Johnson went on to ''[[The New York Times]].'' He was followed by Michael Grossman, who changed the logo and style of the magazine.\n\nIn 1984, Kleinman returned as creative director and went back to the 1970s logo and style, bringing back many of the artists and writers from the magazine's heyday. He left four years later to pursue a career in corporate marketing. At that time, the ''National Lampoon'' magazine entered a period of precipitous decline.\n\n===Editorial===\nEvery regular monthly issue of the magazine had an editorial at the front of the magazine. This often appeared to be straightforward, but was always a parody. It was written by whoever was the editor of that particular issue, since that role rotated among the staff. A few issues were guest-edited.\n\n===Staff===\nThe magazine was an outlet for some notable writing talents, including [[Douglas Kenney]], [[Henry Beard]], [[George W. S. Trow]], [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]], [[P. J. O'Rourke]], [[Michael O'Donoghue]], [[Chris Rush]], [[Sean Kelly (writer)|Sean Kelly]], [[Tony Hendra]], [[Brian McConnachie]], Gerald Sussman, [[Ellis Weiner]], [[Ted Mann]], Chris Cluess, [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Reiss]], Jeff Greenfield, [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and [[Ed Subitzky]].\n\nThe work of many important cartoonists, photographers, and illustrators appeared in the magazine's pages, including [[Neal Adams]], [[Gahan Wilson]], [[Robert Grossman]], Michael Sullivan, [[Ron Barrett]], Peter Bramley, [[Vaughn Bode]], [[Bruce McCall]], [[Rick Meyerowitz]], [[Warren Sattler]], [[M. K. Brown]], [[Shary Flenniken]], [[Bobby London]], [[Edward Gorey]], [[Jeff Jones (artist)|Jeff Jones]], [[Joe Orlando]], [[Arnold Roth]], [[Rich Grote]], [[Ed Subitzky]], [[Mara McAfee]], [[Sam Gross]], [[Charles Rodrigues]], [[Buddy Hickerson]], [[B. K. Taylor]], [[Birney Lettick]], [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Boris Vallejo]], [[Marvin Mattelson]], [[Stan Mack]], [[Chris Callis]], John E. Barrett, [[Raymond Kursar]], [[Andy Lackow]], and [[David C.K. McClelland]].\n\nComedy stars [[John Belushi]], [[Chevy Chase]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Brian Doyle Murray]], [[Harold Ramis]], and [[Richard Belzer]] first gained national attention for their performances in the National Lampoon's stage show and radio show. The first three subsequently went on to become part of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s original wave of [[Saturday Night Live cast|Not Ready for Primetime Players]], Bill Murray replaced Chase when Chase left ''SNL'' after the first season, and Brian Doyle Murray later appeared as an ''SNL'' regular.<ref>''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present'', eight ed. (2003), {{ISBN|9780345455420}}</ref> Harold Ramis went on to be a prolific director and writer working on such films as ''[[Animal House]]'', ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', and many more. Brian Doyle Murray has had roles in dozens of films, and Belzer is an Emmy Award-winning TV actor.\n\n[[Gerald L. Taylor|Gerald L. \"Jerry\" Taylor]]  was the publisher, followed by William T. Lippe. The business side of the magazine was controlled by [[Matty Simmons]], who was [[Chair (official)|chairman of the board]] and [[CEO]] of Twenty First Century Communications, a publishing company.\n\n===True Facts===\n\"True Facts\" was a section near the front of the magazine which contained true but ridiculous items from real life. Together with the [[Masthead (American publishing)|masthead]], it was one of the few parts of the magazine that was factual. \"True Facts\" included photographs of unintentionally funny signage, extracts from ludicrous newspaper reports, strange headlines, and so on. For many years [[John Bendel]] was in charge of the \"True Facts\" section of the magazine. [[Steven Brykman]] edited the \"True Facts\" section of the National Lampoon website. Several \"True Facts\" compilation books were published in the 1980s and early 90s, and several all-True-Facts issues of the magazine were published during the 1980s.\n\n===Foto Funnies===\nMost issues of the magazine featured one or more \"Foto Funny\" or [[Photonovel|fumetti]], comic strips that use photographs instead of drawings as illustrations. The characters who appeared in the Lampoon's Foto Funnies were usually writers, editors, artists, photographers or contributing editors of the magazine, often cast alongside nude or semi-nude models. In 1980, a paperback compilation book, ''[[National Lampoon Foto Funnies]]'' which appeared as a part of [[National Lampoon Comics]], was published.\n\n===Funny Pages===\nThe \"Funny Pages\" was a large section at the back of the magazine that was composed entirely of [[comic strip]]s of various kinds. These included work from a number of artists who also had pieces published in the main part of the magazine, including Gahan Wilson, [[Ed Subitzky]] and [[Vaughn Bode]], as well as artists whose work was only published in this section. The regular strips included \"Dirty Duck\" by [[Bobby London]], \"Trots and Bonnie\" by [[Shary Flenniken]], \"The Appletons\" by [[B. K. Taylor]], \"Politeness Man\" by [[Ron Barrett]], and many other strips. A compilation of Gahan Wilson's \"Nuts\" strip was published in 2011. The Funny Pages logo header art, which was positioned above Gahan Wilson's \"Nuts\" in each issue, and showed a comfortable, old-fashioned family reading newspaper-sized funny papers, was drawn by [[Mike Kaluta]].\n\n====Other merchandise====\nFrom time to time, the magazine advertised Lampoon-related merchandise for sale, including T-shirts that had been especially designed.\n\n==Chronology==\nThe magazine existed from 1970 to 1998. Some consider its finest period was from 1971 to 1975, although it continued to be produced on a monthly schedule throughout the 1970s and the early 1980s, and did well during that time.\n\nHowever, during the late 1980s, a much more serious decline set in. In 1989, the company that controlled the magazine and its related projects (which was part of \"Twenty First Century Communications\") was the subject of a [[hostile takeover]] by Daniel Grodnik, a Hollywood Producer, and Tim Matheson, an actor who starred in the Lampoon's first big hit, Animal House. In 1991 it was sold outright to another company, \"J2 Communications\".\n\nAt that point \"National Lampoon\" was considered valuable only as a [[brand|brand name]] that could be licensed out to other companies. The magazine was issued erratically and rarely from 1991 onwards. 1998 saw the last issue.\n\n===1970===\nThe first issue was April 1970; by November of that year, Michael C. Gross had become the art director. He achieved a unified, sophisticated, and integrated look for the magazine, which enhanced its humorous appeal.\n\n===1973\u20131975===\nNational Lampoon's most successful sales period was 1973\u201375. Its national circulation peaked at 1,000,096 copies sold of the October 1974 \"Pubescence\" issue.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7410.html |date = October 1974 |title = National Lampoon Issue #55 \u2013 Pubescence |accessdate = 2008-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723175712/http://www.marksverylarge.com/issues/7410.html |archivedate = 2008-07-23 |df =  }}</ref> The 1974 monthly average was 830,000, which was also a peak. Former ''Lampoon'' editor [[Tony Hendra]]'s book ''Going Too Far'' includes a series of precise circulation figures.\n\nIt was also during this time that [[Lemmings (National Lampoon)]] Show and [[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]] show was broadcast, bringing interest and acclaim to the National Lampoon brand with magazine talent like writer [[Michael O'Donoghue]] that would go on to write for [[Saturday Night Live]] with many of the players transitioning from [[Lemmings (National Lampoon)]] and [[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]].\n\nThe magazine was considered by many to be at its creative zenith during this time. It should however be noted that the publishing industry's newsstand sales were excellent for many other titles during that time: there were sales peaks for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' (more than 2 million), ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' (more than 7 million), and ''[[TV Guide]]'' (more than 19 million).\n\n===1975===\nSome fans consider the glory days of National Lampoon to have ended in 1975,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/|title=Mark's Very Large National Lampoon Site / News|publisher=}}</ref> although the magazine remained popular and profitable long after that point. During 1975, the three founders (Kenney, Beard, and Hoffman) took advantage of a buyout clause in their contracts for $7.5 million. About the same time, writers Michael O'Donoghue and [[Anne Beatts]] left to join the [[NBC]] comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). At the same time, the'' National Lampoon Show's ''John Belushi and Gilda Radner left the troupe to join the original septet of'' SNL's'' Not Ready for Primetime Players.\n\nThe magazine was a springboard to the [[cinema of the United States]] for a generation of comedy writers, directors, and performers. Various alumni went on to create and write for ''SNL,'' ''[[The David Letterman Show]],'' SCTV, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Night Court]]'', and various films including ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''[[Caddyshack]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'', and ''[[Ghostbusters]]''.\n\nAs some of the original creators departed, the magazine remained popular and profitable as it had the emergence of [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and editor-in-chief [[P.J. O'Rourke]], along with artists and writers such as Gerry Sussman, [[Ellis Weiner]], [[Tony Hendra]], [[Ted Mann]], Peter Kleinman, Chris Cluess, Stu Kreisman, [[John Weidman]], [[Jeff Greenfield]], [[Bruce McCall]], and [[Rick Meyerowitz]].\n\n===1985===\nIn 1985, [[Matty Simmons]] (who had been working only on the business end of the Lampoon up to that point) took over as editor-in-chief. He fired the entire editorial staff, and appointed his two sons, Michael Simmons and Andy Simmons, as editors, Peter Kleinman as creative director and editor, and [[Larry Sloman|Larry \"Ratso\" Sloman]] as executive editor. The magazine was on an increasingly shaky financial footing, and beginning in November 1986, the magazine was published six times a year instead of every month.\n\n===1989===\nIn 1989, the magazine was acquired in a [[hostile takeover]] by a business partnership of producer Daniel Grodnik and actor [[Tim Matheson]] (who played \"Otter\" in the 1978 film ''National Lampoon's [[Animal House]]''). Grodnik and Matheson became the co-Chairmen/co-CEOs. During their tenure, the stock went up from under $2 to $6 and the magazine doubled the monthly ad pages from 7 to 15. The company moved its headquarters from New York to Los Angeles to focus on film and television. The publishing operation stayed in New York.\n\n===1991===\nIn 1991, the magazine (and more importantly, the rights to the [[brand name]] \"National Lampoon\") were bought by a company called [[J2 Communications]] (a company previously known for marketing [[Tim Conway]]'s ''[[Tim Conway#Dorf|Dorf]]'' videos), headed by James P. Jimirro.\n\nJ2 Communications' focus was to make money by licensing out the brand name \"National Lampoon\". The company was contractually obliged to publish at least one new issue of the magazine per year to retain the rights to the Lampoon name. However, the company had very little interest in the magazine itself; throughout the 1990s, the number of issues per year declined precipitously and erratically. In 1991, an attempt at monthly publication was made; nine issues were produced that year. Only two issues were released in 1992. This was followed by one issue in 1993, five in 1994, and three in 1995. For the last three years of its existence, the magazine was published only once a year.\n\n===1998, last issue===\nThe magazine's final print publication was November 1998, after which the contract was renegotiated, and in a sharp reversal, J2 Communications was then prohibited from publishing issues of the magazine. J2, however, still owned the rights to the [[brand name]], which it continued to franchise out to other users. In 2002, the use of the brand name and the rights to republish old material were sold to a new, and otherwise unrelated, company which chose to call itself [[National Lampoon, Incorporated]].\n\n==Related media==\nDuring its most active period, the magazine spun off numerous productions in a wide variety of media.\n''National Lampoon'' released books, special issues, anthologies, and other print pieces, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marksverylarge.com/booksetc/booksetc.html|title=National Lampoon Books & Anthologies Index|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217205007/http://www.marksverylarge.com/booksetc/booksetc.html|archivedate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\n\n===Special editions===\n* ''[[The Best of National Lampoon No. 1]]'', 1971, an anthology\n* ''[[The Breast of National Lampoon]]'' (a \"Best of\" No. 2), 1972, an anthology\n* ''[[The Best of National Lampoon No. 3]]'', 1973, an anthology, art directed by Michael Gross\n* ''[[National Lampoon The Best of No. 4|National Lampoon The Best of#4]]'', 1973, an anthology, art directed by Gross\n* ''[[The National Lampoon Encyclopedia of Humor]]'', 1973, edited by Michael O'Donoghue and art directed by Gross.<br>This publication featured the fake [[Volkswagen]] ad seen above, which was written by Anne Beatts. The spoof was listed in the contents page as \"[[Doyle Dane Bernbach]],\" the name of the advertising agency that had produced the iconic 1960s ad campaign for Volkswagen. According to Mark Simonson's \"Very Large National Lampoon Site\": ''\"If you buy a copy of this issue, you may find the ad is missing. As a result of a lawsuit by VW over the ad for unauthorized use of their trademark, NatLamp was forced to remove the page (with razor blades!) from any copies they still had in inventory (which, from what I gather, was about half the first printing of 250,000 copies) and all subsequent reprints.\"''\n* ''[[National Lampoon Comics]]'', an anthology, 1974, art directed by Gross and David Kaestle\n* ''[[National Lampoon The Best of No. 5]]'', 1974, an anthology, art directed by Gross and Kaestle\n* ''[[National Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody]]'', 1974, Edited by P.J.

The first theatrical release, and by far the most successful ''National Lampoon'' film was ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978). Starring John Belushi and written by Doug Kenney, Harold Ramis, and [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]], it became the highest-grossing comedy film of that time. Produced on a low budget, it was so enormously profitable that, from that point on for the next two decades, the name \"National Lampoon\" applied to the title of a movie was considered to be a valuable selling point in and of itself.\n\nNumerous movies were subsequently made that had \"National Lampoon\" as part of the title. Many of these were unrelated projects because, by that time, the name \"National Lampoon\" could simply be licensed on a one-time basis, by any company, for a fee. Critics such as the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''\u2032s Roger Moore and ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2032 Andrew Adam Newman have written about the cheapening of the ''National Lampoon''\u2032s movie imprimatur; in 2006, an [[Associated Press]] review said: \"The National Lampoon, once a brand name above nearly all others in comedy, has become shorthand for pathetic frat boy humor.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/25/business/media/25lampoon.html | work=The New York Times | title=National Lampoon Stakes Revival on Making Own Films | date=2007-06-25}}</ref>\n\nThe first of the ''National Lampoon'' movies was a not-very-successful made-for-TV movie:\n* ''[[Disco Beaver from Outer Space]]'', broadcast in 1978.\n\n====''National Lampoon's Animal House''====\nIn 1978, ''National Lampoon's [[Animal House]]'' was released. Made on a small budget, it did phenomenally well at the box office. In 2001, the United States [[Library of Congress]] considered the film \"culturally significant\", and preserved it in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\nThe script had its origins in a series of short stories that had been previously published in the magazine. These included Chris Miller's \"Night of the Seven Fires\", which dramatized a fraternity initiation and included the characters Pinto and Otter, which contained prose versions of the toga party, the \"road trip\", and the dead horse incident. Another source was Doug Kenney's \"First Lay Comics\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/grell.shtml|title=Mike Grell interview|publisher=}}</ref> which included the angel and devil scene and the grocery-cart affair. According to the authors, most of these elements were based on real incidents.\n\nThe film was of great cultural significance to its time, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes the magazine's 1970s period as \"Hedonism {} in full sway and political correctness in its infancy.\" [[Animal House]], as the article describes was a crucial film manifestation of that culture.\n\nAn article from ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' describes how ''Animal House'' captures the struggle between \"elitist {fraternity} who willingly aligned itself with the establishment, and the kind full of kooks who refused to be tamed.\" That concept was a crucial figment of the early National Lampoon Magazine, according to a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article concerning the early years of the Magazine and co-founder Douglas Kenney's brand of comedy as a \"liberating response to a rigid and hypocritical culture.\"\n\n====''National Lampoon's Class Reunion''====\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:National Lampoons Class Reunion movie poster.jpg|thumb|125px|Movie poster of ''National Lampoon's Class Reunion'']] -->\nThis 1982 movie was an attempt by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] to make something similar to ''Animal House''. ''[[National Lampoon's Class Reunion]]'' was not successful, however.\n\n====''National Lampoon's Vacation''====\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Vacation1983.jpg|thumb|125px|Movie poster of ''National Lampoon's Vacation'']] -->\nReleased in 1983, the movie ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' was based upon John Hughes's ''National Lampoon'' story \"Vacation '58\". The movie's financial success gave rise to several follow-up films, including ''[[National Lampoon's European Vacation]]'' (1985), ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'' (1989), based on John Hughes's \"Christmas '59\", ''[[Vegas Vacation]]'' (1997), and most recently ''[[Vacation (2015 film)|Vacation]]'' (2015), all featuring [[Chevy Chase]].\n\n====Similar films====\nThe [[Robert Altman]] film ''[[O.C. and Stiggs]]'' (1987) was based on two characters who had been featured in several written pieces in ''National Lampoon'' magazine, including an issue-long story from October 1982 entitled \"The Utterly Monstrous, Mind-Roasting Summer of O.C. and Stiggs.\" Completed in 1984, the film was not released until 1987, when it was shown in a small number of theaters and without the \"National Lampoon\" name. It was not a success.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Animal House'', ''[[mad (magazine)|MAD]]''  magazine lent its name to a 1980 comedy titled ''[[Up the Academy]]''. Although two of ''Animal House''\u2032s co-writers were the ''Lampoon''\u2032s Doug Kenney and Chris Miller, ''Up The Academy'' was strictly a licensing maneuver, with no creative input from ''Mad''\u2032s staff or contributors. It was a critical and commercial failure.\n\n==Film about the magazine==\nIn 2015, a documentary film was released called ''[[National Lampoon: Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead]]''. The film featured a great deal of content from the magazine, as well as interviews with staff members and fans, and it explains how the magazine changed the course of humor.\n\nThe 2018 film ''[[A Futile and Stupid Gesture (film)|A Futile and Stupid Gesture]]'', a biography of co-founder [[Douglas Kenney]], also depicts the magazine's early years. The film was described by a 2018 [[The New York Times]] Article as a \"snapshot of a moment where comedy's freshest counter-culture impulse was gleefully crass and willfully offensive.\" In the same article, [[Douglas Kenney]] was said to \"spot a comical hollowness and rot in the society he and his peers were trained to join.\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''[[Going Too Far]]'', [[Tony Hendra]], 1987, Doubleday, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-385-23223-4}}\n* ''If You Don't Buy This Book, We'll Kill This Dog!

But eight years later in 1996, another Milwaukee outlet, [[WXSS|WAMG]], \"Magic 103.7\", would be the first to pioneer the \"Official\" rhythmic AC format, calling itself \"Rhythm & Romance\" which featured Mid-tempo Rhythmic R&B/Pop tracks (ironically, Milwaukee would once again pick up a Rhythmic AC for the third time in December 2014, when [[WZTI]] filled the void after an eighteen-year gap, although that station leaned towards [[rhythmic oldies]]; it returned to a [[True Oldies Channel]]-led oldies format in August 2015).\n\nIn February 1996, [[WKTU|WYNY]] in [[New York City]] flipped to the format under the name \"103-5 The New KTU\", utilizing a \"Rhythmic Hot AC\" approach with Dance-Pop tracks added to the mix. The station instantly skyrocketed to #1 in the New York City Arbitron ratings in the next book. Because of this, other stations, like [[KBKS-FM|KBKS]]/[[Seattle]], [[WDRQ]]/[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] (which likewise referred to itself as \"93-1 The New DRQ\") and [[KKLQ (FM)|KIBB]]/[[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] flipped to the format.  While WDRQ was a moderate ratings success (the station's true ratings boom came after it evolved into a rhythmic-oriented Contemporary Hit format by 1999), KBKS and KIBB were less successful, resulting in KBKS flipping to Top 40/CHR in May 1997, and KIBB flipped to a format they pioneered: \"[[rhythmic oldies]]\", in November 1997.\n\nBeginning in 2006, there was a trend of several stations in the United States switching to the rhythmic AC format using the brand [[Movin' (brand)|''Movin'']], which debuted on [[Seattle]] station [[KQMV]] in May of that year. [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]] also enjoyed a fair amount of success with Rhythmic AC during this time period, using the continued success of WKTU as its basis for several of its stations, including [[WLLZ (FM)|WDTW-FM]] Detroit, [[WMIA-FM|WMIA]] Miami, and [[WISX]] Philadelphia. This boom screeched to a halt by the early 2010s, with many of the stations evolving into Mainstream or Rhythmic Top 40 (like KQMV or [[KMVQ]] San Francisco), or flipping to other formats, in part due to declining ratings and trying to adapt currents into this niche genre.  As of July 2016, only a handful of \"Movin'\" branded stations remain with a Rhythmic AC format (see list below).\n\nRhythmic AC came to Canada in 1999, when French-language [[CFGL-FM]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] made its debut as \"[[Rythme FM]]\" name. However, the Rythme FM network is now adult contemporary.  During the mid-2000s, when the format started to gain popularity, many [[hot adult contemporary]] stations in Canada started to follow a Rhythmic AC approach, but still remain Hot AC because of pop-rock content still being played. This was first pioneered by [[CHUM-FM]] in [[Toronto]], who had a significant ratings success after starting to lean rhythmic. This approach has worked well in Montreal, where [[CKBE-FM|CKBE]] has had more success with the Rhythmic Hot AC format since its shift from AC in 2011. Unlike CHUM-FM, the currents on CKBE's playlist are more Dance and Rhythmic leaning.\n\nBy 2013, the Rhythmic AC format began to make a comeback in certain markets.  In January of that year, former [[news/talk]] outlet [[WBQT (FM)|WTKK]] in [[Boston]] flipped to the format. The station's ratings, which were low, have significantly improved to compete effectively with [[Rhythmic Top 40]] [[WJMN (FM)|WJMN]]. The station's playlist, initially, had a balance of dance-pop tracks and rhythmic classics, as well as current rhythmic/pop material, but by July 2013, the playlist has shifted to a more urban lean. This revival success story of the format spawned a few similar stations later that year, including [[KHTP]] in [[Seattle]], [[KSSX]] in [[San Diego]] and [[KRBQ]] in [[San Francisco]], as well as (for a short time) [[WKQX (FM)|WIQI]] in [[Chicago]]. KHTP and KRBQ have since shifted in a more Classic Hip-Hop direction, positioning themselves as all-\"Throwback\" stations, while KSSX flipped to Mainstream Urban in May 2016. The Rhythmic AC renaissance has been particularly felt in the state of Florida: in March 2016, [[WMIA-FM]] in Miami, which had switched from Rhythmic AC to Hot AC in August 2014, returned to Rhythmic AC with the slogan \"Rhythm from the '80s to Now,\" and four months later, [[WYKB|WJSJ]] in Jacksonville adopted a \"Classic Dance\" approach. And in Canada, former Urban outlet [[CFXJ-FM]] Toronto went Rhythmic AC as \"93.5 The Move\" in February 2016.\n\nIn January 2015, [[KKGQ]]/[[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] was relaunched with the same Rhythmic AC presentation that was previously offered by its successor KMXW from 2004 to 2007, except this time around, it was more focused on current Rhythmic and Mainstream Pop hits and recurrents from the 1990s and 2000s (KMXW's presentation had an emphasis on 1970s and 1980s product). (That station would completely shift towards [[Hot AC]] by October 2015, with most of the Rhythmic material being moved to evening hours.)

But eight years later in 1996, another Milwaukee outlet, [[WXSS|WAMG]], \"Magic 103.7\", would be the first to pioneer the \"Official\" rhythmic AC format, calling itself \"Rhythm & Romance\" which featured Mid-tempo Rhythmic R&B/Pop tracks (ironically, Milwaukee would once again pick up a Rhythmic AC for the third time in December 2014, when [[WZTI]] filled the void after an eighteen-year gap, although that station leaned towards [[rhythmic oldies]]; it returned to a [[True Oldies Channel]]-led oldies format in August 2015).\n\nIn February 1996, [[WKTU|WYNY]] in [[New York City]] flipped to the format under the name \"103-5 The New KTU\", utilizing a \"Rhythmic Hot AC\" approach with Dance-Pop tracks added to the mix. The station instantly skyrocketed to #1 in the New York City Arbitron ratings in the next book. Because of this, other stations, like [[KBKS-FM|KBKS]]/[[Seattle]], [[WDRQ]]/[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] (which likewise referred to itself as \"93-1 The New DRQ\") and [[KKLQ (FM)|KIBB]]/[[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] flipped to the format.  While WDRQ was a moderate ratings success (the station's true ratings boom came after it evolved into a rhythmic-oriented Contemporary Hit format by 1999), KBKS and KIBB were less successful, resulting in KBKS flipping to Top 40/CHR in May 1997, and KIBB flipped to a format they pioneered: \"[[rhythmic oldies]]\", in November 1997.\n\nBeginning in 2006, there was a trend of several stations in the United States switching to the rhythmic AC format using the brand [[Movin' (brand)|''Movin'']], which debuted on [[Seattle]] station [[KQMV]] in May of that year. [[iHeartMedia|Clear Channel Communications]] also enjoyed a fair amount of success with Rhythmic AC during this time period, using the continued success of WKTU as its basis for several of its stations, including [[WLLZ (FM)|WDTW-FM]] Detroit, [[WMIA-FM|WMIA]] Miami, and [[WISX]] Philadelphia. This boom screeched to a halt by the early 2010s, with many of the stations evolving into Mainstream or Rhythmic Top 40 (like KQMV or [[KMVQ]] San Francisco), or flipping to other formats, in part due to declining ratings and trying to adapt currents into this niche genre.  As of July 2016, only a handful of \"Movin'\" branded stations remain with a Rhythmic AC format (see list below).\n\nRhythmic AC came to Canada in 1999, when French-language [[CFGL-FM]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] made its debut as \"[[Rythme FM]]\" name. However, the Rythme FM network is now adult contemporary.  During the mid-2000s, when the format started to gain popularity, many [[hot adult contemporary]] stations in Canada started to follow a Rhythmic AC approach, but still remain Hot AC because of pop-rock content still being played. This was first pioneered by [[CHUM-FM]] in [[Toronto]], who had a significant ratings success after starting to lean rhythmic. This approach has worked well in Montreal, where [[CKBE-FM|CKBE]] has had more success with the Rhythmic Hot AC format since its shift from AC in 2011. Unlike CHUM-FM, the currents on CKBE's playlist are more Dance and Rhythmic leaning.\n\nBy 2013, the Rhythmic AC format began to make a comeback in certain markets.  In January of that year, former [[news/talk]] outlet [[WBQT (FM)|WTKK]] in [[Boston]] flipped to the format. The station's ratings, which were low, have significantly improved to compete effectively with [[Rhythmic Top 40]] [[WJMN (FM)|WJMN]]. The station's playlist, initially, had a balance of dance-pop tracks and rhythmic classics, as well as current rhythmic/pop material, but by July 2013, the playlist has shifted to a more urban lean. This revival success story of the format spawned a few similar stations later that year, including [[KHTP]] in [[Seattle]], [[KSSX]] in [[San Diego]] and [[KRBQ]] in [[San Francisco]], as well as (for a short time) [[WKQX (FM)|WIQI]] in [[Chicago]]. KHTP and KRBQ have since shifted in a more Classic Hip-Hop direction, positioning themselves as all-\"Throwback\" stations, while KSSX flipped to Mainstream Urban in May 2016. The Rhythmic AC renaissance has been particularly felt in the state of Florida: in March 2016, [[WMIA-FM]] in Miami, which had switched from Rhythmic AC to Hot AC in August 2014, returned to Rhythmic AC with the slogan \"Rhythm from the '80s to Now,\" and four months later, [[WYKB|WJSJ]] in Jacksonville adopted a \"Classic Dance\" approach. And in Canada, former Urban outlet [[CFXJ-FM]] Toronto went Rhythmic AC as \"93.5 The Move\" in February 2016.\n\nIn January 2015, [[KKGQ]]/[[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] was relaunched with the same Rhythmic AC presentation that was previously offered by its successor KMXW from 2004 to 2007, except this time around, it was more focused on current Rhythmic and Mainstream Pop hits and recurrents from the 1990s and 2000s (KMXW's presentation had an emphasis on 1970s and 1980s product). (That station would completely shift towards [[Hot AC]] by October 2015, with most of the Rhythmic material being moved to evening hours.) Also in 2015, [[KJHM-FM|KJHM]] in [[Denver]] shifted to the format after spending its first 5 years with [[rhythmic oldies]], marking the second station with the format in the market, the first being [[KPTT]] from 2006 to 2009.\n\nThe new crop of Rhythmic AC stations varies by market as to how much hip-hop and R&B product are included in the music mix.  Whereas the aforementioned KHTP and KRBQ have repositioned themselves as all-\"Throwback\" stations specializing in Classic Hip-Hop, WKTU, WMOV in Norfolk and the newest incarnation of WMIA-FM lean toward pop and dance, with the latter two continuing to incorporate \"throwbacks\" from as far back as the disco era of the 1970s.\n\n== List of recording artists whose records are played on rhythmic AC radio stations ==\n{{div col start}}\n*[[Aaliyah]]\n*[[ABBA]]\n*[[Ace of Base]]\n*[[Akon]]\n*[[Alicia Keys]]\n*[[Amber (performer)|Amber]]\n*[[Arrested Development (group)|Arrested Development]]\n*[[Bee Gees]]\n*[[Beyonc\u00e9]]\n*[[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]\n*[[Brenda K.
