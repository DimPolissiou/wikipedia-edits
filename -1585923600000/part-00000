It was written by [[Debra Fordham]], who also wrote most of the lyrics. The episode's music was composed by Fordham, ''Scrubs''{{'}} resident composer Jan Stevens, [[The Blanks (band)|The Worthless Peons]]' Paul Perry, [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] orchestrator [[Doug Besterman]], and the ''Avenue Q'' writing team of [[Jeff Marx]] and [[Robert Lopez]].

However, in the style of a traditional ''Scrubs'' episode, this is preceded by a [[cold open]].\n\n=== Cold open ===\n[[Chris Turk|Turk]] and [[Carla Espinosa|Carla]] are deciding whether Carla should take parental leave from the hospital. Turk says he doesn't mind either way, but as Carla decides she'll take a year off, he starts celebrating.\n\nThen, the scene changes to [[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D.]] and [[Elliot Reid|Elliot]] in the park, when a woman, Patti Miller (D'Abruzzo), abruptly falls unconscious. As she returns to consciousness, she sees Elliot, J.D., and a worried group of onlookers singing to her (\"All Right\"). When she tries to respond, she sings too. In reality, no one is actually singing; Ms. Miller is hallucinating. She drifts out of consciousness, and wakes up being wheeled out of an ambulance in the parking lot of [[Scrubs (TV series)#Filming location and Sacred Heart Hospital|Sacred Heart Hospital]], with all the hospital employees singing to her, \"[[My Musical#\"Welcome to Sacred Heart\"|Welcome to Sacred Heart]],\" led by [[Bob Kelso|Dr. Kelso]].\n\n=== Act one ===\n[[Dr. Cox]] tells J.D. he believes Ms. Miller is suffering from a [[psychology|psychological]] problem (as opposed to a [[neurology|neurological]] one), and tells him to run some tests and \"turf her to Psych.\"  Turk and J.D. approach Ms. Miller for a stool sample, explaining that \"[[My Musical#\"Everything Comes Down to Poo\"|Everything Comes Down to Poo]].\"\n\nCarla has brought Isabella to the hospital, and everyone is cooing over the new baby, when Elliot comes in and announces happily that she just bought a new house. Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with her. Carla has decided to take one year [[parental leave]], and [[Laverne Roberts|Laverne]], [[Ted Buckland|Ted]], and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ([[My Musical#\"Gonna Miss You, Carla\"|\"Gonna Miss You, Carla\"]]). Carla begins to realize that she does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.\n\nMs. Miller stops Dr. Cox in the hall to insist that she is not crazy, when they are interrupted by J.D. Cox breaks into a rapid-fire delivery ([[My Musical#\"The Rant Song\"|\"The Rant Song\"]]) of the litany of annoying things J.D. does, with some help from [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]]. Dr. Cox tells Ms. Miller that if she can get J.D. to leave him alone, she'll get the tests she wants. Ms. Miller yells at J.D., and an impressed Dr. Cox agrees to schedule a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]].\n\nElliot and Carla worry about the difficult conversations they have to have with J.D. and Turk, respectively (\"Options\"). In the Act One finale ([[My Musical#\"When the Truth Comes Out\"|\"When the Truth Comes Out\"]]), all the plotlines come together. Dr. Kelso offers Carla her job back, but she worries how to tell Turk. Elliot worries how to tell J.D. he's not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a gigantic [[aneurysm]] in her [[temporal lobe]]. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller, pulling a curtain for privacy that also signals the end of the act.\n\n=== Act two ===\nCarla and Elliot decide to confront Turk and J.D. Carla thinks that Turk and J.D. will help each other through the respective problems, but Elliot believes that men cannot be open about their feelings. Quite the contrary, Turk and J.D. sing about their \"[[My Musical#\"Guy Love\"|Guy Love]].\"  Elliot breaks the news to J.D., who walks out of the room, refusing to talk to her. Carla tells Turk she wants to return to work. Turk responds by saying, \"I always thought family was the most important thing to [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]]s.\" She becomes angry, singing that \"[[My Musical#\"For the Last Time, I'm Dominican\"|For the Last Time, I'm Dominican]]\". Turk tries to explain himself, and finally, agrees to support her decision. Elliot catches up with J.D., feeling awful, and offers to let him move in. He declines, and tells her they'll be \"[[My Musical#\"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen\"|Friends Forever]].\"\n\nMs. Miller interrupts them, afraid about her upcoming surgery, and asks, \"[[My Musical#\"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen\"|What's Going to Happen?]]\" The staff, led by Dr. Cox reassure her that she will be fine; she finally gets calm and the staff stays by her side when she's taken to surgery; the staff repeats she will be fine, which J.D. qualifies with \"we hope,\" as she goes under [[anesthesia]].\n\nWhen she awakes, she asks Dr. Cox if the surgery works, but Cox replies \"you're gonna have to tell us\", and they take a step back; Ms. Miller realized that the surgery was a success, she no longer hears singing, and thanks Dr. Cox and the others. J.D. breaks the moment asking her who was the best singer in her head, much to the rest of the staff's (and especially Dr. Cox's) dismay. J.D. reflects in voiceover that in musicals everyone get what they want, but in reality, after having made a choice we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she wishes she spent more time with her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music in her head.\n\n== Production details ==\nIt had long been a dream in the ''Scrubs'' writer's room to do a musical episode. ''Scrubs'' creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]] is a self-confessed musical theatre \"nerd,\" as are many of the writers.<ref name=\"timeout\">{{cite news|last=Lyons |first=Margaret |date=2007-01-18 |title=The Best Medicine |publisher=TimeOut Chicago |url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/Details.do?page=1&xyurl=xyl://TOCWebArticles1/99/time_in/the_best_medicine.xml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070914204911/http://www.timeout.com/chicago/Details.do?page=1&xyurl=xyl://TOCWebArticles1/99/time_in/the_best_medicine.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2007-01-24 }}</ref> In addition, many of the cast members have had backgrounds in musical theatre.

But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and [[Robert Lopez]], the writers of hit Broadway musical ''Avenue Q''.

It features most of the secondary characters, including Laverne, Todd, Ted and Doug.\n\n=== \"The Rant Song\" ===\n\"The Rant Song\" was composed by Fordham and Perry. The song is a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]-style [[patter song]], in order to complement Dr. Cox's normal rapid-fire rants.

When Carla is seen from the back, she is portrayed by a double.<ref name=\"podcast\"/>\n\n=== \"Guy Love\" ===\n\"Guy Love\" was composed by Fordham and Perry.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> It was a late addition to the episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, \"All the modern musicals like ''[[Jekyll & Hyde (musical)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'' have these really overwrought love songs, so we really wanted to have one between J.D. and Turk.\"<ref name=\"timeout\"/> It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and he gave her the [[hook (music)|hook]], \"It's guy love, between two guys.\" The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She [[email]]ed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, \"and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, she sent me a list of 30 [moments]\",  including Turk performing an [[appendectomy]] on J.D. in \"[[My Day Off]]\".<ref name=\"podcast\"/>  At first, the song was meant to be a [[power ballad]].\n\n\"Guy Love\" was the first of two music videos released by NBC on YouTube in advance of the episode's air date &mdash; the other being \"Everything Comes Down To Poo\".<ref name=\"variety\"/> The videos have since been removed from YouTube. In addition, the night before \"My Musical\" aired, actors Zach Braff and Donald Faison appeared on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and after an interview with the host, Braff grabbed a hand held microphone that was hidden in his chair and the two began singing \"Guy Love\". The song also appeared in \"[[My Road to Nowhere]]\", as Turk's cell phone [[ring tone]] for Carla, and as an arranged incidental version in \"[[My Words of Wisdom]]\", and was played as background music while Turk and J.D. hugged in \"[[My Comedy Show]]\". The song was also used in the season 9 premiere \"[[Our First Day of School]].\"\n\n=== \"For the Last Time, I'm Dominican\" ===\n\"For the Last Time, I'm Dominican\" was composed by Fordham, Perry, and Stevens.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> Fordham knew she wanted to write a [[Latin American music|Latin-themed]] number for Carla, but could not decide on a style; so she \"literally was on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] listening to every Latin style of music she could think of,\" before settling on a [[tango (dance)|tango]].<ref name=\"podcast\"/> The song also parodies \"Tango: Maureen\" from \"Rent.\" The sequence was filmed two months after [[principal photography]], to give Judy Reyes' pelvis enough time to heal for her to be able to tango.<ref name=\"podcast\"/>\n\nEvery question Carla asks during the first verse was an issue in a previous episode - she grew up in [[Chicago]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Own Personal Jesus |episodelink=My Own Personal Jesus |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2001-12-11 |season=1 |number=11}}</ref> she was in medicine eight years before meeting Turk,<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Own American Girl |episodelink=My Own American Girl |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2003-10-02 |season=3 |number=1}}</ref> their wedding song was [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Eight Days a Week (song)|Eight Days a Week]]\",<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Best Friend's Wedding |episodelink=My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs) |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2004-05-04 |season=3 |number=22}}</ref> and Turk struggled with remembering her middle name.<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Mirror Image |episodelink=My Mirror Image |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2004-11-30 |season=6 |number=1}}</ref> Additionally, Turk has called Carla Puerto Rican on several occasions and in \"[[My Last Chance (Scrubs)|My Last Chance]]\" she angrily responded, \"For the last time, Turk, I'm Dominican!\"\n\n=== \"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen\" ===\n\"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen\" was composed by Fordham, Marx and Lopez.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> \"Friends Forever\" is a parody of 1950s-style musical numbers in general, and \"We Go Together\" from ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in particular. However, this was not the original plan. According to Fordham, \"I was really shocked when I got the demo back, because I had never envisioned a '50s number. I did mention \"We Go Together,\" just as an example of I wanted a cheesy, fun, happy ending kind of a thing.\"<ref name=\"podcast\"/>\n\nThe song \"What's Going to Happen\" resembles one of the more \"serious\" numbers from ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', specifically \"Life Support\" and \"Will I?\".<ref name=\"timeout\"/> Fordham has called Ms. Miller's solo in \"What's Going to Happen\" the easiest part of the episode for her to write.<ref name=\"blog1\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Scrubs: \"My Musical\" Soundtrack\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = the [[Scrubs (TV series)#Cast|Cast of ''Scrubs'']]\n| cover        =\n| alt          =\n| released     = August 7, 2007\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Musical theatre|Musical]]\n| length       = 20:05\n| label        = [[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]]\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n\nA [[music download|digital soundtrack]] to the episode was released on various music download websites such as the [[iTunes Store]], featuring 11 tracks of songs from the ''Scrubs'' episode.\n\n#\"All Right\" \u2013 0:43\n#\"Welcome to Sacred Heart\" \u2013 2:06\n#\"Everything Comes Down to Poo\" \u2013 2:10\n#\"Gonna Miss You Carla\" \u2013 2:09\n#\"The Rant Song\" \u2013 2:25\n#\"Options\" \u2013 0:17\n#\"When the Truth Comes Out\" \u2013 2:25\n#\"Guy Love\" \u2013 2:34\n#\"For the Last Time I'm Dominican\" \u2013 1:56\n#Finale: \"Friends Forever\" / \"What's Going to Happen\" \u2013 2:37\n#\"Welcome to Sacred Heart\" (Reprise) \u2013 0:43\n\n== Reception ==\nThe episode was received very positive reviews by critics and audiences alike.

It was written by [[Debra Fordham]], who also wrote most of the lyrics. The episode's music was composed by Fordham, ''Scrubs''{{'}} resident composer Jan Stevens, [[The Blanks (band)|The Worthless Peons]]' Paul Perry, [[Tony Award]]-winning [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] orchestrator [[Doug Besterman]], and the ''Avenue Q'' writing team of [[Jeff Marx]] and [[Robert Lopez]].

However, in the style of a traditional ''Scrubs'' episode, this is preceded by a [[cold open]].\n\n=== Cold open ===\n[[Chris Turk|Turk]] and [[Carla Espinosa|Carla]] are deciding whether Carla should take parental leave from the hospital. Turk says he doesn't mind either way, but as Carla decides she'll take a year off, he starts celebrating.\n\nThen, the scene changes to [[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D.]] and [[Elliot Reid|Elliot]] in the park, when a woman, Patti Miller (D'Abruzzo), abruptly falls unconscious. As she returns to consciousness, she sees Elliot, J.D., and a worried group of onlookers singing to her (\"All Right\"). When she tries to respond, she sings too. In reality, no one is actually singing; Ms. Miller is hallucinating. She drifts out of consciousness, and wakes up being wheeled out of an ambulance in the parking lot of [[Scrubs (TV series)#Filming location and Sacred Heart Hospital|Sacred Heart Hospital]], with all the hospital employees singing to her, \"[[My Musical#\"Welcome to Sacred Heart\"|Welcome to Sacred Heart]],\" led by [[Bob Kelso|Dr. Kelso]].\n\n=== Act one ===\n[[Dr. Cox]] tells J.D. he believes Ms. Miller is suffering from a [[psychology|psychological]] problem (as opposed to a [[neurology|neurological]] one), and tells him to run some tests and \"turf her to Psych.\"  Turk and J.D. approach Ms. Miller for a stool sample, explaining that \"[[My Musical#\"Everything Comes Down to Poo\"|Everything Comes Down to Poo]].\"\n\nCarla has brought Isabella to the hospital, and everyone is cooing over the new baby, when Elliot comes in and announces happily that she just bought a new house. Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with her. Carla has decided to take one year [[parental leave]], and [[Laverne Roberts|Laverne]], [[Ted Buckland|Ted]], and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ([[My Musical#\"Gonna Miss You, Carla\"|\"Gonna Miss You, Carla\"]]). Carla begins to realize that she does not want to separate herself from her work for so long.\n\nMs. Miller stops Dr. Cox in the hall to insist that she is not crazy, when they are interrupted by J.D. Cox breaks into a rapid-fire delivery ([[My Musical#\"The Rant Song\"|\"The Rant Song\"]]) of the litany of annoying things J.D. does, with some help from [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]]. Dr. Cox tells Ms. Miller that if she can get J.D. to leave him alone, she'll get the tests she wants. Ms. Miller yells at J.D., and an impressed Dr. Cox agrees to schedule a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]].\n\nElliot and Carla worry about the difficult conversations they have to have with J.D. and Turk, respectively (\"Options\"). In the Act One finale ([[My Musical#\"When the Truth Comes Out\"|\"When the Truth Comes Out\"]]), all the plotlines come together. Dr. Kelso offers Carla her job back, but she worries how to tell Turk. Elliot worries how to tell J.D. he's not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a gigantic [[aneurysm]] in her [[temporal lobe]]. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller, pulling a curtain for privacy that also signals the end of the act.\n\n=== Act two ===\nCarla and Elliot decide to confront Turk and J.D. Carla thinks that Turk and J.D. will help each other through the respective problems, but Elliot believes that men cannot be open about their feelings. Quite the contrary, Turk and J.D. sing about their \"[[My Musical#\"Guy Love\"|Guy Love]].\"  Elliot breaks the news to J.D., who walks out of the room, refusing to talk to her. Carla tells Turk she wants to return to work. Turk responds by saying, \"I always thought family was the most important thing to [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]]s.\" She becomes angry, singing that \"[[My Musical#\"For the Last Time, I'm Dominican\"|For the Last Time, I'm Dominican]]\". Turk tries to explain himself, and finally, agrees to support her decision. Elliot catches up with J.D., feeling awful, and offers to let him move in. He declines, and tells her they'll be \"[[My Musical#\"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen\"|Friends Forever]].\"\n\nMs. Miller interrupts them, afraid about her upcoming surgery, and asks, \"[[My Musical#\"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen\"|What's Going to Happen?]]\" The staff, led by Dr. Cox reassure her that she will be fine; she finally gets calm and the staff stays by her side when she's taken to surgery; the staff repeats she will be fine, which J.D. qualifies with \"we hope,\" as she goes under [[anesthesia]].\n\nWhen she awakes, she asks Dr. Cox if the surgery works, but Cox replies \"you're gonna have to tell us\", and they take a step back; Ms. Miller realized that the surgery was a success, she no longer hears singing, and thanks Dr. Cox and the others. J.D. breaks the moment asking her who was the best singer in her head, much to the rest of the staff's (and especially Dr. Cox's) dismay. J.D. reflects in voiceover that in musicals everyone get what they want, but in reality, after having made a choice we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she wishes she spent more time with her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music in her head.\n\n== Production details ==\nIt had long been a dream in the ''Scrubs'' writer's room to do a musical episode. ''Scrubs'' creator [[Bill Lawrence (producer)|Bill Lawrence]] is a self-confessed musical theatre \"nerd,\" as are many of the writers.<ref name=\"timeout\">{{cite news|last=Lyons |first=Margaret |date=2007-01-18 |title=The Best Medicine |publisher=TimeOut Chicago |url=http://www.timeout.com/chicago/Details.do?page=1&xyurl=xyl://TOCWebArticles1/99/time_in/the_best_medicine.xml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070914204911/http://www.timeout.com/chicago/Details.do?page=1&xyurl=xyl://TOCWebArticles1/99/time_in/the_best_medicine.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2007-01-24 }}</ref> In addition, many of the cast members have had backgrounds in musical theatre.

But, perhaps the most notable contributors were Jeff Marx and [[Robert Lopez]], the writers of hit Broadway musical ''Avenue Q''. Marx and Lopez's involvement came at the suggestion of Braff, who overheard Fordham asking producer Randall Winston if it would be possible to get actual Broadway composers to work on the episode.<ref name=\"blog1\"/> Fordham did have some contribution to the music, in the form of [[musical genre]] suggestions, but during the actual composition process, she and the composers were almost never in the same room.<ref name=\"blog1\"/>\n\nD'Abruzzo was cast independently of her starring role in ''Avenue Q''.

It features most of the secondary characters, including Laverne, Todd, Ted and Doug.\n\n=== \"The Rant Song\" ===\n\"The Rant Song\" was composed by Fordham and Perry. The song is a [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]-style [[patter song]], in order to complement Dr. Cox's normal rapid-fire rants. Bill Lawrence has mentioned \"[[Major-General's Song]]\" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' as a specific influence. \"We were mortified because ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip|Studio 60]]'' did [a 'Modern Major General' spoof] first.

It also serves the same dramatic purpose as \"One Day More\": it is a showstopper finale to Act One that reprises all previous songs, summarizes Act One's events, and teases the events to come in Act Two.<ref name=\"blog1\"/>  Carla does not march during this song, except for a few \"painful steps\" in this sequence, due to Reyes' aforementioned fractured pelvis. When Carla is seen from the back, she is portrayed by a double.<ref name=\"podcast\"/>\n\n=== \"Guy Love\" ===\n\"Guy Love\" was composed by Fordham and Perry.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> It was a late addition to the episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, \"All the modern musicals like ''[[Jekyll & Hyde (musical)|Jekyll & Hyde]]'' have these really overwrought love songs, so we really wanted to have one between J.D. and Turk.\"<ref name=\"timeout\"/> It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and he gave her the [[hook (music)|hook]], \"It's guy love, between two guys.\" The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She [[email]]ed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, \"and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, she sent me a list of 30 [moments]\",  including Turk performing an [[appendectomy]] on J.D. in \"[[My Day Off]]\".<ref name=\"podcast\"/>  At first, the song was meant to be a [[power ballad]].\n\n\"Guy Love\" was the first of two music videos released by NBC on YouTube in advance of the episode's air date &mdash; the other being \"Everything Comes Down To Poo\".<ref name=\"variety\"/> The videos have since been removed from YouTube. In addition, the night before \"My Musical\" aired, actors Zach Braff and Donald Faison appeared on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' and after an interview with the host, Braff grabbed a hand held microphone that was hidden in his chair and the two began singing \"Guy Love\". The song also appeared in \"[[My Road to Nowhere]]\", as Turk's cell phone [[ring tone]] for Carla, and as an arranged incidental version in \"[[My Words of Wisdom]]\", and was played as background music while Turk and J.D. hugged in \"[[My Comedy Show]]\". The song was also used in the season 9 premiere \"[[Our First Day of School]].\"\n\n=== \"For the Last Time, I'm Dominican\" ===\n\"For the Last Time, I'm Dominican\" was composed by Fordham, Perry, and Stevens.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> Fordham knew she wanted to write a [[Latin American music|Latin-themed]] number for Carla, but could not decide on a style; so she \"literally was on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] listening to every Latin style of music she could think of,\" before settling on a [[tango (dance)|tango]].<ref name=\"podcast\"/> The song also parodies \"Tango: Maureen\" from \"Rent.\" The sequence was filmed two months after [[principal photography]], to give Judy Reyes' pelvis enough time to heal for her to be able to tango.<ref name=\"podcast\"/>\n\nEvery question Carla asks during the first verse was an issue in a previous episode - she grew up in [[Chicago]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Own Personal Jesus |episodelink=My Own Personal Jesus |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2001-12-11 |season=1 |number=11}}</ref> she was in medicine eight years before meeting Turk,<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Own American Girl |episodelink=My Own American Girl |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2003-10-02 |season=3 |number=1}}</ref> their wedding song was [[The Beatles]]' \"[[Eight Days a Week (song)|Eight Days a Week]]\",<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Best Friend's Wedding |episodelink=My Best Friend's Wedding (Scrubs) |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2004-05-04 |season=3 |number=22}}</ref> and Turk struggled with remembering her middle name.<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Mirror Image |episodelink=My Mirror Image |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |airdate=2004-11-30 |season=6 |number=1}}</ref> Additionally, Turk has called Carla Puerto Rican on several occasions and in \"[[My Last Chance (Scrubs)|My Last Chance]]\" she angrily responded, \"For the last time, Turk, I'm Dominican!\"\n\n=== \"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen\" ===\n\"Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen\" was composed by Fordham, Marx and Lopez.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> \"Friends Forever\" is a parody of 1950s-style musical numbers in general, and \"We Go Together\" from ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' in particular. However, this was not the original plan. According to Fordham, \"I was really shocked when I got the demo back, because I had never envisioned a '50s number. I did mention 'We Go Together,' just as an example of I wanted a cheesy, fun, happy ending kind of a thing.\"<ref name=\"podcast\"/>\n\nThe song \"What's Going to Happen\" resembles one of the more \"serious\" numbers from ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', specifically \"Life Support\" and \"Will I?\".<ref name=\"timeout\"/> Fordham has called Ms. Miller's solo in \"What's Going to Happen\" the easiest part of the episode for her to write.<ref name=\"blog1\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Scrubs: \"My Musical\" Soundtrack\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = the [[Scrubs (TV series)#Cast|Cast of ''Scrubs'']]\n| cover        =\n| alt          =\n| released     = August 7, 2007\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Musical theatre|Musical]]\n| length       = 20:05\n| label        = [[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]]\n| producer     =\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n\nA [[music download|digital soundtrack]] to the episode was released on various music download websites such as the [[iTunes Store]], featuring 11 tracks of songs from the ''Scrubs'' episode.\n\n#\"All Right\" \u2013 0:43\n#\"Welcome to Sacred Heart\" \u2013 2:06\n#\"Everything Comes Down to Poo\" \u2013 2:10\n#\"Gonna Miss You Carla\" \u2013 2:09\n#\"The Rant Song\" \u2013 2:25\n#\"Options\" \u2013 0:17\n#\"When the Truth Comes Out\" \u2013 2:25\n#\"Guy Love\" \u2013 2:34\n#\"For the Last Time I'm Dominican\" \u2013 1:56\n#Finale: \"Friends Forever\" / \"What's Going to Happen\" \u2013 2:37\n#\"Welcome to Sacred Heart\" (Reprise) \u2013 0:43\n\n== Reception ==\nThe episode was received very positive reviews by critics and audiences alike.

He played for Southampton in the [[2003 FA Cup Final]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Lundekvam was capped 40 times playing for [[Norway national football team|Norway]].\n\n==Playing career==\nHailing from [[Austevoll]], [[Norway]], he joined [[S.K. Brann|Brann]] as a junior player with his senior debut coming in 1993. Lundekvam eventually gained a regular place as a [[defender (association football)|central defender]] before being sold to English side [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in the autumn of 1996. He was the team's first choice for captain for several years.\n\nLundekvam made his debut for Norway in November 1995, but did not become a regular until 2002. He was [[cap (sports)|capped]] 40 times, scoring twice. His first international goal, against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] in 2002, was the 1,000th goal in the history of the Norwegian national team.\n\nHe scored only two goals during his Saints career. His first came against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on 3 April 2004 in a 4\u20131 win,<ref>{{cite news| title = Wolves 1\u20134 Southampton| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/3571945.stm| work = BBC Sport| date = 3 April 2004| accessdate = 21 February 2008}}</ref> and his second against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff]] in 2006<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4842680.stm\n|title=Southampton 3\u20132 Cardiff\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=1 September 2009}}</ref> \u2013 both teams managed at the time by former Saints manager [[Dave Jones (football manager)|Dave Jones]].\n\nIn [[2002-03 in English football|2002\u201303]], he contributed to what was undoubtedly Southampton's best season since the 1980s, when they finished eighth in the Premier League and reached the FA Cup final, where they only narrowly missed out on silverware as they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal. This was during the management of [[Gordon Strachan]], who famously joked when Lundekvam was stretched off injured in a game against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[2003-04 in English football|2003\u201304 season]] that he \"didn't have a clue\" whether the player was unconscious as \"that's what he's always like\".[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2025420.ece]\n\nLundekvam remained at Southampton after their relegation from the [[FA Premier League]] in 2005.\nHe went off injured after five minutes of the first game of the [[2006-07 in English football|2006\u201307]] season, away to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 6 August 2006 (being replaced in the centre of defence by [[Chris Baird]]) and missed the first two months of the season.
