The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">[http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm Dean Boys' History of EC-121]</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened causing the tail to separate from the remainder of the fuselage at the main cargo door. The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref name=\"StaHypo\">[https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/ Staion Hypo History Of VQ-2. Part 3]</ref><ref name=\"VQH\">[http://vqassociation.org/history/ VQ Association]</ref>. All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">[https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670 Aviation Safety Org Mishap Database]</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. To give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">[http://www.dean-boys.com/ec-121.htm Dean Boys' History of EC-121]</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened causing the tail to separate from the remainder of the fuselage at the main cargo door. The main fuselage and tail section crashed southwest of [[Markt Schwaben]].<ref name=\"StaHypo\">[https://stationhypo.com/2018/09/05/history-of-vq-2-part-3-of-5/ Staion Hypo History Of VQ-2. Part 3]</ref><ref name=\"VQH\">[http://vqassociation.org/history/ VQ Association]</ref>. All fifteen Navy and four Army aircrew were killed.\n\nIn October 1962, the WV-2Q was redesignated the EC-121M Super Constellation.<ref name=\":0\" /> and in the same month the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">[https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670 Aviation Safety Org Mishap Database]</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cesation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\nVQ-2 continued to operate and maintain EC-121M aircraft into 1974. The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref>http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp</ref> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

The term \"nineteen-hundreds\" is often also used to mean the entire century of years from 1900 to 1999 (see [[1900s (disambiguation)|1900s]]). The [[Edwardian era]] (1901\u20131910) covers a similar span of time.\n\nThe decade saw the widespread application of the [[History of the internal combustion engine|internal combustion engine]] including mass production of the automobile, as well as the introduction of the [[typewriter]]. The [[Wright Flyer]] performed the first recorded controlled, powered, sustained heavier than air flight on December 17, 1903. [[Reginald Fessenden]] of [[East Bolton, Quebec]], Canada made what appear to be the first audio radio broadcasts of entertainment and music ever made to a general audience. \n\n[[First-wave feminism]] saw progress, with universities being opened for women in Japan, Bulgaria, Cuba, Russia, and Peru.

[[Cuba]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Norway]] became independent.\n\nWars of this decade included the [[Second Boer War]], the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the [[Kuwaiti\u2013Rashidi war]]. The [[Scramble for Africa]] continued, with the [[Orange Free State]], [[South African Republic]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Aro Confederacy]], [[Sokoto Caliphate]] and [[Kano Emirate]] being conquered by the [[British Empire]]. Failed uprisings and revolutions that took place included the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], an [[1904\u20131905 uprising in Madagascar|uprising in French Madagascar]], the [[Bailundo revolt]], the [[1904 Sasun uprising]], the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]], the [[Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising]], the [[Maji Maji Rebellion]], [[1907 Romanian Peasants' revolt]], and the [[Wad Hubaba Revolt]]. A [[Young Turk Revolution|more successful revolution]] took place in the Ottoman Empire, where the [[Young Turks]] movement restored the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]], establishing the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. The [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]] saw 24,000 to 100,000 [[Herero people|Hereros]] and 10,000 [[Nama people|Namaqua]] killed by German colonial forces, while [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State]] continued until 1908 with the establishment of the [[Belgian Congo]]. The [[Adana massacre of 1909]] saw up to 30,000 civilians, mainly Armenians, massacred by Ottoman Muslims in the city of [[Adana]].\n\nMajor disasters in this decade included the [[1908 Messina earthquake]], the [[Great Qing Famine]], the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake and fire]] and the [[Great Baltimore Fire]]. The first huge success of American cinema, as well as the largest experimental achievement to this point, was the 1903 film ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', directed by [[Edwin S. Porter]], while the world's first feature film, ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', was released on 26 December 1906 in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Popular books of this decade included [[Anne of Green Gables|''Anne of Green Gables'']] and [[The Tale of Peter Rabbit|''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'']], which sold 50 million and 45 million copies respectively.\n\n==Pronunciation varieties==\n{{main|Aughts}}\nThere are several main varieties of how individual years of the decade are pronounced. Using 1906 as an  example, they are \"nineteen-oh-six\", \"nineteen-six\", and \"nineteen-aught-six\". Which variety is most prominent depends somewhat on global region and generation. \"Nineteen-oh-six\" is the most common; \"nineteen-six\" is less common. In [[American English]], \"nineteen-aught-six\" is also recognized but not much used.\n\n== Politics and wars ==\n\n[[File:China imperialism cartoon.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A shocked [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarin]] in [[Manchu people|Manchu]] robe in the back, with [[Queen Victoria]] ([[British Empire]]), [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] ([[German Empire]]), [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] ([[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]]), [[Marianne]] ([[French Third Republic]]), and a [[samurai]] ([[Empire of Japan]]) stabbing into a [[king cake]] with ''Chine'' (\"China\" in French) written on it.

Fessenden and [[Ernst Alexanderson]] developed a high-frequency [[alternator]]-transmitters, an improvement on an already existing device. The improved model operated at a transmitting frequency of approximately 50&nbsp;kHz, although with far less power than Fessenden's rotary-spark transmitters. The alternator-transmitter achieved the goal of transmitting quality audio signals, but the lack of any way to amplify the signals meant they were somewhat weak. On December 21, 1906, Fessenden made an extensive demonstration of the new alternator-transmitter at Brant Rock, showing its utility for point-to-point wireless telephony, including interconnecting his stations to the wire telephone network.  A detailed review of this demonstration appeared in ''The American Telephone Journal''.<ref>[https://earlyradiohistory.us/1907fes.htm Experiments and Results in Wireless Telephony ''The American Telephone Journal'']</ref> Meanwhile, De Forest had developed the [[Audion tube]] an electronic [[amplifier]] device.

(Beginning in 1904, the [[United States Navy]] had broadcast daily time signals and weather reports, but these employed [[spark-gap transmitter]]s, transmitting in [[Morse code]]). On the evening of December 24, 1906 ([[Christmas Eve]]), Fessenden used the alternator-transmitter to send out a short program from [[Ocean Bluff-Brant Rock, Massachusetts|Brant Rock]], [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth County]], [[Massachusetts]]. It included a phonograph record of [[Ombra mai f\u00f9]] (Largo) by [[George Frideric Handel]], followed by Fessenden himself playing the song ''[[O Holy Night]]'' on the [[violin]]. Finishing with reading a passage from the [[Bible]]: 'Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will' ([[Gospel of Luke]] 2:14). On December 31, [[New Year's Eve]], a second short program was broadcast. The main audience for both these transmissions was an unknown number of shipboard radio operators along the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Fessenden claimed that the Christmas Eve broadcast had been heard \"as far down\" as [[Norfolk, Virginia]], while the New Year Eve's broadcast had reached places in the Caribbean. Although now seen as a landmark, these two broadcasts were barely noticed at the time and soon forgotten\u2014 the only first-hand account appears to be a letter Fessenden wrote on January 29, 1932, to his former associate, Samuel M.

The usual exposure is ten seconds. After the exposure has been made the paper is cut off and carried underneath the exposure chamber to the developing bath, where it remains for 35 seconds, and is then drawn into a fixing bath. While one print is being developed or fixed, another exposure can be made. When the copies are removed from the fixing bath, they are allowed to dry by exposure to the air, or may be run through a drying machine. The first print taken from the original is a 'black' print; the whites in the original are black and the blacks, white.

The term \"nineteen-hundreds\" is often also used to mean the entire century of years from 1900 to 1999 (see [[1900s (disambiguation)|1900s]]). The [[Edwardian era]] (1901\u20131910) covers a similar span of time.\n\nThe decade saw the widespread application of the [[History of the internal combustion engine|internal combustion engine]] including mass production of the automobile, as well as the introduction of the [[typewriter]]. The [[Wright Flyer]] performed the first recorded controlled, powered, sustained heavier than air flight on December 17, 1903. [[Reginald Fessenden]] of [[East Bolton, Quebec]], Canada made what appear to be the first audio radio broadcasts of entertainment and music ever made to a general audience. \n\n[[First-wave feminism]] saw progress, with universities being opened for women in Japan, Bulgaria, Cuba, Russia, and Peru.

[[Cuba]], [[Bulgaria]], and [[Norway]] became independent.\n\nWars of this decade included the [[Second Boer War]], the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the [[Kuwaiti\u2013Rashidi war]]. The [[Scramble for Africa]] continued, with the [[Orange Free State]], [[South African Republic]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Aro Confederacy]], [[Sokoto Caliphate]] and [[Kano Emirate]] being conquered by the [[British Empire]]. Failed uprisings and revolutions that took place included the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], an [[1904\u20131905 uprising in Madagascar|uprising in French Madagascar]], the [[Bailundo revolt]], the [[1904 Sasun uprising]], the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]], the [[Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising]], the [[Maji Maji Rebellion]], [[1907 Romanian Peasants' revolt]], and the [[Wad Hubaba Revolt]]. A [[Young Turk Revolution|more successful revolution]] took place in the Ottoman Empire, where the [[Young Turks]] movement restored the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]], establishing the [[Second Constitutional Era]]. The [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]] saw 24,000 to 100,000 [[Herero people|Hereros]] and 10,000 [[Nama people|Namaqua]] killed by German colonial forces, while [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State]] continued until 1908 with the establishment of the [[Belgian Congo]]. The [[Adana massacre of 1909]] saw up to 30,000 civilians, mainly Armenians, massacred by Ottoman Muslims in the city of [[Adana]].\n\nMajor disasters in this decade included the [[1908 Messina earthquake]], the [[Great Qing Famine]], the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake and fire]] and the [[Great Baltimore Fire]]. The first huge success of American cinema, as well as the largest experimental achievement to this point, was the 1903 film ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', directed by [[Edwin S.

Finishing with reading a passage from the [[Bible]]: 'Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to men of good will' ([[Gospel of Luke]] 2:14). On December 31, [[New Year's Eve]], a second short program was broadcast. The main audience for both these transmissions was an unknown number of shipboard radio operators along the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Fessenden claimed that the Christmas Eve broadcast had been heard \"as far down\" as [[Norfolk, Virginia]], while the New Year Eve's broadcast had reached places in the Caribbean. Although now seen as a landmark, these two broadcasts were barely noticed at the time and soon forgotten\u2014 the only first-hand account appears to be a letter Fessenden wrote on January 29, 1932, to his former associate, Samuel M. Kinter.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4540711;view=1up;seq=167|title=Fessenden, Builder of Tomorrows|last=Fessenden|first=Helen May Trott|publisher=Coward-McCann|year=1940|isbn=978-0405060472|location=New York|pages=153\u2013154}}</ref><ref name=\"ContinuumRadio\">{{cite book|title=The Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World|chapter=Radio|pages= 451\u2013461|first=Stephen|last=Barnard|author2=Donna Halper and Dave Laing}}</ref>\n[[File:Percy-MacKaye-Alwyn-Genthe-diascope.jpeg|thumb|The [[Autochrome Lumi\u00e8re]] becomes the first commercial color photography process.]]\n* 1907 \u2013 The [[Autochrome Lumi\u00e8re]] which was patented in 1903 becomes the first commercial color photography process.\n* 1907 \u2013 [[Thomas Edison]] invented the \"Universal Electric Motor\" which made it possible to operate [[dictation machine]]s, etc. on all lighting circuits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thomasedison.com/Inventions.htm|title=THOMAS EDISON'S INVENTIONS|work=thomasedison.com}}</ref>\n* 1907 \u2013 The [[Photostat machine]] begins the modern era of document imaging. The Photostat machine was invented in [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]], [[Kansas]], United States by Oscar Gregory in 1907, and the Photostat Corporation was incorporated in [[Rhode Island]] in 1911. \"Rectigraph and Photostat machines (Plates 40\u201342) combined a large camera and a developing machine and used sensitized paper furnished in 350-foot rolls. \"The prints are made direct on sensitized paper, no negative, plate or film intervening. The usual exposure is ten seconds. After the exposure has been made the paper is cut off and carried underneath the exposure chamber to the developing bath, where it remains for 35 seconds, and is then drawn into a fixing bath. While one print is being developed or fixed, another exposure can be made. When the copies are removed from the fixing bath, they are allowed to dry by exposure to the air, or may be run through a drying machine. The first print taken from the original is a 'black' print; the whites in the original are black and the blacks, white. (Plate 43) A white 'positive' print of the original is made by rephotographing the black print. As many positives as required may be made by continuing to photograph the black print.\" (The American Digest of Business Machines, 1924.) Du Pont Co. files include black prints of graphs dating from 1909, and the company acquired a Photostat machine in 1912.&nbsp;... A 1914 Rectigraph ad stated that the U.S. government had been using Rectigraphs for four years and stated that the machines were being used by insurance companies and abstract and title companies.&nbsp;...

Although the NES follow-up console, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (SNES), was successful, sales took a hit from the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Japanese recession]]. Competition from long-time rival Sega, and relative newcomer Sony, emphasized Nintendo's need to develop a successor for the SNES, or risk losing market dominance to its competitors. Further complicating matters, Nintendo also faced a backlash from third-party developers unhappy with Nintendo's strict licensing policies.<ref name=\"Brandt\" />\n\n=== Development ===\n[[Silicon Graphics|Silicon Graphics, Inc.]] (SGI), a long-time leader in graphics visualization and supercomputing, was interested in expanding its business by adapting its technology into the higher volume realm of consumer products, starting with the video game market. Based upon its [[MIPS R4000]] family of supercomputing and workstation CPUs, SGI developed a CPU requiring a fraction of the resources\u2014consuming only 0.5 watts of power instead of 1.5 to 2 watts, with an estimated target price of {{USD|40}} instead of {{USD|80}}\u2013200.<ref name=\"Video Game Link\">{{cite news | title=COMPANY NEWS; Video Game Link Is Seen For Nintendo | first=Lawrence M. | last=Fisher | date=August 21, 1993 | newspaper=International New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/21/business/company-news-video-game-link-is-seen-for-nintendo.html | accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref> The company created a design proposal for a video game system, seeking an already well established partner in that market.

In order to maximize use of the Nintendo 64 hardware developers had to create their own custom microcode.  Nintendo 64 games running on custom microcode benefited from much higher polygon counts in tandem with more advanced lighting, animation, physics and AI routines than its 32-bit competition. ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real-time lighting that illuminates each area to real-time shadowing and detailed texturing replete with a full in game facial animation system.

This contrasted with the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which used [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturn Game Tutorial |url=http://www.rockin-b.de/saturn/saturngametutorial/SaturnGameTutorial.htm |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> and produced more [[Pixelation|pixelated]] textures.  Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed and this was tied primarily to its storage medium.\n\nThe smaller storage size of ROM cartridges limited the number of available textures. As a result, many games which utilized much smaller 8 or 12&nbsp;MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces.  Compounded by a limit of 4,096 bytes<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo 64 |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1242&st=2 |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> of on-chip texture memory, the end-result is often a distorted, out-of-proportion appearance. Many titles that feature larger 32 or 64&nbsp;MB cartridges avoided this issue entirely, notable games include ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', ''[[Sin and Punishment]]: Successor of the Earth'', and ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' as they feature more ROM space,<ref name=\"hardware1\" /> allowing for more detailed graphics by utilizing multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.\n\n=== Game Paks ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 Game Pak}}\n[[File:N64-Game-Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Open and unopened Nintendo 64 Game Paks]]\n\nNintendo 64 games are [[ROM cartridge]] based.

Its vintage [[ROM cartridge]]s are constrained by small capacity and high production expenses, compared to the [[compact disc]] format used by its chief competitors. Some third-party publishers that supported Nintendo's previous consoles reduced their output or stopped publishing for the console; the Nintendo 64's most successful games came from [[Video game developer|first-party or second-party studios]].\n\n{{further|Nintendo 64 programming characteristics}}\n\n=== Emulation ===\n{{See also|Virtual Console|List of video game emulators#Nintendo 64|label 2=List of Nintendo 64 console emulators}}\n\nSeveral Nintendo 64 games have been released for the [[Wii]]'s and [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] service and are playable with the [[Classic Controller]], [[Nintendo GameCube controller|GameCube controller]], [[Wii U Pro Controller]], or [[Wii U GamePad]]. There are some differences between these versions and the original cartridge versions. For example, the games run in a higher resolution and at a more consistent framerate than their Nintendo 64 counterparts. Some features, such as Rumble Pak functionality, are not available in the Wii versions. Some features are also changed on the Virtual Console releases. For example, the VC version of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allows players to send photos through the Wii's message service, while ''[[Wave Race 64]]'''s in-game content was altered due to the expiration of the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] license. Several games developed by Rare were released on Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, including ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', and ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', following Microsoft's acquisition of Rareware in 2002. One exception is ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', released in April 2015 on the Wii U Virtual Console, as Nintendo retained the rights to the game.\n\nSeveral unofficial emulators have been developed in order to play Nintendo 64 games on other platforms, such as [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[Macintosh|Mac]] and cell phones.\n\n== Accessories ==\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 accessories}}\n\nA number of accessories were produced for the Nintendo 64, including the Rumble Pak and the Transfer Pak.\n\nThe controller was shaped like an \"M\", employing a joystick in the center. ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' called its shape \"evocative of some alien space ship\". While noting that the three handles could be confusing, the magazine said \"the separate grips allow different hand positions for various game types\".<ref name=\"Popular Will\" />\n\n=== 64DD ===\n{{Anchor|Disk drive}}\n{{Main|64DD}}\nNintendo released a peripheral platform called [[64DD]], where \"DD\" stands for \"Disk Drive\". Connecting to the expansion slot at the bottom of the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an Internet appliance, a multimedia workstation, and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese [[Randnet]] online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four ''[[Mario Artist]]'' games (''Paint Studio'', ''Talent Studio'', ''Communication Kit'', and ''Polygon Studio''). Many more planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan, though always having been announced for America and Europe.\n\nTo illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, lead designer [[Shigesato Itoi]] said: \"I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to come up with if we didn\u2019t have the 64DD\". [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] concluded: \"Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we\u2019ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we\u2019ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game\".<ref name=\"The 64Dream Dec 1997\">{{ cite journal | title=A friendly discussion between the \"Big 2\" | others=[http://yomuka.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/itoi-miyamoto-interview-64dd/ Translation] | magazine=The 64DREAM | subjectlink1=Shigeru Miyamoto | subjectlink2=Shigesato Itoi | first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Shigesato | last2=Itoi | date=December 1997 | page=91}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical reception===\nThe Nintendo 64 received generally positive reviews from critics.

Nintendo's \"penchant for perfection\" in game quality control was praised, though with concerns about having only two launch titles at retail and twelve expected by Christmas. Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the ''Times'' cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to \"place a premium on substance over flash\", and noted that the launch titles lack the \"poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures\" which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games. Praising Nintendo's controversial choice of the cartridge medium with its \"nonexistent\" load times and \"continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver\", the review concluded that \"the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish\".<ref name=\"Curtiss wonder\">{{cite news | last=Curtiss | first=Aaron | title=New Nintendo 64 is a Technical Wonder; Leisure: The Cartridge-Based Game Machine Boasts Blistering Speed and Super-Sharp Graphics | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-30/business/fi-49002_1_n64 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=September 30, 1996 | accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Time'' named it their 1996 Machine of the Year, saying the machine had \"done to video-gaming what the [[Boeing 707|707]] did to air travel\".

In order to maximize use of the Nintendo 64 hardware developers had to create their own custom microcode.  Nintendo 64 games running on custom microcode benefited from much higher polygon counts in tandem with more advanced lighting, animation, physics and AI routines than its 32-bit competition. ''Conker's Bad Fur Day'' is arguably the pinnacle of its generation combining multicolored real-time lighting that illuminates each area to real-time shadowing and detailed texturing replete with a full in game facial animation system.  The Nintendo 64's graphics chip is capable of executing many more advanced and complex rendering techniques than its competitors.  It is the first home console to feature [[trilinear filtering]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo DS vs. Nintendo 64 |url=http://purenintendo.com/2008/12/26/nintendo-ds-vs-nintendo-64so-whats-more-powerful/ |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> which allowed textures to look very smooth. This contrasted with the [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which used [[nearest-neighbor interpolation]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Saturn Game Tutorial |url=http://www.rockin-b.de/saturn/saturngametutorial/SaturnGameTutorial.htm |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> and produced more [[Pixelation|pixelated]] textures.  Overall however the results of the Nintendo cartridge system were mixed and this was tied primarily to its storage medium.\n\nThe smaller storage size of ROM cartridges limited the number of available textures. As a result, many games which utilized much smaller 8 or 12&nbsp;MB cartridges are forced to stretch textures over larger surfaces.  Compounded by a limit of 4,096 bytes<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo 64 |url=http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=1242&st=2 |accessdate=January 15, 2009}}</ref> of on-chip texture memory, the end-result is often a distorted, out-of-proportion appearance. Many titles that feature larger 32 or 64&nbsp;MB cartridges avoided this issue entirely, notable games include ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', ''[[Sin and Punishment]]: Successor of the Earth'', and ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' as they feature more ROM space,<ref name=\"hardware1\" /> allowing for more detailed graphics by utilizing multiple, multi-layered textures across all surfaces.\n\n=== Game Paks ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 Game Pak}}\n[[File:N64-Game-Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Open and unopened Nintendo 64 Game Paks]]\n\nNintendo 64 games are [[ROM cartridge]] based.

For example, the VC version of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allows players to send photos through the Wii's message service, while ''[[Wave Race 64]]'''s in-game content was altered due to the expiration of the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] license. Several games developed by Rare were released on Microsoft's [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, including ''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'', ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', and ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', following Microsoft's acquisition of Rareware in 2002. One exception is ''[[Donkey Kong 64]]'', released in April 2015 on the Wii U Virtual Console, as Nintendo retained the rights to the game.\n\nSeveral unofficial emulators have been developed in order to play Nintendo 64 games on other platforms, such as [[Personal computer|PCs]], [[Macintosh|Mac]] and cell phones.\n\n== Accessories ==\n{{Main|Nintendo 64 accessories}}\n\nA number of accessories were produced for the Nintendo 64, including the Rumble Pak and the Transfer Pak.\n\nThe controller was shaped like an \"M\", employing a joystick in the center. ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' called its shape \"evocative of some alien space ship\". While noting that the three handles could be confusing, the magazine said \"the separate grips allow different hand positions for various game types\".<ref name=\"Popular Will\" />\n\n=== 64DD ===\n{{Anchor|Disk drive}}\n{{Main|64DD}}\nNintendo released a peripheral platform called [[64DD]], where \"DD\" stands for \"Disk Drive\". Connecting to the expansion slot at the bottom of the system, the 64DD turns the Nintendo 64 console into an Internet appliance, a multimedia workstation, and an expanded gaming platform. This large peripheral allows players to play Nintendo 64 disk-based games, capture images from an external video source, and it allowed players to connect to the now-defunct Japanese [[Randnet]] online service. Not long after its limited mail-order release, the peripheral was discontinued. Only nine games were released, including the four ''[[Mario Artist]]'' games (''Paint Studio'', ''Talent Studio'', ''Communication Kit'', and ''Polygon Studio''). Many more planned games were eventually released in cartridge format or on other game consoles. The 64DD and the accompanying Randnet online service were released only in Japan, though always having been announced for America and Europe.\n\nTo illustrate the fundamental significance of the 64DD to all game development at Nintendo, lead designer [[Shigesato Itoi]] said: \"I came up with a lot of ideas because of the 64DD. All things start with the 64DD. There are so many ideas I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to come up with if we didn\u2019t have the 64DD\". [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] concluded: \"Almost every new project for the N64 is based on the 64DD. ... we\u2019ll make the game on a cartridge first, then add the technology we\u2019ve cultivated to finish it up as a full-out 64DD game\".<ref name=\"The 64Dream Dec 1997\">{{ cite journal | title=A friendly discussion between the \"Big 2\" | others=[http://yomuka.wordpress.com/2013/03/29/itoi-miyamoto-interview-64dd/ Translation] | magazine=The 64DREAM | subjectlink1=Shigeru Miyamoto | subjectlink2=Shigesato Itoi | first1=Shigeru | last1=Miyamoto | first2=Shigesato | last2=Itoi | date=December 1997 | page=91}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Critical reception===\nThe Nintendo 64 received generally positive reviews from critics. Reviewers praised the console's advanced 3D graphics and gameplay, while criticizing the lack of games, especially compared to its rival, the PlayStation. On [[G4techTV]]'s ''[[Filter (TV series)|Filter]]'', the Nintendo 64 was voted up to No. 1 by registered users.\n\nIn February 1996, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' magazine called the Nintendo Ultra 64 the \"best kept secret in videogames\" and the \"world's most powerful game machine\". It called the system's November 24, 1995 unveiling at [[Nintendo Space World|Shoshinkai]] \"the most anticipated videogaming event of the 1990s, possibly of all time\".<ref name=\"NextGen 14\">{{cite journal | magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] | date=February 1996 | issue=14 | title=Ultra 64: Nintendo's shot at the title | url=https://archive.org/stream/nextgen-issue-014/Next_Generation_Issue_014_February_1996 | accessdate=February 5, 2015}}</ref> Previewing the Nintendo 64 shortly prior to its launch, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine praised the realistic movement and gameplay provided by the combination of fast graphics processing, pressure-sensitive controller, and the ''Super Mario 64'' game.

Its form factor was described as small, light, and \"built for heavy play by kids\" unlike the \"relatively fragile Sega Saturn\". Showing concern for a major console product launch during a sharp, several-year long, decline in the game console market, the review said that the long-delayed Nintendo 64 was \"worth the wait\" in the company's pursuit of quality.  Nintendo's \"penchant for perfection\" in game quality control was praised, though with concerns about having only two launch titles at retail and twelve expected by Christmas. Describing the quality control incentives associated with cartridge-based development, the ''Times'' cited Nintendo's position that cartridge game developers tend to \"place a premium on substance over flash\", and noted that the launch titles lack the \"poorly acted live-action sequences or half-baked musical overtures\" which it says tend to be found on CD-ROM games. Praising Nintendo's controversial choice of the cartridge medium with its \"nonexistent\" load times and \"continuous, fast-paced action CD-ROMs simply cannot deliver\", the review concluded that \"the cartridge-based Nintendo 64 delivers blistering speed and tack-sharp graphics that are unheard of on personal computers and make competing 32-bit, disc-based consoles from Sega and Sony seem downright sluggish\".<ref name=\"Curtiss wonder\">{{cite news | last=Curtiss | first=Aaron | title=New Nintendo 64 is a Technical Wonder; Leisure: The Cartridge-Based Game Machine Boasts Blistering Speed and Super-Sharp Graphics | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-30/business/fi-49002_1_n64 | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=September 30, 1996 | accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n''Time'' named it their 1996 Machine of the Year, saying the machine had \"done to video-gaming what the [[Boeing 707|707]] did to air travel\".

''Time'' credited the Nintendo 64 with revitalizing the video game market, \"rescuing this industry from the dustbin of entertainment history\". The magazine suggested that the Nintendo 64 would play a major role in introducing children to digital technology in the final years of the 20th century.
