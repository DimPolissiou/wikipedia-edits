Another popular theory suggests that the term ''kaki lima'' is also named after the sum of the feet; pushcarts with three feet (two wheels and a stabiliser wooden foot), and the two-footed vendors who push them.<ref name=\"JP-Raffles\">{{cite news | title = The 5 feet story of Thomas Stamford Raffles | author = Suryatini N.

Food hawkers on pushcarts or bicycles might be travelling on streets, approaching potential buyers through frequenting residential areas whilst announcing their presence; or stationing themselves on a packed and busy street side, setting simple seating ''[[warung]]'' (humble shop) under a small [[tarp tent]] and waiting for customers. Vendors often line busy roads during rush hour to offer their wares to hungry passersby in need of a snack, such as ''bakpau'' vendors lining Jakarta's gridlock traffic.<ref name=\"CNN-40\"/>\n\n[[File:Jakarta Indonesia Hawkers-in-Kota-Jakarta-01.jpg|thumb|right|''Bakso'' vendor using ''pikulan'']]\nIn Indonesia, there are many shapes and method of food peddlers, including ''pikulan'' which is the seller carrying things using a rod; ''gerobak'', a wheeled food pushcart; and ''sepeda'' using a bicycle or a tricycle; a hybrid between a cart and a bicycle. The ''pikulan'' is more precisely describes as a carrying method by balancing two wooden baskets or cabinets using a pole or a rod on one's shoulder. The food ''gerobak'' or Indonesian food pushcarts mostly has similar size and design, yet they are distinctive depends to the type of food being sold. They looks like a wheeled portable cupboard with drawers and glass cabinet to store and display ingredients. Some are completed with a small [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]-fuelled stove; ''bakso'' pushcart usually has a large aluminium cauldron or pot to boil the meatballs and to contain the broth, while ''siomay'' one has a [[Food steamer|steamer pot]], ''nasi goreng'' and ''mie goreng'' seller has a [[wok]] on strong-fired stove, while ''satay'' cart has a rectangular charcoal-fuelled [[barbecue grill]] instead. These food pushcarts or tricycles might be constructed from a wooden or metal frame, completed with glass windows and aluminium or tin coating.\n\nThese food peddlers may frequent residential areas to serve potential customers in households in the area. Many of them have their own distinctive call or songs to announce their wares. For example, a satay seller would have a distinctive ''t\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9 sat\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9'' yell, the ''bakso'' seller would hit wooden ''kentongan'' [[slit drum]], ''bubur ayam'' seller would hit the side of a soup bowl, whereas ''mie ayam'' is announced by hitting a wood block.\n\n==History==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een verkoper van sat\u00e9 met zijn pikolan en klanten TMnr 60027242.jpg|thumb|right|[[Satay]] seller in Java, c. 1870, using ''pikulan'' or carrying baskets using a rod.]]\nStreet food has a long history in Indonesian tradition. Some panels of bas-relief on [[Borobudur]] describes travelling food and drink vendor, suggesting that the small scale food entrepreneurship has been established in ancient Java as early as 9th century. The inscriptions dated from [[Majapahit]] period circa 14th century also describes food and drink vendor as one of line of works in Javanese society.\n\nThe influences of Chinese street food culture is also visible in Indonesia as early as [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial era]]. Numbers of Chinese origin dishes such as various noodles, ''bakso'' meatballs, ''[[lumpia]]'' spring rolls, dumplings and Chinese steamed buns (''[[Bakpau|bakpao]]'') are common in Indonesian urban areas.<ref>{{cite book | title = A New Approach to Indonesian Cooking | author = Heinz Von Holzen | publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd | year = 2014 | isbn = 9789814634953 | page = 15 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pRuiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=Kwetiau+Goreng+Chinese+Indonesian+noodle&source=bl&ots=CLkfYDU6zF&sig=7xtnecLFS6kCjD7nZFsU4eJua5I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihlemu1uDKAhWUUY4KHSF4DeQ4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&q=Kwetiau%20Goreng&f=false | accessdate = 12 July 2016 }}</ref> Numbers of local Indonesian dishes has also become the source of street food variants, as well as foreign influences.

School kids' favourite ''[[kue cubit]]'' for example, is a local derivation of Dutch ''[[poffertjes]]''.\n\nThe current proliferation of Indonesia's vigorous street food culture, is also contributed by its demographic condition; the massive [[Urbanization in Indonesia|urbanisation]] in recent decades. This took place especially in the country's rapidly expanding urban agglomerations in [[Greater Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Bandung]], [[Medan]], [[Palembang]], [[Denpasar]], and [[Makassar]].<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | title = Urbanization and urban development patterns | author = Tommy Firman | date = 12 May 2012| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/12/urbanization-and-urban-development-patterns.html}}</ref> The rapid urban growth in recent decades has opened opportunities in foodservice sectors. As large numbers of rural population flocked to Indonesia's urban centers, many of them established a street food business. Today, it is easy to find a diverse collection of street food selling dishes from all over Indonesian archipelago; from Madura to Padang satays, from ''bakso Malang'' to ''siomay Bandung''.<ref name =\"MarieFrance-Asia\">{{cite web | title =  Indonesian Delights: Jakarta\u2019s best street food treats | author = Natasha Gan | date = May 6, 2015 | work = Marie France Asia | url = http://www.mariefranceasia.com/travel/destination-accomplished/asia/street-food-jakartas-appetizing-local-treats-93301.html#item=10}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, several new foreign influences also has enrichen Indonesian street food scene. They came from Western influences (especially United States), also from Japan and the Middle East. For example, today it is common to find [[hamburger]], [[hot dog]] and ''sosis bakar'' (grilled [[Bratwurst]] sausages) food carts next to traditional ''bakso'' meatball pushcart in marketplaces.<ref>{{cite news| title = Bisnis sosis bakar tak lagi membara | date = 17 April 2016 | newspaper = Kontan | language = Indonesian | url = http://peluangusaha.kontan.co.id/news/bisnis-sosis-bakar-tak-lagi-membara}}</ref> Street side Turkish ''[[kebab]]s'' and Japanese ''[[takoyaki]]'' food stalls also might be found, although they might not be authentic, because of the difficulties to acquire required imported ingredients, plus cheaper price range in Indonesian street food market.<ref>{{cite web | title = Franchise Takoyaki dan Okonomiyaki | language = Indonesian | url = http://takoyakijakarta.com/}}</ref> The taste also might has been altered to suit local's preferences, such as the addition of hot and spicy ''[[sambal]]'' [[chili sauce]].\n\n==Types==\n\n===Dishes===\n[[File:Soto Mie Bogor Cart 2.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Soto mie]]'' cart [[street vendor]]]]\nMany Indonesian street foods consist of a single meal, which is prepared, composed, mixed or heated in front of the customers per order. In most cities, it is common to see Chinese dishes such as ''[[bakmi]]e'' or ''[[mie ayam]]'' (chicken noodles) and ''[[bakso]]'' (meatballs) sold by street vendors and food stalls, often adapted to become Indonesian-Chinese cuisine. One common adaptation is that pork is rarely used since the majority of Indonesians are Muslims. Other popular Indonesian street food and snacks are ''[[siomay]]'' and ''[[batagor]]'' (abbreviated from Bakso Tahu Goreng), ''[[pempek]]'' (deep fried fish cake), ''[[bubur ayam]]'' (chicken [[congee]]), ''[[bubur kacang hijau]]'' (mung beans [[porridge]]), [[satay]], ''[[nasi goreng]]'' (English: fried rice), ''[[soto mie]]'' (soto noodle), ''[[mie ayam]]'' (chicken noodle) and ''[[mie goreng]]'' (fried noodle), ''[[tauge goreng]]'' (mung bean sprouts and noodle salad), ''[[asinan]]'' (preserved vegetables or fruits salad), ''[[laksa]], [[Kerak Telor|kerak telor]]'' (spicy omelette) and ''[[seblak]]''.\n\n===Snacks===\n[[File:Kue basah Yogyakarta.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional market in [[Yogyakarta]] selling various kinds of ''kue jajan pasar''.]]\nIndonesian traditional cakes and cookies are collectively called as ''[[kue]]'', and the assorted collection of ''kue'' sold in marketplace are often called ''jajanan pasar'' (market munchies). Other street snacks include selection of pancakes such as ''[[kue ape]]'' and ''[[serabi]]''. It is also common to find Chinese snack, such as ''[[bakpao]]'' (steamed buns with sweet and savoury fillings). Indonesian street side snacks includes ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian assorted fritters) which includes fried ''[[tempeh]]'' and ''[[oncom]]'', ''[[tahu goreng]]'' (fried tofu), ''[[pisang goreng]]'' (fried banana), ''ubi goreng'' (fried sweet potato) and ''[[bakwan]]'' (fried dish of beansprouts and batter).\n\n===Beverages===\n[[File:Cendol Vendor.JPG|thumb|upright|Roadside ''[[cendol]]'' vendor in [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe traditional drinks ''[[lahang]]'' ([[Arenga pinnata|sugar palm]] sap) and ''[[tuak]]'' (palm wine), are among the oldest street drinks sold by street peddler using large bamboo tubes as liquid container. Indonesian street beverages include iced and sweet beverages, such as ''es'' ''[[cendol]]'' or ''es dawet'', ''[[es teler]]'', ''es cincau'', ''[[es doger]]'', ''[[es campur]]'', ''es potong'', and ''es puter''. These beverages is more a [[dessert]]; a cocktail of fruit and snacks rather than a drink, since other than shaved ice it contains a lots of ingredients including fruit bits, tapioca pearls, grass jelly, etc.\n\nFruit juices (''jus'') are very popular.  Varieties include [[orange (fruit)|orange]] (''jus jeruk''), [[guava]] (''jus jambu''), [[mango]] (''jus mangga''), [[soursop]] (''jus sirsak'') and [[avocado]] (''jus alpokat''), the last of these being commonly served with condensed milk and chocolate syrup as a dessert-like treat. [[Durian]] can be made into ice cream called ''es durian''.\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Hygiene===\nWhile most of Indonesian food products served in mid to upperscale eating establishments maintain [[food hygiene]] standard ranges from good to acceptable&nbsp;\u2014 regulated and supervised by ''Badan Pengawasan Obat dan Makanan'' (Indonesian Food and Drug Administration)&nbsp;\u2014 some ''warung'' traditional foodstalls and street vendors might have poor hygiene and low nutritional value.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/11/24/eat-at-your-own-risk-hygiene-poor-quality-remain-issues-in-indonesian-street-food.html|title=Eat at your own risk: Hygiene, poor quality remain issues in Indonesian street food|last=Valentina|first=Jessicha|website=The Jakarta Post|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref><ref name =\"JP-StreetVendorsBP\"/> Hygiene remains a problem for pavement dining as clean dish washing is seldom practised due to a lack of running water.<ref name=\"JP-Raffles\"/>\n\nThe tropical microbes also might contribute to [[food poisoning]] cases, especially among foreigners during their stay in Indonesia. It is advisable to choose cooked hot food instead of uncooked room temperatured ones sold by street vendors. For example, when consuming food sold by street vendors, consuming hot cooked ''[[mie ayam]]'' or hot ''soto'' soup is much safer than having cold and raw ''karedok'', ''gado-gado'' salad or fruit ''rujak''.\n\n===City order===\n[[File:Sukawati, Sukawati, Bali 200507.jpg|thumb|right|Street food often undermined city order, as the carts lined along street side or occupying pedestrian path]]\nToday, it is easy to find large numbers of tarp tented ''warung'' food stalls and ''gerobak'' foodcarts occupying and clogging the ''kaki lima'' pedestrian pavements in Indonesian cities. This might cause walking on the street, especially in Jakarta, is unpleasant and potentially dangerous, as pedestrians are forced to walk on the motorways as the pavements are occupied by street vendors.\n \nHistorically, the island of Java has been well populated; restaurant and street food businesses has been part of its society. Nevertheless, it was the massive urbanisation which started in the 1960s that shaped the street food culture of Indonesian cities. As more and more people flock from rural areas into urban centers, new jobs are required. Many of the rural-origin workforce are low-skilled and low-educated, thus most of them are absorbed in informal economic activities including street food business. Some of them try their luck to sell the delicacies from their hometown by establishing restaurants, ''warungs'', foodstalls,  or travelling foodcarts. That is why in urban centers like Greater Jakarta, one easily discovers various dishes, traditional food and delicacies coming from all over the [[Indonesian archipelago]]. From ''gado-gado Jakarta'', ''asinan Bogor'', ''bakso Malang'', ''sate Madura'', ''sate Padang'', ''pempek Palembang'' to ''siomay Bandung''.<ref name =\"MarieFrance-Asia\"/>\n\nNevertheless, the tremendous occupation of pavements by the ''kaki lima'' vendors, including street food sellers, has led to other urban and societal problems. As municipal authorities try to free the [[pedestrian]]'s pavements and ease the congestion on the street, numbers of disputes erupt between city authorities and street vendors (Indonesian: ''Pedagang Kaki Lima'' or PKL).<ref>{{cite news | title = Penertiban PKL di Jakarta | newspaper = Kompas | language = Indonesian | url = http://lipsus.kompas.com/topikpilihanlist/2610/1/penertiban.pkl.di.jakarta}}</ref> This led to the call for city administration to regulate street food vendors in their area.<ref name =\"JP-StreetVendorsBP\"/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Indonesian Street Food\" mode=packed>\nFile:Asinan seller 1.JPG|<small>''[[Asinan]]''</small>\nFile:Bakso urat asli solo.jpg|<small>''[[Bakso]]''</small>\nFile:Bubur Ayam Travelling Vendor 1.JPG|<small>''[[Bubur ayam]]''</small>\nFile:Es Durian Cart.jpg|<small>''[[Durian|Es durian]]''</small>\nFile:Mall culture jakarta25.jpg|<small>''[[Es campur]]''</small>\nFile:Es Air Tebu (Sugarcane juice) seller.JPG|<small>''[[Sugarcane juice|Es tebu]]''</small>\nFile:Indonesia bike45.jpg|<small>''[[Getuk]]''</small>\nFile:Penjual Gorengan.jpg|<small>''[[Gorengan]]''</small>\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia Hawkers-in- Glodok-03.jpg|<small>''[[Corn cob|Jagung rebus]]''</small>\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia Hawkers-in- Glodok-08.jpg|<small>''[[Peanut|Kacang rebus]]''</small>\nFile:Kerak Telor Betawi Vendor.jpg|<small>''[[Kerak telor]]''</small>\nFile:Tukang ketoprak.JPG|<small>''[[Ketoprak (food)|Ketoprak]]''</small>\nFile:Lahang.JPG|<small>''[[Lahang]]''</small>\nFile:Laksa Bogor 1.JPG|<small>''[[Laksa|Laksa Bogor]]''</small>\nFile:Nasi Goreng Travelling Vendor in Jakarta.JPG|<small>''[[Nasi goreng]]''</small>\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia Hawkers-in-Kota-Jakarta-02.jpg|<small>''[[Martabak]]''</small>\nFile:Bread hawker.jpg|<small>''[[Bread|Roti]]''</small>\nFile:Rujak Vendor.jpg|<small>''[[Rojak|Rujak buah]]''</small>\nFile:Sate ayam-Jakarta.JPG|<small>''[[Satay|Sate Ayam]]''</small>\nFile:Sate seller in Puruih beach.JPG|<small>''[[Satay|Sate Padang]]''</small>\nFile:Seblak street vendor 1.jpg|<small>''[[Seblak]]''</small>\nFile:Pedagang srabi Solo di Pasar Pon.jpg|<small>''[[Serabi]]''</small>\nFile:Gerobak siomay.jpeg|<small>''[[Siomay]]''</small>\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia-Hawkers-in-Glodok-09.jpg|<small>''[[Sup kambing|Sop kaki kambing]]''</small>\nFile:Soto Mie Bogor Cart 1.JPG|<small>''[[Soto mie]]''</small>\nFile:Tauge Goreng 2.JPG|<small>''[[Tauge goreng]]''</small>\nFile:Tongseng Seller.jpg|<small>''[[Tongseng]]''</small>\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hong Kong street food]]\n* [[Street food of Thailand]]\n* [[List of Indonesian dishes]]\n* [[List of street foods]]\n* [[Regional street food]]\n{{Portal bar|Society|Food|Indonesia}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{ cite book | title = Indonesian Street Food Secrets: A Culinary Travel Odyssey | first = Keith Ruskin | last = Miller | publisher = Hawkibinkler Press Limited | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780972106900 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cdh6SQAACAAJ&dq=Indonesian+street+food&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9_orRmPPNAhXML48KHdxbAkwQ6AEIGTAA | accessdate=July 14, 2016}}\n* {{cite web | author=Pantoja, Bea | title=Jakarta: To learn a city, look to street food | website=[[Rappler]] | date=May 9, 2014 | url=http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/57330-jakarta-indonesia-street-food | ref={{sfnref | Rappler | 2014}} | accessdate=July 12, 2016}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Street food in Indonesia}}\n* [https://migrationology.com/indonesian-food/ Mark Wiens: Indonesian Food: 50 of the Best Dishes You Should Eat]\n* [https://id.foursquare.com/epicurina/list/best-streetfood-in-bali Best Streetfood in Bali]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2RBRUFwmuw Mark Wiens: Indonesian Street Food Tour of Glodok in Jakarta] YouTube video\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqqQzkLKluc Asian Street Food: Indonesian Street Food - Street Food In Indonesia - Jakarta Street Food 2016] YouTube video\n\n{{Indonesian cuisine}}\n{{Street food}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indonesian Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Indonesian cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Street food in Indonesia|Indonesia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:Kakilima street vendors in Jakarta.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Traditional ''gerobak'' [[food cart]]s lining [[Jakarta]] street, selling various [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian]] [[street foods]].]]\n'''Indonesian street food''' is a collection of ready-to-eat meals, [[snack]]s, fruits and drinks sold by [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]] or [[street vendor|vendor]]s at ''[[warung]]'' food stalls or [[food cart]]s.

Numbers of Chinese origin dishes such as various noodles, ''bakso'' meatballs, ''[[lumpia]]'' spring rolls, dumplings and Chinese steamed buns (''[[Bakpau|bakpao]]'') are common in Indonesian urban areas.<ref>{{cite book | title = A New Approach to Indonesian Cooking | author = Heinz Von Holzen | publisher = Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd | year = 2014 | isbn = 9789814634953 | page = 15 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pRuiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=Kwetiau+Goreng+Chinese+Indonesian+noodle&source=bl&ots=CLkfYDU6zF&sig=7xtnecLFS6kCjD7nZFsU4eJua5I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihlemu1uDKAhWUUY4KHSF4DeQ4FBDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&q=Kwetiau%20Goreng&f=false | accessdate = 12 July 2016 }}</ref> Numbers of local Indonesian dishes has also become the source of street food variants, as well as foreign influences. Satay for example, is believed started as a street food in the early 19th century, as a local Javanese adaptation of  Indian kebabs.<ref name=\"USAPea\">{{cite web | title=Consumers love succulent Satay, Peanut ingredients for global success | author= |url=http://uk.peanutsusa.com/PDF-Library/Peanut-Ingredients/Satay-trade-information-paper-for-distribution.pdf | publisher=USA Peanuts | page=1 | accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web | title=How to cook the perfect chicken satay | author=Felicity Cloake | date=30 January 2014 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/30/how-to-cook-perfect-chicken-satay | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=7 July 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Satay Washington DC | author=Chef Daeng | url=http://www.satay.com/satay-around-the-world/satay-washington-dc.html | publisher=satay.com | accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref> On the other hand, Dutch influence is also visible in Indonesian street food scene, especially in cakes, pastry and cookies. School kids' favourite ''[[kue cubit]]'' for example, is a local derivation of Dutch ''[[poffertjes]]''.\n\nThe current proliferation of Indonesia's vigorous street food culture, is also contributed by its demographic condition; the massive [[Urbanization in Indonesia|urbanization]] in recent decades. This took place especially in the country's rapidly expanding urban agglomerations in [[Greater Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Bandung]], [[Medan]], [[Palembang]], [[Denpasar]], and [[Makassar]].<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | title = Urbanization and urban development patterns | author = Tommy Firman | date = 12 May 2012| url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/12/urbanization-and-urban-development-patterns.html}}</ref> The rapid urban growth in recent decades has opened opportunities in foodservice sectors. As large numbers of rural population flocked to Indonesia's urban centers, many of them established a street food business. Today, it is easy to find a diverse collection of street food selling dishes from all over Indonesian archipelago; from Madura to Padang satays, from ''bakso Malang'' to ''siomay Bandung''.<ref name =\"MarieFrance-Asia\">{{cite web | title =  Indonesian Delights: Jakarta\u2019s best street food treats | author = Natasha Gan | date = May 6, 2015 | work = Marie France Asia | url = http://www.mariefranceasia.com/travel/destination-accomplished/asia/street-food-jakartas-appetizing-local-treats-93301.html#item=10}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, several new foreign influences also has enrichen Indonesian street food scene. They came from Western influences (especially United States), also from Japan and the Middle East. For example, today it is common to find [[hamburger]], [[hot dog]] and ''sosis bakar'' (grilled [[Bratwurst]] sausages) food carts next to traditional ''bakso'' meatball pushcart in marketplaces.<ref>{{cite news| title = Bisnis sosis bakar tak lagi membara | date = 17 April 2016 | newspaper = Kontan | language = Indonesian | url = http://peluangusaha.kontan.co.id/news/bisnis-sosis-bakar-tak-lagi-membara}}</ref> Street side Turkish ''[[kebab]]s'' and Japanese ''[[takoyaki]]'' food stalls also might be found, although they might not be authentic, because of the difficulties to acquire required imported ingredients, plus cheaper price range in Indonesian street food market.<ref>{{cite web | title = Franchise Takoyaki dan Okonomiyaki | language = Indonesian | url = http://takoyakijakarta.com/}}</ref> The taste also might has been altered to suit local's preferences, such as the addition of hot and spicy ''[[sambal]]'' [[chili sauce]].\n\n==Types==\n\n===Dishes===\n[[File:Soto Mie Bogor Cart 2.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Soto mie]]'' cart [[street vendor]]]]\nMany Indonesian street foods consist of a single meal, which is prepared, composed, mixed or heated in front of the customers per order. In most cities, it is common to see Chinese dishes such as ''[[bakmi]]e'' or ''[[mie ayam]]'' (chicken noodles) and ''[[bakso]]'' (meatballs) sold by street vendors and food stalls, often adapted to become Indonesian-Chinese cuisine. One common adaptation is that pork is rarely used since the majority of Indonesians are Muslims. Other popular Indonesian street food and snacks are ''[[siomay]]'' and ''[[batagor]]'' (abbreviated from Bakso Tahu Goreng), ''[[pempek]]'' (deep fried fish cake), ''[[bubur ayam]]'' (chicken [[congee]]), ''[[bubur kacang hijau]]'' (mung beans [[porridge]]), [[satay]], ''[[nasi goreng]]'' (English: fried rice), ''[[soto mie]]'' (soto noodle), ''[[mie ayam]]'' (chicken noodle) and ''[[mie goreng]]'' (fried noodle), ''[[tauge goreng]]'' (mung bean sprouts and noodle salad), ''[[asinan]]'' (preserved vegetables or fruits salad), ''[[laksa]], [[Kerak Telor|kerak telor]]'' (spicy omelette) and ''[[seblak]]''.\n\n===Snacks===\n[[File:Kue basah Yogyakarta.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional market in [[Yogyakarta]] selling various kinds of ''kue jajan pasar''.]]\nIndonesian traditional cakes and cookies are collectively called as ''[[kue]]'', and the assorted collection of ''kue'' sold in marketplace are often called ''jajanan pasar'' (market munchies). Other street snacks include selection of pancakes such as ''[[kue ape]]'' and ''[[serabi]]''. It is also common to find Chinese snack, such as ''[[bakpao]]'' (steamed buns with sweet and savoury fillings). Indonesian street side snacks includes ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian assorted fritters) which includes fried ''[[tempeh]]'' and ''[[oncom]]'', ''[[tahu goreng]]'' (fried tofu), ''[[pisang goreng]]'' (fried banana), ''ubi goreng'' (fried sweet potato) and ''[[bakwan]]'' (fried dish of beansprouts and batter).\n\n===Beverages===\n[[File:Cendol Vendor.JPG|thumb|upright|Roadside ''[[cendol]]'' vendor in [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe traditional drinks ''[[lahang]]'' ([[Arenga pinnata|sugar palm]] sap) and ''[[tuak]]'' (palm wine), are among the oldest street drinks sold by street peddler using large bamboo tubes as liquid container. Indonesian street beverages include iced and sweet beverages, such as ''es'' ''[[cendol]]'' or ''es dawet'', ''[[es teler]]'', ''es cincau'', ''[[es doger]]'', ''[[es campur]]'', ''es potong'', and ''es puter''. These beverages is more a [[dessert]]; a cocktail of fruit and snacks rather than a drink, since other than shaved ice it contains a lots of ingredients including fruit bits, tapioca pearls, grass jelly, etc.\n\nFruit juices (''jus'') are very popular.  Varieties include [[orange (fruit)|orange]] (''jus jeruk''), [[guava]] (''jus jambu''), [[mango]] (''jus mangga''), [[soursop]] (''jus sirsak'') and [[avocado]] (''jus alpokat''), the last of these being commonly served with condensed milk and chocolate syrup as a dessert-like treat. [[Durian]] can be made into ice cream called ''es durian''.\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Hygiene===\nWhile most of Indonesian food products served in mid to upperscale eating establishments maintain [[food hygiene]] standard ranges from good to acceptable&nbsp;\u2014 regulated and supervised by ''Badan Pengawasan Obat dan Makanan'' (Indonesian Food and Drug Administration)&nbsp;\u2014 some ''warung'' traditional foodstalls and street vendors might have poor hygiene and low nutritional value.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/11/24/eat-at-your-own-risk-hygiene-poor-quality-remain-issues-in-indonesian-street-food.html|title=Eat at your own risk: Hygiene, poor quality remain issues in Indonesian street food|last=Valentina|first=Jessicha|website=The Jakarta Post|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref><ref name =\"JP-StreetVendorsBP\"/> Hygiene remains a problem for sidewalk dining as clean dish washing is seldom practiced due to a lack of running water.<ref name=\"JP-Raffles\"/>\n\nThe tropical microbes also might contribute to [[food poisoning]] cases, especially among foreigners during their stay in Indonesia. It is advisable to choose cooked hot food instead of uncooked room temperatured ones sold by street vendors. For example, when consuming food sold by street vendors, consuming hot cooked ''[[mie ayam]]'' or hot ''soto'' soup is much safer than having cold and raw ''karedok'', ''gado-gado'' salad or fruit ''rujak''.\n\n===City order===\n[[File:Sukawati, Sukawati, Bali 200507.jpg|thumb|right|Street food often undermined city order, as the carts lined along street side or occupying pedestrian path]]\nToday, it is easy to find large numbers of tarp tented ''warung'' food stalls and ''gerobak'' foodcarts occupying and clogging the ''kaki lima'' pedestrian sidewalks in Indonesian cities. This might cause walking on the street, especially in Jakarta, is unpleasant and potentially dangerous, as pedestrians are forced to walk on the motorways as the sidewalks are occupied by street vendors.\n \nHistorically, the island of Java has been well populated; restaurant and street food businesses has been part of its society. Nevertheless, it was the massive urbanization which started in the 1960s that shaped the street food culture of Indonesian cities. As more and more people flock from rural areas into urban centers, new jobs are required. Many of the rural-origin workforce are low-skilled and low-educated, thus most of them are absorbed in informal economic activities including street food business. Some of them try their luck to sell the delicacies from their hometown by establishing restaurants, ''warungs'', foodstalls,  or traveling foodcarts. That is why in urban centers like Greater Jakarta, one easily discovers various dishes, traditional food and delicacies coming from all over the [[Indonesian archipelago]]. From ''gado-gado Jakarta'', ''asinan Bogor'', ''bakso Malang'', ''sate Madura'', ''sate Padang'', ''pempek Palembang'' to ''siomay Bandung''.<ref name =\"MarieFrance-Asia\"/>\n\nNevertheless, the tremendous occupation of sidewalks by the ''kaki lima'' vendors, including street food sellers, has led to other urban and societal problems. As municipal authorities try to free the [[pedestrian]]'s sidewalks and ease the congestion on the street, numbers of disputes erupt between city authorities and street vendors (Indonesian: ''Pedagang Kaki Lima'' or PKL).<ref>{{cite news | title = Penertiban PKL di Jakarta | newspaper = Kompas | language = Indonesian | url = http://lipsus.kompas.com/topikpilihanlist/2610/1/penertiban.pkl.di.jakarta}}</ref> This led to the call for city administration to regulate street food vendors in their area.<ref name =\"JP-StreetVendorsBP\"/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Indonesian Street Food\" mode=packed>\nFile:Asinan seller 1.JPG|<small>''[[Asinan]]''</small>\nFile:Bakso urat asli solo.jpg|<small>''[[Bakso]]''</small>\nFile:Bubur Ayam Travelling Vendor 1.JPG|<small>''[[Bubur ayam]]''</small>\nFile:Es Durian Cart.jpg|<small>''[[Durian|Es durian]]''</small>\nFile:Mall culture jakarta25.jpg|<small>''[[Es campur]]''</small>\nFile:Es Air Tebu (Sugarcane juice) seller.JPG|<small>''[[Sugarcane juice|Es tebu]]''</small>\nFile:Indonesia bike45.jpg|<small>''[[Getuk]]''</small>\nFile:Penjual Gorengan.jpg|<small>''[[Gorengan]]''</small>\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia Hawkers-in- Glodok-03.jpg|<small>''[[Corn cob|Jagung rebus]]''</small>\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia Hawkers-in- Glodok-08.jpg|<small>''[[Peanut|Kacang rebus]]''</small>\nFile:Kerak Telor Betawi Vendor.jpg|<small>''[[Kerak telor]]''</small>\nFile:Tukang ketoprak.JPG|<small>''[[Ketoprak (food)|Ketoprak]]''</small>\nFile:Lahang.JPG|<small>''[[Lahang]]''</small>\nFile:Laksa Bogor 1.JPG|<small>''[[Laksa|Laksa Bogor]]''</small>\nFile:Nasi Goreng Travelling Vendor in Jakarta.JPG|<small>''[[Nasi goreng]]''</small>\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia Hawkers-in-Kota-Jakarta-02.jpg|<small>''[[Martabak]]''</small>\nFile:Bread hawker.jpg|<small>''[[Bread|Roti]]''</small>\nFile:Rujak Vendor.jpg|<small>''[[Rojak|Rujak buah]]''</small>\nFile:Sate ayam-Jakarta.JPG|<small>''[[Satay|Sate Ayam]]''</small>\nFile:Sate seller in Puruih beach.JPG|<small>''[[Satay|Sate Padang]]''</small>\nFile:Seblak street vendor 1.jpg|<small>''[[Seblak]]''</small>\nFile:Pedagang srabi Solo di Pasar Pon.jpg|<small>''[[Serabi]]''</small>\nFile:Gerobak siomay.jpeg|<small>''[[Siomay]]''</small>\nFile:Jakarta Indonesia-Hawkers-in-Glodok-09.jpg|<small>''[[Sup kambing|Sop kaki kambing]]''</small>\nFile:Soto Mie Bogor Cart 1.JPG|<small>''[[Soto mie]]''</small>\nFile:Tauge Goreng 2.JPG|<small>''[[Tauge goreng]]''</small>\nFile:Tongseng Seller.jpg|<small>''[[Tongseng]]''</small>\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hong Kong street food]]\n* [[Street food of Thailand]]\n* [[List of Indonesian dishes]]\n* [[List of street foods]]\n* [[Regional street food]]\n{{Portal bar|Society|Food|Indonesia}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{ cite book | title = Indonesian Street Food Secrets: A Culinary Travel Odyssey | first = Keith Ruskin | last = Miller | publisher = Hawkibinkler Press Limited | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780972106900 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cdh6SQAACAAJ&dq=Indonesian+street+food&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi9_orRmPPNAhXML48KHdxbAkwQ6AEIGTAA | accessdate=July 14, 2016}}\n* {{cite web | author=Pantoja, Bea | title=Jakarta: To learn a city, look to street food | website=[[Rappler]] | date=May 9, 2014 | url=http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/travel/57330-jakarta-indonesia-street-food | ref={{sfnref | Rappler | 2014}} | accessdate=July 12, 2016}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Street food in Indonesia}}\n* [https://migrationology.com/indonesian-food/ Mark Wiens: Indonesian Food: 50 of the Best Dishes You Should Eat]\n* [https://id.foursquare.com/epicurina/list/best-streetfood-in-bali Best Streetfood in Bali]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2RBRUFwmuw Mark Wiens: Indonesian Street Food Tour of Glodok in Jakarta] YouTube video\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqqQzkLKluc Asian Street Food: Indonesian Street Food - Street Food In Indonesia - Jakarta Street Food 2016] YouTube video\n\n{{Indonesian cuisine}}\n{{Street food}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indonesian Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Indonesian cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Street food in Indonesia|Indonesia]]\n", "name_user": "Vulphere", "label": "safe", "comment": "EngvarB", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_food_of_Indonesia"}
