Many became local merchants; others became moneylenders. This drastically increased the rate of commerce between Jews and non-Jews, and, thus, litigation both internally amongst Jews and between Jews and non-Jews. Simultaneously, heavy taxes were being levied on the Jewish communities by the local government, taxes which many Jews at the time felt were being unfairly distributed by the leaders of the local ''kehilla''. The increasing internal and external pressures on the Jewish community, together with their recent near destruction during the Crusades, caused the leaders of the time to take the step of instituting broad decrees to strengthen their communities.<ref>Hirschman, 16\u201317</ref><ref name = \"Weiss\" />\n\n== Synod of the Takkanot ==\nIn or around 1160, a [[synod]] was held in [[Troyes]]. This synod was led by [[Rabbeinu Tam]], his brother, the [[Rashbam]], both grandchildren of [[Rashi]], and [[Eliezer ben Nathan]] (the Ra'avan). Over 250 [[rabbi]]s from communities all over [[France]] attended as well. A number of communal decrees were enacted at the synod covering both Jewish-[[Gentile]] relations as well as matters relating internally to the Jewish community.<ref name = \"JVL-S\" /> Examples of such decrees include:\n*The restriction requiring Jews engaged in monetary disputes amongst themselves to have the case decided by a Jewish [[beth din]], and not a secular court, unless one of the parties was refusing to accept the ruling rendered by the beth din.\n*A person disputing the ''kehillah''\u2019s tax assessment on him should pay the tax first and then bring the assessors to [[beth din]].\n*A person lending space to a community to act as a synagogue cannot restrict specific individuals from praying there.

In or around 1196, the rabbis and community leaders throughout the entire [[Rhineland]] called a synod of their own in [[Mainz]], in which they affirmed most of the decrees of the Troyes synod, and added a number of their own. The decrees did not take as firm hold as was desired, so twenty-four years later, in 1220, a second synod was convened in Mainz, in which the leaders of the generation re-affirmed the decrees enacted in the first synod.<ref name = \"JVL-S\" /><ref name = \"p19\" /> Important historical figures attending one or both of these synods included David of [[M\u00fcnzenberg]], [[Simha of Speyer]], Jacob ben Asher of Speyer, [[Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi]], and [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]].<ref name = \"p21\">Hirschman, 21</ref>\n\nThese enactments covered both internal issues within the Jewish community as well as issues that involved interactions with the non-Jewish government of the time. Specific examples of enactments instituted or strengthened at the Rhineland synods include:\n*The placement of a ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' on anyone who informed on another Jew until such time as restitution was made.\n*The removal of all exceptions to community-imposed taxes.\n*The prohibition against lending money to other Jews without ensuring strict adherence to the ''[[halakha|halakhot]]'' that dealt with loans.\n*The prohibition against calling someone a ''[[mamzer]]'' or otherwise cast aspersions about the legal validity of his or her parents' marriage.\n*The permission for the estate of a deceased person to be used to educate his or her children, even if the deceased indicated some other specific use for the funds.\n\nThere were many other decrees that dealt with various aspects of Jewish legal, financial, and religious life of the times.<ref>Hirschman, 20\u201321</ref>\n\nIn 1223 a third synod was held in the Rhineland community, this time in [[Speyer]]. The main focus of this synod was the \"Chalitzah takkana,\" but other decrees were discussed, including the prohibition against a one person either placing or lifting a ''cherem''. To be either placed or lifted, such bans needed more than one community leader to agree. Notable attendees of this third synod included Elazar Rokeach and David ben Shaltiel.<ref name = \"p22\">Hirschman, 22</ref>\n\n==Modern adherence==\nWhile parts of various decrees still remain in force, the majority of the ''Takkanot Shum'' are no longer considered in force by most [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic Jewry]]. The decrees were instituted to deal with specific religious and sociological problems of the time, and were not considered to be placed in force for perpetuity, but for only as long as such issues existed.<ref name = \"p23\">Hirschman, 23</ref> However, there are two specific decrees still considered active today: the Dowry takkana and the [[Chalitzah]] takkana.<ref name = \"p21\" />\n\n===Dowry takkana===\nAt this time it was common to marry off daughters quite young, as soon as a suitable husband could be found and a [[dowry]] put together.<ref>[[Tosafot]] [[Nashim|Kiddushin]] (41a) sv ''{{lang|he-Latn|assur le'adam}}''</ref>  Combined with childhood diseases and a high general mortality rate this meant that it was not uncommon for young people to die within a short time of marriage, before their spouses had formed lasting relationships with their families.  Under Jewish [[inheritance law]], a husband is his wife's sole heir, but a wife does not inherit from her husband. Thus, no matter who died, the dowry, which represented a substantial sacrifice by the wife's parents for their daughter's happiness, would end up with the husband or his family. As a result, parents became reluctant to give their daughters large dowries, which in turn led to difficulty in finding them husbands.<ref name = \"p22\" /> Therefore the synod of Troyes, led by Rabbenu Tam, decreed that if a husband or wife dies within a year of marriage without leaving a surviving child, the dowry would revert to the parents who had given it; if the death was within two years half the dowry would revert.<ref>[[Moses Isserles|Rama]], [[Even Ha'ezer]] 53:3</ref> While Rabbenu Tam rescinded this decree before his death, it was reaffirmed by his students in the first synod of SHUM.<ref name = \"p22\" /> This decree is today incorporated by reference into the standard [[Ashkenazi]] prenuptial contract (''tena'im''), with the phrase \"and in case of absence [a euphemism for death] it will stand as the decree of ShUM\"; in some communities even this elliptical mention of death is thought unlucky at a wedding, so it is merely hinted at with the cryptic phrase \"and in case, etc.\"<ref>Mordechai Farkash, ''Seder Kiddushin Venisu'in'' 1:11</ref>  Even if it is not explicitly referenced at all, or if there is no contract, it is assumed that the parties consented to it unless it is explicitly excluded.<ref>Beth Shmuel 53:20</ref>\n\n===Chalitzah takkana===\n[[File:Chalitza.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving of a chalitzah ceremony]]\nWhen a husband died childless, there is a [[mitzvah]] for a surviving brother to perform either ''[[yibbum]]'' or ''[[halizah]]''. Already in the times of the [[Talmud]], performing ''yibbum'' was deprecated in favor of ''halitza'' for various reasons.<ref>Talmud [[Bekhorot]] 13a</ref><ref>Talmud Yevamot 39b</ref> The decrees enacted in the various synods of SHUM dealt with the time span allowed and the disbursement of the deceased's property after halitzah.<ref name = \"p22\" />\n\nThe original decree, discussed at all three synods of SHUM, instituted a time limit of three months after the husband's death within which to perform yibbum or halitzah (although yibbum was rarely, if ever, performed) and after the halitzah, a beth din would decide upon the disbursement of the estate, with no recourse for the brother performing halitzah to subsequently sue. This decree was yet again re-affirmed 60 years later by [[Meir of Rothenburg]].<ref name = \"p22\" />\n\nHowever, in 1381, another synod was held in Mainz that changed the disbursement\u2014instituting an even split between the widow and all surviving brothers. This was a change from previous tradition in which, most often, the brother performing the halitzah would receive the [[ketubah]] monies, as well as usually receiving most, if not all, of the surviving estate.
