For example, the pronunciation of \"si\" in ''vision'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|v|\u026a|\u0292|\u0259n}} and ''precision'' {{IPAc-en|p|r|\u026a|\u02c8|s|\u026a|\u0292|\u0259n}}, or the \"s\" in ''treasure'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|r|\u025b|\u0292|\u0259r}}.  See also [[\u017d]], the [[Persian alphabet]] letter [[\u017de|\u0698]] and the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[Zhe (Cyrillic)|\u0436]].\n\nEzh is also used as a letter in some orthographies of [[Laz language|Laz]] and [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], both by itself, and with a [[caron]] ([[\u01ee]] \u01ef). In Laz, these represent voiceless alveolar [[affricate]] /ts/ and its [[ejective consonant|ejective]] counterpart /ts\u02bc/, respectively. In Skolt Sami they respectively denote partially voiced alveolar and post-alveolar affricates, broadly represented /dz/ and /d\u0292/. It also appears in the orthography of some African languages, for example in the [[Aja language (Niger-Congo)|Aja language]] of [[Benin]] and the [[Dagbani language]] of [[Ghana]], where the uppercase variant looks like a reflected sigma ([[Sigma|\u03a3]]).\n\n==Origin==\n[[Image:Z-small-Variante.svg|thumb|right|560x120px|''Ezh'' in a sans serif typeface]]\n\nAs a phonetic symbol, it originates with [[Isaac Pitman]]'s [[English Phonotypic Alphabet]] in 1847, as a ''z'' with an added hook. The symbol is based on [[Gothic minuscule|medieval cursive]] forms of Latin [[z]], evolving into the [[blackletter]] z letter. In Unicode, however, the blackletter ''z'' (\"[[Z#Variant and derived forms|tailed z]]\" , German ''geschw\u00e4nztes Z'') is considered a glyph variant of ''z'', and not an ezh.\n\nIn contexts where \"tailed z\" is used in contrast to tail-less ''z'', notably in standard transcription of [[Middle High German]], Unicode \u0292 is sometimes used, strictly speaking incorrectly. Unicode offers  [[\u0225]] \"z with hook\" as a grapheme for Middle High German coronal fricative instead.\n\n== Similar shapes ==\n=== Relation to yogh ===\nIn [[Unicode 1.0]], the character was unified with the unrelated character [[yogh]] ({{lang|ang|\u021c \u021d}}), which was not correctly added to Unicode until Unicode 3.0. Historically, ezh is derived from Latin [[z]], but yogh is derived from Latin [[g]] by way of [[insular G]] (and incidentally giving rise to the English mispronunciation of the Scottish surname [and business] [[John Menzies|Menzies]] as [\u02c8menziz] instead of [\u02c8m\u026a\u014b\u026as]). The characters look very similar and do not appear alongside each other in any alphabet. To differentiate between the two more clearly, the [[Oxford University Press]] and the [[Early English Text Society]] extend the uppermost tip of the 'yogh' into a little curvature upward.\n\n===Relation to the digit three===\nThe ezh looks similar to the common form of the [[3 (number)|figure three]] (3). To differentiate between the two characters, Ezh includes the sharp zigzag of the letter z, while the number is usually curved. This still remains a problem though, as some type fonts (found on clock faces among other things) use a figure for \"3\" identical in shape to an ezh.\n\n=== Similaritiy to hiragana ro ===\n[[Image:\u308d-bw.png|thumb|left|280x60px|Stroke order in writing \u308d (Japanese hiragana)]]Ezh looks similar to [[Ro (kana)|\u308d]], the Japanese hiragana letter for the [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] \"ro\". However, the central corner of \u308d points out further away to the left than that of ezh.\n\n===Vague ties to the Cyrillic 'Ze'===\n[[Image:Ze, ze, Three, Ezh, ezh and Zhe.png|thumb|right|160x140px|The forms 'Ze', 'Three', 'Ezh' and 'Zhe']] The Cyrillic letter Ze, written as \u0417 (capitalized) or \u0437 (Lower Case), has a similar body to Ezh. As customary, the Cyrillic script has a stiffer structure, but both letters have common roots in historical cursive forms of \u2018Z\u2019, taken from the Greek letter [[Zeta]].\n\nThe pronunciations of Latin Ezh and Cyrillic Ze, however, are different phonemes: while /\u04e0/ stands for the ''s'' in the word ''vi'''s'''ion'', Russian Ze (\u0417) stands for ''z'' as in '''''z'''ebra''. For the /\u04e0/ phoneme, Cyrillic uses '[[Zhe (Cyrillic)|Zhe (\u0416)]]'.\n\nOlder Russian [[typewriter]]s, often to save space, sometimes used \u0417 (Ze) to write the numeral form of 3.\n\n==Usage ==\n===Language orthographies===\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) it represents the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] consonant.  For example: ''vision'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|v|\u026a|\u0292|\u0259n}}. It is pronounced as the \"s\" in \"treasure\" or the \"si\" in the word \"precision\".\n\nIt is used with that value in [[Uropi]].\n\nIt is used in the \"International Standard\" orthography, as devised by Marcel Courthiade for [[Romani alphabets|Romani]].\n\nIt was also used in an obsolete Latin alphabet for writing [[Komi language|Komi]], where it represented [d\u0361\u0291] (similar to English ''j''). In the modern Cyrillic alphabet, this sound is written as ''\u0434\u0437''.\n\n=== Ezh as an abbreviation for dram ===\nIn [[Unicode]], a standard designed to allow symbols from all writing systems to be represented and manipulated by computers, the ezh (alternatively '''\u2128''') is used as the symbol to represent the abbreviation for [[dram (unit)|dram]], an [[apothecaries' system]] [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[mass]].\n\n==Encoding and ligatures==\nThe [[Unicode]] code points are U+01B7 for \u01b7 and U+0292 for \u0292.\n\nThe IPA historically allowed for ezh to be [[typographic ligature|ligatured]] to other letters; some of these ligatures have been added to the Unicode standard.\n*Dezh ([[\u02a4]]) ligatures ezh with the letter D (U+02A4).\n*Lezh ([[\u026e]]) ligatures ezh with the letter L (U+026E).\n*Tezh ([[\ua729]]) (uppercase form \ua728) ligatures ezh with the letter T (U+A728 for \ua728 and U+A729 for \ua729).\n\nRelated [[Obsolete and nonstandard symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet|obsolete IPA characters]] include {{Unichar|01BA|LATIN SMALL LETTER EZH WITH TAIL}} and {{Unichar|0293|LATIN SMALL LETTER EZH WITH CURL}}.\n\n{{Unichar|1DBE|MODIFIER LETTER SMALL EZH}} and {{Unichar|1D9A|LATIN SMALL LETTER EZH WITH RETROFLEX HOOK}} are also used for phonetic transcription.<ref name=\"L204132\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04132-n2740-phonetic.pdf|title=L2/04-132 Proposal to add additional phonetic characters to the UCS|date=2004-04-19|first=Peter|last=Constable}}</ref>\n\n{{Unichar|1D23|LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL EZH}} is used in the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2002/02141-n2419-uralic-phonetic.pdf|title=L2/02-141: Uralic Phonetic Alphabet characters for the UCS|date=2002-03-20|first1=Michael|last1=Everson|authorlink1=Michael Everson|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n==  Typing character ==\nFor Mac: Option\u2325 + :, followed by Shift+Z or Z respectively.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Unified Northern Alphabet]]\n* [[\u01b8|Reversed Ezh]] (\u01b8 \u01b9)\n* [[Abkhazian Dze]] (<span style=\"font-size:190%;\">\u04e0 \u04e1</span>)\n* [[Ze (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic Ze]] (<span style=\"font-size:190%;\">\u0417 \u0437</span>)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [[Michael Everson]]'s essay [http://www.evertype.com/standards/wynnyogh/ezhyogh.html On the derivation of Yogh and Ezh]\n\n{{Latin script}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Z - Ezh}}\n[[Category:Phonetic transcription symbols]]\n[[Category:Uncommon Latin letters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|\u01b7}}\n\n{{Infobox grapheme\n|name=\u01b7\n|letter=\u01b7 \u0292\n|variations=([[Z#Related characters|See below]], [[Tailed z|Typography]])\n|image=File:Latin letter Ezh.svg\n|imagesize=200px\n|imagealt=Writing cursive forms of \u01b7\n|script=[[Latin script]]\n|type=[[Alphabet]]\n|typedesc=ic and [[Logographic]]\n|language=[[Latin language]]\n|phonemes=[{{IPAlink|\u0292}}]<br>[{{IPAlink|d\u0361z}}]<br>[{{IPAlink|d\u0361\u0292}}]<br>[{{IPAlink|d\u0361\u0291}}]<br>{{IPAc-en|'|\u025b|\u0292}}\n|unicode=U+01B7, U+0292\n|alphanumber=\n|number=\n|fam1=<hiero>Z4</hiero>\n|fam2=[[File:Proto-semiticZ-01.svg|20px|Proto-Sinaitic Zayin]]\n|fam3=[[File:Protozayn.svg|20px]]\n|fam4=[[File:Phoenician zayin.svg|20px|Phoenician Zayin]]\n|fam5=[[Image:PhoenicianZ-01.svg|30px]]\n|fam6=[[Zeta|\u0396 \u03b6]]\n|fam7=[[\ud800\udf06]]\n|fam8=[[Z|Z z]]\n|usageperiod=1847 to present\n|children={{bull}}[[\u01b8]]<br>{{bull}}[[\u01ee]]\n|sisters=[[\u00c7]]<br>[[\u017d]]<br>[[\u0417]]<br>[[\u0405]]<br>[[\u0510]]<br>[[\u0506]]<br>[[\u0498]]<br>[[\ua645]]<br>[[Zayin|\u05d6\u202c<br>\u0632<br>\u0719]]<br>[[\u0698\u202c]]<br>[[\u0806]]<br>[[\u12d8]]<br>[[\ud800\udf87]]<br>[[wikt:\u0536|\u0536]] [[\u0566]]<br>[[\u13c3]]<br>[[\u13cb]]<br>[[\u13e8]]<br>[[\u0aa1]]<br>[[\u0aa2]]<br>[[Ja (Indic)|\u091c\u093c]]\n|equivalents=[[Zh (digraph)|zh]], [[\u017e]]\n|associates=[[List of Latin-script digraphs#Z|z(x)]], [[Zh (digraph)|zh]], [[\u017e]]\n|direction=Left-to-Right\n}}\n{| align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; padding: 10px; font-size: 36pt; line-height: 40pt; text-align: center;\"\n| <span style=\"font-family:serif\">\u01b7 \u0292</span>\n|-\n| <span style=\"font-family:sans-serif\">\u01b7 \u0292</span>\n|}\n\n'''Ezh''' ('''\u01b7 \u0292''') {{IPAc-en|'|\u025b|\u0292}},  also called the \"tailed z\", is a letter whose lower case form is used in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), representing the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] consonant.

Cesar Comanche, who I met when I was attending North Carolina State University, lived not far from the school. He stayed in a two-bedroom apartment, and that's basically our studio Missie Ann. [Comanche] named it after his sister. And we pretty much did that album in Comanche's other room besides the bathroom. Every song on The Listening has a story to it, which is crazy. We started recording The Listening in August of 2001, which will make this August the ten-year anniversary when we started Little Brother. So the story goes like this. At the time Phonte was doing his 9 to 5 at Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, the insurance company, and he would come into the studio, and then going back to his 9 to 5, sometimes without even sleeping. That was a repeating fashion. One day, Phonte and I were doing a song called 'Speed.' Phonte did his part, and we took 'Take A Look' by Joc Max and Grap Luva, put out by DJ Spinna, which has a part that goes, 'I put my JBs on when I hustle with speed,' and I really loved that part, so I put that in there. We asked Median to be on it. He said he was down to do it, but on the weekend we wanted to record it, we couldn't find Median. Pooh, who was originally from Virginia, was in town at the time with his friends in Charlotte, North Carolina. Matter of fact, I think around March or April of 2001, Pooh asked Phonte to be a group, and Phonte said, 'No.' But Median wasn't around, so we were like, 'Let's just ask Pooh, he's in town.' So Pooh came in, and recorded the song, and we listened to the song like 18 times, and I looked at Phonte afterward and said, 'Let's try to be a group, man. Let's see what it sounds like.' Median could have been a member of Little Brother. 'Speed' was the first song we recorded as a group, because Median didn't show up. But we thought it sounded good, so we just said, 'Let's be a group.' And that's the first song in Little Brother's existence.}}\n\nThey continued to work the local, [[Research Triangle|Raleigh-Durham]]-area scene and were eventually signed by [[independent record label]] ABB Records. In 2002, they released the [[Cult following|cult hit]] 7\" single \"Atari 2600\", with lyrics centering on [[video game]]s.\n\nIn 2003, the group released their first full-length studio album, ''[[The Listening (Little Brother album)|The Listening]]'' to critical acclaim. National recognition for the group, and particularly 9th Wonder, came when [[Jay-Z]] tapped 9th Wonder for the song \"Threat\", from his eighth studio album ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]''.\n\nFollowing the release of ''The Listening'', Little Brother opened for [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]-based [[alternative hip hop]] collective [[Hieroglyphics (group)|Hieroglyphics]] on the latter's ''[[Full Circle (Hieroglyphics album)|Full Circle]]'' national tour.\n\n===''The Chittlin' Circuit 1.5'' mixtape<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-chittlin-circuit-15-mw0000655990|title=The Chittlin Circuit 1.5 - Little Brother {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref>===\nLittle Brother's first commercially distributed \"mixtape\".

The album's theme compared present day rap music and the music industry to the [[minstrel shows]] of the late 19th century. A music video for the single, \"Lovin' It\", was directed by Joey Boukadakis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/25528219|title=Little Brother - \"Lovin' It\"|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-06-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Little Brother became embroiled in a short-lived feud, when [[Young Jeezy]]'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Slick Pulla]] challenged the group to a [[Battle rap|battle]] after hearing an interview in which Phonte voiced some disapproval concerning \"drug rap\" and Young Jeezy's \"snowman mascot\".

With no major video or radio airplay, ''Getback'' sold approximately 9,600 copies during its first week in stores and landed at No. 89 on the ''Billboard 200'' chart. The album consisted of 11 songs, and featured several guests, most notably [[New Orleans]]-based rapper [[Lil Wayne]]. Lil Wayne had been a longtime fan of the group's work and was invited to rap on the third verse for \"Breakin My Heart\".\n\nFollowing the release of ''Getback'' in late 2007, Little Brother toured with [[Los Angeles]]-based alternative hip hop artist [[Evidence (musician)|Evidence]] of [[Dilated Peoples]].\n\nThe remainder of 2007 found Little Brother working on becoming completely independent artists and putting out records on their own.

This reunion was the result of [[Royce da 5'9\"]] being unable to attend the festival. According to Phonte, he was contacted by the promoters to substitute for Royce and called Pooh and 9th to collaborate with him. The group had not performed together in over a decade, so they performed many of their known hits including \"Say it Again,\" \"Loving It\", \"The Way You Do It,\" and \"Dreams.\" Both artists felt that the energy from the show was a good omen, and after leaving the stage they knew they had something special. Following this performance, Phonte invited Pooh to a barbeque at his home where they decided to continue the collaboration.<ref name=\"tidal.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://tidal.com/browse/video/118638179|title=Rap Radar - Little Brother, Episode 74|via=tidal.com}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, it was revealed that Little Brother was to return and release new music later in the year, announcing their appearance at the upcoming [[Hopscotch Music Festival]] at September 7, 2019 in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].

The album was completed in secret with many artists who featured on the album not knowing that they were contributing to a Little Brother album. The album was also remarkable for killing the singer Percy Miracles, who was an alter ego of Phonte. The first skit on the album features DJ [[Peter Rosenberg]] discussing the death of Percy. This concept was a tribute to the fact that that the death of [[Phife Dawg]] was the event that brought the Phonte and Pooh back together.<ref name=\"tidal.com\"/> It was revealed in an interview on the ''Premium Pete Show'' that 9th Wonder was to have been a part of the reunion album, under its original title ''Homecoming''. The title was changed due to [[Beyonce]] releasing ''[[Homecoming: The Live Album]]'' to coincide with her concert film ''[[Homecoming (2019 film)|Homecoming]]''.

The album's theme compared present day rap music and the music industry to the [[minstrel shows]] of the late 19th century. A music video for the single, \"Lovin' It\", was directed by Joey Boukadakis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/25528219|title=Little Brother - \"Lovin' It\"|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-06-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Little Brother became embroiled in a short-lived feud, when [[Young Jeezy]]'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Slick Pulla]] challenged the group to a [[Battle rap|battle]] after hearing an interview in which Phonte voiced some disapproval concerning \"drug rap\" and Young Jeezy's \"snowman mascot\". Little Brother did not respond, and instead, Phonte called Slick Pulla and the pair resolved the misunderstanding.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===''Getback'' album and 9th Wonder's departure===\nIn late 2006, Little Brother began recording their third album, and second for [[Atlantic Records]], ''[[Getback]]''. However, in January 2007, the group announced both their departure from Atlantic and that producer [[9th Wonder]] had left the group.<ref name=\"9th Wonder and Little Brother Part Ways; Rapper Pooh Clears Up Little Brother Rumors\">{{cite web | last = Kayser | first = Brian | url = http://hiphopgame.ihiphop.com/news.php3?id=1510 | title = 9th Wonder and Little Brother Part Ways; Rapper Pooh Clears Up Little Brother Rumors | work = Kayser, Brian | publisher = HipHopGame.com | accessdate = 27 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe move from Atlantic was due to the commercial failure of ''[[The Minstrel Show]]'', and creative differences over the group's future material. [[Rapper Big Pooh]] said:\n\n{{quote|We as a group just felt that it was not in our best interest to remain in a situation where our needs were constantly being overlooked.

This is just a decision that had to be made so all three of us could move forward and continue to provide the world with dope music.<ref name=\"9th Wonder and Little Brother Part Ways; Rapper Pooh Clears Up Little Brother Rumors\"/>}}\n\nOn October 23, 2007 Little Brother released ''[[Getback]]'', the long-awaited follow-up to ''The Minstrel Show''. With no major video or radio airplay, ''Getback'' sold approximately 9,600 copies during its first week in stores and landed at No. 89 on the ''Billboard 200'' chart. The album consisted of 11 songs, and featured several guests, most notably [[New Orleans]]-based rapper [[Lil Wayne]]. Lil Wayne had been a longtime fan of the group's work and was invited to rap on the third verse for \"Breakin My Heart\".\n\nFollowing the release of ''Getback'' in late 2007, Little Brother toured with [[Los Angeles]]-based alternative hip hop artist [[Evidence (musician)|Evidence]] of [[Dilated Peoples]].\n\nThe remainder of 2007 found Little Brother working on becoming completely independent artists and putting out records on their own. Big Pooh told ''[[L.A.

The CD version contained 5 new songs for the album and the [[iTunes]] version had 7 new songs. The iTunes version linked former groupmate 9th Wonder to the group with the single, \"Black Light Special\".\n\n===Individual member side-projects===\nOutside of Little Brother, [[Phonte]] began a collaboration with [[Netherlands]]-based [[Record producer|producer]] [[Nicolay (musician)|Nicolay]] as the group [[The Foreign Exchange]], that ultimately resulted in the release of their debut album, ''[[Connected (The Foreign Exchange album)|Connected]]'', in 2004. The Foreign Exchange released their follow-up album entitled ''[[Leave It All Behind (The Foreign Exchange album)|Leave It All Behind]]'', in October 2008.\n\n[[Rapper Big Pooh]] released a solo album entitled ''[[Sleepers (album)|Sleepers]]'' in 2005. In 2009, he released two albums, ''The Delightful Bars'', and ''Rapper's Delight''. In early 2010, Rapper Big Pooh released ''The Purple Tape'' mixtape as a free [[Music download|download]].

That's what it's all about -- you don't want your favorite group to force a relationship. Like, you don't want Tribe Called Quest ... If they don't really want to be together, you want them to make another album. If they make an album just because you asked for it, it's not going to be the same Tribe Called Quest you fell in love with.

At this time [[Rapper Big Pooh]] and [[Phonte]] had not spoken in 5 years. Pooh sent Phonte a short message of love and appreciation. Phonte followed this text with a phone call where the two were said to have spoken for several hours. This and many followup conversations allowed the duo to rekindle their friendship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shows.pippa.io/itsthereal/episodes/270-little-brother|title=#270: Little Brother &#124; A Waste Of Time with ItsTheReal|via=shows.pippa.io}}</ref>\n\n[[Phonte]], [[Rapper Big Pooh]] and [[9th Wonder]] reunited on stage together for the first time in eleven years at their hometown in the 2018 Art of Cool Festival. This reunion was the result of [[Royce da 5'9\"]] being unable to attend the festival. According to Phonte, he was contacted by the promoters to substitute for Royce and called Pooh and 9th to collaborate with him. The group had not performed together in over a decade, so they performed many of their known hits including \"Say it Again,\" \"Loving It\", \"The Way You Do It,\" and \"Dreams.\" Both artists felt that the energy from the show was a good omen, and after leaving the stage they knew they had something special. Following this performance, Phonte invited Pooh to a barbeque at his home where they decided to continue the collaboration.<ref name=\"tidal.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://tidal.com/browse/video/118638179|title=Rap Radar - Little Brother, Episode 74|via=tidal.com}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, it was revealed that Little Brother was to return and release new music later in the year, announcing their appearance at the upcoming [[Hopscotch Music Festival]] at September 7, 2019 in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. However, it was also revealed that 9th Wonder would not be returning as a third member of the group, with Phonte and Rapper Big Pooh continuing under the name; as they have been doing since 2007.\n\nOn August 19, 2019, it was announced that Little Brother will be releasing a new album, titled \"May the Lord Watch\", which was released the following day on the 20th.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B1WT1RLgXyt/|title=Phonte Coleman on Instagram: \"Little Brother.

The album was completed in secret with many artists who featured on the album not knowing that they were contributing to a Little Brother album. The album was also remarkable for killing the singer Percy Miracles, who was an alter ego of Phonte. The first skit on the album features DJ [[Peter Rosenberg]] discussing the death of Percy. This concept was a tribute to the fact that that the death of [[Phife Dawg]] was the event that brought the Phonte and Pooh back together.<ref name=\"tidal.com\"/> It was revealed in an interview on the ''Premium Pete Show'' that 9th Wonder was to have been a part of the reunion album, under its original title ''Homecoming''. The title was changed due to [[Beyonce]] releasing ''[[Homecoming: The Live Album]]'' to coincide with her concert film ''[[Homecoming (2019 film)|Homecoming]]''. Phonte and Pooh decided to continue the project without 9th after several disagreements over production and touring commitments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52769/title.little-brother-reveals-why-9th-wonder-wasnt-part-of-reunion-album|title=Little Brother Reveals Why 9th Wonder Wasn't Part Of Reunion Album|first=HipHopDX-|last=https://hiphopdx.com|date=September 10, 2019|website=HipHopDX}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Little Brother discography}}\n*2003: ''[[The Listening (Little Brother album)|The Listening]]''\n*2005: ''[[The Minstrel Show]]''\n*2007: ''[[Getback]]''\n*2010: ''[[Leftback LP|Leftback]]''\n*2019: ''[[May the Lord Watch]]''\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.myspace.com/littlebrother Official website]\n*[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p556916|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic.com Biography - Little Brother]\n*[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Little+Brother+(3) Discogs Profile - Little Brother]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Little Brother}}\n{{Justus League}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Little Brother}}\n[[Category:American hip hop groups]]\n[[Category:Atlantic Records artists]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2010]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2001]]\n[[Category:American musical trios]]\n[[Category:Southern hip hop musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Durham, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Alternative hip hop groups]]\n[[Category:African-American musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from North Carolina]]\n", "name_user": "Derek R Bullamore", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Brother_(group)"}

The most important is the overall standings, calculated by adding each skier's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) are awarded at both sprint stages and at intermediate points during mass start stages. In the sprint stages, the winners are awarded 60 bonus seconds, while on mass start stages the first ten skiers past the intermediate point received from 15 seconds to 1 seconds. The skier with the lowest cumulative time will be the overall winner of the Tour de Ski. For the second time in Tour history, the skier leading the overall standings will wear a yellow bib.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders \" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Bonus seconds for the top 30 positions by type\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | 1\n! scope=\"col\" | 2\n! scope=\"col\" | 3\n! scope=\"col\" | 4\n! scope=\"col\" | 5\n! scope=\"col\" | 6\n! scope=\"col\" | 7\n! scope=\"col\" | 8\n! scope=\"col\" | 9\n! scope=\"col\" | 10\n! scope=\"col\" | 11\n! scope=\"col\" | 12\n! scope=\"col\" | 13\u201315\n! scope=\"col\" | 16\u201320\n! scope=\"col\" | 21\u201325\n! scope=\"col\" | 26\u201330\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4| In finish\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Interval start\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"16\" | ''none''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mass start\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Pursuit \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Sprint\n| 60 || 54 || 48 || 46 || 44 || 42 || 32 || 30 || 28 || 26 || 24 || 22 || 10 || 8 || 6 || 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Intermediate sprint \n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mass Start\n| 15 || 12 || 10 || 8 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 || colspan=\"6\"| ''none''\n|}\n\nThe second competition is the points standings, which replaced the sprint competition from past editions.

The most important is the overall standings, calculated by adding each skier's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) are awarded at both sprint stages and at intermediate points during mass start stages. In the sprint stages, the winners are awarded 60 bonus seconds, while on mass start stages the first ten skiers past the intermediate point received from 15 seconds to 1 seconds. The skier with the lowest cumulative time will be the overall winner of the Tour de Ski. For the second time in Tour history, the skier leading the overall standings will wear a yellow bib.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders \" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Bonus seconds for the top 30 positions by type\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | 1\n! scope=\"col\" | 2\n! scope=\"col\" | 3\n! scope=\"col\" | 4\n! scope=\"col\" | 5\n! scope=\"col\" | 6\n! scope=\"col\" | 7\n! scope=\"col\" | 8\n! scope=\"col\" | 9\n! scope=\"col\" | 10\n! scope=\"col\" | 11\n! scope=\"col\" | 12\n! scope=\"col\" | 13\u201315\n! scope=\"col\" | 16\u201320\n! scope=\"col\" | 21\u201325\n! scope=\"col\" | 26\u201330\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4| In finish\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Interval start\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"16\" | ''none''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mass start\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Pursuit \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Sprint\n| 60 || 54 || 48 || 46 || 44 || 42 || 32 || 30 || 28 || 26 || 24 || 22 || 10 || 8 || 6 || 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Intermediate sprint \n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mass Start\n| 15 || 12 || 10 || 8 || 6 || 5 || 4 || 3 || 2 || 1 || colspan=\"6\"| ''none''\n|}\n\nThe second competition is the points standings, which replaced the sprint competition from past editions.

A third and final season, which completes the story of Lorenzo, premiered on Rai 2 in Italy on 2 December 2019.\n\nDespite being criticised for some historical inaccuracies, the series reached between four and eight million viewers on original airings. According to Italian ratings compiler Auditel, the broadcast of the first episode attracted a record 8.04&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toutelatele.com/les-medicis-maitres-de-florence-carton-d-audience-pour-la-serie-de-sfr-play-85995|title=Les M\u00e9dicis, Ma\u00eetres de Florence : carton d\u2019audience pour la s\u00e9rie de SFR Play|website=Toutelatele|language=fr|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref> \n\nThe series is broadcast in 190 countries worldwide, including on [[Netflix]] in the United States, Canada, the UK, Ireland and India,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2016/11/wild-bunch-tv-sells-big-lights-medici-masters-florence-netflix-us-canada-india/|title=Wild Bunch TV Sells Big Light\u2019s \u2018Medici: Masters Of Florence\u2019 To Netflix In US, Canada & India|last=Munn|first=Patrick|date=24 November 2016|work=TV Wise|publisher=[[Disqus]]|access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> and on [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mediaweek.com.au/medici-masters-florence-sbs/ |title=Medici: Masters of Florence premiering on SBS this April |date=4 April 2017 |magazine=[[MediaWeek]] |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nFlorence, 1429. [[Giovanni de' Medici (1360-1429)|Giovanni de' Medici]] is a rich banker who also represents one of the most important political forces of Florence's [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]]. He has a plan to increase his family power by making an agreement with the Church of Rome. The election of a new Pope is about to take place and Giovanni sends his sons [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo]] and [[Lorenzo the Elder|Lorenzo]] to Rome in order to encourage the election of a Pope close to his family. In Rome, Cosimo, fascinated by the beauty of ancient architectures and art, meets Donatello and one of his models Bianca. Cosimo falls in love with her but is then forced to leave her and marry [[Contessina de' Bardi|Contessina de Bardi]], a political marriage arranged by Giovanni and Contessina's father. The Medici's candidate gets elected, which ensures to the bank of the Medici an unparalleled economic power. Twenty years later, Giovanni is mysteriously murdered and Cosimo and Lorenzo try to secretly investigate his death. Meanwhile the political situation in the city is troubled by plots against the Medici family's power, and their vision for the future of Florence - which will then lead to the Renaissance - is in danger. Cosimo's dream is to complete the [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo of Florence]], but no architect seems to have a feasible solution due to the shape of the base created for the dome. Finally, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] introduces himself to Cosimo and shows him plans for the dome. Cosimo decides to trust Brunelleschi and the construction of the dome starts, bringing jobs and people to Florence. Meanwhile, the mystery surrounding the death of Giovanni thickens and Rinaldo Albizzi, Cosimo's main opponent in the Signoria, tries to block the construction and to incite the people to rise up against the Medicis.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nTwenty years have passed since the events of the first season. [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]], Cosimo's son, and his wife Lucrezia are now at the head of the family. The power of the Medici has consolidated over time, but an assassination attempt on Piero brings to light his mismanagement of the family bank. The Sforza family have the greatest debt towards the bank and manage to make an agreement with Piero to erase their debts. The solution proposed by Sforza would also bring about the invasion of Florence.  [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]], Piero's son, in order to avoid the fall of Florence, takes over the role of his father both in the government of the Signoria and as head of the family, avoiding the invasion. Although he has a relationship with a married woman, Lucrezia Donati, Lorenzo eventually accepts marriage with a rich Roman noblewoman, Clarice Orsini. His brother [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]] and his dear friend [[Sandro Botticelli]], both meet and fall in love with Simonetta, although in different ways. Botticelli's interest is an artistic one and leads to the painting of Venus and Mars in which Simonetta is represented alongside Giuliano.\nThe Pazzi family, led by Jacopo Pazzi and his nephew Francesco, join forces with the Pope in order to increase the Church's control of nearby territories and mines, in opposition to the Medici's policy. This argument will eventually lead to a conspiracy against Lorenzo in an attempt to put an end to his power and his dream of a peaceful and culturally alive Florence.\n\n===Season 3===\nThis season starts immediately after the previous one. Following the breakdown of the Pazzi conspiracy, Lorenzo must still face a military coalition from the Pontifical states and the Kingdom of Naples, led by the ambitious [[Girolamo Riario]]. He undertakes a diplomatic journey to Naples and succeeds in negotiating a separate peace.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Medici episodes}}\n{{:List of Medici episodes}}\n==Cast==\n=== Season 1: ''Masters of Florence'' ===\n{{div col}}\n*[[Richard Madden]] as [[Cosimo de' Medici]]: Head of the Medici family after his father's death\n*[[Stuart Martin]] as [[Lorenzo the Elder|Lorenzo de' Medici]]: Cosimo's younger brother\n*[[Annabel Scholey]] as [[Contessina de' Bardi]]: Cosimo's wife.

For example, the Medici Palazzo was built in 1440s\u20131480s and the Benozzo Gozzoli frescoes of Magi Chapel shown in the Cosimo study were executed in 1459\u201361. The Lorenzo rooms are decorated with the Giulio Romano fresco \"Mars and Venus\" which was painted in the 1520s in Palazzo Te in Mantova. During the episode exile in Venice, the church of Santa Maria della Salute built in the 1630s is repeatedly shown as part of the Venice city landscape.

Each season follows the events of a particular moment of the family history exploring the political and artistic landscape of Renaissance Italy.  \n\nThe first season, titled ''Medici: Masters of Florence'', takes place in 1429, the year [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], head of the family, died. His son [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo de Medici]] succeeds him as head of the family bank, the richest bank of Europe at that time, and fights to preserve his power in Florence. The second season, titled ''Medici: The Magnificent'', takes place 20 years later and tells the story of Cosimo's grandson [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo de Medici]] (known as the Magnificent). A third and final season, which completes the story of Lorenzo, premiered on Rai 2 in Italy on 2 December 2019.\n\nDespite being criticised for some historical inaccuracies, the series reached between four and eight million viewers on original airings. According to Italian ratings compiler Auditel, the broadcast of the first episode attracted a record 8.04&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toutelatele.com/les-medicis-maitres-de-florence-carton-d-audience-pour-la-serie-de-sfr-play-85995|title=Les M\u00e9dicis, Ma\u00eetres de Florence : carton d\u2019audience pour la s\u00e9rie de SFR Play|website=Toutelatele|language=fr|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref> \n\nThe series is broadcast in 190 countries worldwide, including on [[Netflix]] in the United States, Canada, the UK, Ireland and India,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2016/11/wild-bunch-tv-sells-big-lights-medici-masters-florence-netflix-us-canada-india/|title=Wild Bunch TV Sells Big Light\u2019s \u2018Medici: Masters Of Florence\u2019 To Netflix In US, Canada & India|last=Munn|first=Patrick|date=24 November 2016|work=TV Wise|publisher=[[Disqus]]|access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> and on [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mediaweek.com.au/medici-masters-florence-sbs/ |title=Medici: Masters of Florence premiering on SBS this April |date=4 April 2017 |magazine=[[MediaWeek]] |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nFlorence, 1429. [[Giovanni de' Medici (1360-1429)|Giovanni de' Medici]] is a rich banker who also represents one of the most important political forces of Florence's [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]]. He has a plan to increase his family power by making an agreement with the Church of Rome. The election of a new Pope is about to take place and Giovanni sends his sons [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo]] and [[Lorenzo the Elder|Lorenzo]] to Rome in order to encourage the election of a Pope close to his family. In Rome, Cosimo, fascinated by the beauty of ancient architectures and art, meets Donatello and one of his models Bianca. Cosimo falls in love with her but is then forced to leave her and marry [[Contessina de' Bardi|Contessina de Bardi]], a political marriage arranged by Giovanni and Contessina's father. The Medici's candidate gets elected, which ensures to the bank of the Medici an unparalleled economic power. Twenty years later, Giovanni is mysteriously murdered and Cosimo and Lorenzo try to secretly investigate his death. Meanwhile the political situation in the city is troubled by plots against the Medici family's power, and their vision for the future of Florence - which will then lead to the Renaissance - is in danger. Cosimo's dream is to complete the [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo of Florence]], but no architect seems to have a feasible solution due to the shape of the base created for the dome. Finally, [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] introduces himself to Cosimo and shows him plans for the dome. Cosimo decides to trust Brunelleschi and the construction of the dome starts, bringing jobs and people to Florence. Meanwhile, the mystery surrounding the death of Giovanni thickens and Rinaldo Albizzi, Cosimo's main opponent in the Signoria, tries to block the construction and to incite the people to rise up against the Medicis.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nTwenty years have passed since the events of the first season. [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero]], Cosimo's son, and his wife Lucrezia are now at the head of the family. The power of the Medici has consolidated over time, but an assassination attempt on Piero brings to light his mismanagement of the family bank. The Sforza family have the greatest debt towards the bank and manage to make an agreement with Piero to erase their debts. The solution proposed by Sforza would also bring about the invasion of Florence.  [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]], Piero's son, in order to avoid the fall of Florence, takes over the role of his father both in the government of the Signoria and as head of the family, avoiding the invasion. Although he has a relationship with a married woman, Lucrezia Donati, Lorenzo eventually accepts marriage with a rich Roman noblewoman, Clarice Orsini. His brother [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]] and his dear friend [[Sandro Botticelli]], both meet and fall in love with Simonetta, although in different ways. Botticelli's interest is an artistic one and leads to the painting of Venus and Mars in which Simonetta is represented alongside Giuliano.\nThe Pazzi family, led by Jacopo Pazzi and his nephew Francesco, join forces with the Pope in order to increase the Church's control of nearby territories and mines, in opposition to the Medici's policy. This argument will eventually lead to a conspiracy against Lorenzo in an attempt to put an end to his power and his dream of a peaceful and culturally alive Florence.\n\n===Season 3===\nThis season starts immediately after the previous one.

The central courtyard in the Castle features a particularly recognisable staircase with the sculpture of a bear; this staircase becomes the principal entrance of the Medici home in Florence with the addition of the Medici Coat of Arms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gismonda.it/en/2017/01/26/medici-tv-series-location-castle-bracciano/ |title=I Medici Masters of Florence tv series location: Castle Bracciano |date=26 January 2017 |access-date=28 October 2018 |work=Gismonda}}</ref>\n* The [[Villa Farnese]] in Caprarola and its gardens: The frescoed and ring-vaulted internal terrace-courtyard of Villa Caprarola doubles as a Medici villa in the series, while an un-frescoed terrace is used as a Vatican property in Rome. The Caprarola secret gardens with their unique fountains are used to represent the Vatican Gardens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gismonda.it/en/2017/03/06/medici-masters-of-florence-tv-series-locations-palazzo-farnese-caprarola/ |title=Medici Masters of Florence tv series locations: Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola |date=6 March 2017 |access-date=28 October 2018 |work=Gismonda}}</ref>\nThe creators took significant liberties with sets, often showing interior decorations, works of art, and exterior landscapes that were created many years after the events described in the series which occur in the mid-1430s. For example, the Medici Palazzo was built in 1440s\u20131480s and the Benozzo Gozzoli frescoes of Magi Chapel shown in the Cosimo study were executed in 1459\u201361. The Lorenzo rooms are decorated with the Giulio Romano fresco \"Mars and Venus\" which was painted in the 1520s in Palazzo Te in Mantova. During the episode exile in Venice, the church of Santa Maria della Salute built in the 1630s is repeatedly shown as part of the Venice city landscape. Villa Medici contains \"Fortitude and Temperance with Six Antique Heroes\" by Perugino, painted in 1497.\n* Castle of [[Santa Severa]] is Cardinal Baldassarre Cossa's Palace.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gismonda.it/en/2017/01/28/medici-tv-series-locations-castle-santa-severa/ |title=Medici Masters of Florence tv series locations: Castle of Santa Severa |date=28 January 2017 |access-date=28 October 2018 |work=Gismonda}}</ref>\n* The medieval oldtown of [[Viterbo]] and its [[Palazzo dei Papi di Viterbo|Palazzo dei Papi]] are the set for late medieval Rome.\n* [[Hadrian's Villa]] in [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]] is another set for Rome; Cosimo meets [[Donatello]] along the Canopus.\n* Borgo di Rota, a [[frazione]] of [[Tolfa]], is the set for Francesco Sforza's army camp and the village where Lorenzo meets mercenary Ferzetti.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gismonda.it/en/2017/02/26/medici-tv-series-locations-castle-of-rota/ |title=Medici Masters of Florence tv series locations: Castle of Rota |date=26 February 2017 |access-date=28 October 2018 |work=Gismonda}}</ref>\n* [[Pienza]]: used as the Palazzo Medici, the streets of Florence, and the background for Cosimo's wedding.\n* [[Montepulciano]]: Several scenes are filmed outside the Duomo using the unfinished fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral as a backdrop.  These scenes often incorrectly show the Duomo of Florence rising in the background to the north.  The Communal Palace, also in Piazza Grande, is part of several scenes, as is the Church of San Biagio.\n\n===Technical details===\n''Medici: Masters of Florence'' was originated in 4k video and broadcast in this format on the free Italian satellite service Tivu whilst on the Italian Digital Terrestrial service DVB-T2 it was broadcast in Full-HD 1920\u00d71080.\n\nTwo audio tracks were broadcast: Rai TV gave satellite and terrestrial viewers the option to watch the series in Italian or English.<ref>Medicimastersoflorence.com</ref>\n\n== International transmission ==\n\n[[Netflix]] carries out the show in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland and India since December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvwise.co.uk/2016/11/wild-bunch-tv-sells-big-lights-medici-masters-florence-netflix-us-canada-india/|title=Wild Bunch TV Sells Big Light\u2019s \u2018Medici: Masters Of Florence\u2019 To Netflix In US, Canada & India|last=Munn|first=Patrick|date=24 November 2016|work=TV Wise|publisher=[[Disqus]]|access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe series is broadcast in 190 countries countries worldwide, including on [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] in Australia,<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mediaweek.com.au/medici-masters-florence-sbs/ |title=Medici: Masters of Florence premiering on SBS this April |date=4 April 2017 |magazine=[[MediaWeek]] |access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref> on [[Fox Premium]] in Argentina, [[SFR]]'s premium [[Video on demand|SVOD]] service Zive in France, [[Sky 1]] in Germany,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/global/pay-tv-sky-sky-1-germany-austria-1201908343/ |title=Pay-TV Operator Sky Launches Entertainment Channel Sky 1 in Germany, Austria |first=Leo |last=Barraclough |date=3 November 2016 |access-date=30 November 2018 |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]}}</ref> on [[RTP1]] in Portugal, and on [[RTS2]] in Serbia.

They play in [[Premiership Rugby]], England's top division of rugby.\n\nThe club was founded in 1880 and since 1892 plays its home matches at [[Welford Road Stadium]] in the south of the city. The club has been known by the nickname '''Tigers''' since at least 1885. In the [[2018-19 Premiership Rugby|2018&ndash;19 Premiership Rugby season]] Tigers finished 11th, this entitled them to compete in the [[2019-20 European Rugby Challenge Cup]].  The current head coach is [[Geordan Murphy]] who was appointed in September 2018.\n\nLeicester have won 20 major titles. They were European Champions twice, back-to-back in [[2001 Heineken Cup Final|2001]] and [[2002 Heineken Cup Final|2002]]; have won a record 10 [[Premiership Rugby|English Championships]]; and have won eight [[Anglo-Welsh Cup]]s, most recently in [[2016-17 Anglo-Welsh Cup|2017]].  Leicester last won the [[Premiership Rugby]] title in the [[2012-13 English Premiership (rugby union)|2013]] and appeared in a record nine successive Premiership finals, from 2005 to 2013.  Leicester are one of only four teams never to have been relegated from the top division.  Leicester have appeared in five European finals, the joint-second most overall, as well as the two victories they have also lost finals three times, in [[1997 Heineken Cup Final|1997]], [[2007 Heineken Cup Final|2007]] and [[2009 Heineken Cup Final|2009]].\n\nThree Leicester Tigers players were members of the [[2003 Rugby World Cup Final]] winning {{nrut|England}} side including captain [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]].\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of Leicester Tigers}}\n\n===Foundation and Tom Crumbie era (1880\u20131928)===\n[[File:LeicesterTigers1894.jpg|360px|thumb|right|Leicester Tigers in 1894]]\n\nLeicester Football Club was formed on 3 August 1880 by the merger of three smaller teams: Leicester Societies AFC, Leicester Amateur FC and Leicester Alert.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=16}} The club's first game was a scoreless draw on 23 October against [[Moseley Rugby Football Club|Moseley]] at the [[Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=17}} On 10 September 1892 Leicester played their first game at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] against a Leicestershire XV.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=31}}  [[Tom Crumbie]] was appointed secretary on 2 August 1895, a position he held for the next 33 years.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=33}}  Crumbie has been credited with dragging the club to national prominence. He disbanded reserve and third teams making the First XV an invitation side and introducing players from all over the country.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=38}}{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=86}}  Tigers first silverware was the [[Midland Counties Football Union#Midlands Counties Cup|Midlands Counties Cup]] won for the first time in 1898 against [[Moseley Rugby Football Club|Moseley]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=41}} Having won the Midlands Counties Cup every year from 1898 to 1905, they dropped out \"to give other teams a chance\".<ref>The Tigers Tale, Page 19, D.Hands, {{ISBN|0-9514862-5-X}}</ref>  On their return to the competition in 1909 Tigers won the cup again.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=61}} In 1903 [[Jack Miles (rugby union)|Jack Miles]] became the first home produced [[England national rugby union team|England]] international.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=448}}  Leicester's status as a premier club was confirmed in 1905 when a crowd of 20,000 was on hand to see the club face [[The Original All Blacks]], losing 28-0.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=43}}  December 1909 saw Tigers play the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] for the first time, holding them to a 9-9 draw.  The fixture became a vital feature in the club's calendar delivering large attendances until open professionalism and league rugby in the 1990s forced it to gradually be abandoned due to fixture congestion.  Tigers won the Midlands Counties Cup three more times in four years to cement their place as the midland's premier side before the outbreak of [[First World War|war]] in 1914.  The visit of the [[1924-25 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France|Invincible All Blacks]] on 4 October 1924 saw a record attendance at Welford Road of 35,000 that stands to this day.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=83}}  Tigers were beaten 27-0 by the tourists.\n\n===Lions captains, decline and club restructure (1928\u20131971)===\n[[File:Racing-Leicester-1923.jpg|360px|thumb|right|Leicester's match against [[Racing 92|Racing club de France]] in February 1923]]\n\nClub captain [[Doug Prentice]] captained the [[1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=95}}  The first [[BBC]] radio broadcast of a Tigers game was against [[Waterloo FC|Waterloo]] on 29 November 1930; Tigers won 21-5.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=95}}  [[Bernard Gadney]] became the club's first home produced England captain in 1934 and was captain when four Leicester players were part of the first [[England national rugby union team|England]] side to beat the [[1935-36 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and Canada|All Blacks]]. Gadney also became the club's second player to captain the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] on their [[1936 British Lions tour to Argentina|tour to Argentina]].  1936-37 was the worst season since 1889-90 for the club with only 14 wins from 39 matches.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=108}}\n\nTigers first televised game by the [[BBC]] was on 3 February 1951 when they beat [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]] 14-0 at the [[Athletic Ground, Richmond|Richmond Athletic Ground]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=121}}\nThe club underwent a significant restructure in the 1956/57 season.  The practice of being an \"invitation\" club featuring only a First XV  stopped and Tigers adopted a more traditional membership club based approach with multiple sides.  The \"A XV\" was to be re-introduced under the name \"Extra First XV\" with a third \"Colts XV\" also formed.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=134}}  The 1963/64 season saw [[David Matthews (rugby union)|David Matthews]] set the record for most consecutive appearances for the club with 109.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=444}}  [[David Matthews (rugby union)|Matthews]] was to become captain in 1965 and in 1966/67 lead the club to a record 33 wins.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=161}}  [[Chalkie White (rugby player)|Chalkie White]] became coach in 1968; the same season [[Tom Berry (rugby union)|Tom Berry]] became Leicester's first President of the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]]. White was credited with revolutionising Leicester's player in response to rule changes which opened up the game.  1970/71 saw [[Peter Wheeler (rugby union)|Peter Wheeler]] emerge as first choice hooker having made his debut the year before, he ended the season on [[1971 England rugby union tour of Far East|England's tour to the Far East]].  Attendance for the annual [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] game hit a nadir with a crowd of only 2,518.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=176}}\n\n===Introduction of competitions (1971\u20131978)===\n\nThe 1971/72 season saw changes which would radically change both the club and the game.  The [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] introduced a national [[1971-72 John Player Cup|Knockout Cup]] competition for clubs and on 16 November 1971 Tigers played their first competitive cup match since 1914, a 10-3 defeat to [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham]] at their Beeston ground.  Also introduced that season was Tigers' first \"Youth\" XV, based on a collection of the best 14 and 15 year olds in the county.  Only six year later [[Paul Dodge]] became the first graduate to win an international cap.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=173}}\n\nTigers were not involved in the 1974-75 Cup and lost in the 1st round of the [[1975-76 John Player Cup|1975-76 Cup]].  This forced the club into the Midlands qualifiers for the only time.  This era saw a huge increase in the popularity of the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] annual fixture with crowds of 15,000 in 1973 & 1975, 17,000 in 1974 and 21,000 in 1976.  This contrasted with usual crowds in the low hundreds.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=189}}  1976-77 saw the introduction of regional \"Merit Tables\" by the RFU, the first step on the road to full leagues.  Based around traditional fixtures Tigers finished second to Moseley in the Midlands Merit Table with a record of played 8 won 6.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=189}}  It took 6 years before Leicester were drawn at home in the cup but in [[1977-78 John Player Cup|1977-78]] they received four in a row on their way to a first [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]] final against [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]].  The game ended in a 6-3 loss to the Cherry and Whites; the attendance was 25,282 more than double the previous season.  Cup success also coincided with Tigers membership more than doubling from 750 in 1978 to 2,000 by the end of 1979.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=190}}\n\n===Cup success, centenary and first league title (1979\u20131988)===\n\nLeicester secured their first national trophy, the [[1978\u201379 John Player Cup]], by defeating Moseley 15\u201312. Tigers retained the cup in [[1979-80 John Player Cup|1979\u201380]] beating [[London Irish]] 21\u20139 at Twickenham in front of a record crowd of 27,000.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=199}} 1979\u201380 also saw Tigers win the Midlands Merit Table for the first time. To celebrate the club's centenary a six-match tour to [[Australia]] and [[Fiji]] was arranged in August 1980, the first undertaken by an English club in the southern hemisphere.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Prestige fixtures staged at Welford Road to mark the centenary were the visit of the [[Ireland Wolfhounds|Irish Wolfhounds]], [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], and [[Queensland Reds|Queensland]]. Tigers retained the Midlands Merit Table title in November with an undefeated record. On 25 April 1981 Tigers' [[Dusty Hare]] broke the world record for points scored in first-class fixtures with 3,658 points.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=201}}  Leicester retained the cup in [[1980-81 John Player Cup|1980\u201381]] by beating [[Newcastle Falcons|Gosforth]] 22\u201315.\n\nLeicester were knocked out in the semi finals of the [[1981-82 John Player Cup|1982 Cup]]. This was also [[Chalkie White (rugby player)|Chalkie White]]'s last season with the club after 30 years as a player, administrator or coach. A new generation of players debuted in the early '80s: [[Dean Richards (rugby union)|Dean Richards]], [[John Wells (rugby union)|John Wells]], and [[Rory Underwood]]. In 1985 in the penultimate step towards league rugby, the Merit Table A was launched for two seasons where Tigers finished fourth and second. League rugby was launched in England with the [[1987\u201388 Courage League]] and all sides now played all other sides in a round robin. Tigers lost only one match all season and the end of the [[1987\u201388 Courage League|1987\u201388 season]] Tigers became England's first official champions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.premiershiprugby.com/history/|publisher=Premiership Rugby|title=Premiership Rugby - History|accessdate=2 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nTigers finished the [[1988\u201389 Courage League]] in sixth, their joint worst ever finish.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=226}} During the late 1980s and early 1990s several key members of the Leicester pack came through the youth ranks and became key first-team contributors, most notably lock [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]] who debuted in 1989 and later became club captain; flanker [[Neil Back]] who joined in 1990; and the front row trio of [[Graham Rowntree]], [[Richard Cockerill]], and [[Darren Garforth]] who started 166 games together between 1992 and 2002.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=492}}\n\n===Success in professional and European era (1993\u20132003)===\nFrom 1993 to 2002 Leicester enjoyed a remarkable nine trophies in ten years. This streak started when Leicester won the [[1992-93 Pilkington Cup|1993 Pilkington Cup]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=241}} In 1993/94 Tigers finished runners up in the [[1993-94 English Premiership (rugby union)|Courage League]] to Bath. Leicester finished as [[1994-95 English Premiership (rugby union)|Courage League champion in 1994\u201395]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=246\u2013249}}\n\nThe advent of the 1995\u201396 season brought two important changes: rugby union (and consequently the Tigers) became professional, and European club competition began in the form of the [[Heineken cup]]. The 1995/96 season was another of just missing out to perennial rivals Bath who secured a league and cup double after defeating Leicester in the [[1995-96 Pilkington Cup|Pilkington Cup final]]. In Leicester's debut season in the [[Heineken Cup]] the team reached [[1997 Heineken Cup Final|the final]], losing 28-9 against [[CA Brive|Brive]]. Leicester won the [[1996-97 Pilkington Cup|1997 Pilkington Cup Final]] 9&ndash;3 against [[Sale Sharks|Sale]].

From 1884 to 1887, the club played in chocolate and yellow shirts, likely giving rise to the club's nickname, white shorts and black socks before experimenting with claret and French grey horizontal stripes between 1887 and 1891.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=456}}\n\nThe first use of the scarlet, green and white was on 3 October 1891 against [[Milton Keynes RUFC|Wolverton]] at Belgrave Cricket & Cycle Ground. However, for the 1891\u201392 season, the pattern was vertical stripes.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=21}} It was not until 1895 that the now-traditional scarlet, green and white horizontal stripes were introduced to the jersey, paired with black shorts and socks until 1906.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=456}} The Tigers then played three season between 1906 and 1909 in white shirts with navy shorts, the first two seasons with a leaping tiger logo on the left breast{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=44}} before reverting to a scarlet, green and white striped jersey, while retaining the navy shorts. This new kit layout lasted until 1947 when the navy shorts were swapped for white.\n\nThe Tigers kit and colours did not materially change between 1947 and 1999, only slight variations in the sizes of the stripes, the addition of a manufacturer's logo in 1975, a sponsor in 1988 and in 1991 the addition of the club crest for the first time since 1908.\n\nIn 1999, the Tigers switched to a darker green and have played in a variety of kit designs since.\n\n<center>\n{|\n| {{Football kit box\n  | leftarm=000000\n  | body=000000\n  | rightarm=000000\n  | shorts=FFFFFF\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1880\u20131884</center>\n}}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_maroon_hoops\n  | pattern_b=_orangehoops2\n  | pattern_ra=_maroon_hoops\n  | leftarm=FF7E00\n  | body=7B3F00\n  | rightarm=FF7E00\n  | shorts=FFFFFF\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1884\u20131887</center>\n}}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_maroon_hoops2\n  | pattern_b=_maroonhoops2\n  | pattern_ra=_maroon_hoops2\n  | leftarm=BEBEBE\n  | body=BEBEBE\n  | rightarm=BEBEBE\n  | shorts=FFFFFF\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1887\u20131891</center>\n}}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_leicester1892rugbykit\n  | pattern_b=_leicester1892rugbykit\n  | pattern_ra=_leicester1892rugbykit\n  | shorts=000000\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1891\u20131895</center>\n}}\n|}\n{|\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_b=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_ra=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_so=_band_red\n  | leftarm=008000\n  | body=\n  | rightarm=008000\n  | shorts=000000\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1895\u20131906</center>\n }}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=\n  | pattern_b=\n  | pattern_ra=\n  | pattern_so=_yellowtop\n  | leftarm=FFFFFF\n  | body=FFFFFF\n  | rightarm=FFFFFF\n  | shorts=003153\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1906\u20131909</center>\n }}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_b=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_ra=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_so=_band_red\n  | leftarm=008000\n  | body=\n  | rightarm=008000\n  | shorts=003153\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1906\u20131947</center>\n }}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_b=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_ra=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_so=_leicestersocks\n  | leftarm=008000\n  | body=\n  | rightarm=008000\n  | shorts=FFFFFF\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1947\u20131999</center>\n }}\n|}\n</center>\n\n<center>\n{|\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la = _leicestertigers2019h\n  | pattern_b  = _leicestertigers19h\n  | pattern_ra = _leicestertigers2019h\n  | pattern_sh = _leicestertigers2018h\n  | pattern_so =\n  | leftarm    = 006238\n  | body       = 006238\n  | rightarm   = 006238\n  | shorts     = 004738\n  | socks      = 004738\n  | title=<center>Current kit</center>}}\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe Tigers' current kit was launched on 11 September 2019<ref name=\"kit launch\">{{cite press release| url=https://www.leicestertigers.com/news/new-home-and-alternate-kits-revealed-for-2019-20-season | title=Tigers kits unveiled ahead of new season|publisher=Leicester Tigers|date=11 September 2019|accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref> and features Leicester's traditional green, red and white stripes.

They play in [[Premiership Rugby]], England's top division of rugby.\n\nThe club was founded in 1880 and since 1892 plays its home matches at [[Welford Road Stadium]] in the south of the city. The club has been known by the nickname '''Tigers''' since at least 1885. In the [[2018-19 Premiership Rugby|2018&ndash;19 Premiership Rugby season]] Tigers finished 11th, this entitled them to compete in the [[2019-20 European Rugby Challenge Cup]].  The current head coach is [[Geordan Murphy]] who was appointed in September 2018.\n\nLeicester have won 20 major titles. They were European Champions twice, back-to-back in [[2001 Heineken Cup Final|2001]] and [[2002 Heineken Cup Final|2002]]; have won a record 10 [[Premiership Rugby|English Championships]]; and have won eight [[Anglo-Welsh Cup]]s, most recently in [[2016-17 Anglo-Welsh Cup|2017]].  Leicester last won the [[Premiership Rugby]] title in the [[2012-13 English Premiership (rugby union)|2013]] and appeared in a record nine successive Premiership finals, from 2005 to 2013.  Leicester are one of only four teams never to have been relegated from the top division.  Leicester have appeared in five European finals, the joint-second most overall, as well as the two victories they have also lost finals three times, in [[1997 Heineken Cup Final|1997]], [[2007 Heineken Cup Final|2007]] and [[2009 Heineken Cup Final|2009]].\n\nThree Leicester Tigers players were members of the [[2003 Rugby World Cup Final]] winning {{nrut|England}} side including captain [[Martin Johnson (rugby union)|Martin Johnson]].\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of Leicester Tigers}}\n\n===Foundation and Tom Crumbie era (1880\u20131928)===\n[[File:LeicesterTigers1894.jpg|360px|thumb|right|Leicester Tigers in 1894]]\n\nLeicester Football Club was formed on 3 August 1880 by the merger of three smaller teams: Leicester Societies AFC, Leicester Amateur FC and Leicester Alert.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=16}} The club's first game was a scoreless draw on 23 October against [[Moseley Rugby Football Club|Moseley]] at the [[Belgrave Road Cycle and Cricket Ground]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=17}} On 10 September 1892 Leicester played their first game at [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]] against a Leicestershire XV.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=31}}  [[Tom Crumbie]] was appointed secretary on 2 August 1895, a position he held for the next 33 years.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=33}}  Crumbie has been credited with dragging the club to national prominence. He disbanded reserve and third teams making the First XV an invitation side and introducing players from all over the country.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=38}}{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=86}}  Tigers first silverware was the [[Midland Counties Football Union#Midlands Counties Cup|Midlands Counties Cup]] won for the first time in 1898 against [[Moseley Rugby Football Club|Moseley]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=41}} Having won the Midlands Counties Cup every year from 1898 to 1905, they dropped out \"to give other teams a chance\".<ref>The Tigers Tale, Page 19, D.Hands, {{ISBN|0-9514862-5-X}}</ref>  On their return to the competition in 1909 Tigers won the cup again.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=61}} In 1903 [[Jack Miles (rugby union)|Jack Miles]] became the first home produced [[England national rugby union team|England]] international.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=448}}  Leicester's status as a premier club was confirmed in 1905 when a crowd of 20,000 was on hand to see the club face [[The Original All Blacks]], losing 28-0.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=43}}  December 1909 saw Tigers play the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] for the first time, holding them to a 9-9 draw.  The fixture became a vital feature in the club's calendar delivering large attendances until open professionalism and league rugby in the 1990s forced it to gradually be abandoned due to fixture congestion.  Tigers won the Midlands Counties Cup three more times in four years to cement their place as the midland's premier side before the outbreak of [[First World War|war]] in 1914.  The visit of the [[1924-25 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France|Invincible All Blacks]] on 4 October 1924 saw a record attendance at Welford Road of 35,000 that stands to this day.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=83}}  Tigers were beaten 27-0 by the tourists.\n\n===Lions captains, decline and club restructure (1928\u20131971)===\n[[File:Racing-Leicester-1923.jpg|360px|thumb|right|Leicester's match against [[Racing 92|Racing club de France]] in February 1923]]\n\nClub captain [[Doug Prentice]] captained the [[1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=95}}  The first [[BBC]] radio broadcast of a Tigers game was against [[Waterloo FC|Waterloo]] on 29 November 1930; Tigers won 21-5.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=95}}  [[Bernard Gadney]] became the club's first home produced England captain in 1934 and was captain when four Leicester players were part of the first [[England national rugby union team|England]] side to beat the [[1935-36 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and Canada|All Blacks]]. Gadney also became the club's second player to captain the [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]] on their [[1936 British Lions tour to Argentina|tour to Argentina]].  1936-37 was the worst season since 1889-90 for the club with only 14 wins from 39 matches.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=108}}\n\nTigers first televised game by the [[BBC]] was on 3 February 1951 when they beat [[London Scottish F.C.|London Scottish]] 14-0 at the [[Athletic Ground, Richmond|Richmond Athletic Ground]].{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=121}}\nThe club underwent a significant restructure in the 1956/57 season.  The practice of being an \"invitation\" club featuring only a First XV  stopped and Tigers adopted a more traditional membership club based approach with multiple sides.  The \"A XV\" was to be re-introduced under the name \"Extra First XV\" with a third \"Colts XV\" also formed.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=134}}  The 1963/64 season saw [[David Matthews (rugby union)|David Matthews]] set the record for most consecutive appearances for the club with 109.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=444}}  [[David Matthews (rugby union)|Matthews]] was to become captain in 1965 and in 1966/67 lead the club to a record 33 wins.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=161}}  [[Chalkie White (rugby player)|Chalkie White]] became coach in 1968; the same season [[Tom Berry (rugby union)|Tom Berry]] became Leicester's first President of the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]]. White was credited with revolutionising Leicester's player in response to rule changes which opened up the game.  1970/71 saw [[Peter Wheeler (rugby union)|Peter Wheeler]] emerge as first choice hooker having made his debut the year before, he ended the season on [[1971 England rugby union tour of Far East|England's tour to the Far East]].  Attendance for the annual [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] game hit a nadir with a crowd of only 2,518.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=176}}\n\n===Introduction of competitions (1971\u20131978)===\n\nThe 1971/72 season saw changes which would radically change both the club and the game.  The [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] introduced a national [[1971-72 John Player Cup|Knockout Cup]] competition for clubs and on 16 November 1971 Tigers played their first competitive cup match since 1914, a 10-3 defeat to [[Nottingham R.F.C.|Nottingham]] at their Beeston ground.

This era saw a huge increase in the popularity of the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] annual fixture with crowds of 15,000 in 1973 & 1975, 17,000 in 1974 and 21,000 in 1976.

The game ended in a 6-3 loss to the Cherry and Whites; the attendance was 25,282 more than double the previous season.

A new generation of players debuted in the early '80s: [[Dean Richards (rugby union)|Dean Richards]], [[John Wells (rugby union)|John Wells]], and [[Rory Underwood]]. In 1985 in the penultimate step towards league rugby, the Merit Table A was launched for two seasons where Tigers finished fourth and second. League rugby was launched in England with the [[1987\u201388 Courage League]] and all sides now played all other sides in a round robin.

However, for the 1891\u201392 season, the pattern was vertical stripes.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=21}} It was not until 1895 that the now-traditional scarlet, green and white horizontal stripes were introduced to the jersey, paired with black shorts and socks until 1906.{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=456}} The Tigers then played three season between 1906 and 1909 in white shirts with navy shorts, the first two seasons with a leaping tiger logo on the left breast{{sfn|Farmer|Hands|2014|p=44}} before reverting to a scarlet, green and white striped jersey, while retaining the navy shorts. This new kit layout lasted until 1947 when the navy shorts were swapped for white.\n\nThe Tigers kit and colours did not materially change between 1947 and 1999, only slight variations in the sizes of the stripes, the addition of a manufacturer's logo in 1975, a sponsor in 1988 and in 1991 the addition of the club crest for the first time since 1908.\n\nIn 1999, the Tigers switched to a darker green and have played in a variety of kit designs since.\n\n<center>\n{|\n| {{Football kit box\n  | leftarm=000000\n  | body=000000\n  | rightarm=000000\n  | shorts=FFFFFF\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1880\u20131884</center>\n}}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_maroon_hoops\n  | pattern_b=_orangehoops2\n  | pattern_ra=_maroon_hoops\n  | leftarm=FF7E00\n  | body=7B3F00\n  | rightarm=FF7E00\n  | shorts=FFFFFF\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1884\u20131887</center>\n}}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_maroon_hoops2\n  | pattern_b=_maroonhoops2\n  | pattern_ra=_maroon_hoops2\n  | leftarm=BEBEBE\n  | body=BEBEBE\n  | rightarm=BEBEBE\n  | shorts=FFFFFF\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1887\u20131891</center>\n}}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_leicester1892rugbykit\n  | pattern_b=_leicester1892rugbykit\n  | pattern_ra=_leicester1892rugbykit\n  | shorts=000000\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1891\u20131895</center>\n}}\n|}\n{|\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_b=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_ra=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_so=_band_red\n  | leftarm=008000\n  | body=\n  | rightarm=008000\n  | shorts=000000\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1895\u20131906</center>\n }}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=\n  | pattern_b=\n  | pattern_ra=\n  | pattern_so=_yellowtop\n  | leftarm=FFFFFF\n  | body=FFFFFF\n  | rightarm=FFFFFF\n  | shorts=003153\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1906\u20131909</center>\n }}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_b=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_ra=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_so=_band_red\n  | leftarm=008000\n  | body=\n  | rightarm=008000\n  | shorts=003153\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1906\u20131947</center>\n }}\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_b=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_ra=_leicester99rugbykit\n  | pattern_so=_leicestersocks\n  | leftarm=008000\n  | body=\n  | rightarm=008000\n  | shorts=FFFFFF\n  | socks=000000\n  | title=<center>1947\u20131999</center>\n }}\n|}\n</center>\n\n<center>\n{|\n| {{Football kit box\n  | pattern_la = _leicestertigers2019h\n  | pattern_b  = _leicestertigers19h\n  | pattern_ra = _leicestertigers2019h\n  | pattern_sh = _leicestertigers2018h\n  | pattern_so =\n  | leftarm    = 006238\n  | body       = 006238\n  | rightarm   = 006238\n  | shorts     = 004738\n  | socks      = 004738\n  | title=<center>Current kit</center>}}\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe Tigers' current kit was launched on 11 September 2019<ref name=\"kit launch\">{{cite press release| url=https://www.leicestertigers.com/news/new-home-and-alternate-kits-revealed-for-2019-20-season | title=Tigers kits unveiled ahead of new season|publisher=Leicester Tigers|date=11 September 2019|accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref> and features Leicester's traditional green, red and white stripes.

Time is one of the seven fundamental [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] in both the [[International System of Units]] and [[International System of Quantities]]. Time is used to define other quantities&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[velocity]]&nbsp;\u2013 so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition.<ref name=\"TrialogueP3\">Duff, Okun, Veneziano, ''ibid''. p. 3. \"There is no well established terminology for the fundamental constants of Nature.&nbsp;... The absence of accurately defined terms or the uses (i.e., actually misuses) of ill-defined terms lead to confusion and proliferation of wrong statements.\"\n</ref> An [[operational definition]] of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.\n\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backwards in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the [[spacetime]] continuum. [[General Relativity]] is the primary framework for understanding how [[spacetime]] works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted, particularly at the edges of [[black hole]]s.\n\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and [[Engineering technologist|technologists]], and was a prime motivation in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the [[electronic transition]] [[frequency]] of [[caesium]] atoms (see [[#History of time measurement devices|below]]). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"[[Time value of money|time is money]]\") as well as personal value, due to an [[awareness]] of the limited time in each day and in [[life expectancy|human life spans]].\n\n== Temporal measurement ==\nGenerally speaking, methods of temporal measurement, or [[chronometry]], take two distinct forms: the [[calendar]], a mathematical tool for organising intervals of time,<ref name=\"Richards\">{{cite book |title=Mapping Time: The Calendar and its History |last=Richards |first=E. G. |date=1998 |pages=3\u20135 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref>\nand the [[clock]], a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time. In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day. Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously. The number (as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch&nbsp;\u2013 a central reference point.\n\n=== History of the calendar ===\n{{Main|Calendar}}\n\nArtifacts from the [[Paleolithic]] suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Rudgley\">{{cite book |title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age |last=Rudgley |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Rudgley |date=1999 |pages=86\u2013105 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York}}\n</ref>\n[[Lunar calendar]]s were among the first to appear, with years of either 12 or 13 [[lunar month]]s (either 354 or 384 days). Without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. [[Lunisolar calendar]]s have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years. Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based, with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five [[epagomenal]] days at the end of the year.<ref>Van Stone, Mark. \"The Maya Long Count Calendar: An Introduction.\" Archaeoastronomy 24.(2011): 8\u201311. Academic Search Complete. Web. 20 February 2016.</ref>\n\nThe reforms of [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC put the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]] on a [[solar calendar]]. This [[Julian calendar]] was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] introduced a correction in 1582; the [[Gregorian calendar]] was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used calendar around the world.\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], a new clock and calendar were invented in an attempt to de-Christianize time and create a more rational system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar. The [[French Republican Calendar]]'s days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a deviation from the base 12 ([[duodecimal]]) system used in many other devices by many cultures. The system was abolished in 1806.<ref>\"French Republican Calendar | Chronology.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, n.d.

The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.<ref>Barnett, Jo Ellen ''Time's Pendulum: The Quest to Capture Time&nbsp;\u2013 from Sundials to Atomic Clocks'' Plenum, 1998 {{isbn|0-306-45787-3}} p. 28\n</ref>\n\nA [[sundial]] uses a [[gnomon]] to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the hour. The position of the shadow marks the hour in [[Time zone|local time]]. The idea to separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used to count the passage of night.<ref>Lombardi, Michael A. \"Why Is a Minute Divided into 60 Seconds, an Hour into 60 Minutes, Yet There Are Only 24 Hours in a Day?\" Scientific American.

They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the people from [[Chaldea]] (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages.<ref>Barnett, ''ibid'', p. 37.</ref> In the 11th century, [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventors]] and [[History of science and technology in China|engineers]] invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an [[escapement]] mechanism.\n\n[[File:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary [[quartz watch]], 2007 ]]\nThe [[hourglass]] uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time.

Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages. [[Richard of Wallingford]] (1292\u20131336), abbot of St. Alban's abbey, famously built a mechanical clock as an astronomical [[orrery]] about 1330.<ref>North, J.

The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see [[ship's bell]]). The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.\n\n[[File:ChipScaleClock2 HR.jpg|thumb|Chip-scale [[atomic clock]]s, such as this one unveiled in 2004, are expected to greatly improve [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/miniclock.cfm |title=NIST Unveils Chip-Scale Atomic Clock |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522125607/http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/miniclock.cfm |archivedate=22 May 2011  }}</ref>]]\n\nClocks can range from watches, to more exotic varieties such as the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a [[pendulum]].\n\nAlarm clocks first appeared in ancient Greece around 250 BC with a water clock that would set off a whistle. This idea was later mechanized by Levi Hutchins and Seth E. Thomas.<ref name=\"Clocks 2016\"/>\n\nA [[chronometer watch|chronometer]] is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards. Initially, the term was used to refer to the [[marine chronometer]], a timepiece used to determine [[longitude]] by means of [[celestial navigation]], a precision firstly achieved by [[John Harrison]]. More recently, the term has also been applied to the [[chronometer watch]], a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency [[COSC]].\n\nThe most accurate timekeeping devices are [[atomic clock]]s, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211190407/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 February 2012 |title=New atomic clock can keep time for 200 million years: Super-precise instruments vital to deep space navigation |date=16 February 2008 |work=Vancouver Sun |accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref> and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.\n\nAtomic clocks use the frequency of [[electronic transition]]s in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the atoms used is [[caesium]], most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n99-22.cf |title=NIST-F1 Cesium Fountain Clock |accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of [[caesium]] atoms. [[International System of Units|SI]] defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation that corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the <sup>133</sup>Cs atom.\n\nToday, the [[Global Positioning System]] in coordination with the [[Network Time Protocol]] can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe.\n\nIn medieval philosophical writings, the '''atom''' was a unit of time referred to as the smallest possible division of time. The earliest known occurrence in English is in [[Byrhtferth]]'s ''Enchiridion'' (a science text) of 1010\u20131012,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Byrhtferth of Ramsey |year=2008 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=15 September 2008 |url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9438957}}</ref> where it was defined as 1/564 of a ''momentum'' (1\u00bd minutes),<ref>\"atom\", [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision September 2008 (contains relevant citations from Byrhtferth's ''Enchiridion'')</ref> and thus equal to 15/94 of a second. It was used in the ''[[computus]]'', the process of calculating the date of Easter.\n\n{{As of| May 2010}}, the smallest time interval uncertainty in direct measurements is on the order of 12 [[attosecond]]s (1.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221217</sup> seconds), about 3.7 \u00d7 10<sup>26</sup> [[Planck time]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news192909576.html |title=12 attoseconds is the world record for shortest controllable time |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805173204/http://www.physorg.com/news192909576.html |archivedate=5 August 2011  }}\n</ref>\n\n=== Units of time ===\n{{See also|Time (Orders of magnitude)|Unit of time#List}}\n\nThe [[second]] (s) is the [[SI]] base unit. A [[minute]] (min) is 60 seconds in length, and an [[hour]] is 60 minutes or 3600 seconds in length. A day is usually 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length; however, the duration of a calendar day can vary due to [[Daylight saving time]] and [[Leap second]]s.\n\n== Definitions and standards ==\nThe Mean [[Solar Time]] system defines the second as 1/86,400 of the mean [[solar day]], which is the year-average of the solar day. The solar day is the time interval between two successive solar noons, i.e., the time interval between two successive passages of the Sun across the local meridian. The local meridian is an imaginary line that runs from celestial north pole to celestial south pole passing directly over the head of the observer. At the local meridian the Sun reaches its highest point on its daily arc across the sky.\n\nIn 1874 the British Association for the Advancement of Science introduced the CGS (centimetre/gramme/second system) combining fundamental units of length, mass and time. The second is \"elastic\", because tidal friction is slowing the earth's rotation rate. For use in calculating ephemerides of celestial motion, therefore, in 1952 astronomers introduced the \"ephemeris second\", currently defined as\n\n{{quote|the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].<ref>''Whitaker's Almanac 2013'' (ed. Ruth Northey), London 2012, p. 1131, {{isbn|978-1-4081-7207-0}}.</ref>}}\n{{clear left}}\n\nThe CGS system has been superseded by the ''Syst\u00e8me international''. The [[SI base unit]] for time is the [[SI]] second. The [[International System of Quantities]], which incorporates the SI, also defines larger units of time equal to fixed integer multiples of one second (1 s), such as the minute, hour and day. These are not part of the SI, but may be used alongside the SI. Other units of time such as the month and the year are not equal to fixed multiples of 1 s, and instead exhibit significant variations in duration.<ref name=\"si_units\">{{cite book |title=The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040427205458/http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2004 |date=1998 |author=Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du M\u00e9tre |accessdate=9 April 2011 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe official SI definition of the second is as follows:<ref name=\"si_units\"/><ref name=\"second\">{{cite web |title=Base unit definitions: Second |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |publisher=[[NIST]] |accessdate=9 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417135428/http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |archivedate=17 April 2011  }}\n</ref>\n{{quote|The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]] 133 atom.}}\n{{clear left}}\n\nAt its 1997 meeting, the CIPM affirmed that this definition refers to a caesium atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K.<ref name=\"si_units\"/>\n\nThe current definition of the second, coupled with the current definition of the meter, is based on the [[special theory of relativity]], which affirms our spacetime to be a [[Minkowski space]]. The definition of the second in mean solar time, however, is unchanged.\n\n=== World time ===\nWhile in theory, the concept of a single worldwide universal time-scale may have been conceived of many centuries ago, in practicality the technical ability to create and maintain such a time-scale did not become possible until the mid-19th century. The timescale adopted was Greenwich Mean Time, created in 1847. A few countries have replaced it with Coordinated Universal Time, [[UTC]].\n\n==== History of the development of UTC ====\nWith the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], a greater understanding and agreement on the nature of time itself became increasingly necessary and helpful. In 1847 in Britain, [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) was first created for use by the British railways, the British navy, and the British shipping industry. Using telescopes, GMT was calibrated to the [[mean solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] in the UK.\n\nAs international commerce continued to increase throughout Europe, in order to achieve a more efficiently functioning modern society, an agreed upon, and highly accurate '''''international standard''''' of time measurement became necessary. In order to find or determine such a time-standard, three steps had to be followed:\n# An internationally agreed upon time-standard had to be defined.\n# This new time-standard then had to be consistently and accurately measured.\n# The new time-standard then had to be freely shared and distributed around the world.\n\nThe development of what is now known as [[UTC|UTC time]] began as a collaboration between 41 nations, officially agreed and signed at the [[International Meridian Conference]], in Washington D.C. in 1884. At this conference, the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the \"universal day\", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. astronomical day ''X'' began at noon of civil day ''X''. The purpose of this was to keep one night's observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the [[Royal Navy]], but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their [[Prime Meridian]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howse|first1=Derek|title=Greenwich Time and the Longitude|year=1997|publisher=Philip Wilson|location=London|isbn=978-0-85667-468-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/greenwichtimelon0000hows/page/133 133\u2013137]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwichtimelon0000hows/page/133}}</ref>\n\nAmong the 41 nations represented at the conference, the advanced time-technologies that had already come into use in Britain were fundamental components of the agreed method of arriving at a universal and agreed international time. In 1928 Greenwich Mean Time was rebranded for scientific purposes by the [[International Astronomical Union]] as [[Universal Time]] (UT). This was to avoid confusion with the previous system in which the day had begun at noon. As the general public had always begun the day at midnight, the timescale continued to be presented to them as Greenwich Mean Time. By 1956, universal time had been split into various versions: UT2, which smoothed for polar motion and seasonal effects, was presented to the public as Greenwich Mean Time. Later, UT1 (which smooths only for polar motion) became the default form of UT used by astronomers and hence the form used in navigation, sunrise and sunset and moonrise and moonset tables where the name Greenwich Mean Time continues to be employed. Greenwich Mean Time is also the preferred method of describing the timescale used by legislators. Even to the present day, UT is still based on an international telescopic system. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system. Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT, where the second is defined as 1/86 400 of the mean solar day.\n\nUntil 1960, the methods and definitions of time-keeping that had been laid out at the International Meridian Conference proved to be adequate to meet time tracking needs of science. Still, with the advent of the \"electronic revolution\" in the latter half of the 20th century, the technologies that had been available at the time of the Convention of the Metre proved to be in need of further refinement in order to meet the needs of the ever-increasing precision that the \"electronic revolution\" had begun to require.\n\n==== The ephemeris second ====\nAn invariable second (the \"ephemeris second\") had been defined, use of which removed the errors in ephemerides resulting from the use of the variable mean solar second as the time argument. In 1960 this ephemeris second was made the basis of the \"coordinated universal time\" which was being derived from atomic clocks. It is a specified fraction of the mean tropical year as at 1900 and, being based on historical telescope observations, corresponds roughly to the mean solar second of the early nineteenth century.<ref name=\"USNO\">\n{{cite web |title=Leap Seconds |publisher=Time Service Department, [[United States Naval Observatory]] |url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |accessdate=22 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228195938/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |archivedate=28 February 2012 }}\n</ref>\n\n==== The SI second ====\nIn 1967 a further step was taken with the introduction of the SI second, essentially the ephemeris second as measured by atomic clocks and formally defined in atomic terms.<ref name=mark58>\n{{cite journal |author=W Markowitz, RG Hall, L Essen, JVL Parry |year=1958 |url=http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |title=Frequency of cesium in terms of ephemeris time |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=105\u2013107 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.1.105 |bibcode=1958PhRvL...1..105M |last2=Hall |last3=Essen |last4=Parry |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019014530/http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2008  }}</ref>\nThe SI second (Standard Internationale second) is based directly on the measurement of the atomic-clock observation of the frequency oscillation of caesium atoms. It is the basis of all atomic timescales, e.g. coordinated universal time, GPS time, International Atomic Time, etc. Atomic clocks do not measure nuclear decay rates, which is a common misconception, but rather measure a certain natural vibrational frequency of caesium-133.<ref>[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html Cesium Atoms at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223231150/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html |date=23 February 2015 }} USNO, downloaded 28 June 2016.</ref> Coordinated universal time is subject to one constraint which does not affect the other atomic timescales. As it has been adopted as the civil timescale by some countries (most countries have opted to retain mean solar time) it is not permitted to deviate from GMT by more than 0.9 second. This is achieved by the occasional insertion of a leap second.\n\n==== Current application of UTC ====\n\nMost countries use mean solar time. Australia, Canada (Quebec only), Colombia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea (Bougainville only), Paraguay, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States and Venezuela use UTC. However, UTC is widely used by the scientific community in countries where mean solar time is official. [[UTC|UTC time]] is based on the SI second, which was first defined in 1967, and is based on the use of atomic clocks. Some other less used but closely related time-standards include [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]], [[Terrestrial Time]], and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]].\n\nBetween 1967 and 1971, UTC was periodically adjusted by fractional amounts of a second in order to adjust and refine for variations in mean solar time, with which it is aligned. After 1 January 1972, UTC time has been defined as being offset from atomic time by a whole number of seconds, changing only when a [[leap second]] is added to keep radio-controlled clocks synchronized with the rotation of the Earth.\n\nThe [[Global Positioning System]] also broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC. GPS-time is based on, and regularly synchronized with or from, UTC-time.\n\nThe surface of the Earth is split up into a number of [[time zone]]s. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from GMT. For example, time zones at sea are based on GMT. In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to [[daylight saving time]] transitions.\n\n=== Time conversions ===\nThese conversions are accurate at the millisecond level for time systems based on the rotation of the Earth (UT1 and TT). Conversions between atomic time systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are accurate at the microsecond level.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! System\n! Description\n! UT1\n! UTC\n! TT\n! TAI\n!

In [[astronomy]], sidereal time is used to predict when a [[star]] will reach its [[culmination|highest point]] in the sky. Due to [[Earth's orbit]]al motion around the Sun, a mean solar day is about 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a mean sidereal day, or {{fract|1|366}} more than a mean sidereal day.\n\n=== Chronology ===\n{{Main|Chronology}}\n\nAnother form of time measurement consists of studying the [[past]]. Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a [[chronology]]), and can be put into chronological groups ([[periodization]]). One of the most important systems of periodization is the [[geologic time scale]], which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the [[Earth]] and its life. Chronology, periodization, and interpretation of the past are together known as the study of history.\n\n=== Time-like concepts: terminology ===\nThe term \"time\" is generally used for many close but different concepts, including:\n* [[instant]]<ref>IEC 60050-113:2011, item 113-01-08</ref> as an object&nbsp;\u2013 one point on the time axes.

The cyclic time of the primordial mythical consciousness has been transformed into the time of profane man, but the mythical consciousness remains. It has been historicized. The Christian mythos and its accompanying ritual are bound up, for example, with history and center in authentic history, especially the Christ-event. Sacred space, the Transcendent Presence, is thus opened up to secular man because it meets him where he is, in the linear flow of secular time.

In short, an empty space would be a substance with no properties; it will be a substance that even God cannot modify or destroy.... That is, space and time are internal or intrinsic features of the complete concepts of things, not extrinsic.... Leibniz's view has two major implications. First, there is no absolute location in either space or time; location is always the situation of an object or event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time are not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are, rather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways of perceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are phenomena or, strictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions that are well-founded upon the internal properties of substances).... It is sometimes convenient to think of space and time as something \"out there,\" over and above the entities and their relations to each other, but this convenience must not be confused with reality. Space is nothing but the order of co-existent objects; time nothing but the order of successive events. This is usually called a relational theory of space and time. |accessdate=9 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000548/http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H7 |archivedate=14 May 2011  }}\n</ref> and [[Immanuel Kant]],<ref name=Mattey>\n{{cite web |url=http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314201600/http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM  |url-status=dead  |archive-date=14 March 2005 |title=Critique of Pure Reason, Lecture notes: Philosophy 175 UC Davis |date=22 January 1997 |last=Mattey |first=G.J. |quote=What is correct in the Leibnizian view was its anti-metaphysical stance.

Another way to put the point is to say that the fact that the mind of the knower makes the ''a priori'' contribution does not mean that space and time or the categories are mere figments of the imagination.

In this view, ''time'' does not refer to any kind of entity that \"flows,\" that objects \"move through,\" or that is a \"container\" for events. Spatial [[measurement]]s are used to [[quantity|quantify]] the extent of and distances between [[object (philosophy)|objects]], and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between [[Phenomenon|events]].

Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of ''having been'', which allows the past to exist in the present. The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement. It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \"being ahead of oneself\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative.

This contrasts with [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (all time: present, past and future, is real) and the [[Growing block universe|growing block theory]] (the present and the past are real, but the future is not).\n\n== Physical definition ==\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}\n{{Main|Time in physics}}\n\nUntil [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space, time was considered to be the same everywhere in the universe, with all observers measuring the same time interval for any event.<ref>Herman M. Schwartz, ''Introduction to Special Relativity'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968, hardcover 442 pages, see {{isbn|0-88275-478-5}} (1977 edition), pp. 10\u201313\n</ref>\nNon-relativistic [[classical mechanics]] is based on this Newtonian idea of time.\n\nEinstein, in his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]],<ref>A.

Minkowski, ''The Principle of Relativity'', Dover Publications, Inc, 2000, softcover 216 pages, {{isbn|0-486-60081-5}}, See pp. 37\u201365 for an English translation of Einstein's original 1905 paper.\n</ref>\npostulated the constancy and finiteness of the speed of light for all observers. He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.\n\nThe theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in [[Minkowski space]]time, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a [[light-year]] is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two [[Event (relativity)|events]] in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an ''[[Spacetime interval|invariant interval]]'', which can be either [[space-like]], [[light-like]], or [[time-like]]. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any [[frame of reference]], there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the ''invariant interval'' between the events is independent of the observer (and his or her velocity).\n\n=== Classical mechanics ===\nIn non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]], Newton's concept of \"relative, apparent, and common time\" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the result that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.\n\n[[File:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|Two-dimensional space depicted in three-dimensional spacetime. The past and future [[light cone]]s are absolute, the \"present\" is a relative concept different for observers in relative motion.]]\n\n=== Spacetime ===\n{{Main|Spacetime}}\nTime has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging into spacetime in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the [[inertial frame of reference|spatial reference frame of the observer]], and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.\n\nOn the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the [[past]] is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the [[future]] is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |title=Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity |publisher=YouTube |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182611/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |title=Time Travel: Einstein's big idea (Theory of Relativity) |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182714/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\n=== Time dilation ===\n[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and occurs later in the red frame.]]\n{{Main|Time dilation}}\n\n[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on [[Causality (physics)|cause and effect]], measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Subatomic particle]]s exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], in the high-speed particle's [[Inertial frame of reference|frame of reference]], it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its [[mean lifetime]], and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \"slow down\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \"warped\") by high-speed motion.\n\nEinstein (''The Meaning of Relativity''): \"Two [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]] taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which register the same simultaneously.\"\n\nEinstein wrote in his book, ''Relativity'', that [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity is also relative]], i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.\n\n=== Relativistic time versus Newtonian time ===\n[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|Views of spacetime along the [[world line]] of a rapidly accelerating observer in a relativistic universe. The events (\"dots\") that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past [[light cone]] of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer.]]\n\nThe animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and the relativistic descriptions. At the heart of these differences are the [[Galilean transformation|Galilean]] and [[Lorentz transformation]]s applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively.\n\nIn the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the spacetime trajectory (\"[[world line]]\") of the observer. The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime.\n\nThe slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.\n\nIn the Newtonian description these changes are such that ''time'' is absolute:<ref>{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 Extract of p. 30]</ref> the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the 'now' (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer).\n\nHowever, in the relativistic description the ''observability of events'' is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the \"[[light cone]]\" of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of ''absolute time'' is no longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.\n\n=== Arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Arrow of time}}\n\nTime appears to have a direction&nbsp;\u2013 the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an [[arrow of time]], and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modelled by a parameter in the system being analysed, where there is no \"proper time\": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] arrow of time, which points away from the [[Big Bang]], [[CPT symmetry]], and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only travelling forwards in time (see [[light cone]]). In [[particle physics]], the [[CP violation|violation of CP symmetry]] implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve [[CPT symmetry]] as stated above. The standard description of [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]] is also time asymmetric (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]). The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that [[entropy]] must increase over time (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|Entropy]]). This can be in either direction \u2013 Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time. So entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy universe is a statistical aberration, in the similar manner as tossing a coin often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row. However, this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZujlUD1oAAC |last=Greene |first=Brian |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos|chapter= Chapter 6: Chance and the Arrow |date=2005 |location=London|isbn=978-0-14-195995-5 }}</ref>\n\n=== Quantized time ===\n{{See also|Chronon}}\n\nTime quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical theories (the [[Standard Model]] of Particles and Interactions and [[General Relativity]]) time is not quantized.\n\n[[Planck time]] (~ 5.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221244</sup> seconds) is the unit of time in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]]. Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist; see for instance [[loop quantum gravity]].\n\n== Time travel ==\n{{Main|Time travel}}\n{{See also|Time travel in fiction|Wormhole|Twin paradox}}\n\nTime travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the normal \"flow\" of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) \"persist\" in some way. Time travel has been a [[plot device]] in fiction since the 19th century. Travelling backwards in time has never been verified, presents many theoretical problems, and may be an impossibility.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |title=Informational Time and Space |journal=Prespacetime Journal |first=Gunn |last=Quznetsov |date=30 March 2010 |volume=1 |issue=2 |accessdate=30 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102085729/http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |archivedate=2 January 2017  }}</ref> Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a [[Time travel|time machine]].\n\nA central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of [[causality]]; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a [[temporal paradox]]. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch points]], [[Multiverse|parallel realities]], or [[universe]]s.\n\nAnother solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, [[free will]] either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the [[grandfather paradox]] because it is a historical fact that one's grandfather was not killed before his child (one's parent) was conceived. This view does not simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveller would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveller moves from. More elaboration on this view can be found in the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]].\n\n== Time perception ==\n[[File:William James b1842c.jpg|thumb|upright|Philosopher and psychologist [[William James]]]]\n{{Main|Time perception}}\n\nThe [[specious present]] refers to the time duration wherein one's [[perception]]s are considered to be in the present. The experienced present is said to be 'specious' in that, unlike the objective present, it is an interval and not a durationless instant.

[[Time-use research]] is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been observed to be about 20\u201330 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period.\n\n[[Time management]] is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.\n\n== Sequence of events ==\nA sequence of events, or series of events, is a [[sequence]] of items, facts, events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order (chronological order), often with [[causality]] relationships among the items.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sequence \u2013 Order of Important Events |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |publisher=[[Austin Independent School District]] |date=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172713/http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |title=Sequence of Events Worksheets |url=http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013032311/http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2010 |publisher=[[Reference.com]] }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |author1=Compiled by David Luckham |author2=Roy Schulte |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Event Processing Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 Version 2.0 |url=http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/ |publisher=Complex Event Processing |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015182053/http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/ |archivedate=15 October 2011  |date=23 August 2011 }}\n</ref>\nBecause of [[causality]], cause precedes [[result|effect]], or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause.

Time is one of the seven fundamental [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] in both the [[International System of Units]] and [[International System of Quantities]].

The absence of accurately defined terms or the uses (i.e., actually misuses) of ill-defined terms lead to confusion and proliferation of wrong statements.\"\n</ref> An [[operational definition]] of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted. \n\nThe operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is. It does not address why events can happen forward and backwards in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time. Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the [[spacetime]] continuum. [[General Relativity]] is the primary framework for understanding how [[spacetime]] works. Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted, particularly at the edges of [[black hole]]s.\n\nTemporal measurement has occupied scientists and [[Engineering technologist|technologists]], and was a prime motivation in [[navigation]] and [[astronomy]]. Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time. Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart. Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the [[electronic transition]] [[frequency]] of [[caesium]] atoms (see [[#History of time measurement devices|below]]). Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (\"[[Time value of money|time is money]]\") as well as personal value, due to an [[awareness]] of the limited time in each day and in [[life expectancy|human life spans]].\n\n== Temporal measurement ==\nGenerally speaking, methods of temporal measurement, or [[chronometry]], take two distinct forms: the [[calendar]], a mathematical tool for organising intervals of time,<ref name=\"Richards\">{{cite book |title=Mapping Time: The Calendar and its History |last=Richards |first=E. G. |date=1998 |pages=3\u20135 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref>\nand the [[clock]], a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time. In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day. Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously. The number (as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch&nbsp;\u2013 a central reference point.\n\n=== History of the calendar ===\n{{Main|Calendar}}\n\nArtifacts from the [[Paleolithic]] suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Rudgley\">{{cite book |title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age |last=Rudgley |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Rudgley |date=1999 |pages=86\u2013105 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York}}\n</ref>\n[[Lunar calendar]]s were among the first to appear, with years of either 12 or 13 [[lunar month]]s (either 354 or 384 days). Without [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. [[Lunisolar calendar]]s have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years. Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization. These calendars were religiously and astronomically based, with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five [[epagomenal]] days at the end of the year.<ref>Van Stone, Mark. \"The Maya Long Count Calendar: An Introduction.\" Archaeoastronomy 24.(2011): 8\u201311. Academic Search Complete. Web. 20 February 2016.</ref>\n\nThe reforms of [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BC put the [[Roman Empire|Roman world]] on a [[solar calendar]]. This [[Julian calendar]] was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year. [[Pope Gregory XIII]] introduced a correction in 1582; the [[Gregorian calendar]] was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used calendar around the world.\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], a new clock and calendar were invented in an attempt to de-Christianize time and create a more rational system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar. The [[French Republican Calendar]]'s days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a deviation from the base 12 ([[duodecimal]]) system used in many other devices by many cultures. The system was abolished in 1806.<ref>\"French Republican Calendar | Chronology.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, n.d.

The T was oriented eastward in the mornings. At noon, the device was turned around so that it could cast its shadow in the evening direction.<ref>Barnett, Jo Ellen ''Time's Pendulum: The Quest to Capture Time&nbsp;\u2013 from Sundials to Atomic Clocks'' Plenum, 1998 {{isbn|0-306-45787-3}} p. 28\n</ref>\n\nA [[sundial]] uses a [[gnomon]] to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the hour. The position of the shadow marks the hour in [[Time zone|local time]]. The idea to separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system. The importance of the number 12 is due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of stars used to count the passage of night.<ref>Lombardi, Michael A. \"Why Is a Minute Divided into 60 Seconds, an Hour into 60 Minutes, Yet There Are Only 24 Hours in a Day?\" Scientific American.

They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and the people from [[Chaldea]] (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages.<ref>Barnett, ''ibid'', p. 37.</ref> In the 11th century, [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventors]] and [[History of science and technology in China|engineers]] invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an [[escapement]] mechanism.\n\n[[File:Swatch Irony angle below.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary [[quartz watch]], 2007 ]]\nThe [[hourglass]] uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time.

Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages.

The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see [[ship's bell]]). The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.\n\n[[File:ChipScaleClock2 HR.jpg|thumb|Chip-scale [[atomic clock]]s, such as this one unveiled in 2004, are expected to greatly improve [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/miniclock.cfm |title=NIST Unveils Chip-Scale Atomic Clock |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522125607/http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/miniclock.cfm |archivedate=22 May 2011  }}</ref>]]\n\nClocks can range from watches, to more exotic varieties such as the [[Clock of the Long Now]]. They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a [[pendulum]].\n\nAlarm clocks first appeared in ancient Greece around 250 BC with a water clock that would set off a whistle. This idea was later mechanized by Levi Hutchins and Seth E. Thomas.<ref name=\"Clocks 2016\"/>\n\nA [[chronometer watch|chronometer]] is a portable timekeeper that meets certain precision standards. Initially, the term was used to refer to the [[marine chronometer]], a timepiece used to determine [[longitude]] by means of [[celestial navigation]], a precision firstly achieved by [[John Harrison]]. More recently, the term has also been applied to the [[chronometer watch]], a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency [[COSC]].\n\nThe most accurate timekeeping devices are [[atomic clock]]s, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211190407/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e24ccfa7-44eb-40b7-8b67-daf8263569ff |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 February 2012 |title=New atomic clock can keep time for 200 million years: Super-precise instruments vital to deep space navigation |date=16 February 2008 |work=Vancouver Sun |accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref> and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.\n\nAtomic clocks use the frequency of [[electronic transition]]s in certain atoms to measure the second. One of the atoms used is [[caesium]], most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n99-22.cf |title=NIST-F1 Cesium Fountain Clock |accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of [[caesium]] atoms.

The earliest known occurrence in English is in [[Byrhtferth]]'s ''Enchiridion'' (a science text) of 1010\u20131012,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Byrhtferth of Ramsey |year=2008 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |accessdate=15 September 2008 |url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9438957}}</ref> where it was defined as 1/564 of a ''momentum'' (1\u00bd minutes),<ref>\"atom\", [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision September 2008 (contains relevant citations from Byrhtferth's ''Enchiridion'')</ref> and thus equal to 15/94 of a second.

A [[minute]] (min) is 60 seconds in length, and an [[hour]] is 60 minutes or 3600 seconds in length. A day is usually 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length; however, the duration of a calendar day can vary due to [[Daylight saving time]] and [[Leap second]]s.\n\n== Definitions and standards ==\nThe Mean [[Solar Time]] system defines the second as 1/86,400 of the mean [[solar day]], which is the year-average of the solar day. The solar day is the time interval between two successive solar noons, i.e., the time interval between two successive passages of the Sun across the local meridian. The local meridian is an imaginary line that runs from celestial north pole to celestial south pole passing directly over the head of the observer. At the local meridian the Sun reaches its highest point on its daily arc across the sky.\n\nIn 1874 the British Association for the Advancement of Science introduced the CGS (centimetre/gramme/second system) combining fundamental units of length, mass and time. The second is \"elastic\", because tidal friction is slowing the earth's rotation rate. For use in calculating ephemerides of celestial motion, therefore, in 1952 astronomers introduced the \"ephemeris second\", currently defined as\n\n{{quote|the fraction 1/31,556,925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 January 0 at 12 hours [[ephemeris time]].<ref>''Whitaker's Almanac 2013'' (ed.

The [[SI base unit]] for time is the [[SI]] second. The [[International System of Quantities]], which incorporates the SI, also defines larger units of time equal to fixed integer multiples of one second (1 s), such as the minute, hour and day. These are not part of the SI, but may be used alongside the SI. Other units of time such as the month and the year are not equal to fixed multiples of 1 s, and instead exhibit significant variations in duration.<ref name=\"si_units\">{{cite book |title=The International System of Units (SI), 7th Edition |url=http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040427205458/http://www1.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-brochure.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2004 |date=1998 |author=Organisation Intergouvernementale de la Convention du M\u00e9tre |accessdate=9 April 2011 }}\n</ref>\n\nThe official SI definition of the second is as follows:<ref name=\"si_units\"/><ref name=\"second\">{{cite web |title=Base unit definitions: Second |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |publisher=[[NIST]] |accessdate=9 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417135428/http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/second.html |archivedate=17 April 2011  }}\n</ref>\n{{quote|The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the [[caesium]] 133 atom.}}\n{{clear left}}\n\nAt its 1997 meeting, the CIPM affirmed that this definition refers to a caesium atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K.<ref name=\"si_units\"/>\n\nThe current definition of the second, coupled with the current definition of the meter, is based on the [[special theory of relativity]], which affirms our spacetime to be a [[Minkowski space]]. The definition of the second in mean solar time, however, is unchanged.\n\n=== World time ===\nWhile in theory, the concept of a single worldwide universal time-scale may have been conceived of many centuries ago, in practicality the technical ability to create and maintain such a time-scale did not become possible until the mid-19th century. The timescale adopted was Greenwich Mean Time, created in 1847. A few countries have replaced it with Coordinated Universal Time, [[UTC]].\n\n==== History of the development of UTC ====\nWith the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], a greater understanding and agreement on the nature of time itself became increasingly necessary and helpful. In 1847 in Britain, [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) was first created for use by the British railways, the British navy, and the British shipping industry. Using telescopes, GMT was calibrated to the [[mean solar time]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich]] in the UK.\n\nAs international commerce continued to increase throughout Europe, in order to achieve a more efficiently functioning modern society, an agreed upon, and highly accurate '''''international standard''''' of time measurement became necessary. In order to find or determine such a time-standard, three steps had to be followed:\n# An internationally agreed upon time-standard had to be defined.\n# This new time-standard then had to be consistently and accurately measured.\n# The new time-standard then had to be freely shared and distributed around the world.\n\nThe development of what is now known as [[UTC|UTC time]] began as a collaboration between 41 nations, officially agreed and signed at the [[International Meridian Conference]], in Washington D.C. in 1884. At this conference, the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the \"universal day\", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight. This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast astronomical GMT began at mean noon, i.e. astronomical day ''X'' began at noon of civil day ''X''. The purpose of this was to keep one night's observations under one date. The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925. Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the [[Royal Navy]], but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their [[Prime Meridian]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howse|first1=Derek|title=Greenwich Time and the Longitude|year=1997|publisher=Philip Wilson|location=London|isbn=978-0-85667-468-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/greenwichtimelon0000hows/page/133 133\u2013137]|url=https://archive.org/details/greenwichtimelon0000hows/page/133}}</ref>\n\nAmong the 41 nations represented at the conference, the advanced time-technologies that had already come into use in Britain were fundamental components of the agreed method of arriving at a universal and agreed international time. In 1928 Greenwich Mean Time was rebranded for scientific purposes by the [[International Astronomical Union]] as [[Universal Time]] (UT). This was to avoid confusion with the previous system in which the day had begun at noon. As the general public had always begun the day at midnight, the timescale continued to be presented to them as Greenwich Mean Time. By 1956, universal time had been split into various versions: UT2, which smoothed for polar motion and seasonal effects, was presented to the public as Greenwich Mean Time. Later, UT1 (which smooths only for polar motion) became the default form of UT used by astronomers and hence the form used in navigation, sunrise and sunset and moonrise and moonset tables where the name Greenwich Mean Time continues to be employed. Greenwich Mean Time is also the preferred method of describing the timescale used by legislators. Even to the present day, UT is still based on an international telescopic system. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system. Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT, where the second is defined as 1/86 400 of the mean solar day.\n\nUntil 1960, the methods and definitions of time-keeping that had been laid out at the International Meridian Conference proved to be adequate to meet time tracking needs of science. Still, with the advent of the \"electronic revolution\" in the latter half of the 20th century, the technologies that had been available at the time of the Convention of the Metre proved to be in need of further refinement in order to meet the needs of the ever-increasing precision that the \"electronic revolution\" had begun to require.\n\n==== The ephemeris second ====\nAn invariable second (the \"ephemeris second\") had been defined, use of which removed the errors in ephemerides resulting from the use of the variable mean solar second as the time argument. In 1960 this ephemeris second was made the basis of the \"coordinated universal time\" which was being derived from atomic clocks. It is a specified fraction of the mean tropical year as at 1900 and, being based on historical telescope observations, corresponds roughly to the mean solar second of the early nineteenth century.<ref name=\"USNO\">\n{{cite web |title=Leap Seconds |publisher=Time Service Department, [[United States Naval Observatory]] |url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |accessdate=22 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228195938/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html |archivedate=28 February 2012 }}\n</ref>\n\n==== The SI second ====\nIn 1967 a further step was taken with the introduction of the SI second, essentially the ephemeris second as measured by atomic clocks and formally defined in atomic terms.<ref name=mark58>\n{{cite journal |author=W Markowitz, RG Hall, L Essen, JVL Parry |year=1958 |url=http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |title=Frequency of cesium in terms of ephemeris time |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=105\u2013107 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.1.105 |bibcode=1958PhRvL...1..105M |last2=Hall |last3=Essen |last4=Parry |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019014530/http://www.leapsecond.com/history/1958-PhysRev-v1-n3-Markowitz-Hall-Essen-Parry.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2008  }}</ref>\nThe SI second (Standard Internationale second) is based directly on the measurement of the atomic-clock observation of the frequency oscillation of caesium atoms. It is the basis of all atomic timescales, e.g. coordinated universal time, GPS time, International Atomic Time, etc. Atomic clocks do not measure nuclear decay rates, which is a common misconception, but rather measure a certain natural vibrational frequency of caesium-133.<ref>[http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html Cesium Atoms at Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223231150/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cesium.html |date=23 February 2015 }} USNO, downloaded 28 June 2016.</ref> Coordinated universal time is subject to one constraint which does not affect the other atomic timescales. As it has been adopted as the civil timescale by some countries (most countries have opted to retain mean solar time) it is not permitted to deviate from GMT by more than 0.9 second. This is achieved by the occasional insertion of a leap second.\n\n==== Current application of UTC ====\n\nMost countries use mean solar time. Australia, Canada (Quebec only), Colombia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea (Bougainville only), Paraguay, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States and Venezuela use UTC. However, UTC is widely used by the scientific community in countries where mean solar time is official. [[UTC|UTC time]] is based on the SI second, which was first defined in 1967, and is based on the use of atomic clocks. Some other less used but closely related time-standards include [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]], [[Terrestrial Time]], and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]].\n\nBetween 1967 and 1971, UTC was periodically adjusted by fractional amounts of a second in order to adjust and refine for variations in mean solar time, with which it is aligned. After 1 January 1972, UTC time has been defined as being offset from atomic time by a whole number of seconds, changing only when a [[leap second]] is added to keep radio-controlled clocks synchronized with the rotation of the Earth.\n\nThe [[Global Positioning System]] also broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC. GPS-time is based on, and regularly synchronized with or from, UTC-time.\n\nThe surface of the Earth is split up into a number of [[time zone]]s. Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from GMT. For example, time zones at sea are based on GMT. In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to [[daylight saving time]] transitions.\n\n=== Time conversions ===\nThese conversions are accurate at the millisecond level for time systems based on the rotation of the Earth (UT1 and TT). Conversions between atomic time systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are accurate at the microsecond level.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! System\n! Description\n! UT1\n! UTC\n! TT\n! TAI\n!

In [[astronomy]], sidereal time is used to predict when a [[star]] will reach its [[culmination|highest point]] in the sky. Due to [[Earth's orbit]]al motion around the Sun, a mean solar day is about 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a mean sidereal day, or {{fract|1|366}} more than a mean sidereal day.\n\n=== Chronology ===\n{{Main|Chronology}}\n\nAnother form of time measurement consists of studying the [[past]]. Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a [[chronology]]), and can be put into chronological groups ([[periodization]]). One of the most important systems of periodization is the [[geologic time scale]], which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the [[Earth]] and its life.

In short, an empty space would be a substance with no properties; it will be a substance that even God cannot modify or destroy.... That is, space and time are internal or intrinsic features of the complete concepts of things, not extrinsic.... Leibniz's view has two major implications. First, there is no absolute location in either space or time; location is always the situation of an object or event relative to other objects and events. Second, space and time are not in themselves real (that is, not substances). Space and time are, rather, ideal. Space and time are just metaphysically illegitimate ways of perceiving certain virtual relations between substances. They are phenomena or, strictly speaking, illusions (although they are illusions that are well-founded upon the internal properties of substances).... It is sometimes convenient to think of space and time as something \"out there,\" over and above the entities and their relations to each other, but this convenience must not be confused with reality. Space is nothing but the order of co-existent objects; time nothing but the order of successive events. This is usually called a relational theory of space and time. |accessdate=9 April 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000548/http://www.iep.utm.edu/leib-met/#H7 |archivedate=14 May 2011  }}\n</ref> and [[Immanuel Kant]],<ref name=Mattey>\n{{cite web |url=http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314201600/http://www-philosophy.ucdavis.edu/mattey/kant/TIMELEC.HTM  |url-status=dead  |archive-date=14 March 2005 |title=Critique of Pure Reason, Lecture notes: Philosophy 175 UC Davis |date=22 January 1997 |last=Mattey |first=G.J. |quote=What is correct in the Leibnizian view was its anti-metaphysical stance.

It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes \"being ahead of oneself\" when thinking of a pending occurrence. Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present. The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative.

This theory rejects the existence of all direct interaction with the past or the future, holding only the present as tangible. This is one of the philosophical arguments against time travel. This contrasts with [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] (all time: present, past and future, is real) and the [[Growing block universe|growing block theory]] (the present and the past are real, but the future is not).\n\n== Physical definition ==\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}\n{{Main|Time in physics}}\n\nUntil [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] reinterpretation of the physical concepts associated with time and space, time was considered to be the same everywhere in the universe, with all observers measuring the same time interval for any event.<ref>Herman M. Schwartz, ''Introduction to Special Relativity'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1968, hardcover 442 pages, see {{isbn|0-88275-478-5}} (1977 edition), pp. 10\u201313\n</ref>\nNon-relativistic [[classical mechanics]] is based on this Newtonian idea of time.\n\nEinstein, in his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]],<ref>A.

He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer.\n\nThe theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in [[Minkowski space]]time, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time. In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that distance, e.g., a [[light-year]] is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two [[Event (relativity)|events]] in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an ''[[Spacetime interval|invariant interval]]'', which can be either [[space-like]], [[light-like]], or [[time-like]]. Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any [[frame of reference]], there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the ''invariant interval'' between the events is independent of the observer (and his or her velocity).\n\n=== Classical mechanics ===\nIn non-relativistic [[classical mechanics]], Newton's concept of \"relative, apparent, and common time\" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience. In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. This led directly to the result that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.\n\n[[File:World line.svg|250px|right|thumb|Two-dimensional space depicted in three-dimensional spacetime. The past and future [[light cone]]s are absolute, the \"present\" is a relative concept different for observers in relative motion.]]\n\n=== Spacetime ===\n{{Main|Spacetime}}\nTime has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging into spacetime in [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the [[inertial frame of reference|spatial reference frame of the observer]], and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly.\n\nOn the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other. Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart. This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer. In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the [[past]] is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the [[future]] is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |title=Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity |publisher=YouTube |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182611/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev9zrt__lec |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |title=Time Travel: Einstein's big idea (Theory of Relativity) |publisher=YouTube |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017182714/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7vpw4AH8QQ |archivedate=17 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\n=== Time dilation ===\n[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity.svg|thumb|[[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Event B is simultaneous with A in the green reference frame, but it occurred before in the blue frame, and occurs later in the red frame.]]\n{{Main|Time dilation}}\n\n[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] showed in his thought experiments that people travelling at different speeds, while agreeing on [[Causality (physics)|cause and effect]], measure different time separations between events, and can even observe different chronological orderings between non-causally related events. Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light. [[Subatomic particle]]s exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest. According to the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], in the high-speed particle's [[Inertial frame of reference|frame of reference]], it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its [[mean lifetime]], and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero. Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to \"slow down\" for the particle. Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten. Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or \"warped\") by high-speed motion.\n\nEinstein (''The Meaning of Relativity''): \"Two [[Spacetime#Basic concepts|events]] taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB. Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which register the same simultaneously.\"\n\nEinstein wrote in his book, ''Relativity'', that [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity is also relative]], i.e., two events that appear simultaneous to an observer in a particular inertial reference frame need not be judged as simultaneous by a second observer in a different inertial frame of reference.\n\n=== Relativistic time versus Newtonian time ===\n[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|Views of spacetime along the [[world line]] of a rapidly accelerating observer in a relativistic universe. The events (\"dots\") that pass the two diagonal lines in the bottom half of the image (the past [[light cone]] of the observer in the origin) are the events visible to the observer.]]\n\nThe animations visualise the different treatments of time in the Newtonian and the relativistic descriptions. At the heart of these differences are the [[Galilean transformation|Galilean]] and [[Lorentz transformation]]s applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively.\n\nIn the figures, the vertical direction indicates time. The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the spacetime trajectory (\"[[world line]]\") of the observer. The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime.\n\nThe slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer. Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.\n\nIn the Newtonian description these changes are such that ''time'' is absolute:<ref>{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 Extract of p. 30]</ref> the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event occurs in the 'now' (i.e., whether an event passes the horizontal line through the observer).\n\nHowever, in the relativistic description the ''observability of events'' is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the \"[[light cone]]\" of the observer. Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of ''absolute time'' is no longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer.\n\n=== Arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Arrow of time}}\n\nTime appears to have a direction&nbsp;\u2013 the past lies behind, fixed and immutable, while the future lies ahead and is not necessarily fixed. Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an [[arrow of time]], and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse. This is generally a consequence of time being modelled by a parameter in the system being analysed, where there is no \"proper time\": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary. Examples of this include the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] arrow of time, which points away from the [[Big Bang]], [[CPT symmetry]], and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only travelling forwards in time (see [[light cone]]). In [[particle physics]], the [[CP violation|violation of CP symmetry]] implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve [[CPT symmetry]] as stated above. The standard description of [[measurement]] in [[quantum mechanics]] is also time asymmetric (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]). The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that [[entropy]] must increase over time (see [[Entropy (arrow of time)|Entropy]]). This can be in either direction \u2013 Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time. So entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy universe is a statistical aberration, in the similar manner as tossing a coin often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row. However, this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yZujlUD1oAAC |last=Greene |first=Brian |title=The Fabric of the Cosmos|chapter= Chapter 6: Chance and the Arrow |date=2005 |location=London|isbn=978-0-14-195995-5 }}</ref>\n\n=== Quantized time ===\n{{See also|Chronon}}\n\nTime quantization is a hypothetical concept. In the modern established physical theories (the [[Standard Model]] of Particles and Interactions and [[General Relativity]]) time is not quantized.\n\n[[Planck time]] (~ 5.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221244</sup> seconds) is the unit of time in the system of [[natural units]] known as [[Planck units]]. Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle. Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist; see for instance [[loop quantum gravity]].\n\n== Time travel ==\n{{Main|Time travel}}\n{{See also|Time travel in fiction|Wormhole|Twin paradox}}\n\nTime travel is the concept of moving backwards or forwards to different points in time, in a manner analogous to moving through space, and different from the normal \"flow\" of time to an earthbound observer. In this view, all points in time (including future times) \"persist\" in some way. Time travel has been a [[plot device]] in fiction since the 19th century. Travelling backwards in time has never been verified, presents many theoretical problems, and may be an impossibility.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |title=Informational Time and Space |journal=Prespacetime Journal |first=Gunn |last=Quznetsov |date=30 March 2010 |volume=1 |issue=2 |accessdate=30 December 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102085729/http://prespacetime.com/index.php/pst/article/view/10 |archivedate=2 January 2017  }}</ref> Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a [[Time travel|time machine]].\n\nA central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of [[causality]]; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a [[temporal paradox]]. Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch points]], [[Multiverse|parallel realities]], or [[universe]]s.\n\nAnother solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, [[free will]] either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the [[grandfather paradox]] because it is a historical fact that one's grandfather was not killed before his child (one's parent) was conceived. This view does not simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveller would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveller moves from. More elaboration on this view can be found in the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]].\n\n== Time perception ==\n[[File:William James b1842c.jpg|thumb|upright|Philosopher and psychologist [[William James]]]]\n{{Main|Time perception}}\n\nThe [[specious present]] refers to the time duration wherein one's [[perception]]s are considered to be in the present.

[[Time-use research]] is a developing field of study. The question concerns how time is allocated across a number of activities (such as time spent at home, at work, shopping, etc.). Time use changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways. However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been observed to be about 20\u201330 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period.\n\n[[Time management]] is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time. Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.\n\n== Sequence of events ==\nA sequence of events, or series of events, is a [[sequence]] of items, facts, events, actions, changes, or procedural steps, arranged in time order (chronological order), often with [[causality]] relationships among the items.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sequence \u2013 Order of Important Events |url=http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |publisher=[[Austin Independent School District]] |date=2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172713/http://www.austinschools.org/curriculum/la/resources/documents/instResources/LA_res_Seq_ORS_Module.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |title=Sequence of Events Worksheets |url=http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013032311/http://www.reference.com/motif/Science/sequence-of-events-worksheets |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2010 |publisher=[[Reference.com]] }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |author1=Compiled by David Luckham |author2=Roy Schulte |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Event Processing Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 Version 2.0 |url=http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/ |publisher=Complex Event Processing |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015182053/http://www.complexevents.com/2011/08/23/event-processing-glossary-version-2-0/ |archivedate=15 October 2011  |date=23 August 2011 }}\n</ref>\nBecause of [[causality]], cause precedes [[result|effect]], or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause.

A sequence of events may also be used to help describe [[Process (engineering)|processes]] in science, technology, and medicine. A sequence of events may be focused on past events (e.g., stories, history, chronology), on future events that must be in a predetermined order (e.g., [[plan]]s, [[schedule (project management)|schedules]], procedures, timetables), or focused on the observation of past events with the expectation that the events will occur in the future (e.g., processes, projections). The use of a sequence of events occurs in fields as diverse as machines ([[cam timer]]), documentaries (''[[Seconds From Disaster]]''), law ([[Choice of law#Sequence of events in conflict cases|choice of law]]), [[computer simulation]] ([[discrete event simulation]]), and [[electric power transmission]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Utility Communications Architecture (UCA) glossary |url=http://www.nettedautomation.com/glossary_menue/glossary_uca.html |publisher=NettedAutomation |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210131225/http://nettedautomation.com/glossary_menue/glossary_uca.html |archivedate=10 December 2011  }}\n</ref>\n([[sequence of events recorder]]). A specific example of a sequence of events is the [[timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].\n\n== Spatial conceptualization of time ==\nAlthough time is regarded as an abstract concept, there is increasing evidence that time is [[Conceptual metaphor|conceptualized]] in the mind in terms of space.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |last=N\u00fa\u00f1ez |first=Rafael |last2=Cooperrider |first2=Kensy |last3=Doan |first3=D |last4=Wassmann |first4=J\u00fcrg |date=1 July 2012 |title=Contours of time: Topographic construals of past, present, and future in the Yupno valley of Papua New Guinea  |journal=Cognition |volume=124 |issue=1 |pages=25\u201335 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.03.007|pmid=22542697 }}</ref> That is, instead of thinking about time in a general, abstract way, humans think about time in a spatial way and mentally organize it as such. Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal events in a specific way.\n\nThis spatial representation of time is often represented in the mind as a Mental Time Line (MTL).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Bottini |first=Roberto |last2=Crepaldi |first2=Davide |last3=Casasanto |first3=Daniel |last4=Crollen |first4=Virgine |last5=Collignon |first5=Olivier |date=1 August 2015 |title=Space and time in the sighted and blind   |journal=Cognition |volume=141 |pages=67\u201372 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2015.04.004|pmid=25935747 |hdl=2078.1/199842 }}</ref> Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal order. These origins are shaped by many environmental factors<ref name=\":0\" />\u2013\u2013for example, [[literacy]] appears to play a large role in the different types of MTLs, as reading/[[Writing system|writing direction]] provides an everyday temporal orientation that differs from culture to culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In western cultures, the MTL may unfold rightward (with the past on the left and the future on the right) since people read and write from left to right.<ref name=\":1\" /> Western calendars also continue this trend by placing the past on the left with the future progressing toward the right. Conversely, Arabic, Farsi, Urdu and [[Israeli Hebrew language|Israeli-Hebrew]] speakers read from right to left, and their MTLs unfold leftward (past on the right with future on the left), and evidence suggests these speakers organize time events in their minds like this as well.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis linguistic evidence that abstract concepts are based in spatial concepts also reveals that the way humans mentally organize time events varies across cultures\u2013\u2013that is, a certain specific mental organization system is not universal. So, although Western cultures typically associate past events with the left and future events with the right according to a certain MTL, this kind of horizontal, egocentric MTL is not the spatial organization of all cultures. Although most developed nations use an egocentric spatial system, there is recent evidence that some cultures use an allocentric spatialization, often based on environmental features.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA recent study of the indigenous Yupno people of [[Papua New Guinea]] focused on the directional gestures used when individuals used time-related words.<ref name=\":0\" /> When speaking of the past (such as \"last year\" or \"past times\"), individuals gestured downhill, where the river of the valley flowed into the ocean. When speaking of the future, they gestured uphill, toward the source of the river. This was common regardless of which direction the person faced, revealing that the Yupno people may use an allocentric MTL, in which time flows uphill.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA similar study of the Pormpuraawans, an [[Aboriginal groupings of Western Australia|aboriginal group]] in Australia, revealed a similar distinction in which when asked to organize photos of a man aging \"in order,\" individuals consistently placed the youngest photos to the east and the oldest photos to the west, regardless of which direction they faced.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal |title=Remembrances of Times East |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=1635\u20139 |journal=Psychological Science |pmid=20959511|year=2010 |last1=Boroditsky |first1=L. |last2=Gaby |first2=A. |doi=10.1177/0956797610386621 }}</ref> This directly clashed with an American group which consistently organized the photos from left to right. Therefore, this group also appears to have an allocentric MTL, but based on the cardinal directions instead of geographical features.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe wide array of distinctions in the way different groups think about time leads to the broader question that different groups may also think about other abstract concepts in different ways as well, such as causality and number.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Era]]\n* [[Horology]]\n* [[International System of Quantities]]\n* [[Kairos]]\n* [[List of UTC timing centers]]\n* [[UTC]]\n* [[Term (time)]]\n\n=== Books ===\n* ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' by [[Stephen Hawking]]\n* ''[[About Time (book)|About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution]]'' by [[Paul Davies]]\n* ''[[From Eternity to Here|From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time]]'' by [[Sean M.

Peer support is also used to refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other [[Social connection|connection]] and support on a reciprocal basis.\n\nPeer support is distinct from other forms of [[social support]] in that the source of support is a ''peer'', a person who is similar in fundamental ways to the recipient of the support; their relationship is one of equality. A peer is in a position to offer support by virtue of relevant experience: he or she has \"been there, done that\" and can relate to others who are now in a similar situation. Trained peer support workers such as [[peer support specialist]]s and [[Center for Victims of Torture#Training Peer Counselors|peer counselors]] receive special training and are required to obtain [[Continuing Education]] Units, like clinical staff. Some other trained peer support workers may also be law-enforcement personnel and firefighters as well as [[emergency medical responders]].\n\n==Underlying theory==\n\nThe effectiveness of peer support is believed to derive from a variety of [[psychosocial]] processes described best by Dr. Karen Fortuna in 2019:<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Fortuna  | first = Karen | year = 2019 | title = Peer Support: a Human Factor to Enhance Engagement in Digital Health Behavior Change Interventions | journal = Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 152\u2013161 | doi=10.1007/s41347-019-00105-x}}.</ref> social support, experiential knowledge, social learning theory, social comparison theory, the helper-therapy principle, and self-determination theory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mead | first1 = S. | last2 = MacNeil | first2 = C | year = 2006 | title = Peer Support: What Makes It Unique? | url = http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_10/Peer_Support_What_Makes_It_Unique_Mead.html  journal = International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 29\u201337 }}</ref>\n\n*[[Social support]] is the existence of positive psychosocial interactions with others with whom there is mutual trust and concern.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sarason | first1 = I. | last2 = Levine | first2 = H. | last3 = Basham | first3 = R. | last4 = Sarason | first4 = B. | year = 1983 | title = Assessing social support: The social support questionnaire | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 127\u2013139 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.127 }}</ref> Positive relationships contribute to positive adjustment and buffer against stressors and adversities by offering (a) emotional support<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Flannery Jr | first1 = Raymond B. | year = | title = Social support and psychological trauma: A methodological review | url = | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 593\u2013611 }}</ref> (esteem, attachment, and reassurance),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Young | first1 = K.W. | year = 2006 | title = Social Support and Life Satisfaction | url = http://www.psychosocial.com/IJPR_10/Social_Support_and_QOL7_Young.html | journal = International Journal of Psychosocial Rehabilitation | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 155\u2013164 }}</ref> (b) instrumental support (material goods and services), (c) companionship<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thoits | first1 = P | year = 1986 | title = Social support as coping assistance | url = | journal = J.

The aim of these organisations is to support the health, rights and well being of sex workers and advocate on their behalf for law reform in order to make working safer. Sex work is work and there are many people who willingly choose it as a job/career. While [[sex trafficking]] does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the [[Sex Industry Network (SIN)]] when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Peer education]]\n* [[Peer mentoring]]\n* [[Peer support specialist]]\n* [[Person centered planning]]\n* [[Self-determination]]\n* [[Self-help]]\n* [[Self-help groups for mental health]]\n* [[Social connection]]\n* [[Support group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Curlie|Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement/Support_Groups|Support Groups}}\n* [http://psp.drk.dk/sw40688.asp International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Reference Centre for Psychosocial Support]\n* [http://www.selfhelpgroups.org American Self-Help Group Clearinghouse]\n\n[[Category:Counseling]]\n[[Category:Mental health support groups]]\n[[Category:Drug rehabilitation]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology]]\n[[Category:Mental health]]\n[[Category:Peer support]]\n[[Category:Personal development]]\n[[Category:Support groups]]\n[[Category:Peer learning]]\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Support group|Self-help groups for mental health = }}\n'''Peer support''' occurs when people provide knowledge, experience, emotional, social or practical help to each other.<ref>Shery Mead, David Hilton, Laurie Curtis, [http://mentalhealthpeers.com/pdfs/peersupport.pdf \"Peer Support: A Theoretical Perspective.\"]</ref> It commonly refers to an initiative consisting of trained supporters (although it can be provided by peers without training), and can take a number of forms such as [[peer mentoring]], reflective listening (reflecting content and/or feelings), or [[counseling]]. Peer support is also used to refer to initiatives where colleagues, members of self-help organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other [[Social connection|connection]] and support on a reciprocal basis.\n\nPeer support is distinct from other forms of [[social support]] in that the source of support is a ''peer'', a person who is similar in fundamental ways to the recipient of the support; their relationship is one of equality. A peer is in a position to offer support by virtue of relevant experience: he or she has \"been there, done that\" and can relate to others who are now in a similar situation. Trained peer support workers such as [[peer support specialist]]s and [[Center for Victims of Torture#Training Peer Counselors|peer counselors]] receive special training and are required to obtain [[Continuing Education]] Units, like clinical staff.

The aim of these organisations is to support the health, rights and well being of sex workers and advocate on their behalf for law reform in order to make working safer. Sex work is work and there are many people who willingly choose it as a job/career. While [[sex trafficking]] does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the [[Sex Industry Network (SIN)]] when engaging with community members because peers can understand that someone could willingly choose to do sex work.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Peer education]]\n* [[Peer mentoring]]\n* [[Peer support specialist]]\n* [[Person centered planning]]\n* [[Self-determination]]\n* [[Self-help]]\n* [[Self-help groups for mental health]]\n* [[Social connection]]\n* [[Support group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Curlie|Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement/Support_Groups|Support Groups}}\n* [http://psp.drk.dk/sw40688.asp International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Reference Centre for Psychosocial Support]\n* [http://www.selfhelpgroups.org American Self-Help Group Clearinghouse]\n\n[[Category:Counseling]]\n[[Category:Mental health support groups]]\n[[Category:Drug rehabilitation]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology]]\n[[Category:Mental health]]\n[[Category:Peer support]]\n[[Category:Personal development]]\n[[Category:Support groups]]\n[[Category:Peer learning]]\n[[Category:Peer-to-peer]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnderlying theory:Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_support"}
