Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another thirty years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at [[Sinematek Indonesia]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Ratna Asmara, Ali Yugo, and Iscandar Sukarno in Djaoeh di Mata, Peran Pemuda dalam Kebangkitan Film Indonesia, p50.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Ratna Asmara, Ali Joego, and Iscandar Sukarno in a scene from the film]]\nA poor villager, Asrad ([[Ali Joego]]), is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after).

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

As one of Nintendo's most famous and familiar icons, Kirby's round appearance and ability to copy his foes' powers has made him a well-known figure in video games, consistently ranked as one of the most iconic video game characters. He first appeared in 1992 in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the [[Game Boy]]. Originally a placeholder, created by [[Masahiro Sakurai]], at the age of 19, for the game's early development, he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from [[Action game|action]] [[Platform game|platformers]] to [[Puzzle game|puzzle]], [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], and even [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], and has been featured as a playable fighter in all ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' games. He has also starred in his own [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya|anime]] and manga series. His most recent appearance is in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. Since 1999, he has been voiced by [[Makiko Ohmoto]].\n\nKirby is well known for his ability to inhale objects and creatures to gain their abilities, as well as his ability to float by expanding his body. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, including his homeworld of Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as [[Dark Matter (Kirby)|Dark Matter]] or [[Nightmare (Kirby)|Nightmare]]. On these adventures he often crosses paths with his rivals, the gluttonous [[King Dedede]] and the mysterious [[Meta Knight]], though Meta Knight can be seen as a hero, depending on the game. Kirby has been described as one of the most legendary video game characters of all time by ''[[PC World]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/220620/25_legendary_video_game_characters.html|title=25 Legendary Video Game Characters|magazine=PC World|last=Filice|first=Albert|date=3 March 2011}}</ref> In virtually all his appearances, Kirby is depicted as cheerful, innocent and food-loving but becomes fearless, bold and clever in the face of danger.\n\nKirby also met this guy named josh platten when he went to war Kirby kidnapped and tortured him. Josh is now dead. :(\n\n==Concept and creation==\nKirby was created by video game designer [[Masahiro Sakurai]] as the [[player character]] of the 1992 game ''Kirby's Dream Land''. The character's design was intended to serve as placeholder graphics for the game's original protagonist in early development and thus was given a simplistic ball-like appearance. Sakurai switched to the placeholder design for the final character design when he believed that it served the character better.<ref name=\"kirby facts\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/41729/11-amazing-kirby-facts-and-secrets/ | title=11 amazing Kirby facts and secrets | author=Zablotny, Marc | date=September 10, 2012 | work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031152020/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/41729/11-amazing-kirby-facts-and-secrets/ | archive-date=October 31, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The character was known as {{nihongo|Popopo|\u30dd\u30dd\u30dd}} during development until the name \"Kirby\" was chosen from a draft list of potential names. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] stated that \"Kirby\" was chosen in honor of American lawyer [[John Kirby (attorney)|John Kirby]], who defended Nintendo in the ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'' case in 1984 and that the [[guttural]]-sounding name contrasted amusingly with the character's cute appearance.<ref name=\"Kirby's name origin\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/42153/how-did-mario-get-his-name-and-the-origins-of-your-favourite-nintendo-stars/?page=6 | title=How did your favourite Nintendo characters get their names? | author=Zablotny, Marc | date=September 20, 2012 | work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | accessdate=March 26, 2014 | url-status=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924055013/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/42153/how-did-mario-get-his-name-and-the-origins-of-your-favourite-nintendo-stars/?page=6 | archivedate=September 24, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/06/17/miyamoto-wii-amp-wii-u-are-colored-white-for-all-ages-appeal.aspx|title=Miyamoto Talks Wii U, Zelda, And Nintendo's Past|last=Turi|first=Tim|website=Game Informer|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=October 26, 2018}}</ref> Kirby appears white in ''Kirby's Dream Land'' due to the [[grayscale]] [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of the Game Boy system. Sakurai intended the character to be pink, though Miyamoto originally wanted the character to be yellow. Kirby does appear white in the game's North American promotional materials and artwork to reflect the character's in-game appearance.<ref name=\"kirby facts\"/>\n\nIn North America, Kirby consistently appears in artwork with a more striking, bolder expression than in Japan, where his expression is more relaxed. Nintendo has said that the more battle-ready appearance appeals to a wider audience in North America.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-is-kirby-always-angry-in-the-us-nintendo-explains/1100-6419263/ | title=Why is Kirby always angry in the US? Nintendo explains | author=Gaston, Martin | date=April 28, 2014 | publisher = Gamespot}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical appearance===\nKirby has a pink, spherical, body with small stubby arms and large red feet. His eyes are a distinctive oval shape and are white (eye shine) at the top, black in the center and dark blue on the bottom (all black in early games) with rosy cheek-blushes near his eyes. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch or flatten and adopt different shapes, open his mouth really wide to inhale foes, or inflate himself with air and fly. According to the ''Super Smash Bros.'' manual he is 8 inches (or 20.32 centimeters) tall,<ref name=profilejp>{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0003/miryoku/index.html|title = Kirby's profile|accessdate = 2008-09-02|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.|language = Japanese}}</ref><ref>''Super Smash Bros.'' - Kirby's in-game biography</ref> however the games themselves are inconsistent with Kirby's height. Kirby's appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger blue eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\n===Personality===\nKirby hails from the distant Planet Popstar, where he lives in a dome-shaped house in the country of Dream Land. He has a positive attitude, and frequently helps to save Dream Land through the use of his unique powers. His age is never directly stated, although he is referred to as a \"little boy\" in the English manual for ''Kirby's Dream Land'', described as a baby in the anime, and was referred to as being a \"jolly fellow\" in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]''.\n\nKirby is cheerful and innocent. He is often depicted with a voracious appetite. His other hobbies include singing, although he is [[tone deafness|tone-deaf]].<ref name=\"profilejp\"/>\n\nThe same personality and nature is presented in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' games. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', his trophy profile states that he is an \"extremely skilled technician\". Kirby plays a prominent role in the Subspace Emissary plot as a protagonist, the story mode of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. Although he appears cute and innocent, many commercials and ads have contrasted this with his extreme fighting skills when he takes on the abilities of an enemy.\n\nKirby is a character of few words and rarely speaks in-game. His dialogue is largely limited to appearances in some games' instruction manuals, and brief comments such as \"Hi!\" or \"Poyo!\" in games including ''Super Smash Bros.'' and ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]''. Despite his lack of dialogue, Kirby narrates the functions of certain Copy Abilities on the pause menu in ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Remakes and ports|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', and ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]''. Kirby gives short descriptions of various menu options when they are highlighted. The concept of Kirby being mostly mute is supported by Masahiro Sakurai's insistence that Kirby does not speak in the [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!#Production|anime series]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, although he does occasionally say the names of his special attacks and certain foods and sometimes repeats other words that he hears. In the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, when Kirby copies a foe's ability, Kirby says the name of some attacks, such as [[Captain Falcon]]'s \"Falcon Punch\", Ness' PK Flash, Lucas' PK Freeze, Ryu's Hadoken/Shakunetsu Hadoken, \"Jump/Speed/Shield/Buster/Smash\" when using [[Shulk]]'s Monado Arts and [[Terry Bogard]]'s Power Wave. There are some notable exceptions where Kirby actually does speak in-game, such as ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker#Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu|Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]''.\n\nDespite his loveable nature, he sometimes acts in an impulsive or naive way, such as when he accuses King Dedede of interfering with the Fountain of Dreams in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and then leaves to retrieve the pieces of the shattered Star Rod without receiving a full explanation.<ref name = \"adventure\">{{cite web|url = http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/games/adventure/instruction.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080320121750/http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/games/adventure/instruction.html|archivedate = 2008-03-20|title = ''Kirby's Adventure'' instruction manual|accessdate = 2008-09-02}}</ref> He also attacked Meta Knight in ''[[Kirby Squeak Squad]]'' for ownership of a chest that he believed contained a slice of his stolen strawberry shortcake. In reality, the Star Rod was going to be taken by Nightmare, who would corrupt the Fountain of Dreams and turn every dream into a Nightmare, and the chest that Kirby wanted contained Dark Nebula, a powerful being with evil intentions. King Dedede and Meta Knight were aware of these problems, and were trying to protect the world.\n\n===Abilities===\n[[File:Kirby_gets_an_ability_(videogame_gameplay).png|thumb|Kirby can gain the properties of enemies or objects he eats. For example; by inhaling a sword wielding foe, Kirby becomes a skilled swordsman.]]Kirby's main ability is inhaling enemies and objects and spitting them out with incredible force. Both his mouth and body expand to allow him to inhale things much larger than himself. However, there is a limit to what he can inhale; excessively large or heavy foes like [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] can resist Kirby's inhale. Against these opponents Kirby must find smaller objects to use as ammo or intercept his opponent's attacks and send them back at them.\n\nKirby is able to float like a balloon by inhaling a gulp of air to make himself more buoyant, flying slowly by flapping his arms. However, his only method of attack in this state is to spit the gulp of air, sending him back towards the ground. While in most games he can float indefinitely, he gets tired in some games such as ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', [[Team Kirby Clash Deluxe]], [[Kirby Fighters Deluxe]] and ''Super Smash Bros.''.\n\nKirby's main mode of transportation is a star shaped, flying vehicle called a Warp Star. By clinging to its side or riding it like a surfboard Kirby is able to move quickly through the air and travel quickly between areas.\n\nFrom the [[Kirby's Adventure|second game]] onwards, by swallowing foes, Kirby can copy their primary attribute, called a Copy Ability. Giving Kirby new abilities such as gaining fire abilities from inhaling a fiery creature or the ability to shoot needles from his body by eating a spiky creature. Kirby can only have one Copy Ability at a time and must discard his current one if he wishes to use another. Additionally, if he takes too much damage his Copy Ability will be knocked out of him; though if he's quick he can inhale it again.\n\n''Kirby Super Star'' greatly expanded on the concept of Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure''. Originally Kirby just obtained one technique from a Copy Ability which replaced his Inhale but ''Kirby Super Star'' introduced multiple fighting techniques for each ability with their own controls. Additionally while ''Kirby's Adventure'' didn't have Kirby's appearance drastically change when he had a Copy Ability, aside from his color changing to orange or snow white, or wielding a weapon for abilities like ''Sword'' or ''Hammer''. ''Kirby Super Star'' gave each Copy Ability its own costume, such as a fiery crown for Fire Kirby or a floppy green cap that resembles [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link's]] for Sword Kirby.\n\nIn ''Kirby Super Star'', Kirby could sacrifice his current Copy Ability to create a 'Helper', an allied version of the enemy Kirby typically gets that ability from.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.digitpress.com/library/manuals/snes/kirby%20super%20star.pdf|title = ''Kirby Super Star'' manual|page = 10|publisher = Nintendo of America}}</ref> The new Helper could be controlled by the game or a second player. This feature has not yet been included in later Kirby games, although it was included in ''Kirby Super Star's'' remake, ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' and was intended to return in the cancelled ''Gamecube Kirby'' game which would have had Kirby able to make up to four helpers at once. In the game [[Kirby Star Allies]], the game\u2019s main mechanic is similar to this, but with now up to 3 helpers.\n\nOther games have developed his powers even further, often with new ways to utilize his Copy Abilities. As a whole, however, his basic moves have remained the same. In ''Kirby 64'' Kirby can combine two Copy Abilities to create new ones. This returns in ''Kirby: Squeak Squad'' in a limited form, but only with Bomb and Sword which are both able to combine with Ice, Fire, and Spark. In Kirby Star Allies, this returns again with more combinations available to the player.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', some Copy Abilities received enhanced versions called Super Abilities. Stronger than normal Copy Abilities, Super Abilities are capable of destroying scenery and interacting with the environment but unlike normal Copy Abilities their use has a time limit. Likewise, in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', Kirby can eat a Miracle Fruit to become Hypernova Kirby, giving his basic inhale ability a temporary boost that allows him to inhale huge objects.\n\nIn addition to his natural and Copy Abilities Kirby makes use of a variety of power-ups and items. In ''Kirby's Dream Land'', Kirby's first appearance, Kirby did not have Copy Abilities. He collected power ups, such as a mint leaf, which enabled him to shoot out endless air pellets for a limited amount of time, and super spicy curry, which let Kirby shoot out fireballs from his mouth until the item's effect wore off or he lost a life. Kirby uses food or other special items like Maxim Tomatoes or Invincibility Lollipops to heal his health or gain temporary invincibility in the case of the lollipop. ''Kirby Super Star'', ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' contain a feature where Kirby can share his food with the second player.\n\nIn ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', Kirby's Final Smash is his Cook ability from ''Kirby Super Star'', which cook opponents, items and more.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/16/6179547/super-smash-bros-3ds-wii-u-final-smash|title=Super Smash Bros 3DS final smashes, compared to Brawl|last=Riendeau|first=Danielle|date=2014-09-16|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref> In ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Kirby's Final Smash is an Ultra Sword attack.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'' and its 3DS remake, at the start of the game, Kirby inhales a yarn-based Maxim Tomato (referred to by Yin-Yarn as a Metamato) transforming him into yarn, granting Kirby the ability to transform into a car, a surfboarding penguin, a ''[[UFO]]'', and many other forms. Also, since Kirby cannot suck up enemies in this game (since air just goes through him), he uses a yarn whip to grab enemies and turn them into yarn balls, which can be thrown at other foes, attached to buttons, move zippers and more.\n\n===Species===\nAlthough never explored in great detail in the series, Kirby is not the only member of his kind. Similar looking characters are seen in the ending of ''Kirby's Dream Land'', and its remake ''Spring Breeze'' in ''Kirby Super Star.'' Meta Knight and Galacta Knight, both of whom bear a close resemblance to Kirby without their masks are often hinted to be of the same species as Kirby. In general, members of the species all look similar, but sometimes have different colored skin, eyes, and feet.\n\nNo official term exists for them other than Kirby's species. They are commonly referred to as 'Kirbys', just as [[Yoshi]] in the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' series]] is the name of both the species and character. As a name, however, 'Kirby' refers to only one character. In the English manual of ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'', the term 'Kirbys' is used at points, to illustrate the feature of having four differently colored versions of Kirby active in the game simultaneously, although in this situation the four \"Kirbys\" are four pieces of Kirby rather than four individual Kirby-like beings. Another common term is 'Dream Landers', a term used in the instruction manual for ''Kirby's Adventure''.<ref name=\"adventure\"/> This term, however, also refers to anyone who lives in Dream Land, including characters like King Dedede. The biography of Kirby in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' says Kirby is a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of Dream Land.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/kirby.html|title = Smash Bros. DOJO! - Kirby's Profile|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.}}</ref> Sometimes the term 'puffballs' is used referring to the species' round shape.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Remakes and ports|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'' and ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', different colored Kirbys appear as other players in multi-player games. In the case of the latter, they are the result of Kirby being divided into four by Dark Meta Knight.<ref name = \"katam\">{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/bk8j/story/index.html|title = Kirby & the Amazing Mirror Story|accessdate = 2006-11-21|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.|language = Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn the anime, Kirby has also been called a Star Warrior, along with Meta Knight and other characters that have appeared in the Kirby animated series. It is said that Kirby is just a young Star Warrior or an underdeveloped one. In the first episode of the animated series, Kirby's space ship prematurely crashed on Pop Star. The trip was supposed to take him several hundred years and in that time he was supposed to be dormant; however, his ship drifted into a space rift causing it to warp to Dream Land and making his trip shorter, not allowing him to develop into the Star Warrior he was going to become. Kirby was also called a Warpstar Knight or a Warpstar Warrior, but this was only occasionally seen in select advertisements.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', a mysterious enemy appears called Batamon, notable for its resemblance to Kirby aside from a more flattened shape and different face. These creatures are always seen walking past walls or ceilings beyond Kirby's reach, with the exception of a single stage in Cloudy Park, where Kirby can continue past the exit and come into contact with some.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Main series===\n{{main|Kirby (series)}}\n\nKirby's primary media form is video games, as he is the star and protagonist of the Nintendo owned series named after him. Most Kirby games are [[platform games]] in which Kirby fights enemies, solves puzzles, and challenges bosses. Each game typically adds a new twist or change to Kirby's abilities that the levels of the game emphasize, such as combining power ups in ''Kirby 64'' or Super Abilities in ''Return to Dream Land''. Most games involve Kirby saving a world or even universe from a dark, evil force of some kind. Typical Kirby games have a powerful being, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare, controlling or corrupting a secondary villain.\n\nThe series has 26 games currently, with the first being ''Kirby's Dream Land'' in 1992 and the latest being ''Kirby Star Allies'' in 2018. Although most are platform games, some spin offs have included pinball, racing, and puzzle games.\n\n===''Super Smash Bros.'' series===\nKirby appears in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series of games as a playable character, which is also created by Masahiro Sakurai. He is the sole ''Kirby'' series representative in ''[[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', and has been one of three (the others being Meta Knight and King Dedede) as of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. He reprises his role as a playable character in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', the latter of which features him playing a starring role in the \"World of Light\" story mode.\n\n===Anime===\n{{main|Kirby: Right Back at Ya!}}\nKirby appears in his own [[anime]] titled '''''Kirby: Right Back at Ya!''''', (Japanese: \u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 ''Hoshi no Kaabii'') in Japan. The series was licensed in [[North America]] by [[4Kids Entertainment]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] company [[Nelvana]], and produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and [[HAL Laboratory]]. It aired on [[4Kids Entertainment|4Kids TV]], via [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting]] (since 2001 which has done 100 episodes).\n\nThe anime series is set in its own universe independent of the games and offers its own take on the setting and characters, however, Kirby's creator, Masahiro Sakurai, was greatly involved in its creation, so it did not stray far from his vision of how Kirby should be.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2001/08/21/103%2C998390482%2C934%2C0%2C0.html|title = Kirby article|accessdate = 2006-12-07|publisher = [[Famitsu|Famitsu Magazine]]|language = Japanese}}</ref> The anime contains darker themes such as war, and death while still maintaining the cheerful and surreal themes the games are known for.\n\nIn the anime Kirby's origin and backstory are explored much more deeply than in the games. Kirby is a legendary Star Warrior who, according to legend, is fated to save Pop Star from destruction, but he was awoken from his slumber 200 years too early by mistake and as such has many baby or childlike qualities. Because of his age, he is still getting the hang of his powers and depends even more on the help of his friends to pull through tough situations. It is also implied that Kirby was originally a creation of the ancient evil entity called [[List of Kirby characters#Nightmare|Nightmare]] but refused to follow his evil orders and was discarded into the depths of space.\n\nKirby's Warpstar is also expanded upon, as in the games it is a mode of transportation, but here the Warpstar is also the source of his power but as he's too young to keep it safe for himself the character Tiff takes it upon herself to keep the Warpstar safe.\n\nThough Sakurai instructed that Kirby not speak in full sentences (citing the ''[[Peanuts]]'' character [[Snoopy]]) he did allow him to use a small vocabulary including a catch phrase \"Poyo\" and the names of various attacks and characters.\n\nPrior to this Kirby was also in a short educational video that was released exclusively in Japan in 1994, designed to teach [[Kanji]] to young children. The feature was not animated, but contained illustrations and was bundled with a similar video featuring [[Mario]] and [[Wario]].\n\n===Manga and comics===\nKirby also stars in several [[manga]] series, most of which have only been released in Japanese. The longest running series is titled \u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 \u30c7\u30c7\u30c7\u3067\u30d7\u30d7\u30d7\u306a\u3082\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a (''lit. Kirby of the Stars: The Story of Dedede In Pupupu'') running up to 25 books, and was written by Hirokazu Hikawa (\u3072\u304b\u308f \u535a\u4e00 ''Hikawa Hirokazu'').<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nippon-export.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=10301|title = Kirby - Manga : Vol. 21|work = Nippon Export|date = 1 December 2004|accessdate = 2006-09-21}}</ref> While [[Viz Media]] originally had plans to release the manga in English on September 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://nintendo.joystiq.com/2009/12/16/viz-publishing-kirby-manga-in-north-america|title = Viz publishing Kirby manga in North America|work = Viz Media|date = 16 December 2009|accessdate = 2010-02-23|archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6ETDMR34a?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/12/16/viz-publishing-kirby-manga-in-north-america|archive-date = 16 February 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref> This release date was pushed back to October 4, 2011 before being canceled completely on May 16, 2011.\n\nOther Kirby manga are typically one-shot comedy [[Yonkoma|4koma]] gag-manga based on the games, and have multiple artists.\n\nThe German [[Club Nintendo]] magazine often featured comics starring various Nintendo characters including Kirby. In his comics Kirby is reimagined as a detective and King Dedede as his sidekick.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nintendo-power.de/comics/kirby-856|title = Comic: Kirby|accessdate = 2009-05-09|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130131074648/http://www.nintendo-power.de/comics/kirby-856|archivedate = 2013-01-31}}</ref> These comics were promotions for Kirby games that were released in Germany at the time including ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'', ''Kirby's Avalanche'', and ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]''.\n\n==Reception==\nSince he first appeared in ''Kirby's Dream Land'', Kirby has received positive reception.

As one of Nintendo's most famous and familiar icons, Kirby's round appearance and ability to copy his foes' powers has made him a well-known figure in video games, consistently ranked as one of the most iconic video game characters. He first appeared in 1992 in ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the [[Game Boy]]. Originally a placeholder, created by [[Masahiro Sakurai]], at the age of 19, for the game's early development, he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from [[Action game|action]] [[Platform game|platformers]] to [[Puzzle game|puzzle]], [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], and even [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], and has been featured as a playable fighter in all ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' games. He has also starred in his own [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya|anime]] and manga series. His most recent appearance is in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'', for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. Since 1999, he has been voiced by [[Makiko Ohmoto]].\n\nKirby is well known for his ability to inhale objects and creatures to gain their abilities, as well as his ability to float by expanding his body. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, including his homeworld of Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as [[Dark Matter (Kirby)|Dark Matter]] or [[Nightmare (Kirby)|Nightmare]]. On these adventures he often crosses paths with his rivals, the gluttonous [[King Dedede]] and the mysterious [[Meta Knight]], though Meta Knight can be seen as a hero, depending on the game. Kirby has been described as one of the most legendary video game characters of all time by ''[[PC World]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/220620/25_legendary_video_game_characters.html|title=25 Legendary Video Game Characters|magazine=PC World|last=Filice|first=Albert|date=3 March 2011}}</ref> In virtually all his appearances, Kirby is depicted as cheerful, innocent and food-loving but becomes fearless, bold and clever in the face of danger.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nKirby was created by video game designer [[Masahiro Sakurai]] as the [[player character]] of the 1992 game ''Kirby's Dream Land''. The character's design was intended to serve as placeholder graphics for the game's original protagonist in early development and thus was given a simplistic ball-like appearance. Sakurai switched to the placeholder design for the final character design when he believed that it served the character better.<ref name=\"kirby facts\">{{cite web | url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/41729/11-amazing-kirby-facts-and-secrets/ | title=11 amazing Kirby facts and secrets | author=Zablotny, Marc | date=September 10, 2012 | work=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] | accessdate=January 23, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031152020/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/41729/11-amazing-kirby-facts-and-secrets/ | archive-date=October 31, 2014 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The character was known as {{nihongo|Popopo|\u30dd\u30dd\u30dd}} during development until the name \"Kirby\" was chosen from a draft list of potential names.

Sakurai intended the character to be pink, though Miyamoto originally wanted the character to be yellow. Kirby does appear white in the game's North American promotional materials and artwork to reflect the character's in-game appearance.<ref name=\"kirby facts\"/>\n\nIn North America, Kirby consistently appears in artwork with a more striking, bolder expression than in Japan, where his expression is more relaxed. Nintendo has said that the more battle-ready appearance appeals to a wider audience in North America.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-is-kirby-always-angry-in-the-us-nintendo-explains/1100-6419263/ | title=Why is Kirby always angry in the US? Nintendo explains | author=Gaston, Martin | date=April 28, 2014 | publisher = Gamespot}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical appearance===\nKirby has a pink, spherical, body with small stubby arms and large red feet. His eyes are a distinctive oval shape and are white (eye shine) at the top, black in the center and dark blue on the bottom (all black in early games) with rosy cheek-blushes near his eyes. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch or flatten and adopt different shapes, open his mouth really wide to inhale foes, or inflate himself with air and fly. According to the ''Super Smash Bros.'' manual he is 8 inches (or 20.32 centimeters) tall,<ref name=profilejp>{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0003/miryoku/index.html|title = Kirby's profile|accessdate = 2008-09-02|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.|language = Japanese}}</ref><ref>''Super Smash Bros.'' - Kirby's in-game biography</ref> however the games themselves are inconsistent with Kirby's height. Kirby's appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger blue eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\n===Personality===\nKirby hails from the distant Planet Popstar, where he lives in a dome-shaped house in the country of Dream Land. He has a positive attitude, and frequently helps to save Dream Land through the use of his unique powers. His age is never directly stated, although he is referred to as a \"little boy\" in the English manual for ''Kirby's Dream Land'', described as a baby in the anime, and was referred to as being a \"jolly fellow\" in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]''.\n\nKirby is cheerful and innocent. He is often depicted with a voracious appetite. His other hobbies include singing, although he is [[tone deafness|tone-deaf]].<ref name=\"profilejp\"/>\n\nThe same personality and nature is presented in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' games. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', his trophy profile states that he is an \"extremely skilled technician\". Kirby plays a prominent role in the Subspace Emissary plot as a protagonist, the story mode of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. Although he appears cute and innocent, many commercials and ads have contrasted this with his extreme fighting skills when he takes on the abilities of an enemy.\n\nKirby is a character of few words and rarely speaks in-game. His dialogue is largely limited to appearances in some games' instruction manuals, and brief comments such as \"Hi!\" or \"Poyo!\" in games including ''Super Smash Bros.'' and ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]''. Despite his lack of dialogue, Kirby narrates the functions of certain Copy Abilities on the pause menu in ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Remakes and ports|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', and ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]''. Kirby gives short descriptions of various menu options when they are highlighted. The concept of Kirby being mostly mute is supported by Masahiro Sakurai's insistence that Kirby does not speak in the [[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!#Production|anime series]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, although he does occasionally say the names of his special attacks and certain foods and sometimes repeats other words that he hears. In the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series, when Kirby copies a foe's ability, Kirby says the name of some attacks, such as [[Captain Falcon]]'s \"Falcon Punch\", Ness' PK Flash, Lucas' PK Freeze, Ryu's Hadoken/Shakunetsu Hadoken, \"Jump/Speed/Shield/Buster/Smash\" when using [[Shulk]]'s Monado Arts and [[Terry Bogard]]'s Power Wave. There are some notable exceptions where Kirby actually does speak in-game, such as ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker#Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu|Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]'' and ''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]''.\n\nDespite his loveable nature, he sometimes acts in an impulsive or naive way, such as when he accuses King Dedede of interfering with the Fountain of Dreams in ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and then leaves to retrieve the pieces of the shattered Star Rod without receiving a full explanation.<ref name = \"adventure\">{{cite web|url = http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/games/adventure/instruction.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080320121750/http://kirby.classicgaming.gamespy.com/games/adventure/instruction.html|archivedate = 2008-03-20|title = ''Kirby's Adventure'' instruction manual|accessdate = 2008-09-02}}</ref> He also attacked Meta Knight in ''[[Kirby Squeak Squad]]'' for ownership of a chest that he believed contained a slice of his stolen strawberry shortcake. In reality, the Star Rod was going to be taken by Nightmare, who would corrupt the Fountain of Dreams and turn every dream into a Nightmare, and the chest that Kirby wanted contained Dark Nebula, a powerful being with evil intentions. King Dedede and Meta Knight were aware of these problems, and were trying to protect the world.\n\n===Abilities===\n[[File:Kirby_gets_an_ability_(videogame_gameplay).png|thumb|Kirby can gain the properties of enemies or objects he eats. For example; by inhaling a sword wielding foe, Kirby becomes a skilled swordsman.]]Kirby's main ability is inhaling enemies and objects and spitting them out with incredible force. Both his mouth and body expand to allow him to inhale things much larger than himself. However, there is a limit to what he can inhale; excessively large or heavy foes like [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] can resist Kirby's inhale. Against these opponents Kirby must find smaller objects to use as ammo or intercept his opponent's attacks and send them back at them.\n\nKirby is able to float like a balloon by inhaling a gulp of air to make himself more buoyant, flying slowly by flapping his arms. However, his only method of attack in this state is to spit the gulp of air, sending him back towards the ground. While in most games he can float indefinitely, he gets tired in some games such as ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', [[Team Kirby Clash Deluxe]], [[Kirby Fighters Deluxe]] and ''Super Smash Bros.''.\n\nKirby's main mode of transportation is a star shaped, flying vehicle called a Warp Star. By clinging to its side or riding it like a surfboard Kirby is able to move quickly through the air and travel quickly between areas.\n\nFrom the [[Kirby's Adventure|second game]] onwards, by swallowing foes, Kirby can copy their primary attribute, called a Copy Ability. Giving Kirby new abilities such as gaining fire abilities from inhaling a fiery creature or the ability to shoot needles from his body by eating a spiky creature. Kirby can only have one Copy Ability at a time and must discard his current one if he wishes to use another. Additionally, if he takes too much damage his Copy Ability will be knocked out of him; though if he's quick he can inhale it again.\n\n''Kirby Super Star'' greatly expanded on the concept of Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure''. Originally Kirby just obtained one technique from a Copy Ability which replaced his Inhale but ''Kirby Super Star'' introduced multiple fighting techniques for each ability with their own controls. Additionally while ''Kirby's Adventure'' didn't have Kirby's appearance drastically change when he had a Copy Ability, aside from his color changing to orange or snow white, or wielding a weapon for abilities like ''Sword'' or ''Hammer''. ''Kirby Super Star'' gave each Copy Ability its own costume, such as a fiery crown for Fire Kirby or a floppy green cap that resembles [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link's]] for Sword Kirby.\n\nIn ''Kirby Super Star'', Kirby could sacrifice his current Copy Ability to create a 'Helper', an allied version of the enemy Kirby typically gets that ability from.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.digitpress.com/library/manuals/snes/kirby%20super%20star.pdf|title = ''Kirby Super Star'' manual|page = 10|publisher = Nintendo of America}}</ref> The new Helper could be controlled by the game or a second player. This feature has not yet been included in later Kirby games, although it was included in ''Kirby Super Star's'' remake, ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'' and was intended to return in the cancelled ''Gamecube Kirby'' game which would have had Kirby able to make up to four helpers at once. In the game [[Kirby Star Allies]], the game\u2019s main mechanic is similar to this, but with now up to 3 helpers.\n\nOther games have developed his powers even further, often with new ways to utilize his Copy Abilities. As a whole, however, his basic moves have remained the same. In ''Kirby 64'' Kirby can combine two Copy Abilities to create new ones. This returns in ''Kirby: Squeak Squad'' in a limited form, but only with Bomb and Sword which are both able to combine with Ice, Fire, and Spark. In Kirby Star Allies, this returns again with more combinations available to the player.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', some Copy Abilities received enhanced versions called Super Abilities. Stronger than normal Copy Abilities, Super Abilities are capable of destroying scenery and interacting with the environment but unlike normal Copy Abilities their use has a time limit. Likewise, in ''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'', Kirby can eat a Miracle Fruit to become Hypernova Kirby, giving his basic inhale ability a temporary boost that allows him to inhale huge objects.\n\nIn addition to his natural and Copy Abilities Kirby makes use of a variety of power-ups and items. In ''Kirby's Dream Land'', Kirby's first appearance, Kirby did not have Copy Abilities. He collected power ups, such as a mint leaf, which enabled him to shoot out endless air pellets for a limited amount of time, and super spicy curry, which let Kirby shoot out fireballs from his mouth until the item's effect wore off or he lost a life. Kirby uses food or other special items like Maxim Tomatoes or Invincibility Lollipops to heal his health or gain temporary invincibility in the case of the lollipop. ''Kirby Super Star'', ''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' contain a feature where Kirby can share his food with the second player.\n\nIn ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', Kirby's Final Smash is his Cook ability from ''Kirby Super Star'', which cook opponents, items and more.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/16/6179547/super-smash-bros-3ds-wii-u-final-smash|title=Super Smash Bros 3DS final smashes, compared to Brawl|last=Riendeau|first=Danielle|date=2014-09-16|website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref> In ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Kirby's Final Smash is an Ultra Sword attack.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'' and its 3DS remake, at the start of the game, Kirby inhales a yarn-based Maxim Tomato (referred to by Yin-Yarn as a Metamato) transforming him into yarn, granting Kirby the ability to transform into a car, a surfboarding penguin, a ''[[UFO]]'', and many other forms. Also, since Kirby cannot suck up enemies in this game (since air just goes through him), he uses a yarn whip to grab enemies and turn them into yarn balls, which can be thrown at other foes, attached to buttons, move zippers and more.\n\n===Species===\nAlthough never explored in great detail in the series, Kirby is not the only member of his kind. Similar looking characters are seen in the ending of ''Kirby's Dream Land'', and its remake ''Spring Breeze'' in ''Kirby Super Star.'' Meta Knight and Galacta Knight, both of whom bear a close resemblance to Kirby without their masks are often hinted to be of the same species as Kirby. In general, members of the species all look similar, but sometimes have different colored skin, eyes, and feet.\n\nNo official term exists for them other than Kirby's species. They are commonly referred to as 'Kirbys', just as [[Yoshi]] in the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' series]] is the name of both the species and character. As a name, however, 'Kirby' refers to only one character. In the English manual of ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'', the term 'Kirbys' is used at points, to illustrate the feature of having four differently colored versions of Kirby active in the game simultaneously, although in this situation the four \"Kirbys\" are four pieces of Kirby rather than four individual Kirby-like beings. Another common term is 'Dream Landers', a term used in the instruction manual for ''Kirby's Adventure''.<ref name=\"adventure\"/> This term, however, also refers to anyone who lives in Dream Land, including characters like King Dedede. The biography of Kirby in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' says Kirby is a [[Citizenship|citizen]] of Dream Land.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.smashbros.com/wii/en_us/characters/kirby.html|title = Smash Bros. DOJO! - Kirby's Profile|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.}}</ref> Sometimes the term 'puffballs' is used referring to the species' round shape.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Adventure#Remakes and ports|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'' and ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'', different colored Kirbys appear as other players in multi-player games. In the case of the latter, they are the result of Kirby being divided into four by Dark Meta Knight.<ref name = \"katam\">{{cite web|url = https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/bk8j/story/index.html|title = Kirby & the Amazing Mirror Story|accessdate = 2006-11-21|publisher = Nintendo Co., Ltd.|language = Japanese}}</ref>\n\nIn the anime, Kirby has also been called a Star Warrior, along with Meta Knight and other characters that have appeared in the Kirby animated series. It is said that Kirby is just a young Star Warrior or an underdeveloped one. In the first episode of the animated series, Kirby's space ship prematurely crashed on Pop Star. The trip was supposed to take him several hundred years and in that time he was supposed to be dormant; however, his ship drifted into a space rift causing it to warp to Dream Land and making his trip shorter, not allowing him to develop into the Star Warrior he was going to become. Kirby was also called a Warpstar Knight or a Warpstar Warrior, but this was only occasionally seen in select advertisements.\n\nIn ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', a mysterious enemy appears called Batamon, notable for its resemblance to Kirby aside from a more flattened shape and different face. These creatures are always seen walking past walls or ceilings beyond Kirby's reach, with the exception of a single stage in Cloudy Park, where Kirby can continue past the exit and come into contact with some.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Main series===\n{{main|Kirby (series)}}\n\nKirby's primary media form is video games, as he is the star and protagonist of the Nintendo owned series named after him. Most Kirby games are [[platform games]] in which Kirby fights enemies, solves puzzles, and challenges bosses. Each game typically adds a new twist or change to Kirby's abilities that the levels of the game emphasize, such as combining power ups in ''Kirby 64'' or Super Abilities in ''Return to Dream Land''. Most games involve Kirby saving a world or even universe from a dark, evil force of some kind. Typical Kirby games have a powerful being, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare, controlling or corrupting a secondary villain.\n\nThe series has 26 games currently, with the first being ''Kirby's Dream Land'' in 1992 and the latest being ''Kirby Star Allies'' in 2018. Although most are platform games, some spin offs have included pinball, racing, and puzzle games.\n\n===''Super Smash Bros.'' series===\nKirby appears in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series of games as a playable character, which is also created by Masahiro Sakurai. He is the sole ''Kirby'' series representative in ''[[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', and has been one of three (the others being Meta Knight and King Dedede) as of ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. He reprises his role as a playable character in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', the latter of which features him playing a starring role in the \"World of Light\" story mode.\n\n===Anime===\n{{main|Kirby: Right Back at Ya!}}\nKirby appears in his own [[anime]] titled '''''Kirby: Right Back at Ya!''''', (Japanese: \u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 ''Hoshi no Kaabii'') in Japan. The series was licensed in [[North America]] by [[4Kids Entertainment]] and the [[Canada|Canadian]] company [[Nelvana]], and produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and [[HAL Laboratory]]. It aired on [[4Kids Entertainment|4Kids TV]], via [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting]] (since 2001 which has done 100 episodes).\n\nThe anime series is set in its own universe independent of the games and offers its own take on the setting and characters, however, Kirby's creator, Masahiro Sakurai, was greatly involved in its creation, so it did not stray far from his vision of how Kirby should be.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2001/08/21/103%2C998390482%2C934%2C0%2C0.html|title = Kirby article|accessdate = 2006-12-07|publisher = [[Famitsu|Famitsu Magazine]]|language = Japanese}}</ref> The anime contains darker themes such as war, and death while still maintaining the cheerful and surreal themes the games are known for.\n\nIn the anime Kirby's origin and backstory are explored much more deeply than in the games. Kirby is a legendary Star Warrior who, according to legend, is fated to save Pop Star from destruction, but he was awoken from his slumber 200 years too early by mistake and as such has many baby or childlike qualities. Because of his age, he is still getting the hang of his powers and depends even more on the help of his friends to pull through tough situations. It is also implied that Kirby was originally a creation of the ancient evil entity called [[List of Kirby characters#Nightmare|Nightmare]] but refused to follow his evil orders and was discarded into the depths of space.\n\nKirby's Warpstar is also expanded upon, as in the games it is a mode of transportation, but here the Warpstar is also the source of his power but as he's too young to keep it safe for himself the character Tiff takes it upon herself to keep the Warpstar safe.\n\nThough Sakurai instructed that Kirby not speak in full sentences (citing the ''[[Peanuts]]'' character [[Snoopy]]) he did allow him to use a small vocabulary including a catch phrase \"Poyo\" and the names of various attacks and characters.\n\nPrior to this Kirby was also in a short educational video that was released exclusively in Japan in 1994, designed to teach [[Kanji]] to young children. The feature was not animated, but contained illustrations and was bundled with a similar video featuring [[Mario]] and [[Wario]].\n\n===Manga and comics===\nKirby also stars in several [[manga]] series, most of which have only been released in Japanese. The longest running series is titled \u661f\u306e\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3 \u30c7\u30c7\u30c7\u3067\u30d7\u30d7\u30d7\u306a\u3082\u306e\u304c\u305f\u308a (''lit. Kirby of the Stars: The Story of Dedede In Pupupu'') running up to 25 books, and was written by Hirokazu Hikawa (\u3072\u304b\u308f \u535a\u4e00 ''Hikawa Hirokazu'').<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nippon-export.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=10301|title = Kirby - Manga : Vol. 21|work = Nippon Export|date = 1 December 2004|accessdate = 2006-09-21}}</ref> While [[Viz Media]] originally had plans to release the manga in English on September 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://nintendo.joystiq.com/2009/12/16/viz-publishing-kirby-manga-in-north-america|title = Viz publishing Kirby manga in North America|work = Viz Media|date = 16 December 2009|accessdate = 2010-02-23|archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6ETDMR34a?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/12/16/viz-publishing-kirby-manga-in-north-america|archive-date = 16 February 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref> This release date was pushed back to October 4, 2011 before being canceled completely on May 16, 2011.\n\nOther Kirby manga are typically one-shot comedy [[Yonkoma|4koma]] gag-manga based on the games, and have multiple artists.\n\nThe German [[Club Nintendo]] magazine often featured comics starring various Nintendo characters including Kirby. In his comics Kirby is reimagined as a detective and King Dedede as his sidekick.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nintendo-power.de/comics/kirby-856|title = Comic: Kirby|accessdate = 2009-05-09|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130131074648/http://www.nintendo-power.de/comics/kirby-856|archivedate = 2013-01-31}}</ref> These comics were promotions for Kirby games that were released in Germany at the time including ''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'', ''Kirby's Avalanche'', and ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]''.\n\n==Reception==\nSince he first appeared in ''Kirby's Dream Land'', Kirby has received positive reception.

''Twilight of the Idols'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), pg. ix</ref> As Nietzsche's fame and popularity were spreading both inside and outside Germany, he felt that he needed a text that would serve as a short introduction to his work.{{citation needed|reason=Nietzsche's work was not widely read in his lifetime|date=August 2015}} Originally titled ''A Psychologist's Idleness'', it was renamed ''Twilight of the Idols or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer''.\n\nThe latter title, ''G\u00f6tzen-D\u00e4mmerung'' in German, is a pun on the title of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera, ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'', or 'Twilight of the Gods'. ''[[:wikt:G\u00f6tze|G\u00f6tze]]'' is a German word for \"idol\" or \"false god\". [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has suggested that in his use of the word Nietzsche might be indebted to [[Francis Bacon]].<ref>Kaufmann W., The Portable Nietzsche, New York: Viking, 1954, p463</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nNietzsche criticizes German culture of the day as unsophisticated, decadent and nihilistic, and shoots some disapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural figures who represent similar tendencies. In contrast to all these alleged representatives of cultural \"[[decadence]]\", Nietzsche applauds [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Napoleon]], [[Goethe]], [[Thucydides]] and the [[Sophist]]s as healthier and stronger types. The book states the [[transvaluation of values|transvaluation of all values]] as Nietzsche's final and most important project, and gives a view of antiquity wherein [[Roman Empire|the Romans]] for once take precedence over the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], albeit only in the field of literature.\n\nThe book is divided into twelve sections:\n\n===Foreword===\n\n===Maxims and Arrows===\nSingle sentence aphorisms on a variety of topics.\n\n===The Problem of Socrates===\n\nThroughout history, Nietzsche asserts, the most learned seem to have shared a common belief that life is worthless. Nietzsche argues that this idea was not a symptom of a healthy society but of one in decline. Philosophers such as [[Socrates]] or [[Plato]], Nietzsche explains, shared a common physiological disposition to feel negatively about life, which reflected the decay of the superior Greek culture that preceded them.\n\nNietzsche holds Socrates in special contempt. Socrates, he believes, was subject to all manner of vice and lustful impulses and was a product of the \"lower orders\" of society. Nietzsche singles out two particular ideas of Socrates for attack. The first is the interconnectedness of reason, virtue, and happiness. The second is Socrates's introduction of the [[dialectic]] method to philosophy (the process by which two or more people with different points of view reach a conclusion through a process of discourse, logic, and reason, also called the [[Socratic method]]). Nietzsche thought that the dialectic allowed weaker philosophical positions and less sophisticated thinkers to gain too large a foothold in a society. Nietzsche's program valued instinct over reason, but because of Socrates and the dialectic, Greek culture now became \"absurdly rational.\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', 2003, pg. 43.</ref> A key part of Nietzsche's thesis is that \"happiness and instinct are one,\" but reason stands in direct opposition to instinct.\n\nUltimately, Nietzsche insisted, the value of life cannot be estimated, and any judgment concerning it only reveals the person's life-denying or [[Nietzschean affirmation|life-affirming]] tendencies.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. ''Twilight of the Idols; and the Anti-Christ.'' Trans. R. J. Hollingdale. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1977, pgs. 40, 55.</ref>\n\n===Reason in Philosophy===\nNietzsche denies many of Plato's ideas, specifically that of Being and Becoming, the world of the forms, and the fallibility of the senses.  More precisely, he does not believe that one should refute the senses, as Plato did.<ref>Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', pg. 45.</ref>  This goes against Nietzsche's ideals of human excellence in that it is a symptom of personal decadence.<ref name=\"NietzscheTwilight\">Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', pg. 49.</ref>  By decadence, Nietzsche is referring to a fading of life, vitality and an embrace of weakness.  In Nietzsche's view, if one is to accept a non-sensory, unchanging world as superior and our sensory world as inferior, then one is adopting a hate of nature and thus a hate of the sensory world &ndash; the world of the living.  Nietzsche postulates that only one who is weak, sickly or ignoble would subscribe to such a belief.\n\nNietzsche goes on to relate this obsession with the non-physical realm to [[Christianity]] and the concept of [[Heaven]].  Nietzsche indicates that the belief in the Christian God is a similar decadence and hate of life.<ref name=\"NietzscheTwilight\" />  Given that Christians believe in Heaven, which is in concept similar to Plato's ideas of the world of forms (a changeless, eternal world) and that Christians divide the world into the \"real\" (heaven) and the apparent (living) world, they too hate nature.\n\n===How the \"True World\" Finally Became Fiction===\nIn this section, Nietzsche demonstrates the process by which previous philosophers have fictionalized the apparent world, casting the product of the senses into doubt, and thereby removing the concept of the real world. The section is divided into six parts:\n\n# The wise and pious man dwells in the real world, which he attains through his wisdom (skills in perception warrant a more accurate view of the real world).\n# The wise and pious man doesn't dwell in the real world, but rather it is promised to him, a goal to live for. (ex: to the sinner who repents)\n# The real world is unattainable and cannot be promised, yet remains a consolation when confronted with the perceived injustices of the apparent world.\n# If the real world is not attained, then it is unknown. Therefore, there is no duty to the real world, and no consolation derived from it.\n# The idea of a real world has become useless&mdash;it provides no consolation or motive. It is therefore cast aside as a useless abstraction.\n# What world is left? The concept of the real world has been abolished, and with it, the idea of an apparent world follows.\n\n===Morality as Anti-Nature===\n\nNietzsche is not a [[hedonism|hedonist]], arguing that any passion in excess can \"drag their victim down with the weight of their folly.\" However, he maintains that it is possible for the passions to ultimately become \"spiritualized.\" Christianity, he criticizes, instead deals with immoderate passions by attempting to remove the passion completely. In an analogy, Nietzsche claims that the Christian approach to morality is not much different than how an unskilled dentist might treat any tooth pain by removing the tooth entirely rather than pursue other less aggressive and equally effective treatments. Christianity doesn't attempt to \"spiritualize, beautify, deify a desire,\" which leads Nietzsche to conclude that the Christian Church is \"hostile to life.\" Taking a psychological turn, Nietzsche writes that people who want to exterminate certain passions outright do so mainly because they are \"too weak-willed, too degenerate to impose moderation\" upon their own selves.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ.: trans. R. J. Hollingdale. New York: Penguin Books; 2003. p. 52</ref>\n\nNietzsche develops his idea of spiritualizing the passions through examining the concepts of ''love'' and ''enmity''. Love, he claims, is actually the \"spiritualization of sensuality.\" Enmity, on the other hand, spiritualizes the state of having enemies since having opponents helps us to define and strengthen our own positions. Even with the anti-Christian sentiment that pervades his thinking, Nietzsche makes it very clear that he has no interest in eliminating the Christian Church. Instead, he recognizes that his own philosophical program would be neither as effective or necessary without it. If his enemy the Church denies the \"instincts of life,\" this helps him to develop a position that affirms them. Using theological language, Nietzsche insists that the real \"[[blasphemy]]\" is the Christian \"rebellion against life.\" Christian morality is ultimately symptomatic of a \"declining, debilitated, weary, condemned life.\"\n\nNietzsche concludes that insisting people ought to be one way and not another leads to a form of bigotry that devalues the goodness of human diversity, the \"enchanting wealth of types.\" Also, the belief that people can truly change their nature disregards the fact that any person is a \"piece of fate.\" It is not possible for a person to divorce him- or herself from either the past events or present circumstances that cause them to be who they are. Ultimately, Nietzsche concludes that it is \"immoralists\" such as himself who have the highest respect for inherent worth of individuals because they do not value one person's approach to life over any others.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ.: trans. R. J. Hollingdale. New York: Penguin Books; 2003. p. 56-57</ref>\n\n===The Four Great Errors===\n\nIn the chapter ''[[The Four Great Errors]]'', he suggests that people, especially Christians, confuse the effect for the cause, and that they [[Psychological projection|project]] the human ego and [[Subject (philosophy)|subjectivity]] on to other things, thereby creating the illusionary concept of [[being]], and therefore also of the [[Noumenon|thing-in-itself]] and [[God]]. In reality, motive or intention is \"an accompaniment to an act\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', pg. 60.</ref> rather than the cause of that act. By removing causal agency based on free, conscious will, Nietzsche critiques the ethics of accountability, suggesting that everything is necessary in a whole that can neither be judged nor condemned, because there is nothing outside of it.<ref>Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', pg. 65.</ref> What people typically deem \"[[vice]]\" is in fact merely \"the inability ''not'' to react to a stimulus.\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', pg. 54.</ref> In this light, the concept of [[morality]] becomes purely a means of control: \"the doctrine of will has been invented essentially for the purpose of punishment, that is of ''finding guilty''.\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', pg. 64.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Men were thought of as ''free'' so that they could become ''guilty'': consequently, every action ''had'' to be thought of as willed, the origin of every action as lying in the consciousness... ...Today, when we have started to move in the ''reverse'' direction, when we immoralists especially are trying with all our might to remove the concept of guilt and the concept of punishment from the world and to purge psychology, history, nature, the social institutions and sanctions of them, there is in our eyes no more radical opposition than that of the theologians, who continue to infect the innocence of becoming with 'punishment' and 'guilt' by means of the concept of the 'moral world-order'. Christianity is a hangman's metaphysics. <small>''The Four Great Errors''</small>}}\n\n===The 'Improvers' of Mankind===\nIn this passage, Nietzsche proclaims his lack of belief of an objective morality, stating that there is no such thing as moral fact. With this information, he lists two examples of cases where moralization of mankind was attempted, despite the lack of complete moral truth. The people pushing for this morality are called 'improvers' by Nietzsche, the quotes representing the fact that these certain people fail at their goal of improving man.\n\nThe first of these examples is that of religion. In this example, Nietzsche tells a fictional story of a priest who converts a man to [[Christianity]], in order to keep him moral. However, his man eventually falls into basic human instinct such as lust, and is thus labeled as a sinner. Afterwards, the man is full of hatred, and is ostracized by others. The priest in this story represents the 'improver,' as he attempts to moralize someone, but only makes the man's life miserable.\n\nThe second of these examples is that of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] in India. This system made an attempt of moralizing man by method of demoting and [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing]] the [[Dalit]] who were at the very bottom of society. The 'improvers' in this scenario are those who perpetuate the caste system, and contribute to the dehumanization of the Dalit for the goal of moralization.\n\n===What the Germans Lack===\nIn examining German society of his day, Nietzsche attributes any advantage Germans hold over other European countries to basic ethical virtues and not to any cultural sophistication. Nietzsche attributes the decline he sees in the sophistication in German thought to prioritizing politics over the intellect. The state and culture are in tension because one of the pair thrives at the expense of the other.\n\n{{quote|Culture and the state--one should not deceive oneself over this--are antagonists: the \u2032cultural state\u2032 is merely a modern idea. The one lives off the other, the one thrives at the expense of the other.

Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ.: trans. R. J. Hollingdale. New York: Penguin Books; 2003. p. 74</ref>}}\n\nNietzsche also attributes this decline in the German intellect to problems he saw in higher education in his day. First, Nietzsche calls into question the qualifications of college instructors, insisting on the need for \"educators who are themselves educated.\" Educators, he argues, are vital to teach three key skills: seeing (the ability to think before acting on impulse), thinking (\"Thinking has to be learned in the way dancing has to be learned.\"), and speaking and writing (\"One has to be able to dance with the ''pen.''\"). Second, he is highly critical of opening colleges and universities to all classes of society, because when stripped of its \"privilege,\" the quality of higher education declines. \"All higher education belongs to the exceptions alone: one must be privileged to have a right to so high a privilege. Great and fine things can never be common property.\"<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ.: trans. R. J. Hollingdale. New York: Penguin Books; 2003. p. 75</ref>\n\n===Skirmishes of an Untimely Man===\n\n===What I Owe to the Ancients===\nNietzsche criticizes Plato, accusing him of \"over-morality\" and calling him an \"exalted swindle.\" He goes further to claim that \"Christianity is Platonism for the people\" in its harmful morality.\n\nHe argues against what he sees as Plato's hatred of life to argue that humans need to value life despite the suffering. He refers to the [[Dionysian Mysteries]] to argue that we need to answer a triumphant yes to life, and that even pain is holy. He also refers to the [[Eternal recurrence|Eternal Recurrence]], his thought experiment that asks if you would be happy if you found out you had to live the same life over and over down to the last detail unknowingly (Nietzsche thinks the answer should be yes), to encourage people to embrace and celebrate life. Nietzsche believes that to be oneself is \"the eternal joy of becoming.\"\n\n===The Hammer Speaks===\nNietzsche speaks of Part III 'Of Old and New Law Tablets' in Thus Spoke Zarathustra.<ref>Nietzsche ''Twilight of the Idols'' p. 122</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\n{{In popular culture|date=October 2018}}\nNietzsche's original line \"From life's school of war: what does not kill me makes me stronger\" has been referenced many times.

''Twilight of the Idols'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), pg. ix</ref> As Nietzsche's fame and popularity were spreading both inside and outside Germany, he felt that he needed a text that would serve as a short introduction to his work.{{citation needed|reason=Nietzsche's work was not widely read in his lifetime|date=August 2015}} Originally titled ''A Psychologist's Idleness'', it was renamed ''Twilight of the Idols or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer''.\n\nThe former title, ''G\u00f6tzen-D\u00e4mmerung'' in German, is a pun on the title of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera, ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'', or 'Twilight of the Gods'. ''[[:wikt:G\u00f6tze|G\u00f6tze]]'' is a German word for \"idol\" or \"false god\". [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has suggested that in his use of the word Nietzsche might be indebted to [[Francis Bacon]].<ref>Kaufmann W., The Portable Nietzsche, New York: Viking, 1954, p463</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nNietzsche criticizes German culture of the day as unsophisticated, decadent and nihilistic, and shoots some disapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural figures who represent similar tendencies. In contrast to all these alleged representatives of cultural \"[[decadence]]\", Nietzsche applauds [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Napoleon]], [[Goethe]], [[Thucydides]] and the [[Sophist]]s as healthier and stronger types. The book states the [[transvaluation of values|transvaluation of all values]] as Nietzsche's final and most important project, and gives a view of antiquity wherein [[Roman Empire|the Romans]] for once take precedence over the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], albeit only in the field of literature.\n\nThe book is divided into twelve sections:\n\n===Foreword===\n\n===Maxims and Arrows===\nSingle sentence aphorisms on a variety of topics.\n\n===The Problem of Socrates===\n\nThroughout history, Nietzsche asserts, the most learned seem to have shared a common belief that life is worthless. Nietzsche argues that this idea was not a symptom of a healthy society but of one in decline. Philosophers such as [[Socrates]] or [[Plato]], Nietzsche explains, shared a common physiological disposition to feel negatively about life, which reflected the decay of the superior Greek culture that preceded them.\n\nNietzsche holds Socrates in special contempt. Socrates, he believes, was subject to all manner of vice and lustful impulses and was a product of the \"lower orders\" of society. Nietzsche singles out two particular ideas of Socrates for attack. The first is the interconnectedness of reason, virtue, and happiness. The second is Socrates's introduction of the [[dialectic]] method to philosophy (the process by which two or more people with different points of view reach a conclusion through a process of discourse, logic, and reason, also called the [[Socratic method]]). Nietzsche thought that the dialectic allowed weaker philosophical positions and less sophisticated thinkers to gain too large a foothold in a society. Nietzsche's program valued instinct over reason, but because of Socrates and the dialectic, Greek culture now became \"absurdly rational.\"<ref>Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', 2003, pg. 43.</ref> A key part of Nietzsche's thesis is that \"happiness and instinct are one,\" but reason stands in direct opposition to instinct.\n\nUltimately, Nietzsche insisted, the value of life cannot be estimated, and any judgment concerning it only reveals the person's life-denying or [[Nietzschean affirmation|life-affirming]] tendencies.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. ''Twilight of the Idols; and the Anti-Christ.'' Trans. R. J. Hollingdale. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1977, pgs. 40, 55.</ref>\n\n===Reason in Philosophy===\nNietzsche denies many of Plato's ideas, specifically that of Being and Becoming, the world of the forms, and the fallibility of the senses.  More precisely, he does not believe that one should refute the senses, as Plato did.<ref>Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', pg. 45.</ref>  This goes against Nietzsche's ideals of human excellence in that it is a symptom of personal decadence.<ref name=\"NietzscheTwilight\">Nietzsche, ''Twilight of the Idols'', pg. 49.</ref>  By decadence, Nietzsche is referring to a fading of life, vitality and an embrace of weakness.  In Nietzsche's view, if one is to accept a non-sensory, unchanging world as superior and our sensory world as inferior, then one is adopting a hate of nature and thus a hate of the sensory world &ndash; the world of the living.  Nietzsche postulates that only one who is weak, sickly or ignoble would subscribe to such a belief.\n\nNietzsche goes on to relate this obsession with the non-physical realm to [[Christianity]] and the concept of [[Heaven]].  Nietzsche indicates that the belief in the Christian God is a similar decadence and hate of life.<ref name=\"NietzscheTwilight\" />  Given that Christians believe in Heaven, which is in concept similar to Plato's ideas of the world of forms (a changeless, eternal world) and that Christians divide the world into the \"real\" (heaven) and the apparent (living) world, they too hate nature.\n\n===How the \"True World\" Finally Became Fiction===\nIn this section, Nietzsche demonstrates the process by which previous philosophers have fictionalized the apparent world, casting the product of the senses into doubt, and thereby removing the concept of the real world. The section is divided into six parts:\n\n# The wise and pious man dwells in the real world, which he attains through his wisdom (skills in perception warrant a more accurate view of the real world).\n# The wise and pious man doesn't dwell in the real world, but rather it is promised to him, a goal to live for. (ex: to the sinner who repents)\n# The real world is unattainable and cannot be promised, yet remains a consolation when confronted with the perceived injustices of the apparent world.\n# If the real world is not attained, then it is unknown. Therefore, there is no duty to the real world, and no consolation derived from it.\n# The idea of a real world has become useless&mdash;it provides no consolation or motive. It is therefore cast aside as a useless abstraction.\n# What world is left? The concept of the real world has been abolished, and with it, the idea of an apparent world follows.\n\n===Morality as Anti-Nature===\n\nNietzsche is not a [[hedonism|hedonist]], arguing that any passion in excess can \"drag their victim down with the weight of their folly.\" However, he maintains that it is possible for the passions to ultimately become \"spiritualized.\" Christianity, he criticizes, instead deals with immoderate passions by attempting to remove the passion completely. In an analogy, Nietzsche claims that the Christian approach to morality is not much different than how an unskilled dentist might treat any tooth pain by removing the tooth entirely rather than pursue other less aggressive and equally effective treatments. Christianity doesn't attempt to \"spiritualize, beautify, deify a desire,\" which leads Nietzsche to conclude that the Christian Church is \"hostile to life.\" Taking a psychological turn, Nietzsche writes that people who want to exterminate certain passions outright do so mainly because they are \"too weak-willed, too degenerate to impose moderation\" upon their own selves.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. Twilight of the Idols and The Anti-Christ.: trans. R. J. Hollingdale. New York: Penguin Books; 2003. p. 52</ref>\n\nNietzsche develops his idea of spiritualizing the passions through examining the concepts of ''love'' and ''enmity''. Love, he claims, is actually the \"spiritualization of sensuality.\" Enmity, on the other hand, spiritualizes the state of having enemies since having opponents helps us to define and strengthen our own positions. Even with the anti-Christian sentiment that pervades his thinking, Nietzsche makes it very clear that he has no interest in eliminating the Christian Church. Instead, he recognizes that his own philosophical program would be neither as effective or necessary without it. If his enemy the Church denies the \"instincts of life,\" this helps him to develop a position that affirms them. Using theological language, Nietzsche insists that the real \"[[blasphemy]]\" is the Christian \"rebellion against life.\" Christian morality is ultimately symptomatic of a \"declining, debilitated, weary, condemned life.\"\n\nNietzsche concludes that insisting people ought to be one way and not another leads to a form of bigotry that devalues the goodness of human diversity, the \"enchanting wealth of types.\" Also, the belief that people can truly change their nature disregards the fact that any person is a \"piece of fate.\" It is not possible for a person to divorce him- or herself from either the past events or present circumstances that cause them to be who they are.

The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645.
