Similarly to the south, signage directs southbound travelers approaching this intersection to take Card Sound Road if the lights on it are flashing, rather than taking US 1 south to Key Largo.\n\n[[File:Pinecrest Parkway.jpg|thumb|Portion of the South Dixie Highway, just south of Dadeland]]\nJust north of the Card Sound Road intersection, US 1 meets the southern end of [[Florida State Road 997|Krome Avenue (State Road 997)]], and then enters Florida City. Here, US 1 intersects [[Florida State Road 9336|State Road 9336]], providing access westwards to [[Everglades National Park]]; at the same intersection, Palm Drive ([[Florida State Road 906|former State Road 906]]) likewise provides access eastwards to [[Biscayne National Park]]. From here northbound, the South Dixie Highway is paralleled by the [[South Miami-Dade Busway]] along the former [[Florida East Coast Railway]] alignment. Near-immediately northbound of the Palm Drive intersection, US 1 meets the southern end of the [[Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike]], and then crosses into [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] at South 328th Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofhomestead.com/pdf/maps/flum.pdf|title=Land Use Map of Homestead}}</ref> The road then curves northeast through Homestead, parallel to Florida's Turnpike, leaving the city north of South 304th Street, continuing northeast through the communities of [[Leisure City, Florida|Leisure City]], Modello, [[Naranja, Florida|Naranja]], [[Princeton, Florida|Princeton]], and [[Goulds, Florida|Goulds]].\n\nAt West 112th Avenue/[[Allapattah Road (Miami)|Allapattah Road]] (SR&nbsp;989), US 1 enters the incorporated town of [[Cutler Bay, Florida|Cutler Bay]] (formerly [[Cutler Ridge, Florida|Cutler Ridge]]), soon passes under the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike, and continues northeast in the town until at South 186th Street it forms the town's border for two blocks before leaving at South 184th Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cutlerbay.net/images/CBMap2.jpg|title=Map of Cutler Bay}}</ref> From here, the road continues northeast from this point, forming the western boundary of [[Palmetto Bay, Florida|Palmetto Bay]].<ref name=\"MiamiDadeFLDOT\">{{cite map |url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/surveyingandmapping/geomap/mida_c.pdf |title=General Highway Map - Miami-Dade County, Florida |author=Surveying and Mapping Office |publisher= Florida Department of Transportation |date=April 2007 |edition=May, 2010 |accessdate=April 3, 2013}}</ref> In [[Perrine, Florida|Perrine]], it meets [[Florida State Road 994|State Road 994]], and then divides into a one-way pair of streets, with northbound traffic directed east one block of the southbound traffic along a sweeping curve between South 183rd and South 168th Streets. After the two directions of traffic rejoin, the road meets [[Coral Reef Drive]] (SR&nbsp;992), then passes through Rockdale and Howard until it reaches South 136th Street (Howard Drive), meets the southern terminus of [[Florida State Road 973|State Road 973]] a block later, and serves to divide [[Pinecrest, Florida|Pinecrest]] to the southeast and [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] and [[Dadeland]] to the northwest for the next few miles.

About a mile east, it meets the national southern terminus of I-95, which is joins over the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] into downtown.\n\n[[File:Southern Biscayne Boulevard.jpg|thumb|Biscayne Boulevard in Downtown Miami]]\nThe road is then named Biscayne Boulevard through the rest of Miami-Dade County as it proceeds north on [[Biscayne Bay]]. As Biscayne Boulevard, US 1 becomes a one-way pair at an intersection with [[Florida State Road 970|State Road 970]]. Two blocks north, it reaches [[Florida State Road 968|State Road 968]] (Flagler Street), the north\u2013south baseline for most of Miami-Dade County. US 1 then passes by the western end of [[Bayfront Park]], and then intersects Port Boulevard (NE 6th Street), providing access to the [[Port of Miami]], with the [[American Airlines Arena]] at the northeastern end of the intersection. For the next few blocks, it passes by [[Bicentennial Park (Miami)|Bicentennial Park]], with [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|Interstate 395]] at the northern end, which also marks the national southern terminus of US 41. US 1 continues through midtown Miami, intersecting with the national southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|U.S. Route 27]] one block south of [[Interstate 195 (Florida)|Interstate 195]] next to the Julia Tuttle Causeway. North of I-195, the road continues through Miami as a residential road, intersecting [[Florida State Road 944|State Road 944]], [[Florida State Road 934|State Road 934]], and [[Florida State Road 915|State Road 915]] before leaving Miami. Moving further inland, the Boulevard replaces East Sixth Avenue at 61st Street. It enters the village of [[Miami Shores, Florida|Miami Shores]] at North 87th Street. Crossing the Biscayne Canal, Miami Shores becomes [[North Miami, Florida|North Miami]]. In North Miami, it intersects [[Florida State Road 922|State Road 922]], leading to the Broad Causeway and [[Florida State Road 916|State Road 916]]. In [[North Miami Beach, Florida|North Miami Beach]], it intersects [[Florida State Road 826|State Road 826]], and [[Florida State Road 860|State Road 860]]. The road enters [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]] at [[Greynolds Park]]. It continues north-northeast through the city of Aventura, curving due north at North 187th Street and northeast at North 203rd Street. In Aventura, it intersects [[Florida State Road 856|State Road 856]] at the southwest of the [[Aventura Mall]], and after intersecting the former [[Florida State Road 854|State Road 854]], it leaves Miami-Dade County.\n\n===Broward County===\n[[File:Ft Laud FL New River Tunnel north01.jpg|thumb|New River Tunnel, going north]]\nEntering [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] near [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]], US 1 first intersects [[Florida State Road 858|State Road 858]]. Next it meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 824|State Road 824]], which provides access to [[Miramar, Florida|Miramar]] and [[Pembroke Pines, Florida|Pembroke Pines]]. Entering [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]], US 1 intersects [[Florida State Road 820|State Road 820]] in a [[traffic circle]] around Anniversary Park. In [[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]], it meets [[Florida State Road 822|State Road 822]] and [[Florida State Road 848|State Road 848]]. Here [[Florida State Road A1A|State Road A1A]] also begins running concurrently with the road just south of [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport]] for a few miles. Near the southeastern corner of the airport, US 1 meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 818|State Road 818]]. It then proceeds to run around the eastern edge of the airport. On the northeastern corner, US 1 meets [[Interstate 595 (Florida)|I-595]]. Now in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] as Federal Highway, it intersects the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 84|State Road 84]]. Another \u00bd mile beyond, A1A ends its concurrency with US 1 and returns to the barrier island. One mile south of downtown, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 736|State Road 736]]. The road enters downtown Fort Lauderdale via the [[New River Tunnel]], one of only a few<!--there are several in Disney World--> underwater road tunnels in the state (the other on a state road being the [[Port of Miami Tunnel]]). The next major intersection is with [[Florida State Road 842|State Road 842]]. US 1 then turns east for one mile in concurrency with [[Florida State Road 838|State Road 838]] before separating again and turning north. The last two major intersections in Fort Lauderdale are with [[Florida State Road 816|State Roads 816]] and [[Florida State Road 870|870]]. US 1 then enters [[Pompano Beach, Florida|Pompano Beach]]. As it makes its way through Pompano Beach, it intersects [[Florida State Road 814|State Road 814]]. It then passes by the [[Pompano Beach Airpark]] and the Pompano Beach Golf Club. The road then proceeds to enter [[Deerfield Beach, Florida|Deerfield Beach]], where it meets [[Florida State Road 869|SE 10th Street]] and [[Florida State Road 810|State Road 810]]. US 1 then crosses the [[Hillsboro Canal]] and exits Deerfield Beach and Broward County.\n\n===Palm Beach County===\n[[File:Red US 1 Sign in FL.jpg|thumb|left|One of the last remaining colored-shield US 1 signs, in Boca Raton on S Military Trail]]\n\nAs US 1 enters [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]] and [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], it forms the western boundary to Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club, meeting with the northern terminus of the southern section of [[Florida State Road 811|State Road 811]]. It passes through the heart of Boca Raton, becoming a divided road with three lanes each, becoming the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 808|State Road 808]], as well as intersecting [[Florida State Road 800|State Road 800]], and becoming the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 794|State Road 794]]. US 1 then enters [[Delray Beach, Florida|Delray Beach]], becoming a [[one-way pair]] just north of Linton Boulevard, and meets [[Florida State Road 806|State Road 806]] in central Delray Beach. US 1 becomes a divided highway again, entering [[Boynton Beach, Florida|Boynton Beach]], [[Florida State Road 804|State Road 804]] runs concurrent for 2 blocks, providing access to local beaches at Ocean Ridge via the Intercoastal Waterway. At the city limits of [[Lake Worth, Florida|Lake Worth]] and [[Lantana, Florida|Lantana]], just north of Lantana Road, US 1's hidden designation, [[Florida State Road 5|State Road 5]] splits and runs parallel to US 1 a few blocks to the east. In central Lake Worth US 1 intersects [[Florida State Road 802|State Road 802]]. Entering [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], it first intersects [[Florida State Road 882|State Road 882]], followed by [[U.S. Route 98 (Florida)|US 98]]/[[Florida State Road 80|State Road 80]].\n\n[[File:West PB FL Central Park HD US 1 SR&nbsp;805 south01.jpg|thumb|US 1 looking south just north of US 98/SR&nbsp;80]]\nAt Belvedere Road, it meets the northern end of State Road 5. In central West Palm Beach, it intersects [[Florida State Road 704|State Road 704]], where US 1 becomes a one way pair through the heart of West Palm Beach. A mile north of SR&nbsp;704, A1A begins running concurrent with US 1. At Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard, the one way pair ends for US 1, continuing north for 11 blocks, until it hits 23rd/25th street, becoming a one way pair for 4 blocks, as US 1 moves two blocks west as it moves north. US 1 leaves West Palm Beach and enters [[Riviera Beach, Florida|Riviera Beach]] via a bridge over the [[Port of Palm Beach]]. In Riviera Beach, US 1's concurrency with SR&nbsp;A1A ends at [[Florida State Road 708|State Road 708]]. In [[North Palm Beach, Florida|North Palm Beach]] it meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 850|State Road 850]] and [[Florida State Road 786|State Road 786]], where SR&nbsp;A1A becomes concurrent with US 1 for about 1.25 miles before splitting off at the southern end of [[Juno Beach, Florida|Juno Beach]]. In [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter]] it intersects [[Florida State Road 706|State Road 706]], and has another concurrency with SR&nbsp;A1A just south of the [[Jupiter Inlet]]. Entering [[Tequesta, Florida|Tequesta]] at the northern end of the inlet, US 1 then meets up with the northern terminus of the northern portion of SR&nbsp;811, and leaves Palm Beach County north of County Line Road.\n\n===Treasure Coast===\n[[File:Hobe Sound FL NWR US 1 south01.jpg|thumb|left|US 1, looking south from the entrance to the [[Hobe Sound National Wildlife Refuge]]]]\nAs US 1 makes its way into Martin County, it passes through [[Jonathan Dickinson State Park]] before crossing over the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] tracks. At the southern end of [[Hobe Sound, Florida|Hobe Sound]], A1A splits off onto its own route. The two roads parallel each other until [[Stuart, Florida|Stuart]]. Through the center of Hobe Sound it intersects County Road 708. It then leaves Hobe Sound and enters [[Port Salerno, Florida|Port Salerno]] before it enters the heart Stuart, where it intersects [[Florida State Road 714|State Road 714]] near SR&nbsp;714's eastern terminus at the northwestern end of [[Witham Field]]. SR&nbsp;714 ends less than a mile east at A1A. Through the center of Stuart it meets [[Florida State Road 76|State Road 76]]. US 1 then crosses a bridge over the [[St. Lucie River]]. North of the bridge it crosses over the Florida East Coast Railway tracks again and meets [[County Road 707 (Martin County, Florida)|County Road 707]]. Two miles north of the river, it leaves Stuart and enters [[Jensen Beach, Florida|Jensen Beach]], intersecting Jensen Beach Boulevard and passing by [[Treasure Coast Square]]. One and a half miles north of Treasure Coast Square, US 1 leaves Martin County.\n\n[[File:Ft Pierce FL Harbor Branch Center US 1 north01.jpg|thumb|US 1, looking north from the [[Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute]] entrance]]\nAs US 1 enters [[Saint Lucie County, Florida|St. Lucie County]] and [[Port Saint Lucie, Florida|Port Saint Lucie]], it first meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 716|Port Saint Lucie Boulevard]].

A few blocks north, US 1 returns to the shoreline of the Indian River and then intersects [[Florida State Road 508|State Road 508]], followed by [[Florida State Road 507|State Road 507]], with US 1 veering away from the Indian River and crossing the Elbow Creek Bridge.\n\nIn 2016, an average of 52,460 vehicles daily transited US 1, between Sarno Road and Eau Gallie Boulevard.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Rick | last=Neale | title=Melbourne leaders to add Sarno Road turn lane and U.S. 1 | url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/2017/02/17/melbourne-leaders-add-sarno-road-turn-lane-us-1/98004942/| newspaper=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida| pages= 3A | date=February 20, 2017 | accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJust north of the Elbow Creek Bridge, it enters the [[Eau Gallie, Florida|Eau Gallie]] portion of Melbourne, and intersects [[Florida State Road 518|State Road 518]]. It then enters [[Palm Shores, Florida|Palm Shores]], another portion of Melbourne, leaving it just south of [[Florida State Road 404|State Road 404]], the Pineda Causeway.  {{convert|1.8|mi|km}} north of the intersection is the community of [[Pineda, Florida|Pineda]].\n\nIn [[Rockledge, Florida|Rockledge]], US 1 intersects with [[County Road 515 (Brevard County, Florida)|CR 515]] and the [[Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway]] follows that road for {{convert|14|mi|km}}, as US 1 stays a few blocks west of the river. North of Rockledge, it enters [[Cocoa, Florida|Cocoa]], running through Historic Cocoa Village on the west side, and intersecting [[Florida State Road 520|State Road 520]]. North of Cocoa, it intersects [[Florida State Road 528|State Road 528]], the lone expressway US 1 crosses in Brevard County. In Brentwood Heights, US 1 intersects [[County Road 515 (Brevard County, Florida)|CR 515]] again, with US 1 resuming its status as the [[Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway]]. US 1 continues north to [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]], first intersecting with [[Florida State Road 405|State Road 405]], with east SR&nbsp;405 leading to [[NASA Parkway]] and the main entrance of the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island]]. Still in Titusville, it intersects [[Florida State Road 50|State Road 50]]. Now in central Titusville, US 1 intersects SR&nbsp;405 again, and [[Florida State Road 406|State Road 406]], where the [[Indian River Lagoon Scenic Highway]] ends on US 1 and proceeds onto east SR&nbsp;406. North of Titusville, US 1 steers away from the Indian River and travels in a parallel direction with [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] from here to the [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia County]] line. In [[Scottsmoor, Florida|Scottsmoor]], just south of the Volusia County line, it intersects [[County Road 5A (Brevard County, Florida)|CR 5A]], a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} [[spur route]] of the road itself.\n\n===Volusia County===\n[[File:Oak Hill FL US 1 north01.jpg|thumb|left|US 1, looking north from the median, in Oak Hill]]\nThe road enters Volusia County just north of Scottsmoor, where US 1 branches away from I-95 and in a northeast direction towards the coast. At the intersection of [[Florida State Road 3|State Road 3]] in [[Oak Hill, Florida|Oak Hill]], US 1 turns north, aligned with the coast. US 1 continues through central Oak Hill, intersecting County Road 4164. US 1 then continues north to [[Edgewater, Volusia County, Florida|Edgewater]], where it meets with [[State Road 442 (Florida)|SR&nbsp;442]], and meets with County Road 4136 (Park Avenue) before leaving Edgewater. In [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida|New Smyrna Beach]], it crosses under [[Florida State Road 44|State Road 44]] and [[County Road A1A (Volusia County, Florida)|CR A1A]], starting another concurrency with SR&nbsp;A1A. It continues through central New Smyrna Beach, passing by the [[New Smyrna Beach Municipal Airport]], and leaving the town via a crossing of Spruce Creek and Rose Bay, entering [[Allandale, Florida|Allandale]]. A few blocks north of the creek, US 1 intersects [[Florida State Road 5A|State Road 5A]], a bypass running north to Ormond Beach. Now in [[Port Orange, Florida|Port Orange]], US 1 runs through the core of the town, intersecting [[Florida State Road 421|State Road 421]]/[[Florida State Road A1A|State Road A1A]], ending another concurrency with SR&nbsp;A1A. A1A connects to the barrier island via the [[Port Orange Causeway]].\n\nUS 1 then enters [[South Daytona, Florida|South Daytona]], with intersections with Reed Canal Road and Big Tree Road. It then enters [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], locally known as Ridgewood Avenue as it runs through the central part of the town. US 1's journey through Daytona Beach begins with an intersection with [[Florida State Road 400|SR&nbsp;400]], which will become unsigned on [[Interstate 4]] west of I-95. Through Daytona Beach, US 1 provides access to four bridges crossing to the [[barrier island]]; the Memorial Bridge, followed by the [[Broadway Bridge (Daytona Beach)|Carlton Blank Bridge]], which carries [[U.S. Highway 92 (Florida)|US 92]], the Main Street Bridge and the Seabreeze Bridge. It crosses [[State Road 430 (Florida)|SR&nbsp;430]] before leaving Daytona Beach and entering [[Holly Hill, Florida|Holly Hill]]. In Holly Hill, it intersects County Road 4019 (LPGA Boulevard/11th Street), which is home to the [[LPGA]] [[headquarters]].\n\nIt then enters the city of [[Ormond Beach, Florida|Ormond Beach]], where US 1 is known and Younge Street, intersecting [[Florida State Road 40|State Road 40]], and running parallel with County Road 4079. As US 1 heads northwest, it then intersects [[Florida State Road 5A|State Road 5A]], the northern end of the bypass. It then crosses the [[Tomoka River]] before leaving Ormond Beach. A few miles northwest, it then meets [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]], passing through some hotels and fast food restaurants as it crosses under the interstate. US 1 leaves Volusia County west of I-95.\n\n===Flagler County===\nUS 1 runs west of I-95 throughout its journey in Flagler County, running in a northwest direction. The first major intersection in the county is with Old Dixie Highway in [[Korona, Florida|Korona]]. From there, it enters [[Dupont, Florida|Dupoint]], intersecting County Road 304, followed by Belle Terre Parkway. It then enters [[Bunnell, Florida|Bunnell]], where it's known as State Street, with an intersection of [[State Road 11 (Florida)|SR&nbsp;11]]/[[Florida State Road 100|State Road 100]], with a brief concurrency with SR&nbsp;100. The SR&nbsp;100 concurrency ends with an intersection with [[Florida State Road 20|State Road 20]]/State Road 100. North of Bunnell, US 1 intersects [[Old Dixie Highway]] (County Road 13). US 1 then straddles the western end of [[Palm Coast, Florida|Palm Coast]], with an intersection with Palm Coast Parkway (County Road 1424) near the northern end of the city, providing access to [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]]. Before leaving Palm Coast, it intersects Old Kings Road, and then leaves Flagler County via a crossing of the Pellicer Creek bridge.\n\n===St. Johns County===\nUS 1 enters St. Johns county at the northern end of Pellicer Creek, and quickly intersects with County Road 204 just south of the [[Interstate 95 in Florida|Interstate 95]] interchange. At the I-95 interchange, US 1 stays east of the interstate, and heads into an undeveloped area. At [[Florida State Road 206|State Road 206]], The road is slightly more developed, as US 1 heads towards [[St. Augustine Shores, Florida|St. Augustine Shores]], followed by [[St. Augustine South, Florida|St. Augustine South]] at the crossing of Moultrie Creek. It then enters   [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], first intersecting with [[Florida State Road 312|State Road 312]], followed by [[Florida State Road 207|State Road 207]], where US 1 is now known as Ponce De Leon Boulevard. Heading north, it intersects [[U.S. Highway 1 Business (St. Augustine, Florida)|US 1 Business]], known locally as King Street, and a tourist route through Old St. Augustine. Just north of the intersection, it crosses the San Sebastian River, and then straddles on the eastern riverbed. At the northern end of St. Augustine, it intersects [[Florida State Road 16|State Road 16]], followed by US 1 Business five blocks later. After leaving St. Augustine, it passes by the western end of the [[Northeast Florida Regional Airport]], and cuts through wetlands to [[Durbin, Florida|Durbin]]. At the northernmost intersection with [[County Road 210 (St. Johns County, Florida)|County Road 210]] at Race Track Road, US 1 crosses the Duval County line and enters Jacksonville.\n\n===Duval County===\n{{see also|Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway (Jacksonville)}}\nFrom [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]], US 1 starts its journey through [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] and Jacksonville at Race Track Road, where it becomes the Philips Highway, a {{convert|17|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} section of US 1 south of [[Downtown Jacksonville]] named after Judge Henry Bethune Philips, the first chairman of the ''State Road Board'', predecessor of the [[Florida Department of Transportation]].<ref>{{cite news|last = Kerr |first = Jessie-Lynne |url = http://jacksonville.com/opinion/blog/402032/jessie-lynne-kerr/2010-06-02/how-philips-highway-got-its-name |title = How Philips Highway got its name |work = Florida Times-Union |date = June 2, 2010}}</ref>  It heads north through the sparsely developed sections of southeast [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], intersecting the future [[Interstate 795 (Florida)|Interstate 795]] interchange, followed by Old St. Augustine Road in [[Bayard, Jacksonville, Florida|Bayard]]. It continues northwest, intersecting Greenland Road and [[Interstate 295 (Florida)|Interstate 295]] East Beltway. North of I-295, US 1 enters a commercial area with multiple furniture stores, with an intersection with [[Florida State Road 115|State Road 115]]. A 1/2 mile northwest is an interchange with I-95.\n\nA few miles north, US 1 intersects Sunbeam Road (County Road 116), which connects to [[Florida State Road 13|State Road 13]]. It then heads to [[Florida State Road 152|State Road 152]], locally known as Baymeadows Road. As US 1 heads towards the heart of Jacksonville, it intersects with [[Florida State Road 202|State Road 202]], locally known as JTB Boulevard, a freeway through eastern Jacksonville. US 1 then heads towards Bowden Road, providing access to southbound I-95, followed one block later by [[Florida State Road 109|State Road 109]], locally known as University Boulevard. A few miles north, it intersects Emerson Street, signed as [[U.S. Highway 1 Alternate (Jacksonville, Florida)|U.S. Highway 1 Alternate]] to the east and  [[Florida State Road 126|State Road 126]] to the west. It then intersects St. Augustine Road and Philips Highway ends at I-95 exit 348.\n\n[[File:Main Street Bridge Jacksonville southbound approach.jpg|thumb|left|[[Main Street Bridge (Jacksonville)|Main Street Bridge]] from [[Downtown Jacksonville]] ]]\nNorth of Philips Highway, US 1 continues as Kings Avenue, running within a block of I-95. One block north of I-95, it intersects [[U.S. Route 90 (Florida)|U.S. Route 90]], and starts a concurrency as the two highways head north. After crossing under I-95, the road intersects [[Florida State Road 13|State Road 13]] twice, heading towards the [[Main Street Bridge (Jacksonville)|Main Street Bridge]], crossing the [[St. Johns River]]. North of the bridge, the road becomes a [[one-way pair]], named Ocean Street northbound and Main Street southbound. It then intersects [[Florida State Road 228|State Road 228]], starting a concurrency. Several blocks north, it ends the US 90 concurrency and begins a concurrency with US 90 Alternate. It then intersects with [[Florida State Road 115|State Road 115]], and the national southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 23 (Florida)|U.S. Route 23]]. It also ends the concurrencies of US 90 Alternate and SR&nbsp;228. It also starts a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 17 (Florida)|U.S. Route 17]]. At that point, the one-way pair ends, and US 1 leaves downtown as Main Street. It then intersects US 1 Alternate, and the road heads west on the [[Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway (Jacksonville)|Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway]], ending the concurrency with US 17, which heads north. At this point, US 1 changes its unsigned state road from SR&nbsp;5 to [[Florida State Road 15|State Road 15]].\n\nU.S. 1 then intersects I-95 one last time on a cloverleaf interchange on exit 354A; the two highways will not meet again until Virginia. U.S. 1 continues west, with the parkway ending with an intersection of [[U.S. Route 23 (Florida)|U.S. Route 23]], which US 1 shares a concurrency with from here to the Georgia state line. The road continues northwest, intersecting [[Florida State Road 111|State Road 111]], and crossing the [[Ribault River]] just north of that intersection. US 1 then intersects [[Florida State Road 115A|State Road 115A]]. Just south of the I-295 West Beltway, it passes west of the Little Trout River. It then has an interchange with the I-295 West Beltway, followed by an intersection with Trout River Boulevard. US 1 then crosses the [[Trout River (Florida)|Trout River]], a [[tributary]] of the [[St. Johns River]], and intersects [[Florida State Road 104|State Road 104]] immediately north of the river. The road then heads towards the Thomas Creek Conversation Area, leaving Duval County at the Thomas Creek Bridge.\n\n===Nassau County===\nNorth of the Thomas Creek Conservation Area, it enters Nassau County, and [[Nassau Village-Ratliff, Florida|Nassau Village-Ratliff]]. It next heads to [[Callahan, Florida|Callahan]], where it intersects with [[Florida State Road 115|State Road 115]]. At the center part of town, it intersects the northern terminus of [[Florida State Road A1A|State Road A1A]] and [[Florida State Road 200|State Road 200]], as well as starting a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 301 (Florida)|U.S. Route 301]] that continues beyond the Georgia state line. Just north of Callahan, US 1 intersects County Road 115. US 1 heads north towards [[Hilliard, Florida|Hilliard]], which contains an intersection with [[County Road 108 (Nassau County, Florida)|CR 108]]. Heading north towards Georgia, it passes by a [[welcome center]] on the southbound side in [[Boulogne, Florida|Boulogne]], followed by an intersection with [[County Road 121 (Nassau County, Florida)|CR 121]]/Lake Hampton Road, the last intersection before US 1 crosses the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Marys River]] and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] state line.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Historical US&nbsp;1 route markers\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = US 1 Florida 1926.svg\n| alt1      = US 1 route marker\n| caption1  = 1926 design\n| image2    = US 1 Florida 1948.svg\n| alt2      = US 1 route marker\n| caption2  = 1948 design\n| image3= US 1 (FL).svg\n| alt3= US 1 route marker\n| caption3 =1956-1993, red highway shields\n| image4    = US 1.svg\n| alt4      = US 1 route marker\n| caption4  = Modern design\n}}\nUS 1 was designated nationwide on November 11, 1926, running from [[Miami, Florida]], north to [[Fort Kent, Maine]].<ref>{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth298433/m1/1/zoom/ |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[University of North Texas Libraries]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref> The label was generally applied to the [[Atlantic Highway (United States)|Atlantic Highway]], except between [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and [[Augusta, Georgia]], where a more inland route was chosen. In Florida, US 1 was designated along the full length of [[Florida State Road 4 (pre-1945)|SR&nbsp;4]]. South of Jacksonville, this was both the Atlantic Highway and the eastern division of the [[Dixie Highway]]; the route from Jacksonville northwest into Georgia was a Jacksonville\u2013[[Macon, Georgia]] Dixie Highway connector.\n\n[[File:Photograph of a road sign along the highway in Key West, Florida, announcing the beginning of U.S. Route 1 to Fort... - NARA - 200542.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of US 1 as of March 1951]]\nWith the [[Overseas Highway]] completed in 1938, US 1 was extended from Miami over the [[Overseas Highway]] (SR&nbsp;4A) to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] shortly afterward, where it still ends today.\n\nThe section of US 1 between Miami and Jacksonville has been replaced by [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] for most through traffic.\n\nIn Florida, where signs for U.S. Highways formerly had different colors for each highway, the \"shield\" for US 1 was red. Florida began using the colored shields in 1956, but during the 1980s the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] was revised to specify only a black and white color scheme for [[U.S. Highway shield]]s. As such, Federal funds were no longer available to maintain the colored signs. On August 27, 1993, the decision was made to no longer produce colored signs. Since then, the remaining colored signs have been replaced gradually by black-and-white signs.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{for|a complete list of intersections and bridges in the [[Florida Keys]]|Overseas Highway}}{{jcttop|state=FL|length_ref=<ref name=sld>[http://www2.dot.state.fl.us/Straight-linesOnlineGIS/ FDOT straight line diagrams], accessed January 2014</ref>}}\n{{FLint\n|county=Monroe\n|cspan=20\n|location=Key West\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.000\n|road=Fleming Street\n|notes=Southern terminus\n}}\n{{FLint\n|mile=3.927\n|road={{jct|state=FL|SR|A1A|dir1=south|name1=Roosevelt Boulevard|location1=[[Key West International Airport|Airport]]|extra=airport|location2=Beaches}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Key West segment of SR&nbsp;A1A\n}}\n<!--4.531=0-->\n{{FLint\n|location=Stock Island<!--looks like the Key West city limits are the north ROW line-->\n|mile=4.586\n|road=MacDonald Drive\n|notes=Former [[Florida State Road 4A (pre-1945)|SR&nbsp;4A]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Boca Chica Key\n|mile=8.08\n|road=[[Naval Air Station Key West]]\n|notes=Interchange\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=East Rockland Key\n|mile=9.183\n|road=Rockland Drive&nbsp;\u2013 [[NAS Key West|NAS]] Truck Entrance\n|notes=Former US&nbsp;1 south\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Big Coppitt Key\n|mile=10.691\n|road=Boca Chica Road ([[County Road 941 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;941]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;941 (former [[Florida State Road 941|SR&nbsp;941]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Lower Sugarloaf Key\n|mile=16.955\n|road=Sugarloaf Boulevard ([[County Road 939 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;939]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;939 (former [[Florida State Road 939|SR&nbsp;939]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Sugarloaf Key\n|mile=19.970\n|road=State Road 939B<!--yes, that's the street name--> ([[County Road 939 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;939]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;939 (former SR&nbsp;939)\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Summerland Key\n|mile=25.197\n|road=East Shore Drive ([[County Road 942 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;942]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;942 (former [[Florida State Road 942|SR&nbsp;942]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Big Pine Key\n|mile=30.527\n|road=Key Deer Boulevard ([[County Road 940 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;940]] north)&nbsp;\u2013 [[National Key Deer Visitor Center]]\n|notes=Southern terminus of CR&nbsp;940 (former [[Florida State Road 940|SR&nbsp;940]])\n}}<!--31.079=0-->\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Bahia Honda Channel]]\n|mile=35.272\n|mile2=36.544\n|bridge=[[Bahia Honda Bridge]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Moser Channel]]\n|mile=40.011\n|mile2=46.804\n|bridge=[[Seven Mile Bridge]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Marathon\n|lspan=2\n|mile=48.059\n|road={{jct|state=FL|CR|931|county1=Monroe|dir1=north|name1=20th Street}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of CR&nbsp;931 (former [[Florida State Road 931|SR&nbsp;931]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|mile=49.965\n|road=Sombrero Beach Road ([[County Road 931 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;931]] south)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sombrero Beach]]\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;931 (former SR&nbsp;931)\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Long Key Channel]]\n|mile=63.140\n|mile2=65.446\n|bridge=[[Long Key Bridge]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Islamorada\n|lspan=4\n|mile=84.344\n|road={{jct|state=FL|CR|905|county1=Monroe|dir1=north}}<!--no CR&nbsp;905 shields, but it's the street name-->\n|notes=Former SR&nbsp;4A;

As Biscayne Boulevard, US 1 becomes a one-way pair at an intersection with [[Florida State Road 970|State Road 970]]. Two blocks north, it reaches [[Florida State Road 968|State Road 968]] (Flagler Street), the north\u2013south baseline for most of Miami-Dade County. US 1 then passes by the western end of [[Bayfront Park]], and then intersects Port Boulevard (NE 6th Street), providing access to the [[Port of Miami]], with the [[American Airlines Arena]] at the northeastern end of the intersection. For the next few blocks, it passes by [[Bicentennial Park (Miami)|Bicentennial Park]], with [[Interstate 395 (Florida)|Interstate 395]] at the northern end, which also marks the national southern terminus of US 41. US 1 continues through midtown Miami, intersecting with the national southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|U.S. Route 27]] one block south of [[Interstate 195 (Florida)|Interstate 195]] next to the Julia Tuttle Causeway. North of I-195, the road continues through Miami as a residential road, intersecting [[Florida State Road 944|State Road 944]], [[Florida State Road 934|State Road 934]], and [[Florida State Road 915|State Road 915]] before leaving Miami. Moving further inland, the Boulevard replaces East Sixth Avenue at 61st Street. It enters the village of [[Miami Shores, Florida|Miami Shores]] at North 87th Street. Crossing the Biscayne Canal, Miami Shores becomes [[North Miami, Florida|North Miami]]. In North Miami, it intersects [[Florida State Road 922|State Road 922]], leading to the Broad Causeway and [[Florida State Road 916|State Road 916]]. In [[North Miami Beach, Florida|North Miami Beach]], it intersects [[Florida State Road 826|State Road 826]], and [[Florida State Road 860|State Road 860]]. The road enters [[Aventura, Florida|Aventura]] at [[Greynolds Park]]. It continues north-northeast through the city of Aventura, curving due north at North 187th Street and northeast at North 203rd Street. In Aventura, it intersects [[Florida State Road 856|State Road 856]] at the southwest of the [[Aventura Mall]], and after intersecting the former [[Florida State Road 854|State Road 854]], it leaves Miami-Dade County.\n\n===Broward County===\n[[File:Ft Laud FL New River Tunnel north01.jpg|thumb|New River Tunnel, going north]]\nEntering [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] near [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]], US 1 first intersects [[Florida State Road 858|State Road 858]]. Next it meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 824|State Road 824]], which provides access to [[Miramar, Florida|Miramar]] and [[Pembroke Pines, Florida|Pembroke Pines]]. Entering [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]], US 1 intersects [[Florida State Road 820|State Road 820]] in a [[traffic circle]] around Anniversary Park. In [[Dania Beach, Florida|Dania Beach]], it meets [[Florida State Road 822|State Road 822]] and [[Florida State Road 848|State Road 848]]. Here [[Florida State Road A1A|State Road A1A]] also begins running concurrently with the road just south of [[Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport]] for a few miles. Near the southeastern corner of the airport, US 1 meets the eastern terminus of [[Florida State Road 818|State Road 818]]. It then proceeds to run around the eastern edge of the airport. On the northeastern corner, US 1 meets [[Interstate 595 (Florida)|I-595]].

In Florida, US 1 was designated along the full length of [[Florida State Road 4 (pre-1945)|SR&nbsp;4]]. South of Jacksonville, this was both the Atlantic Highway and the eastern division of the [[Dixie Highway]]; the route from Jacksonville northwest into Georgia was a Jacksonville\u2013[[Macon, Georgia]] Dixie Highway connector.\n\n[[File:Photograph of a road sign along the highway in Key West, Florida, announcing the beginning of U.S. Route 1 to Fort... - NARA - 200542.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of US 1 as of March 1951]]\nWith the [[Overseas Highway]] completed in 1938, US 1 was extended from Miami over the [[Overseas Highway]] (SR&nbsp;4A) to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]] shortly afterward, where it still ends today.\n\nThe section of US 1 between Miami and Jacksonville has been replaced by [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] for most through traffic.\n\nIn Florida, where signs for U.S. Highways formerly had different colors for each highway, the \"shield\" for US 1 was red.

As such, Federal funds were no longer available to maintain the colored signs. On August 27, 1993, the decision was made to no longer produce colored signs. Since then, the remaining colored signs have been replaced gradually by black-and-white signs.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{for|a complete list of intersections and bridges in the [[Florida Keys]]|Overseas Highway}}{{jcttop|state=FL|length_ref=<ref name=sld>[http://www2.dot.state.fl.us/Straight-linesOnlineGIS/ FDOT straight line diagrams], accessed January 2014</ref>}}\n{{FLint\n|county=Monroe\n|cspan=20\n|location=Key West\n|lspan=2\n|mile=0.000\n|road=Fleming Street\n|notes=Southern terminus\n}}\n{{FLint\n|mile=3.927\n|road={{jct|state=FL|SR|A1A|dir1=south|name1=Roosevelt Boulevard|location1=[[Key West International Airport|Airport]]|extra=airport|location2=Beaches}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Key West segment of SR&nbsp;A1A\n}}\n<!--4.531=0-->\n{{FLint\n|location=Stock Island<!--looks like the Key West city limits are the north ROW line-->\n|mile=4.586\n|road=MacDonald Drive\n|notes=Former [[Florida State Road 4A (pre-1945)|SR&nbsp;4A]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Boca Chica Key\n|mile=8.08\n|road=[[Naval Air Station Key West]]\n|notes=Interchange\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=East Rockland Key\n|mile=9.183\n|road=Rockland Drive&nbsp;\u2013 [[NAS Key West|NAS]] Truck Entrance\n|notes=Former US&nbsp;1 south\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Big Coppitt Key\n|mile=10.691\n|road=Boca Chica Road ([[County Road 941 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;941]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;941 (former [[Florida State Road 941|SR&nbsp;941]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Lower Sugarloaf Key\n|mile=16.955\n|road=Sugarloaf Boulevard ([[County Road 939 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;939]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;939 (former [[Florida State Road 939|SR&nbsp;939]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Sugarloaf Key\n|mile=19.970\n|road=State Road 939B<!--yes, that's the street name--> ([[County Road 939 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;939]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;939 (former SR&nbsp;939)\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Summerland Key\n|mile=25.197\n|road=East Shore Drive ([[County Road 942 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;942]] south)\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;942 (former [[Florida State Road 942|SR&nbsp;942]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Big Pine Key\n|mile=30.527\n|road=Key Deer Boulevard ([[County Road 940 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;940]] north)&nbsp;\u2013 [[National Key Deer Visitor Center]]\n|notes=Southern terminus of CR&nbsp;940 (former [[Florida State Road 940|SR&nbsp;940]])\n}}<!--31.079=0-->\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Bahia Honda Channel]]\n|mile=35.272\n|mile2=36.544\n|bridge=[[Bahia Honda Bridge]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Moser Channel]]\n|mile=40.011\n|mile2=46.804\n|bridge=[[Seven Mile Bridge]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Marathon\n|lspan=2\n|mile=48.059\n|road={{jct|state=FL|CR|931|county1=Monroe|dir1=north|name1=20th Street}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of CR&nbsp;931 (former [[Florida State Road 931|SR&nbsp;931]])\n}}\n{{FLint\n|mile=49.965\n|road=Sombrero Beach Road ([[County Road 931 (Monroe County, Florida)|CR&nbsp;931]] south)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Sombrero Beach]]\n|notes=Northern terminus of CR&nbsp;931 (former SR&nbsp;931)\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Long Key Channel]]\n|mile=63.140\n|mile2=65.446\n|bridge=[[Long Key Bridge]]\n}}\n{{FLint\n|location=Islamorada\n|lspan=4\n|mile=84.344\n|road={{jct|state=FL|CR|905|county1=Monroe|dir1=north}}<!--no CR&nbsp;905 shields, but it's the street name-->\n|notes=Former SR&nbsp;4A;

Poorly reviewed by critics, the film also [[Box-office bomb|flopped at the box office]]. Produced on a then high budget of $14 million, it earned a little over $13 million,<ref name=\"numbers\">[http://the-numbers.com/movies/series/Airport.php Airport - Box Office History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> thus ending the enormous financial success of the ''Airport'' films.\n\nThe film was directed by [[David Lowell Rich]].<ref name=\"The Concorde ...

Airport '79|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> The ensemble cast includes [[George Kennedy]], who appeared in all four films from the ''Airport'' series, [[Susan Blakely]], [[Alain Delon]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in main roles.  [[Mercedes McCambridge]] and [[Martha Raye]] have cameos. \n\n==Plot==\nKevin Harrison ([[Robert Wagner]]), a corrupt arms dealer, attempts to destroy an American-owned [[Concorde]] on its maiden flight after one of the passengers, reporter Maggie Whelan ([[Susan Blakely]]), learns of his weapons sales to communist countries during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe Concorde takes off from [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Captain Paul Metrand ([[Alain Delon]]) makes conversation with Isabelle ([[Sylvia Kristel]]), the purser. They land at [[Washington-Dulles International Airport|Dulles Airport]] outside [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nMaggie reports on the \"Goodwill\" flight on the Concorde the following day, which leads to a story of Harrison and his Buzzard [[surface-to-air missile]] project. A man named Carl Parker ([[Macon McCalman]]) shows up to Maggie with a claim about documentation of illegal arms deals, but is shot by an assailant who then chases Maggie throughout the house before a passerby triggers a fire alarm, scaring the assailant away.\n\nMaggie is told by Harrison someone is framing him. He sends Maggie off in a limo, then plots to have the Concorde's departure delayed and  the drone test reprogrammed.\n\nCapt. Joe Patroni ([[George Kennedy]]) joins Metrand aboard the Concorde, creating some doubt as to which pilot is in command. They are joined by Peter O'Neill ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]), the 2nd officer and flight engineer, who is living with a controlling girlfriend.\n\nHarrison surprises Maggie at the airline check-in desk to see her off. He asks if the documents showed up, but they have not. As he is walking away, Parker's wife ([[Kathleen Maguire]]) delivers the documents to Maggie as she steps into the mobile lounge. She looks them over and realizes that Harrison lied to her.\n\nThe Concorde takes off for Paris. Unbeknownst to the flight crew, an off-course  [[surface-to-air missile]]  is headed straight for them. At his company headquarters, Harrison tells his controllers to alert the government. The USAF scrambles [[F-15]] fighter jets to intercept the missile just as it locks onto the Concorde. After several evasive maneuvers by the passenger plane, an F-15 shoots down the missile before it collides with the Concorde.\n\nAs the Concorde is approaching the European coastline, an [[F-4 Phantom II]] sent by Harrison engages the Concorde as [[French Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage|Mirages]] scramble to help. The Concorde manages to evade the F-4's missiles, but the explosion of one of them damages the plane's hydraulic system. The Mirages shoot down the F-4 and the Concorde continues to Paris, although to Le Bourget airport instead of Charles de Gaulle. The plane reaches the French coastline, landing with a damaged hydraulic system and just barely stopping at the last safety net. Metrand and Isabelle invite Patroni to dinner.\n\nHarrison promises Maggie to go public with the documents but attempts to bribe her into \"polishing\" his statement. After being paid by Harrison, a mechanic, Froelich ([[Jon Cedar]]), places a device in the Concorde's cargo door control unit, timed to open during flight.\n\nAs the passengers board, a well-dressed woman (played by [[Charo]]) attempts to smuggle a dog aboard. She is caught by an alert Isabelle and leaves. Froelich is in line at the security checkpoint when some of his money falls out of his pant leg. The X-ray technician attempts to return it, but Froelich pretends not to hear and runs off panicked. On the runway, where the Concorde is taking off, the aircraft's exhaust kills Froelich and scatters the money he received from Harrison.\n\nThe aircraft is en route to Moscow when the automatic device opens the cargo door. Metrand sees the carpet tear down the middle of the aisle, signifying the fuselage is under tremendous stress and the aircraft is about to break apart. The cargo door is ripped off, extensively damaging the aircraft and ripping a segment of the floor as it spirals toward the ground. The airline founder's seat lodges in the hole, acting as a plug. The pilots attempt to fly to [[Innsbruck]], Austria, for an emergency landing, but realize they are losing too much fuel and do not have enough to make it there. Metrand realizes they are flying towards a ski area he knows in the Alps; they could make a belly landing on a mountain-side.\n\nThe aircraft approaches the landing site while the ski patrol marks a runway. It lands successfully. While passengers are being rescued, Maggie gives a report of the accident to a news reporter and mentions a major story she is about to release. Harrison is seeing the newscast in his private plane and commits suicide. At the crash site, the last of the crew leaves the Concorde shortly before the fuselage caves in and explodes from the leaking fuel.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Alain Delon]] as Capt.

[[Mercedes McCambridge]] and [[Martha Raye]] have cameos. \n\n==Plot==\nKevin Harrison ([[Robert Wagner]]), a corrupt arms dealer, attempts to destroy an American-owned [[Concorde]] on its maiden flight after one of the passengers, reporter Maggie Whelan ([[Susan Blakely]]), learns of his weapons sales to communist countries during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe Concorde takes off from [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Captain Paul Metrand ([[Alain Delon]]) makes conversation with Isabelle ([[Sylvia Kristel]]), the purser. They land at [[Washington-Dulles International Airport|Dulles Airport]] outside [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nMaggie reports on the \"Goodwill\" flight on the Concorde the following day, which leads to a story of Harrison and his Buzzard [[surface-to-air missile]] project. A man named Carl Parker ([[Macon McCalman]]) shows up to Maggie with a claim about documentation of illegal arms deals, but is shot by an assailant who then chases Maggie throughout the house before a passerby triggers a fire alarm, scaring the assailant away.\n\nMaggie is told by Harrison someone is framing him. He sends Maggie off in a limo, then plots to have the Concorde's departure delayed and  the drone test reprogrammed.\n\nCapt. Joe Patroni ([[George Kennedy]]) joins Metrand aboard the Concorde, creating some doubt as to which pilot is in command. They are joined by Peter O'Neill ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]), the 2nd officer and flight engineer, who is living with a controlling girlfriend.\n\nHarrison surprises Maggie at the airline check-in desk to see her off. He asks if the documents showed up, but they have not. As he is walking away, Parker's wife ([[Kathleen Maguire]]) delivers the documents to Maggie as she steps into the mobile lounge. She looks them over and realizes that Harrison lied to her.\n\nThe Concorde takes off for Paris. Unbeknownst to the flight crew, an off-course  [[surface-to-air missile]]  is headed straight for them. At his company headquarters, Harrison tells his controllers to alert the government. The USAF scrambles [[F-15]] fighter jets to intercept the missile just as it locks onto the Concorde. After several evasive maneuvers by the passenger plane, an F-15 shoots down the missile before it collides with the Concorde.\n\nAs the Concorde is approaching the European coastline, an [[F-4 Phantom II]] sent by Harrison engages the Concorde as [[French Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage|Mirages]] scramble to help. The Concorde manages to evade the F-4's missiles, but the explosion of one of them damages the plane's hydraulic system. The Mirages shoot down the F-4 and the Concorde continues to Paris, although to Le Bourget airport instead of Charles de Gaulle. The plane reaches the French coastline, landing with a damaged hydraulic system and just barely stopping at the last safety net. Metrand and Isabelle invite Patroni to dinner.\n\nHarrison promises Maggie to go public with the documents but attempts to bribe her into \"polishing\" his statement. After being paid by Harrison, a mechanic, Froelich ([[Jon Cedar]]), places a device in the Concorde's cargo door control unit, timed to open during flight.\n\nAs the passengers board, a well-dressed woman (played by [[Charo]]) attempts to smuggle a dog aboard. She is caught by an alert Isabelle and leaves. Froelich is in line at the security checkpoint when some of his money falls out of his pant leg. The X-ray technician attempts to return it, but Froelich pretends not to hear and runs off panicked. On the runway, where the Concorde is taking off, the aircraft's exhaust kills Froelich and scatters the money he received from Harrison.\n\nThe aircraft is en route to Moscow when the automatic device opens the cargo door. Metrand sees the carpet tear down the middle of the aisle, signifying the fuselage is under tremendous stress and the aircraft is about to break apart. The cargo door is ripped off, extensively damaging the aircraft and ripping a segment of the floor as it spirals toward the ground. The airline founder's seat lodges in the hole, acting as a plug. The pilots attempt to fly to [[Innsbruck]], Austria, for an emergency landing, but realize they are losing too much fuel and do not have enough to make it there. Metrand realizes they are flying towards a ski area he knows in the Alps; they could make a belly landing on a mountain-side.\n\nThe aircraft approaches the landing site while the ski patrol marks a runway. It lands successfully. While passengers are being rescued, Maggie gives a report of the accident to a news reporter and mentions a major story she is about to release. Harrison is seeing the newscast in his private plane and commits suicide. At the crash site, the last of the crew leaves the Concorde shortly before the fuselage caves in and explodes from the leaking fuel.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alain Delon]] as Capt.

He prepared for a run in 1992 amidst a crowded field seeking to beat the incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush]]. In the aftermath of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Bush seemed unbeatable, but an economic [[recession]]\u2014which ultimately proved to be small by historical standards\u2014spurred the Democrats on. Tom Harkin won his native Iowa without much surprise. Clinton, meanwhile, was still a relatively unknown national candidate before the primary season when a woman named [[Gennifer Flowers]] appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/docs/flowers031398.htm |title=Declaration of Gennifer Flowers |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 13, 1998 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Clinton sought damage control by appearing on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' with his wife, [[Hillary Clinton]], for an interview with [[Steve Kroft]]. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts [[New Hampshire Democratic primary, 1992|won the primary in neighboring New Hampshire]] but Clinton's second-place finish \u2013 strengthened by Clinton's speech labeling himself \"The Comeback Kid\" \u2013 re-energized his campaign. Clinton swept nearly all of the Southern [[Super Tuesday|Super Tuesday primaries]], making him the solid front runner. Jerry Brown, however, began to run a surprising insurgent campaign, particularly through use of a 1-800 number to receive grassroots funding. Brown \"seemed to be the most left-wing and right-wing man in the field. [He] called for [[term limits]], a [[flat tax]], and the abolition of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].\"<ref name=Walker>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2009-11-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2009/nov/01/00012/ Five Faces of Jerry Brown], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut and Colorado and seemed poised to overtake Clinton.\n\nOn March 17, Tsongas left the race when he decisively lost both the [[Illinois]] and [[Michigan]] primaries to Clinton, with Brown as a distant third. Exactly one week later, Brown eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought [[Connecticut]] primary. Tsongas subsequently won the Delaware caucus two months later despite his withdrawal.  As the press focused on the primaries in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Wisconsin]], which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a serious [[gaffe]]: he announced to an audience of various leaders of [[New York City]]'s [[Jew]]ish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] as a vice presidential candidate. Jackson was still a [[Hymietown|controversial figure]] in that community and Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37-34), and dramatically in New York (41-26). In addition, his \"willingness to break with liberal orthodoxy on taxes led to denunciations from the party regulars, but by the end of the race he had been embraced by much of the Left.\"<ref name=Walker/>\n\nAlthough Brown continued to campaign in a number of states, he won no further primaries. Despite this, he still had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win in his home state of California would have deprived Clinton of sufficient support to win the nomination. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in the California primary by a margin of 47% to 40%.\n\n==The convention==\n{{Main|1992 Democratic National Convention}}\n\nThe convention met in [[New York City]], and the official tally was:\n\n* [[Bill Clinton]] 3,372\n* [[Jerry Brown]] 596\n* [[Paul Tsongas]] 209\n* [[Pennsylvania|Penn.]] Gov. [[Robert P. Casey]] 10\n* Rep. [[Pat Schroeder]] 8\n* [[Larry Agran]] 3\n* [[Ronald Daniels (politician)|Ron Daniels]] 1\n* [[Al Gore]] 1\n* Joe Simonetta 1\n\nClinton chose [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Al Gore|Albert A. Gore Jr.]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Tennessee]]) to be his running mate on July 9, 1992. Choosing Gore, who is from Clinton's neighboring state of [[Tennessee]], went against the popular strategy of balancing a Southern candidate with a Northern partner. Gore did serve to balance the ticket in other ways, as he was perceived as strong on foreign policy and environmental issues, while Clinton was not.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DB133DF933A25754C0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Clinton Selects Senator Gore Of Tennessee As Running Mate|work=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Gwen Ifill|first=Gwen|last=Ifill|date=1992-07-10|accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> Also, Gore's similarities to Clinton allowed him to really push some of his key campaign themes, such as centrism and generational change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Albert_Gore.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Albert A.

Brown did speak at the convention by seconding his own nomination.\n\nAnother additional [[1992 Democratic National Convention#Casey Controversy|controversy]] concerned Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert P. Casey|Bob Casey]], who sought a speaking slot at the convention but was not granted one. Casey complained that it was because of his outspoken pro-life views: he had warned the platform committee that Democrats were committing political suicide because of their support for abortion rights.<ref>''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution]]'' May 19, 1992 Page: A/8</ref> Clinton supporters have said that Casey was not allowed to speak because he had not endorsed the ticket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2008/08/the-myth-of-bob.html |title=The myth of Bob Casey's 1992 non-speech |publisher=Brendan Nyhan |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\n==Popular vote results==\nTotal popular vote number in primaries:<ref name=\"ourcampaigns.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55212 |title=US President - D Primaries Race - Feb 01, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n* [[Bill Clinton]] - 10,482,411 (52.01%)\n* [[Jerry Brown]] - 4,071,232 (20.20%)\n* [[Paul Tsongas]] - 3,656,010 (18.14%)\n* Unpledged - 750,873 (3.73%) \t\n* [[Bob Kerrey]] - 318,457 (1.58%)\n* [[Tom Harkin]] - 280,304 (1.39%)\n* [[Lyndon LaRouche]] - 154,599 (0.77%)\n* [[Eugene McCarthy]] - 108,678 (0.54%)\n* [[Charles Woods (Alabama)|Charles Woods]] - 88,948 (0.44%)\n* [[Larry Agran]] - 58,611 (0.29%)\n* [[Ross Perot]] - 54,755 (0.27%)\n* [[Ralph Nader]] - 35,935 (0.18%)\n* [[Louis Stokes]] - 29,983 (0.15%)\n* Angus Wheeler McDonald - 9,900 (0.05%)\n* J.

He prepared for a run in 1992 amidst a crowded field seeking to beat the incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush]]. In the aftermath of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Bush seemed unbeatable, but an economic [[recession]]\u2014which ultimately proved to be small by historical standards\u2014spurred the Democrats on. Tom Harkin won his native Iowa without much surprise. Clinton, meanwhile, was still a relatively unknown national candidate before the primary season when a woman named [[Gennifer Flowers]] appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/docs/flowers031398.htm |title=Declaration of Gennifer Flowers |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 13, 1998 |accessdate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Clinton sought damage control by appearing on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' with his wife, [[Hillary Clinton]], for an interview with [[Steve Kroft]]. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts [[New Hampshire Democratic primary, 1992|won the primary in neighboring New Hampshire]] but Clinton's second-place finish \u2013 strengthened by Clinton's speech labeling himself \"The Comeback Kid\" \u2013 re-energized his campaign. Clinton swept nearly all of the Southern [[Super Tuesday|Super Tuesday primaries]], making him the solid front runner. Jerry Brown, however, began to run a surprising insurgent campaign, particularly through use of a 1-800 number to receive grassroots funding. Brown \"seemed to be the most left-wing and right-wing man in the field. [He] called for [[term limits]], a [[flat tax]], and the abolition of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]].\"<ref name=Walker>[[Jesse Walker|Walker, Jesse]] (2009-11-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2009/nov/01/00012/ Five Faces of Jerry Brown], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut and Colorado and seemed poised to overtake Clinton.\n\nOn March 17, Tsongas left the race when he decisively lost both the [[Illinois]] and [[Michigan]] primaries to Clinton, with Brown as a distant third. Exactly one week later, Brown eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought [[Connecticut]] primary. Tsongas subsequently won the Delaware caucus two months later despite his withdrawal.  As the press focused on the primaries in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Wisconsin]], which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a serious [[gaffe]]: he announced to an audience of various leaders of [[New York City]]'s [[Jew]]ish community that, if nominated, he would consider the Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] as a vice presidential candidate. Jackson was still a [[Hymietown|controversial figure]] in that community and Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37-34), and dramatically in New York (41-26). In addition, his \"willingness to break with liberal orthodoxy on taxes led to denunciations from the party regulars, but by the end of the race he had been embraced by much of the Left.\"<ref name=Walker/>\n\nAlthough Brown continued to campaign in a number of states, he won no further primaries. Despite this, he still had a sizable number of delegates, and a big win in his home state of California would have deprived Clinton of sufficient support to win the nomination. After nearly a month of intense campaigning and multiple debates between the two candidates, Clinton managed to defeat Brown in the California primary by a margin of 47% to 40%.\n\n==The convention==\n{{Main|1992 Democratic National Convention}}\n\nThe convention met in [[New York City]], and the official tally was:\n\n* [[Bill Clinton]] 3,372\n* [[Jerry Brown]] 596\n* [[Paul Tsongas]] 209\n* [[Pennsylvania|Penn.]] Gov.

[[Pat Schroeder]] 8\n* [[Larry Agran]] 3\n* [[Ronald Daniels (politician)|Ron Daniels]] 1\n* [[Al Gore]] 1\n* Joe Simonetta 1\n\nClinton chose [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Al Gore|Albert A. Gore Jr.]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Tennessee]]) to be his running mate on July 9, 1992. Choosing Gore, who is from Clinton's neighboring state of [[Tennessee]], went against the popular strategy of balancing a Southern candidate with a Northern partner. Gore did serve to balance the ticket in other ways, as he was perceived as strong on foreign policy and environmental issues, while Clinton was not.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DB133DF933A25754C0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Clinton Selects Senator Gore Of Tennessee As Running Mate|work=[[The New York Times]]|authorlink=Gwen Ifill|first=Gwen|last=Ifill|date=1992-07-10|accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> Also, Gore's similarities to Clinton allowed him to really push some of his key campaign themes, such as centrism and generational change.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Albert_Gore.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Albert A.

Brown did speak at the convention by seconding his own nomination.\n\nAnother additional [[1992 Democratic National Convention#Casey Controversy|controversy]] concerned Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert P. Casey|Bob Casey]], who sought a speaking slot at the convention but was not granted one. Casey complained that it was because of his outspoken pro-life views: he had warned the platform committee that Democrats were committing political suicide because of their support for abortion rights.<ref>''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution|The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution]]'' May 19, 1992 Page: A/8</ref> Clinton supporters have said that Casey was not allowed to speak because he had not endorsed the ticket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2008/08/the-myth-of-bob.html |title=The myth of Bob Casey's 1992 non-speech |publisher=Brendan Nyhan |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\n==Popular vote results==\nTotal popular vote number in primaries:<ref name=\"ourcampaigns.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55212 |title=US President - D Primaries Race - Feb 01, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n* [[Bill Clinton]] - 10,482,411 (52.01%)\n* [[Jerry Brown]] - 4,071,232 (20.20%)\n* [[Paul Tsongas]] - 3,656,010 (18.14%)\n* Unpledged - 750,873 (3.73%) \t\n* [[Bob Kerrey]] - 318,457 (1.58%)\n* [[Tom Harkin]] - 280,304 (1.39%)\n* [[Lyndon LaRouche]] - 154,599 (0.77%)\n* [[Eugene McCarthy]] - 108,678 (0.54%)\n* [[Charles Woods (Alabama)|Charles Woods]] - 88,948 (0.44%)\n* [[Larry Agran]] - 58,611 (0.29%)\n* [[Ross Perot]] - 54,755 (0.27%)\n* [[Ralph Nader]] - 35,935 (0.18%)\n* [[Louis Stokes]] - 29,983 (0.15%)\n* Angus Wheeler McDonald - 9,900 (0.05%)\n* J.

The state highway runs {{convert|35.39|mi|km}} from [[Camp Peary]] near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] east to [[U.S. Route 258]] (US 258) at [[Fort Monroe]] in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]].  SR 143 is a major local thoroughfare on the [[Virginia Peninsula]] portion of the [[Hampton Roads]] metropolitan area.  The state highway is named Merrimac Trail through the [[independent city]] of Williamsburg and adjacent portions of [[York County, Virginia|York County]] and [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]].  SR 143 follows Jefferson Avenue through the city of [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] from the Williamsburg area past [[Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail]] to near [[Downtown Newport News, Virginia|Downtown Newport News]].  The state highway, which mostly runs northwest&ndash;southeast, heads northeast from Newport News, serving as one highway connecting the downtown areas of Newport News and Hampton.  SR 143 parallels both [[U.S. Route 60 in Virginia|US 60]] and [[Interstate 64 in Virginia|Interstate 64]] (I-64) extensively, and sometimes very closely, throughout its course.  The state highway also [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with US 60 in Hampton and with [[U.S. Route 17 in Virginia|US 17]] in Newport News.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:2017-07-05 18 02 21 View west along Virginia State Route 143 (Capitol Landing Road) at Virginia State Route 5 in Williamsburg, Virginia.jpg|thumb|right|View west along SR 143 at SR 5 in Williamsburg]]\nSR 143 begins at the entrance to Camp Peary in York County north of Williamsburg.  The state highway heads south as Merrimac Trail, a four-lane divided highway that meets I-64 at a [[partial cloverleaf]] interchange.  SR 143 heads south through a forested area and meets the northern end of [[Virginia State Route 132|SR 132]], which provides access to [[Colonial Williamsburg]] and, via [[Colonial Parkway]], [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]].  The state highway crosses Queen Creek into the city of Williamsburg and meets the northern end of [[Virginia State Route 5|SR 5]] (Capitol Landing Road).  East of the SR 5 intersection, SR 143 reduces to two lanes, crosses Colonial Parkway with no access, and re-enters York County by crossing an unnamed creek.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane at its intersection with [[Virginia State Route 162|SR 162]] (2nd Street).  The state highway heads southeast and enters James City County at its intersection with SR 641 (Penniman Road).  SR 143 begins to closely parallel the north side of [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Peninsula Subdivision]], which is itself paralleled by US 60 (Pocahontas Trail) to the south; the center turn lane becomes a turn lane exclusively for the eastbound direction of the highway.  The two highways have mirror-image partial cloverleaf interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 199|SR 199]] (Humelsine Parkway) as they re-enter York County.  SR 143 passes between Williamsburg Country Club to the north and [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] to the south; the state highway does not have access to the theme park.  Just east of the park, the westbound direction of the state highway receives an exit ramp from I-64.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 continues east into James City County as a four-lane undivided highway that closely parallels I-64 to the north and the railroad to the south while passing through a forested area.  The state highway receives a ramp from eastbound I-64 shortly before crossing Mill Run into the city of Newport News, where the highway's name changes to Jefferson Avenue.  Just east of the stream, there are ramps from eastbound SR 143 to eastbound I-64 and from westbound SR 143 to westbound I-64 as the state highway crosses to the north side of the Interstate.  SR 143 intersects [[Virginia State Route 238|SR 238]] (Yorktown Road), which provides access to and from I-64 in the direction of Hampton, near the [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]] area of the city.  The state highway passes through [[Newport News Park]] and crosses the Lee Hall Reservoir before intersection [[Virginia State Route 105|SR 105]] (Fort Eustis Boulevard) near [[Fort Eustis]].  The intersection is just east of SR 105's interchange with I-64; the ramps to and from westbound I-64 for access to SR 105 in the direction of Yorktown connect with SR 143 north and south of the interchange, respectively.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 veers away from I-64 and expands to a six-lane divided highway at Kings Ridge Drive.  The state highway intersects [[Virginia State Route 173|SR 173]] (Denbigh Boulevard) east of the [[Denbigh, Virginia|namesake community]] and north of Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, which is accessed by Bland Boulevard.  Southeast of the airport, SR 143 crosses to the south side of I-64 at a [[cloverleaf interchange]] adjacent to [[Patrick Henry Mall]].  The state highway intersects [[Virginia State Route 171|SR 171]] (Oyster Point Road) and passes through an industrial and commercial area that includes the [[Jefferson Lab]] (Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility) and the [[City Center at Oyster Point]].  South of the city center, SR 143 intersects J. Clyde Morris Boulevard, which heads northeast as part of US 17 toward Yorktown and west as [[Virginia State Route 312|SR 312]].  SR 143 and US 17 run concurrently southeast through junctions with [[Virginia State Route 306|SR 306]] (Harpersville Road) and [[Virginia State Route 152|SR 152]] (Main Street) before diverging at Mercury Boulevard, a major east&ndash;west thoroughfare that carries US 258 and provides access to the [[James River Bridge]].  This intersection is also the northern terminus of [[Virginia State Route 32|SR 32]].<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 becomes a four-lane undivided highway at 40th Street, which is used to access [[Virginia State Route 351|SR 351]] (39th Street).  SR 351 passes over SR 143 just to the north of SR 143's partial interchange with [[Interstate 664|I-664]] (Hampton Roads Beltway), which includes ramps from eastbound SR 143 to southbound I-664 and from northbound I-664 to SR 143.  The state highway becomes two lanes at 34th Street and maintains that profile southeast to 27th and 28th Streets, onto which the highway turns northeast as a [[one-way pair]], with eastbound following 27th Street and westbound using 28th Street.  This one-way pair is just north of US 60's one-way pair on 25th and 26th Streets.  The one-way pair ends at Salters Creek, where the highway comes together as a four-lane divided highway passes through a sliver of the city of Hampton.  SR 143 enters Hampton for good at Pear Avenue, where the highway continues as Victoria Boulevard.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 follows Victoria Boulevard through the [[Wythe (Hampton, Virginia)|Wythe]] and [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] neighborhoods of Hampton.  Within the latter neighborhood, the state highway intersects US 60; the state highway joins the U.S. Highway north on Kecoughtan Road then east on Settlers Landing Road.  The two highways meet the southern end of [[Virginia State Route 134|SR 134]] (Armistead Avenue) and head as a two-lane divided street through downtown Hampton, which contains [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Hampton, Virginia)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] and the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]].  SR 143 and US 60 become four lanes again to cross the [[Hampton River]] and pass along the northern edge of the campus of [[Hampton University]].  The two highways diverge at their [[diamond interchange]] with I-64 (Hampton Roads Beltway), which US 60 joins to cross [[Hampton Roads]] via the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].  SR 143 continues southeast along two-lane County Street, turns southwest onto Libby Street for one block, then turns south on Mellen Street and intersects [[Virginia State Route 169|SR 169]] (Mallory Street) within the [[Phoebus, Virginia|Phoebus]] neighborhood.  The state highway crosses the Mill Creek estuary as Ingalls Road and reaches its eastern terminus at its junction with US 258's (Mercury Boulevard) northern terminus at the entrance to Fort Monroe.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/>}}\n{{VAint\n|county=York\n|cspan=3\n|location=none\n|mile=0.00\n|road=[[Camp Peary]]\n}}\n{{VAint\n|location=none\n|mile=0.24\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64|city1=Newport News|city2=Richmond}}\n|notes=Exit 238 (I-64)\n}}\n{{VAint\n|location=none\n|mile=0.84\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|132|dir1=south|city1=Williamsburg<!--also signed Williamsburg Downtown-->|city2=Jamestown|location3=[[Yorktown, VA|Yorktown]] via [[Colonial Parkway]]|location4=[[Colonial Williamsburg Visitor Center]]}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city=Williamsburg\n|mile=1.43\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|5|dir1=west|name1=Capitol Landing Road}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of SR 5\n}}\n{{VAint\n|county=York\n|location=none\n|mile=\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|162|dir1=west|name1=Second Street|city1=Williamsburg<!--also signed Williamsburg Downtown-->|location2=[[Colonial Parkway]]|location3=[[Colonial Williamsburg Visitor Center]]}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of SR 162\n}}\n{{jctco|state=VA|county=James City}}\n{{VAint\n|county=York\n|cspan=2\n|location=none\n|mile=4.21\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|199|to2=to|US|60|I|64|city1=Newport News|city2=Richmond|city3=Yorktown|city4=Jamestown|location5=[[Busch Gardens Williamsburg|Busch Gardens]]|city6=Downtown Williamsburg|location7=[[Water Country USA]]|location8=[[Colonial Parkway]]<!--\"To Yorktown VIA PARKWAY\"-->|location9=[[Cheatham Annex]]}}\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{VAint\n|location=none\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64}}\n|notes=Exit 243B (I-64), access from I-64 to SR 143 westbound only\n}}\n{{jctco|state=VA|county=James City}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city=Newport News\n|lspan=13\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64|city1=Williamsburg|city2=Richmond|city3=Newport News|city4=Hampton}}\n|notes=Exit 247 (I-64); ramps from eastbound I-64 to SR 143, eastbound SR 143 to eastbound I-64, and westbound SR 143 to westbound I-64\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=10.27\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|238|to2=to|I|64|dir2=east|name1=Yorktown Road|city1=Lee Hall}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=12.82\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|105|name1=Fort Eustis Boulevard|I|64|to3=to|US|17|city1=Williamsburg|city2=Yorktown|location3=[[Fort Eustis]]|location4=[[Fort Eustis Transportation Museum]]}}\n|notes=Exit 250 (I-64); direct ramps between westbound I-64 and SR 143\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=15.85\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|173|name1=Denbigh Boulevard}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=17.84\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64|city1=Hampton|city2=Norfolk|city3=Williamsburg|city4=Richmond}}\n|notes=Exit 255 (I-64)\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=18.57\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|171|dir1=east|name1=Oyster Point Road|to2=to|I|64}}\n|notes=Western terminus of SR 171\n}}\n{{VAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=20.97\n|road={{jct|state=VA|US|17|dir1=north|SR|312|dir2=west|name2=J.

The state highway heads southeast and enters James City County at its intersection with SR 641 (Penniman Road).  SR 143 begins to closely parallel the north side of [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Peninsula Subdivision]], which is itself paralleled by US 60 (Pocahontas Trail) to the south; the center turn lane becomes a turn lane exclusively for the eastbound direction of the highway.  The two highways have mirror-image partial cloverleaf interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 199|SR 199]] (Humelsine Parkway) as they re-enter York County.  SR 143 passes between Williamsburg Country Club to the north and [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] to the south; the state highway does not have access to the theme park.  Just east of the park, the westbound direction of the state highway receives an exit ramp from I-64.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 continues east into James City County as a four-lane undivided highway that closely parallels I-64 to the north and the railroad to the south while passing through a forested area.  The state highway receives a ramp from eastbound I-64 shortly before crossing Mill Run into the city of Newport News, where the highway's name changes to Jefferson Avenue.  Just east of the stream, there are ramps from eastbound SR 143 to eastbound I-64 and from westbound SR 143 to westbound I-64 as the state highway crosses to the north side of the Interstate.  SR 143 intersects [[Virginia State Route 238|SR 238]] (Yorktown Road), which provides access to and from I-64 in the direction of Hampton, near the [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]] area of the city.  The state highway passes through [[Newport News Park]] and crosses the Lee Hall Reservoir before intersection [[Virginia State Route 105|SR 105]] (Fort Eustis Boulevard) near [[Fort Eustis]].  The intersection is just east of SR 105's interchange with I-64; the ramps to and from westbound I-64 for access to SR 105 in the direction of Yorktown connect with SR 143 north and south of the interchange, respectively.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 veers away from I-64 and expands to a six-lane divided highway at Kings Ridge Drive.  The state highway intersects [[Virginia State Route 173|SR 173]] (Denbigh Boulevard) east of the [[Denbigh, Virginia|namesake community]] and north of Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, which is accessed by Bland Boulevard.  Southeast of the airport, SR 143 crosses to the south side of I-64 at a [[cloverleaf interchange]] adjacent to [[Patrick Henry Mall]].  The state highway intersects [[Virginia State Route 171|SR 171]] (Oyster Point Road) and passes though an industrial and commercial area that includes the [[Jefferson Lab]] (Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility) and the [[City Center at Oyster Point]].  South of the city center, SR 143 intersects J. Clyde Morris Boulevard, which heads northeast as part of US 17 toward Yorktown and west as [[Virginia State Route 312|SR 312]].  SR 143 and US 17 run concurrently southeast through junctions with [[Virginia State Route 306|SR 306]] (Harpersville Road) and [[Virginia State Route 152|SR 152]] (Main Street) before diverging at Mercury Boulevard, a major east&ndash;west thoroughfare that carries US 258 and provides access to the [[James River Bridge]].  This intersection is also the northern terminus of [[Virginia State Route 32|SR 32]].<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 becomes a four-lane undivided highway at 40th Street, which is used to access [[Virginia State Route 351|SR 351]] (39th Street).  SR 351 passes over SR 143 just to the north of SR 143's partial interchange with [[Interstate 664|I-664]] (Hampton Roads Beltway), which includes ramps from eastbound SR 143 to southbound I-664 and from northbound I-664 to SR 143.  The state highway becomes two lanes at 34th Street and maintains that profile southeast to 27th and 28th Streets, onto which the highway turns northeast as a [[one-way pair]], with eastbound following 27th Street and westbound using 28th Street.  This one-way pair is just north of US 60's one-way pair on 25th and 26th Streets.  The one-way pair ends at Salters Creek, where the highway comes together as a four-lane divided highway passes through a sliver of the city of Hampton.  SR 143 enters Hampton for good at Pear Avenue, where the highway continues as Victoria Boulevard.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\nSR 143 follows Victoria Boulevard through the [[Wythe (Hampton, Virginia)|Wythe]] and [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] neighborhoods of Hampton.  Within the latter neighborhood, the state highway intersects US 60; the state highway joins the U.S. Highway north on Kecoughtan Road then east on Settlers Landing Road.  The two highways meet the southern end of [[Virginia State Route 134|SR 134]] (Armistead Avenue) and head as a two-lane divided street through downtown Hampton, which contains [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Hampton, Virginia)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] and the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]].  SR 143 and US 60 become four lanes again to cross the [[Hampton River]] and pass along the northern edge of the campus of [[Hampton University]].  The two highways diverge at their [[diamond interchange]] with I-64 (Hampton Roads Beltway), which US 60 joins to cross [[Hampton Roads]] via the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] to [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].  SR 143 continues southeast along two-lane County Street, turns southwest onto Libby Street for one block, then turns south on Mellen Street and intersects [[Virginia State Route 169|SR 169]] (Mallory Street) within the [[Phoebus, Virginia|Phoebus]] neighborhood.  The state highway crosses the Mill Creek estuary as Ingalls Road and reaches its eastern terminus at its junction with US 258's (Mercury Boulevard) northern terminus at the entrance to Fort Monroe.<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/><ref name=\"Google Maps VA 143\"/>\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=<ref name=\"VDOT Traffic Data\"/>}}\n{{VAint\n|county=York\n|cspan=3\n|location=none\n|mile=0.00\n|road=[[Camp Peary]]\n}}\n{{VAint\n|location=none\n|mile=0.24\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64|city1=Newport News|city2=Richmond}}\n|notes=Exit 238 (I-64)\n}}\n{{VAint\n|location=none\n|mile=0.84\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|132|dir1=south|city1=Williamsburg<!--also signed Williamsburg Downtown-->|city2=Jamestown|location3=[[Yorktown, VA|Yorktown]] via [[Colonial Parkway]]|location4=[[Colonial Williamsburg Visitor Center]]}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city=Williamsburg\n|mile=1.43\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|5|dir1=west|name1=Capitol Landing Road}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of SR 5\n}}\n{{VAint\n|county=York\n|location=none\n|mile=\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|162|dir1=west|name1=Second Street|city1=Williamsburg<!--also signed Williamsburg Downtown-->|location2=[[Colonial Parkway]]|location3=[[Colonial Williamsburg Visitor Center]]}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of SR 162\n}}\n{{jctco|state=VA|county=James City}}\n{{VAint\n|county=York\n|cspan=2\n|location=none\n|mile=4.21\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|199|to2=to|US|60|I|64|city1=Newport News|city2=Richmond|city3=Yorktown|city4=Jamestown|location5=[[Busch Gardens Williamsburg|Busch Gardens]]|city6=Downtown Williamsburg|location7=[[Water Country USA]]|location8=[[Colonial Parkway]]<!--\"To Yorktown VIA PARKWAY\"-->|location9=[[Cheatham Annex]]}}\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{VAint\n|location=none\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64}}\n|notes=Exit 243B (I-64), access from I-64 to SR 143 westbound only\n}}\n{{jctco|state=VA|county=James City}}\n{{VAint\n|indep_city=Newport News\n|lspan=13\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64|city1=Williamsburg|city2=Richmond|city3=Newport News|city4=Hampton}}\n|notes=Exit 247 (I-64); ramps from eastbound I-64 to SR 143, eastbound SR 143 to eastbound I-64, and westbound SR 143 to westbound I-64\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=10.27\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|238|to2=to|I|64|dir2=east|name1=Yorktown Road|city1=Lee Hall}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=12.82\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|105|name1=Fort Eustis Boulevard|I|64|to3=to|US|17|city1=Williamsburg|city2=Yorktown|location3=[[Fort Eustis]]|location4=[[Fort Eustis Transportation Museum]]}}\n|notes=Exit 250 (I-64); direct ramps between westbound I-64 and SR 143\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=15.85\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|173|name1=Denbigh Boulevard}}\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=17.84\n|road={{jct|state=VA|I|64|city1=Hampton|city2=Norfolk|city3=Williamsburg|city4=Richmond}}\n|notes=Exit 255 (I-64)\n}}\n{{VAint\n|mile=18.57\n|road={{jct|state=VA|SR|171|dir1=east|name1=Oyster Point Road|to2=to|I|64}}\n|notes=Western terminus of SR 171\n}}\n{{VAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=20.97\n|road={{jct|state=VA|US|17|dir1=north|SR|312|dir2=west|name2=J.

For the early tasks that humans wanted computers to accomplish, it was possible to create algorithms that enabled the machine to execute all the steps needed to solve the problem in hand. So on the computer's part, no learning was needed.  For certain advanced tasks,  facial recognition for example, it is not easy to create the needed algorithms, partly as it's not easy for humans to precisely define how we recognise faces.  Abundant face related data exists however. So far, compared to the difficulty in directly creating the required algorithms,  it's turned out in practice to be easier to assist computers to learn themselves how to recognise faces from available data. The discipline of machine learning develops various approaches for computers to learn to accomplish tasks for which no algorithm exists.<ref name = \"Alpaydin2020\">{{cite book\n | author = Ethem Alpaydin \n | title =Introduction to Machine Learning\n | year = 2020\n | edition = Fourth\n | pages = xix, 1-3, 13-18\n | publisher = [[MIT]]\n |ISBN = 0262043793\n }}</ref><ref name=\"elements\"/>\n\n=== Machine learning approaches ===\n{{Anchor|Algorithm types}}\nEarly classifications for machine learning approaches sometimes divided them into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system. These were:\n<br/>[[Supervised learning]]:  The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] inputs to outputs.\n<br/>[[Unsupervised learning]]:  No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end ([[feature learning]]).\n<br/>[[Reinforcement learning]]:  A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as [[Autonomous car|driving a vehicle]] or playing a game against an opponent) As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise. <ref name=\"bishop2006\"/>\n\nOther approaches or processes have since developed that don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.

In the early days of AI as an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]], some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"[[neural network]]s\"; these were mostly [[perceptron]]s and [[ADALINE|other models]] that were later found to be reinventions of the [[generalized linear model]]s of statistics.<ref>{{cite citeseerx |last1=Sarle |first1=Warren |title=Neural Networks and statistical models |citeseerx=10.1.1.27.699 |year=1994}}</ref> [[Probability theory|Probabilistic]] reasoning was also employed, especially in automated [[medical diagnosis]].<ref name=\"aima\">{{cite AIMA|edition=2}}</ref>{{rp|488}}\n\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the [[GOFAI|logical, knowledge-based approach]] caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|488}} By 1980, [[expert system]]s had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.<ref name=\"changing\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Langley | first1 = Pat| title = The changing science of machine learning | doi = 10.1007/s10994-011-5242-y | journal = [[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]]| volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 275\u2013279 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to [[inductive logic programming]], but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in [[pattern recognition]] and [[information retrieval]].<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|708\u2013710; 755}} Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and [[computer science]] around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"[[connectionism]]\", by researchers from other disciplines including [[John Hopfield|Hopfield]], [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] and [[Geoff Hinton|Hinton]]. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of [[backpropagation]].<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|25}}\n\nMachine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the [[symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic approaches]] it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and [[probability theory]].<ref name=\"changing\" /> As of 2019, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a sub field of AI. Yet some practitioners, for example Dr Daniel Hulme, who both teaches AI and  runs a company operating in the field, argues that machine learning and AI are separate. <ref name=\"elements\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://course.elementsofai.com/\n|title= The Elements of AI\n|publisher= [[University of Helsinki]]\n|date = Dec 2019\n|accessdate=7 April 2020}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.techworld.com/tech-innovation/satalia-ceo-no-one-is-doing-ai-optimisation-can-change-that-3775689/\n|title= Satalia CEO Daniel Hulme has a plan to overcome the limitations of machine learning\n|publisher= [[Techworld]]\n|date = October 2019\n|accessdate=7 April 2020}}\n</ref><ref name = \"Alpaydin2020\"/>\n\n=== Relation to data mining ===\nMachine learning and [[data mining]] often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on ''known'' properties learned from the training data, [[data mining]] focuses on the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of (previously) ''unknown'' properties in the data (this is the analysis step of [[knowledge discovery]] in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, [[ECML PKDD]] being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to ''reproduce known'' knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously ''unknown'' knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n\n=== Relation to optimization ===\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some [[loss function]] on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Le Roux |first1=Nicolas |first2=Yoshua |last2=Bengio |first3=Andrew |last3=Fitzgibbon |title=Improving First and Second-Order Methods by Modeling Uncertainty |encyclopedia=Optimization for Machine Learning |year=2012 |page=404 |editor1-last=Sra |editor1-first=Suvrit |editor2-first=Sebastian |editor2-last=Nowozin |editor3-first=Stephen J. |editor3-last=Wright |publisher=MIT Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JPQx7s2L1A8C&pg=PA403&dq=\"Improving+First+and+Second-Order+Methods+by+Modeling+Uncertainty|isbn=9780262016469 }}</ref>\n\n=== Relation to statistics ===\nMachine learning and [[statistics]] are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population [[Statistical inference|inferences]] from a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Danilo |last=Bzdok |first2=Naomi |last2=Altman |authorlink2=Naomi Altman |first3=Martin |last3=Krzywinski |title=Statistics versus Machine Learning |journal=[[Nature Methods]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=233\u2013234 |year=2018 |doi=10.1038/nmeth.4642 |pmid=30100822 |pmc=6082636 }}</ref> According to [[Michael I.

The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [[theoretical computer science]] known as [[computational learning theory]]. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The [[bias\u2013variance decomposition]] is one way to quantify generalization [[Errors and residuals|error]].\n\nFor the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to [[overfitting]] and generalization will be poorer.<ref name=\"alpaydin\">{{Cite book |author=Alpaydin, Ethem |title=Introduction to Machine Learning |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoma00alpa_0 |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |place=London |isbn=978-0-262-01243-0 |access-date=4 February 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in [[Time complexity#Polynomial time|polynomial time]]. There are two kinds of [[time complexity]] results.

Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\n\n== Approaches ==\n\n=== Types of learning algorithms ===\n\nThe types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach, the type of data they input and output, and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve.\n\n==== Supervised learning ====\n{{Main|Supervised learning}}\n[[File:Svm max sep hyperplane with margin.png|thumb|A [[support vector machine]] is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a [[linear classifier|linear boundary]].

Through iterative optimization of an [[Loss function|objective function]], supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mohri |first1=Mehryar |last2=Rostamizadeh |first2=Afshin |last3=Talwalkar |first3=Ameet |title=Foundations of Machine Learning |date=2012 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=9780262018258}}</ref> An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.

The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.

Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some ''similarity metric'' and evaluated, for example, by ''internal compactness'', or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and ''separation'', the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on ''estimated density'' and ''graph connectivity''.\n\n==== Semi-supervised learning ====\n{{Main|Semi-supervised learning}}\n\nSemi-supervised learning falls between [[unsupervised learning]] (without any labeled training data) and [[supervised learning]] (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels,  yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.  \n\nIn [[Weak supervision|weakly supervised learning]], the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/ws_blog_post.html|title=Weak Supervision: The New Programming Paradigm for Machine Learning|author1=Alex Ratner |author2=Stephen Bach |author3=Paroma Varma |author4=Chris |others= referencing work by many other members of Hazy Research|website=hazyresearch.github.io|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==== Reinforcement learning ====\n{{Main|Reinforcement learning}}\nReinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how [[software agent]]s ought to take [[Action selection|actions]] in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as [[game theory]], [[control theory]], [[operations research]], [[information theory]], [[simulation-based optimization]], [[multi-agent system]]s, [[swarm intelligence]], [[statistics]] and [[genetic algorithm]]s. In machine learning, the environment is typically represented as a [[Markov Decision Process]] (MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms use [[dynamic programming]] techniques.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reinforcement learning and markov decision processes|author1=van Otterlo, M.|author2=Wiering, M.|journal=Reinforcement Learning |volume=12|pages=3\u201342 |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-27645-3_1|series=Adaptation, Learning, and Optimization|isbn=978-3-642-27644-6}}</ref> Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP, and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.\n\n==== Self learning ==== \n\nSelf-learning as machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning  named Crossbar Adaptive Array (CAA). <ref>  Bozinovski, S. (1982). \"A self-learning system using secondary reinforcement\" . In Trappl, Robert (ed.).

The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. <ref>Bozinovski, Stevo (2014) \"Modeling mechanisms of cognition-emotion interaction in artificial neural networks, since 1981.\" Procedia Computer Science p. 255-263 </ref>\nThe self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning  routine: \n  In situation s perform action a;\n  Receive consequence situation s\u2019;\n  Compute emotion of being in consequence situation v(s\u2019);\n  Update crossbar memory  w\u2019(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s\u2019).\n\nIt is a system with only one input, situation s, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the  behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. <ref> Bozinovski, S.

This replaces manual [[feature engineering]], and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\n\nFeature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include [[artificial neural network]]s, [[multilayer perceptron]]s, and supervised [[dictionary learning]].

Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in [[image de-noising]]. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.<ref>Aharon, M, M Elad, and A Bruckstein. 2006. \"[http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cs278/papers/ksvd.pdf K-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Overcomplete Dictionaries for Sparse Representation].\" Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on 54 (11): 4311\u20134322</ref>\n\n==== Anomaly detection ====\n{{Main|Anomaly detection}}\nIn [[data mining]], anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Zimek|first=Arthur|title=Outlier Detection|date=2017|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Database Systems|pages=1\u20135|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7993-3_80719-1|isbn=9781489979933|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich}}</ref> Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as [[bank fraud]], a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.

Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.\n\n====Robot learning====\nIn [[developmental robotics]], [[robot learning]] algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans. These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, [[Motor_coordination#Muscle_synergies|motor synergies]] and imitation.\n\n==== Association rules ====\n{{Main|Association rule learning}}{{See also|Inductive logic programming}}\nAssociation rule learning is a [[rule-based machine learning]] method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases.

In addition to [[market basket analysis]], association rules are employed today in application areas including [[Web usage mining]], [[intrusion detection]], [[continuous production]], and [[bioinformatics]].

Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.\n\n==== Artificial neural networks ====\n{{Main|Artificial neural network}}{{See also|Deep learning}}\n[[File:Colored neural network.svg|thumb|300px|An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in a [[brain]]. Here, each circular node represents an [[artificial neuron]] and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.]]\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or [[Connectionism|connectionist]] systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the [[biological neural network]]s that constitute animal [[brain]]s. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\n\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"[[artificial neuron]]s\", which loosely model the [[neuron]]s in a biological [[brain]]. Each connection, like the [[synapse]]s in a biological [[brain]], can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a [[real number]], and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a [[weight (mathematics)|weight]] that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a [[human brain]] would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from [[biology]]. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[machine translation]], [[social network]] filtering, [[general game playing|playing board and video games]] and [[medical diagnosis]].\n\n[[Deep learning]] consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are [[computer vision]] and [[speech recognition]].<ref>Honglak Lee, Roger Grosse, Rajesh Ranganath, Andrew Y.

It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, [[leaf node|leaves]] represent class labels and branches represent [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]s of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically [[real numbers]]) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and [[decision making]]. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.\n\n==== Support vector machines ====\n{{Main|Support vector machines}}\nSupport vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related [[supervised learning]] methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.<ref name=\"CorinnaCortes\">{{Cite journal |last1=Cortes |first1=Corinna |authorlink1=Corinna Cortes |last2=Vapnik |first2=Vladimir N. |year=1995 |title=Support-vector networks |journal=[[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]] |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=273\u2013297 |doi=10.1007/BF00994018 }}</ref>  An SVM training algorithm is a non-[[probabilistic classification|probabilistic]], [[binary classifier|binary]], [[linear classifier]], although methods such as [[Platt scaling]] exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the [[kernel trick]], implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\n[[Image:Linear regression.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Illustration of linear regression on a data set.]]\n\n==== Regression analysis ====\n{{Main|Regression analysis}}\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is [[linear regression]], where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as [[ordinary least squares]]. The latter is often extended by [[regularization (mathematics)]] methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in [[ridge regression]]. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include [[polynomial regression]] (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel <ref>{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Christopher|title=Tutorial: Polynomial Regression in Excel|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~cstevens/301/Excel4.html|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>), [[Logistic regression]] (often used in [[statistical classification]]) or even [[kernel regression]], which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the [[kernel trick]] to implicitly map input variables to higher dimensional space. \n\n==== Bayesian networks ====\n{{Main|Bayesian network}}\n[[Image:SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg|thumb|right|A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.]]\n\nA Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic [[graphical model]] that represents a set of [[random variables]] and their [[conditional independence]] with a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform [[inference]] and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like [[speech recognition|speech signals]] or [[peptide sequence|protein sequences]], are called [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called [[influence diagram]]s.\n\n==== Genetic algorithms ====\n{{Main|Genetic algorithm}}\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a [[search algorithm]] and [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] technique that mimics the process of [[natural selection]], using methods such as [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] and [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] to generate new [[Chromosome (genetic algorithm)|genotype]]s in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.

Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. [[Overfitting]] is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.\n\n==== Federated learning ====\n{{Main|Federated learning}}\nFederated learning is a new approach to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, [[Gboard]] uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to [[Google]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html|title=Federated Learning: Collaborative Machine Learning without Centralized Training Data|website=Google AI Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nThere are many applications for machine learning, including:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Precision agriculture|Agriculture]]\n* [[Computational anatomy|Anatomy]]\n* [[Adaptive website]]s\n* [[Affective computing]]\n* [[Banking]]\n* [[Bioinformatics]]\n* [[Brain\u2013machine interface]]s\n* [[Cheminformatics]]\n* [[Citizen science]]\n* [[Network simulation|Computer networks]]\n* [[Computer vision]]\n* [[Credit-card fraud]] detection\n* [[Data quality]]\n* [[DNA sequence]] classification\n* [[Computational economics|Economics]]\n* [[Financial market]] analysis <ref>Machine learning is  included in the [[Chartered_Financial_Analyst_(CFA)#Curriculum|CFA Curriculum]] (discussion is top down); see: [https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/study-session/2020-l2-ss3.ashx  Kathleen DeRose and Christophe Le Lanno (2020). \"Machine Learning\"].</ref>\n* [[General game playing]]\n* [[Handwriting recognition]]\n* [[Information retrieval]]\n* [[Insurance]]\n* [[Internet fraud]] detection\n* [[Computational linguistics|Linguistics]]\n* [[Machine learning control]]\n* [[Machine perception]]\n* [[Machine translation]]\n* [[Marketing]]\n* [[Automated medical diagnosis|Medical diagnosis]]\n* [[Natural language processing]]\n* [[Natural language understanding]]\n* [[Online advertising]]\n* [[Mathematical optimization|Optimization]]\n* [[Recommender system]]s\n* [[Robot locomotion]]\n* [[Search engines]]\n* [[Sentiment analysis]]\n* [[Sequence mining]]\n* [[Software engineering]]\n* [[Speech recognition]]\n* [[Structural health monitoring]]\n* [[Syntactic pattern recognition]]\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Automated theorem proving|Theorem proving]]\n* [[Time series|Time series forecasting]]\n* [[User behavior analytics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nIn 2006, the media-services provider [[Netflix]] held the first \"[[Netflix Prize]]\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy on its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%.

In comparison, the K-fold-[[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model.

Similarly, investigators sometimes report the [[False Positive Rate]] (FPR) as well as the [[False Negative Rate]] (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The [[Total Operating Characteristic]] (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability.

There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these \"greed\" biases are addressed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Char |first=D.

For the early tasks that humans wanted computers to accomplish, it was possible to create algorithms that enabled the machine to execute all the steps needed to solve the problem in hand. So on the computer's part, no learning was needed.  For certain advanced tasks,  facial recognition for example, it is not easy to create the needed algorithms, partly as it's not easy for humans to precisely define how we recognise faces.  Abundant face related data exists however. So far, compared to the difficulty in directly creating the required algorithms,  it's turned out in practice to be easier to assist computers to learn themselves how to recognise faces from available data. The discipline of machine learning develops various approaches for computers to learn to accomplish tasks for which no algorithm exists.<ref name = \"Alpaydin2020\">{{cite book\n | author = Ethem Alpaydin \n | title =Introduction to Machine Learning\n | year = 2020\n | edition = Fourth\n | pages = xix, 1-3, 13-18\n | publisher = [[MIT]]\n |ISBN = 0262043793\n }}</ref><ref name=\"elements\"/>\n\n=== Machine learning approaches ===\n{{Anchor|Algorithm types}}\nEarly classifications for machine learning approaches sometimes divided them into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system.

In the early days of AI as an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]], some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"[[neural network]]s\"; these were mostly [[perceptron]]s and [[ADALINE|other models]] that were later found to be reinventions of the [[generalized linear model]]s of statistics.<ref>{{cite citeseerx |last1=Sarle |first1=Warren |title=Neural Networks and statistical models |citeseerx=10.1.1.27.699 |year=1994}}</ref> [[Probability theory|Probabilistic]] reasoning was also employed, especially in automated [[medical diagnosis]].<ref name=\"aima\">{{cite AIMA|edition=2}}</ref>{{rp|488}}\n\nHowever, an increasing emphasis on the [[GOFAI|logical, knowledge-based approach]] caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|488}} By 1980, [[expert system]]s had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.<ref name=\"changing\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Langley | first1 = Pat| title = The changing science of machine learning | doi = 10.1007/s10994-011-5242-y | journal = [[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]]| volume = 82 | issue = 3 | pages = 275\u2013279 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to [[inductive logic programming]], but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in [[pattern recognition]] and [[information retrieval]].<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|708\u2013710; 755}} Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and [[computer science]] around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"[[connectionism]]\", by researchers from other disciplines including [[John Hopfield|Hopfield]], [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] and [[Geoff Hinton|Hinton]]. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of [[backpropagation]].<ref name=\"aima\" />{{rp|25}}\n\nMachine learning, reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the [[symbolic artificial intelligence|symbolic approaches]] it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and [[probability theory]].<ref name=\"changing\" /> As of 2019, many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a sub field of AI. Yet some practitioners, for example Dr Daniel Hulme, who both teaches AI and  runs a company operating in the field, argues that machine learning and AI are separate. <ref name=\"elements\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://course.elementsofai.com/\n|title= The Elements of AI\n|publisher= [[University of Helsinki]]\n|date = Dec 2019\n|accessdate=7 April 2020}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.techworld.com/tech-innovation/satalia-ceo-no-one-is-doing-ai-optimisation-can-change-that-3775689/\n|title= Satalia CEO Daniel Hulme has a plan to overcome the limitations of machine learning\n|publisher= [[Techworld]]\n|date = October 2019\n|accessdate=7 April 2020}}\n</ref><ref name = \"Alpaydin2020\"/>\n\n=== Relation to data mining ===\nMachine learning and [[data mining]] often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on ''known'' properties learned from the training data, [[data mining]] focuses on the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of (previously) ''unknown'' properties in the data (this is the analysis step of [[knowledge discovery]] in databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, [[ECML PKDD]] being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to ''reproduce known'' knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously ''unknown'' knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n\n=== Relation to optimization ===\nMachine learning also has intimate ties to [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some [[loss function]] on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Le Roux |first1=Nicolas |first2=Yoshua |last2=Bengio |first3=Andrew |last3=Fitzgibbon |title=Improving First and Second-Order Methods by Modeling Uncertainty |encyclopedia=Optimization for Machine Learning |year=2012 |page=404 |editor1-last=Sra |editor1-first=Suvrit |editor2-first=Sebastian |editor2-last=Nowozin |editor3-first=Stephen J. |editor3-last=Wright |publisher=MIT Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JPQx7s2L1A8C&pg=PA403&dq=\"Improving+First+and+Second-Order+Methods+by+Modeling+Uncertainty|isbn=9780262016469 }}</ref>\n\n=== Relation to statistics ===\nMachine learning and [[statistics]] are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population [[Statistical inference|inferences]] from a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]], while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Danilo |last=Bzdok |first2=Naomi |last2=Altman |authorlink2=Naomi Altman |first3=Martin |last3=Krzywinski |title=Statistics versus Machine Learning |journal=[[Nature Methods]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=233\u2013234 |year=2018 |doi=10.1038/nmeth.4642 |pmid=30100822 |pmc=6082636 }}</ref> According to [[Michael I.

The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n\nThe computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of [[theoretical computer science]] known as [[computational learning theory]]. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The [[bias\u2013variance decomposition]] is one way to quantify generalization [[Errors and residuals|error]].\n\nFor the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to [[overfitting]] and generalization will be poorer.<ref name=\"alpaydin\">{{Cite book |author=Alpaydin, Ethem |title=Introduction to Machine Learning |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoma00alpa_0 |year=2010 |publisher=The MIT Press |place=London |isbn=978-0-262-01243-0 |access-date=4 February 2017 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.

The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data.

Other methods are based on ''estimated density'' and ''graph connectivity''.\n\n==== Semi-supervised learning ====\n{{Main|Semi-supervised learning}}\n\nSemi-supervised learning falls between [[unsupervised learning]] (without any labeled training data) and [[supervised learning]] (with completely labeled training data).

There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the  behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. <ref> Bozinovski, S.

[[Sparse coding]] algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros.

However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.\n\n==== Sparse dictionary learning ====\n{{Main|Sparse dictionary learning}}\nSparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of [[basis function]]s, and is assumed to be a [[sparse matrix]]. The method is [[strongly NP-hard]] and difficult to solve approximately.<ref>{{cite journal |first=A.

Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in [[image de-noising]]. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.<ref>Aharon, M, M Elad, and A Bruckstein. 2006. \"[http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~cs278/papers/ksvd.pdf K-SVD: An Algorithm for Designing Overcomplete Dictionaries for Sparse Representation].\" Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on 54 (11): 4311\u20134322</ref>\n\n==== Anomaly detection ====\n{{Main|Anomaly detection}}\nIn [[data mining]], anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|last=Zimek|first=Arthur|title=Outlier Detection|date=2017|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Database Systems|pages=1\u20135|publisher=Springer New York|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7993-3_80719-1|isbn=9781489979933|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich}}</ref> Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as [[bank fraud]], a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.

This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data, unless it has been aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Paul | last=Dokas | first2=Levent |last2=Ertoz |first3=Vipin |last3=Kumar |first4=Aleksandar |last4=Lazarevic |first5=Jaideep |last5=Srivastava |first6=Pang-Ning |last6=Tan | title=Data mining for network intrusion detection | year=2002 | journal=Proceedings NSF Workshop on Next Generation Data Mining | url=http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~kolari1/Mining/ngdm/dokas.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThree broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.<ref name=\"ChandolaSurvey\">{{cite journal |last1=Chandola |first1=V. |last2=Banerjee |first2=A. |last3=Kumar |first3=V. |year=2009 |title=Anomaly detection: A survey|journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]]|volume=41|issue=3|pages=1\u201358|doi=10.1145/1541880.1541882|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/71d1ac92ad36b62a04f32ed75a10ad3259a7218d }}</ref> Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.\n\n====Robot learning====\nIn [[developmental robotics]], [[robot learning]] algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences, also known as a curriculum, to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans. These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning, maturation, [[Motor_coordination#Muscle_synergies|motor synergies]] and imitation.\n\n==== Association rules ====\n{{Main|Association rule learning}}{{See also|Inductive logic programming}}\nAssociation rule learning is a [[rule-based machine learning]] method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\".<ref name=\"piatetsky\">Piatetsky-Shapiro, Gregory (1991), ''Discovery, analysis, and presentation of strong rules'', in Piatetsky-Shapiro, Gregory; and Frawley, William J.; eds., ''Knowledge Discovery in Databases'', AAAI/MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.</ref>\n\nRule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bassel|first=George W.|last2=Glaab|first2=Enrico|last3=Marquez|first3=Julietta|last4=Holdsworth|first4=Michael J.|last5=Bacardit|first5=Jaume|date=2011-09-01|title=Functional Network Construction in Arabidopsis Using Rule-Based Machine Learning on Large-Scale Data Sets|journal=The Plant Cell|language=en|volume=23|issue=9|pages=3101\u20133116|doi=10.1105/tpc.111.088153|issn=1532-298X|pmc=3203449|pmid=21896882}}</ref> Rule-based machine learning approaches include [[learning classifier system]]s, association rule learning, and [[artificial immune system]]s.\n\nBased on the concept of strong rules, [[Rakesh Agrawal (computer scientist)|Rakesh Agrawal]], [[Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski]] and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by [[point-of-sale]] (POS) systems in supermarkets.<ref name=\"mining\">{{Cite book | last1 = Agrawal | first1 = R. | last2 = Imieli\u0144ski | first2 = T. | last3 = Swami | first3 = A. | doi = 10.1145/170035.170072 | chapter = Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases | title = Proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data - SIGMOD '93 | pages = 207 | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0897915922 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.40.6984 }}</ref> For example, the rule <math>\\{\\mathrm{onions, potatoes}\\} \\Rightarrow \\{\\mathrm{burger}\\}</math> found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional [[pricing]] or [[product placement]]s. In addition to [[market basket analysis]], association rules are employed today in application areas including [[Web usage mining]], [[intrusion detection]], [[continuous production]], and [[bioinformatics]]. In contrast with [[sequence mining]], association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.\n\nLearning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a [[genetic algorithm]], with a learning component, performing either [[supervised learning]], [[reinforcement learning]], or [[unsupervised learning]]. They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a [[piecewise]] manner in order to make predictions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Urbanowicz|first=Ryan J.|last2=Moore|first2=Jason H.|date=2009-09-22|title=Learning Classifier Systems: A Complete Introduction, Review, and Roadmap|journal=Journal of Artificial Evolution and Applications|language=en|volume=2009|pages=1\u201325|doi=10.1155/2009/736398|issn=1687-6229}}</ref>\n\nInductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule-learning using [[logic programming]] as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that [[Entailment|entails]] all positive and no negative examples. [[Inductive programming]] is a related field that considers any kind of programming languages for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as [[Functional programming|functional programs]].\n\nInductive logic programming is particularly useful in [[bioinformatics]] and [[natural language processing]].

Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems.\n\n==== Artificial neural networks ====\n{{Main|Artificial neural network}}{{See also|Deep learning}}\n[[File:Colored neural network.svg|thumb|300px|An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in a [[brain]]. Here, each circular node represents an [[artificial neuron]] and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.]]\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs), or [[Connectionism|connectionist]] systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the [[biological neural network]]s that constitute animal [[brain]]s. Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\n\nAn ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"[[artificial neuron]]s\", which loosely model the [[neuron]]s in a biological [[brain]]. Each connection, like the [[synapse]]s in a biological [[brain]], can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a [[real number]], and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a [[weight (mathematics)|weight]] that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n\nThe original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a [[human brain]] would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from [[biology]]. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[machine translation]], [[social network]] filtering, [[general game playing|playing board and video games]] and [[medical diagnosis]].\n\n[[Deep learning]] consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are [[computer vision]] and [[speech recognition]].<ref>Honglak Lee, Roger Grosse, Rajesh Ranganath, Andrew Y.

It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, [[leaf node|leaves]] represent class labels and branches represent [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]s of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically [[real numbers]]) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and [[decision making]]. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.\n\n==== Support vector machines ====\n{{Main|Support vector machines}}\nSupport vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related [[supervised learning]] methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.<ref name=\"CorinnaCortes\">{{Cite journal |last1=Cortes |first1=Corinna |authorlink1=Corinna Cortes |last2=Vapnik |first2=Vladimir N. |year=1995 |title=Support-vector networks |journal=[[Machine Learning (journal)|Machine Learning]] |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=273\u2013297 |doi=10.1007/BF00994018 }}</ref>  An SVM training algorithm is a non-[[probabilistic classification|probabilistic]], [[binary classifier|binary]], [[linear classifier]], although methods such as [[Platt scaling]] exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the [[kernel trick]], implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n\n[[Image:Linear regression.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Illustration of linear regression on a data set.]]\n\n==== Regression analysis ====\n{{Main|Regression analysis}}\nRegression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is [[linear regression]], where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as [[ordinary least squares]]. The latter is often extended by [[regularization (mathematics)]] methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in [[ridge regression]]. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include [[polynomial regression]] (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel <ref>{{cite web|last1=Stevenson|first1=Christopher|title=Tutorial: Polynomial Regression in Excel|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~cstevens/301/Excel4.html|website=facultystaff.richmond.edu|accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref>), [[Logistic regression]] (often used in [[statistical classification]]) or even [[kernel regression]], which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the [[kernel trick]] to implicitly map input variables to higher dimensional space. \n\n==== Bayesian networks ====\n{{Main|Bayesian network}}\n[[Image:SimpleBayesNetNodes.svg|thumb|right|A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet.]]\n\nA Bayesian network, belief network or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic [[graphical model]] that represents a set of [[random variables]] and their [[conditional independence]] with a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform [[inference]] and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like [[speech recognition|speech signals]] or [[peptide sequence|protein sequences]], are called [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called [[influence diagram]]s.\n\n==== Genetic algorithms ====\n{{Main|Genetic algorithm}}\nA genetic algorithm (GA) is a [[search algorithm]] and [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] technique that mimics the process of [[natural selection]], using methods such as [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] and [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]] to generate new [[Chromosome (genetic algorithm)|genotype]]s in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.

Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. [[Overfitting]] is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.\n\n==== Federated learning ====\n{{Main|Federated learning}}\nFederated learning is a new approach to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server.

In comparison, the K-fold-[[Cross-validation (statistics)|cross-validation]] method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]], which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kohavi|first1=Ron|title=A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Estimation and Model Selection|journal=International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence|date=1995|url=http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/cs573/Papers/Kohavi-IJCAI-95.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report [[sensitivity and specificity]] meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the [[False Positive Rate]] (FPR) as well as the [[False Negative Rate]] (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The [[Total Operating Characteristic]] (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used [[Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) and ROC's associated Area Under the Curve (AUC).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pontius|first1=Robert Gilmore|last2=Si|first2=Kangping|title=The total operating characteristic to measure diagnostic ability for multiple thresholds| journal=International Journal of Geographical Information Science|volume=28|issue=3|year=2014|pages=570\u2013583|doi=10.1080/13658816.2013.862623}}</ref>\n\n== Ethics ==\nMachine learning poses a host of [[Machine ethics|ethical questions]].

There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these \"greed\" biases are addressed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Char |first=D.

The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]]. Its eastern terminus is at a [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]] in Vernon Center, a [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] within the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]]. Over its routing, NY&nbsp;31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in [[Upstate New York]]: [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\u2013Niagara Falls, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] to the north and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] to the south, as well as the [[Erie Canal]], as it proceeds east.\n\nMuch of NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] was originally designated as part of a [[legislative route]] from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY&nbsp;31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route&nbsp;30 (modern NY&nbsp;31, [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]], and NY&nbsp;104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to [[Lenox, New York|Lenox]]. At Lenox, NY&nbsp;31 turned southeast to follow what is now [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] and [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] to [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] in [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]]. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to [[Lewiston (village), New York|Lewiston]] on [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] and altered in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]] to continue east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] via [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. With the advent of [[U.S. Route&nbsp;104]] (US&nbsp;104) {{circa|1935}}, NY&nbsp;31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.\n\nNY&nbsp;31 was truncated westward to [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY&nbsp;31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of '''New York State Route&nbsp;234''', a north\u2013south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY&nbsp;234 was transferred from the state of New York to [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY&nbsp;234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY&nbsp;234 became an extension of NY&nbsp;31.\n\n==Route description==\nMost of NY&nbsp;31 is owned by the state of New York and maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, some sections of the route\u2014mostly within cities\u2014are locally owned and maintained. In the cities of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY&nbsp;31 is completely city-owned.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_niagara.csv |title=Niagara County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"inv-monroe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_monroe.csv |title=Monroe County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Another city-maintained section exists in the [[Lockport (city), New York|city of Lockport]] from Washburn Street (five blocks east of [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]]) to the eastern city line.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\" /> Two villages\u2014[[Medina, New York|Medina]] and [[Newark, New York|Newark]]\u2014also maintain parts of NY&nbsp;31.

The busiest of these, from [[Interstate&nbsp;590]] (I-590) to [[New York State Route 65|NY&nbsp;65]] in the eastern suburb of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]], carries in excess of 40,000 vehicles [[average annual daily traffic|per day on average]]. Two other segments\u2014between South and Woodbury Avenues in downtown Rochester and from NY&nbsp;65 to French Road in Brighton and [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford]]\u2014have traffic volumes in excess of 30,000 vehicles. On the other hand, the portion of NY&nbsp;31 in the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] town of [[Vernon (town), New York|Vernon]] between the [[Vernon Downs]] racetrack and Youngs Road handles just 910 cars per day on average, making it the least-traveled segment of the route.<ref name=\"2009tvr\" />\n\n===Western New York===\nNY&nbsp;31 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in northern Niagara Falls. After a short distance eastward through the northern fringe of the city as College Avenue, the road encounters [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]] at the northeastern city line. NY&nbsp;31 continues northeastward into the town of [[Niagara, New York|Niagara]], following Witmer Road to an interchange with [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] at exit&nbsp;24. Past I-190, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] south of the [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] reservoir. At the intersection, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Saunders Settlement Road, a name it retains for almost {{convert|15|mi|0}}. Continuing through [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], NY&nbsp;31 passes the south end of the [[Tuscarora Indian Reservation]] ahead of a brief [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. Past the east end of the concurrency, NY&nbsp;429 travels north toward NY&nbsp;104 while NY&nbsp;31 continues east past [[Niagara County Community College]] to an intersection with [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]], the final state route that NY&nbsp;31 intersects before entering the [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]] area.<ref name=\"ilnymap\">{{cite map |title=I Love New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |cartography=[[Map Works]] |year=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"bing1\">{{bing maps |url=https://binged.it/2sYrt88 |title=overview map of NY 31 from Niagara Falls to Gates |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:NY 63-31 in Medina.jpg|left|thumb|NY&nbsp;31 and NY&nbsp;63 north through Medina village]]\nWest of Lockport, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 270|NY&nbsp;270]] and [[New York State Route 93|NY&nbsp;93]]. Continuing into the city, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]] (Transit Street) at an intersection partially located over the [[Erie Canal]]. NY&nbsp;31 heads eastward through Lockport, intersecting the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 77|NY&nbsp;77]] at the eastern edge of the city. While NY&nbsp;77 continues along the right-of-way of NY&nbsp;31, NY&nbsp;31 exits, following a northeasterly alignment through [[Gasport, New York|Gasport]] to [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]], where it acts as the western and southern terminus of [[New York State Route 31E|NY&nbsp;31E]] and [[New York State Route 271|NY&nbsp;271]], respectively. Just east of town, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the first of nine county lines along its routing, entering [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nAt an intersection south of [[Medina, New York|Medina]], [[New York State Route 31A|NY&nbsp;31A]] branches off, continuing straight from NY&nbsp;31 while NY&nbsp;31 turns north to overlap [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] for a short distance between NY&nbsp;31A and NY&nbsp;31E in Medina. At NY&nbsp;31E, NY&nbsp;31 separates from NY&nbsp;63, following the path of NY&nbsp;31E east out of the village. {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the east, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 98|NY&nbsp;98]] in [[Albion (village), Orleans County, New York|Albion]]. Midway between Albion and [[Holley, New York|Holley]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects the southern end of [[New York State Route 387|NY&nbsp;387]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues to the southeast, entering Holley and intersecting [[New York State Route 237|NY&nbsp;237]] in the village center. The route quickly leaves Holley soon after, crossing into [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] just over a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) from the village line.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\n===Rochester area===\n====Western suburbs and downtown====\n[[File:NY 31 at NY 31A in Sweden.jpg|thumb|Approaching NY&nbsp;31A on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in Sweden]]\nJust inside the Monroe County line, the road traverses the [[Erie Canal]] before intersecting Redman Road about {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} west of the village of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]]. NY&nbsp;31 turns south here, following Redman Road back across the Erie Canal and past the western fringe of the [[State University of New York at Brockport|SUNY Brockport]] campus to a junction with Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31A enters the intersection from the west and ends at NY&nbsp;31 while the latter turns east onto Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31 progresses eastward, intersecting [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] in a commercialized area directly south of Brockport and becoming Brockport&ndash;Spencerport Road. East of the village in the surrounding town of [[Sweden, New York|Sweden]], NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 260|NY&nbsp;260]]. The route continues eastward, paralleling the Erie Canal as it enters [[Ogden, New York|Ogden]], where NY&nbsp;31 comes to the current western terminus of [[New York State Route 531|NY&nbsp;531]], the Spencerport Expressway, and, shortly after, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 36|NY&nbsp;36]]. NY&nbsp;31, now sandwiched by the canal to the north and NY&nbsp;531 to the south, heads eastward into the village of [[Spencerport, New York|Spencerport]], where it becomes Nichols Street and meets [[New York State Route 259|NY&nbsp;259]] in the center of the community.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nOutside of Spencerport, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Spencerport Road as it heads eastward into the town of [[Gates, New York|Gates]]. The route heads past residential neighborhoods to the north and mostly undeveloped land to the south as it enters the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Elmgrove, built up around NY&nbsp;31's junction with [[New York State Route 386|NY&nbsp;386]].<ref name=\"bing1\" /> Not far to the east, NY&nbsp;31 enters [[North Gates, New York|North Gates]], a densely populated residential community near the northern town line of Gates. In the southeastern outskirts of the community, NY&nbsp;31 intersects Lyell and Howard Roads at a junction that once served as the western terminus of [[New York State Route 47|NY&nbsp;47]]<ref name=\"bing1\" /><ref name=\"1964map\">{{cite map |title=New York and Metropolitan New York |publisher=[[Sinclair Oil Corporation]] |year=1964 |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref> NY&nbsp;31 continues east from here as Lyell Avenue, meeting [[New York State Route 390|NY&nbsp;390]] at an interchange immediately north of the route's larger interchange with [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]]. Not far to the east is the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line, which NY&nbsp;31 crosses upon traversing the Erie Canal once again.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\n[[File:PAETEC Park Exterior.jpg|thumb|left|Broad Street at Sahlen's Stadium]]\nNY&nbsp;31 follows Lyell Avenue through the city to West Broad Street, where it turns to follow Broad Street southeastward past [[Marina Auto Stadium]]. It heads onward toward a pair of overpasses, one carrying I-490 and another holding the [[CSX Transportation]]-owned [[Rochester Subdivision]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues under both, following the former path of the Erie Canal southeast through the city to the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 33|NY&nbsp;33]] at West Main Street. NY&nbsp;31 follows West Main Street to the east, passing under I-490 once again before breaking from Main Street and occupying East Broad Street. The street proceeds to the east, passing through the commercial heart of the city. Just east of Exchange Boulevard, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 383|NY&nbsp;383]], the route crosses the [[Genesee River]] on the [[Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct|Broad Street Aqueduct]].<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nEast of the waterway, NY&nbsp;31 follows East Broad Street to South Avenue, where it turns south for two blocks to a junction with Woodbury Boulevard. It turns east here, following Woodbury Boulevard for two blocks to Chestnut Street, at which point NY&nbsp;31 turns southward to follow Chestnut Street. Westbound NY&nbsp;31 in the area, however, follows one block of Woodbury Boulevard and two blocks of South Clinton Avenue to reach East Broad Street. At the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], Chestnut Street becomes Monroe Avenue, the name NY&nbsp;31 retains to [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]].<ref name=\"rochester east quad\">{{cite map |url=http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=o18 |title=Rochester East Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1997 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> Over this stretch, NY&nbsp;31 maintains a constant southeasterly progression as it passes through southeastern Rochester and the town of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]]. As the route exits downtown Rochester, it intersects I-490 at exit&nbsp;18. The route continues onward, passing Cobbs Hill Park and entering Brighton, where it traverses areas more commercial in nature<ref name=\"bing2\">{{bing maps |url=https://binged.it/2s0Jo0z |link=no |title=overview map of NY 31 from Rochester to Verona |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref> and meets the former routing of NY&nbsp;47 a second time in an area of town known as Twelve Corners.<ref name=\"1981map\"/>\n\n====Eastern suburbs and Wayne County====\n[[File:NY 31 in Pittsford NY 1.JPG|thumb|NY&nbsp;31 in Brighton]]\nIn the eastern portion of Brighton, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[Interstate 590|I-590]] by way of an interchange and intersects [[New York State Route 65|NY&nbsp;65]]. From NY&nbsp;65, NY&nbsp;31 continues southeast into the [[Pittsford (town), New York|town of Pittsford]], passing along the southern fringe of [[Oak Hill Country Club]] and paralleling the former right-of-way of the [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] railroad line to the [[Pittsford (town), New York|village of Pittsford]]. Just inside the village limits, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the Erie Canal once more and intersects the [[West Shore Subdivision]] at-grade. In the village center, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]]. East of NY&nbsp;96, the route crosses over the Erie Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY&nbsp;31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the [[Perinton, New York|Perinton]] town line at exit&nbsp;26. The route continues east into Perinton, where it traverses the Erie Canal for one final time within the county and crosses [[New York State Route 250|NY&nbsp;250]] near Perinton Square Mall.<ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\nEast of the mall, the route passes through increasingly rural areas, with the exception of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY&nbsp;250 and the [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]] line.<ref name=\"bing2\" /> NY&nbsp;31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural [[Macedon (town), New York|town of Macedon]] to the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of the same name]]. Prior to exiting the village, NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] and the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]]. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra]], NY&nbsp;31 joins [[New York State Route 21|NY&nbsp;21]] through the center of the village.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 west at NY 89.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching NY&nbsp;89 on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in [[Tyre, New York|Tyre]]]]\nFrom Palmyra east, the route parallels the Erie Canal for a considerable distance. Between Palmyra and [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 dips into [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] for less than a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) before reentering Wayne County. In [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 88|NY&nbsp;88]]. Farther east, in [[Lyons (hamlet), New York|Lyons]], it crosses [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] and the Erie Canal. At [[Clyde, New York|Clyde]], NY&nbsp;31 briefly overlaps [[New York State Route 414|NY&nbsp;414]] in the center of the village. Outside of Clyde, the Erie Canal veers off to the southeast while NY&nbsp;31 continues east alongside the Rochester Subdivision to the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Savannah, New York|Savannah]], the final centralized community within Wayne County. Here, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 89|NY&nbsp;89]] and follows it southward toward the [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] line. At the county line, NY&nbsp;89 turns west to follow the county line while NY&nbsp;31 heads southeast into Seneca County. The route proceeds across the northeastern most corner of the county before crossing into [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] via a bridge over the Erie Canal after just {{convert|1.5|mi|1}}.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n===Central New York===\nShortly after entering Cayuga County, NY&nbsp;31 crosses and begins to parallel the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]), which NY&nbsp;31 does for most of its routing west of the outer [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] suburbs. In [[Port Byron, New York|Port Byron]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]] in the center of the village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY&nbsp;31 continues alone to [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]], where the route meets [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]] and [[County Route 31B (Cayuga County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;31B]] (CR&nbsp;31B, formerly [[New York State Route 31B|NY&nbsp;31B]]) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY&nbsp;31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs down the center of the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY&nbsp;31 to the south.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:Junction of NY 38 with NY 31.jpg|thumb|right|Western terminus of the NY&nbsp;31&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;38 overlap in Port Byron]]\nContinuing into [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] and the village of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]], NY&nbsp;31 begins to make a turn northward while connecting to the northern end of [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] (the former northern terminus of [[New York State Route 31C|NY&nbsp;31C]]) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY&nbsp;31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment in the shadow of the Thruway. Once inside the limits of [[Van Buren, New York|Van Buren]], NY&nbsp;31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of [[New York State Route 173|NY&nbsp;173]] in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]], where NY&nbsp;31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]] to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY&nbsp;31 merges with [[New York State Route 690|NY&nbsp;690]] northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nOn the north bank of the river, NY&nbsp;31 exits NY&nbsp;690 but joins [[New York State Route 370|NY&nbsp;370]] at the end of the exit ramp. Together, NY&nbsp;31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, intersecting [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] in the village center. Three blocks from NY&nbsp;48, NY&nbsp;370 splits from NY&nbsp;31. As NY&nbsp;370 heads for downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], NY&nbsp;31 continues east, overlapping [[New York State Route 631|NY&nbsp;631]] for a short distance before passing through [[Lysander New Community, New York|Lysander New Community]] and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of [[Clay, New York|Clay]], NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 481|NY&nbsp;481]] at an interchange in the shadow of the [[Great Northern Mall (New York)|Great Northern Mall]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward through the town to [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]], where it meets [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] and [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] at exit&nbsp;30. As NY&nbsp;31 heads away from I-81, [[Oneida Lake]] slowly becomes visible to the north. NY&nbsp;31 comes within a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]] line, here delimited by [[Chittenango Creek]], NY&nbsp;31 enters the western half of [[Bridgeport, New York|Bridgeport]] and meets the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 298|NY&nbsp;298]] near the banks of the creek. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 east at NY 46.jpg|thumb|left|Eastbound NY&nbsp;31 at NY&nbsp;46 in Verona]]\nEast of Bridgeport, NY&nbsp;31 moves closer to Oneida Lake, eventually coming to within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the lakeshore at points. Near the eastern edge of Oneida Lake, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 13|NY&nbsp;13]] in the hamlet of [[South Bay, New York|South Bay]]. To the east, NY&nbsp;31 meets the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] at a junction adjacent to the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] line, again marked by a body of water, the [[Oneida Creek]]. NY&nbsp;31 traverses the creek and proceeds eastward through the Oneida County town of [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. Northeast of [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] adjacent to the path of the old routing of the [[Erie Canal]]. Farther east, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] just north of its interchange with the Thruway. The [[Turning Stone Resort & Casino]], located {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of the intersection, is accessible via NY&nbsp;365.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nPast NY&nbsp;365, NY&nbsp;31 passes over the Thruway (I-90) for the final time.

NY&nbsp;31 joins NY&nbsp;5, following the route eastward for about {{convert|0.75|mi|2}} out of the village to Stuhlman Road. Here, NY&nbsp;31 splits from NY&nbsp;5 and follows Stuhlman Road southward, passing to the east of [[Vernon Downs]] before intersecting Youngs Road. Stuhlman Road ends here; however, NY&nbsp;31 turns eastward onto Youngs Road, following it into the hamlet of Vernon Center. The route continues eastward into the center of the community, where it ends at a large [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n==History==\n===Early designations===\nIn 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] established a statewide [[legislative route]] system that initially consisted of 37 [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] routes. Much of what is now NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] became part of one of three routes, namely Route&nbsp;14, Route&nbsp;20, and Route&nbsp;30. Route&nbsp;30 began at the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] city line (delimited by modern [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]]) and followed current NY&nbsp;31 east to [[Sanborn, New York|Sanborn]], where it turned north onto modern [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. The route followed current NY&nbsp;429 to [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] in [[Porter, New York|Porter]], at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] in [[Ridgeway, New York|Ridgeway]]. Route&nbsp;30 went south here, utilizing modern NY&nbsp;63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY&nbsp;31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY&nbsp;31 to the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line. In the vicinity of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]], however, Route&nbsp;30 was routed on West Avenue and modern [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] instead. From the southeastern city line to [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]] in the [[Pittsford (village), New York|village of Pittsford]], Monroe Avenue (modern NY&nbsp;31) was part of Route&nbsp;14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY&nbsp;31 between current [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]] and [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] in the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of Macedon]] and [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] in Jordan was part of Route&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"1909book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA52 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

Its eastern terminus is at a [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]] in Vernon Center, a [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] within the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]]. Over its routing, NY&nbsp;31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in [[Upstate New York]]: [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\u2013Niagara Falls, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] to the north and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] to the south, as well as the [[Erie Canal]], as it proceeds east.\n\nMuch of NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] was originally designated as part of a [[legislative route]] from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY&nbsp;31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route&nbsp;30 (modern NY&nbsp;31, [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]], and NY&nbsp;104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to [[Lenox, New York|Lenox]]. At Lenox, NY&nbsp;31 turned southeast to follow what is now [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] and [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] to [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] in [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]]. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to [[Lewiston (village), New York|Lewiston]] on [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] and altered in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]] to continue east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] via [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. With the advent of [[U.S. Route&nbsp;104]] (US&nbsp;104) {{circa|1935}}, NY&nbsp;31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.\n\nNY&nbsp;31 was truncated westward to [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY&nbsp;31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of '''New York State Route&nbsp;234''', a north\u2013south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY&nbsp;234 was transferred from the state of New York to [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY&nbsp;234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY&nbsp;234 became an extension of NY&nbsp;31.\n\n==Route description==\nMost of NY&nbsp;31 is owned by the state of New York and maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, some sections of the route\u2014mostly within cities\u2014are locally owned and maintained.

NY&nbsp;31 heads eastward through Lockport, intersecting the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 77|NY&nbsp;77]] at the eastern edge of the city. While NY&nbsp;77 continues along the right-of-way of NY&nbsp;31, NY&nbsp;31 exits, following a northeasterly alignment through [[Gasport, New York|Gasport]] to [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]], where it acts as the western and southern terminus of [[New York State Route 31E|NY&nbsp;31E]] and [[New York State Route 271|NY&nbsp;271]], respectively. Just east of town, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the first of nine county lines along its routing, entering [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nAt an intersection south of [[Medina, New York|Medina]], [[New York State Route 31A|NY&nbsp;31A]] branches off, continuing straight from NY&nbsp;31 while NY&nbsp;31 turns north to overlap [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] for a short distance between NY&nbsp;31A and NY&nbsp;31E in Medina. At NY&nbsp;31E, NY&nbsp;31 separates from NY&nbsp;63, following the path of NY&nbsp;31E east out of the village. {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the east, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 98|NY&nbsp;98]] in [[Albion (village), Orleans County, New York|Albion]].

NY&nbsp;31 turns south here, following Redman Road back across the Erie Canal and past the western fringe of the [[State University of New York at Brockport|SUNY Brockport]] campus to a junction with Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31A enters the intersection from the west and ends at NY&nbsp;31 while the latter turns east onto Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31 progresses eastward, intersecting [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] in a commercialized area directly south of Brockport and becoming Brockport&ndash;Spencerport Road. East of the village in the surrounding town of [[Sweden, New York|Sweden]], NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 260|NY&nbsp;260]]. The route continues eastward, paralleling the Erie Canal as it enters [[Ogden, New York|Ogden]], where NY&nbsp;31 comes to the current western terminus of [[New York State Route 531|NY&nbsp;531]], the Spencerport Expressway, and, shortly after, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 36|NY&nbsp;36]]. NY&nbsp;31, now sandwiched by the canal to the north and NY&nbsp;531 to the south, heads eastward into the village of [[Spencerport, New York|Spencerport]], where it becomes Nichols Street and meets [[New York State Route 259|NY&nbsp;259]] in the center of the community.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nOutside of Spencerport, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Spencerport Road as it heads eastward into the town of [[Gates, New York|Gates]].

NY&nbsp;31 continues under both, following the former path of the Erie Canal southeast through the city to the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 33|NY&nbsp;33]] at West Main Street. NY&nbsp;31 follows West Main Street to the east, passing under I-490 once again before breaking from Main Street and occupying East Broad Street. The street proceeds to the east, passing through the commercial heart of the city. Just east of Exchange Boulevard, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 383|NY&nbsp;383]], the route crosses the [[Genesee River]] on the [[Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct|Broad Street Aqueduct]].<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nEast of the waterway, NY&nbsp;31 follows East Broad Street to South Avenue, where it turns south for two blocks to a junction with Woodbury Boulevard.

From NY&nbsp;65, NY&nbsp;31 continues southeast into the [[Pittsford (town), New York|town of Pittsford]], passing along the southern fringe of [[Oak Hill Country Club]] and paralleling the former right-of-way of the [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] railroad line to the [[Pittsford (town), New York|village of Pittsford]]. Just inside the village limits, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the Erie Canal once more and intersects the [[West Shore Subdivision]] at-grade. In the village center, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]]. East of NY&nbsp;96, the route crosses over the Erie Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY&nbsp;31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the [[Perinton, New York|Perinton]] town line at exit&nbsp;26. The route continues east into Perinton, where it traverses the Erie Canal for one final time within the county and crosses [[New York State Route 250|NY&nbsp;250]] near Perinton Square Mall.<ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\nEast of the mall, the route passes through increasingly rural areas, with the exception of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY&nbsp;250 and the [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]] line.<ref name=\"bing2\" /> NY&nbsp;31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural [[Macedon (town), New York|town of Macedon]] to the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of the same name]]. Prior to exiting the village, NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] and the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]]. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra]], NY&nbsp;31 joins [[New York State Route 21|NY&nbsp;21]] through the center of the village.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 west at NY 89.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching NY&nbsp;89 on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in [[Tyre, New York|Tyre]]]]\nFrom Palmyra east, the route parallels the Erie Canal for a considerable distance. Between Palmyra and [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 dips into [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] for less than a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) before reentering Wayne County. In [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 88|NY&nbsp;88]]. Farther east, in [[Lyons (hamlet), New York|Lyons]], it crosses [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] and the Erie Canal. At [[Clyde, New York|Clyde]], NY&nbsp;31 briefly overlaps [[New York State Route 414|NY&nbsp;414]] in the center of the village. Outside of Clyde, the Erie Canal veers off to the southeast while NY&nbsp;31 continues east alongside the Rochester Subdivision to the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Savannah, New York|Savannah]], the final centralized community within Wayne County. Here, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 89|NY&nbsp;89]] and follows it southward toward the [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] line. At the county line, NY&nbsp;89 turns west to follow the county line while NY&nbsp;31 heads southeast into Seneca County. The route proceeds across the northeastern most corner of the county before crossing into [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] via a bridge over the Erie Canal after just {{convert|1.5|mi|1}}.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n===Central New York===\nShortly after entering Cayuga County, NY&nbsp;31 crosses and begins to parallel the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]), which NY&nbsp;31 does for most of its routing west of the outer [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] suburbs. In [[Port Byron, New York|Port Byron]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]] in the center of the village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY&nbsp;31 continues alone to [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]], where the route meets [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]] and [[County Route 31B (Cayuga County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;31B]] (CR&nbsp;31B, formerly [[New York State Route 31B|NY&nbsp;31B]]) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY&nbsp;31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs down the center of the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY&nbsp;31 to the south.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:Junction of NY 38 with NY 31.jpg|thumb|right|Western terminus of the NY&nbsp;31&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;38 overlap in Port Byron]]\nContinuing into [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] and the village of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]], NY&nbsp;31 begins to make a turn northward while connecting to the northern end of [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] (the former northern terminus of [[New York State Route 31C|NY&nbsp;31C]]) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY&nbsp;31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment in the shadow of the Thruway. Once inside the limits of [[Van Buren, New York|Van Buren]], NY&nbsp;31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of [[New York State Route 173|NY&nbsp;173]] in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]], where NY&nbsp;31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]] to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY&nbsp;31 merges with [[New York State Route 690|NY&nbsp;690]] northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nOn the north bank of the river, NY&nbsp;31 exits NY&nbsp;690 but joins [[New York State Route 370|NY&nbsp;370]] at the end of the exit ramp. Together, NY&nbsp;31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, intersecting [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] in the village center. Three blocks from NY&nbsp;48, NY&nbsp;370 splits from NY&nbsp;31. As NY&nbsp;370 heads for downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], NY&nbsp;31 continues east, overlapping [[New York State Route 631|NY&nbsp;631]] for a short distance before passing through [[Lysander New Community, New York|Lysander New Community]] and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of [[Clay, New York|Clay]], NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 481|NY&nbsp;481]] at an interchange in the shadow of the [[Great Northern Mall (New York)|Great Northern Mall]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward through the town to [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]], where it meets [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] and [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] at exit&nbsp;30. As NY&nbsp;31 heads away from I-81, [[Oneida Lake]] slowly becomes visible to the north. NY&nbsp;31 comes within a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]] line, here delimited by [[Chittenango Creek]], NY&nbsp;31 enters the western half of [[Bridgeport, New York|Bridgeport]] and meets the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 298|NY&nbsp;298]] near the banks of the creek. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 east at NY 46.jpg|thumb|left|Eastbound NY&nbsp;31 at NY&nbsp;46 in Verona]]\nEast of Bridgeport, NY&nbsp;31 moves closer to Oneida Lake, eventually coming to within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the lakeshore at points. Near the eastern edge of Oneida Lake, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 13|NY&nbsp;13]] in the hamlet of [[South Bay, New York|South Bay]]. To the east, NY&nbsp;31 meets the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] at a junction adjacent to the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] line, again marked by a body of water, the [[Oneida Creek]]. NY&nbsp;31 traverses the creek and proceeds eastward through the Oneida County town of [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. Northeast of [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] adjacent to the path of the old routing of the [[Erie Canal]]. Farther east, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] just north of its interchange with the Thruway. The [[Turning Stone Resort & Casino]], located {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of the intersection, is accessible via NY&nbsp;365.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nPast NY&nbsp;365, NY&nbsp;31 passes over the Thruway (I-90) for the final time. The route continues southeast into the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]] and the [[Vernon (village), New York|village of the same name]] within, where NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]. NY&nbsp;31 joins NY&nbsp;5, following the route eastward for about {{convert|0.75|mi|2}} out of the village to Stuhlman Road. Here, NY&nbsp;31 splits from NY&nbsp;5 and follows Stuhlman Road southward, passing to the east of [[Vernon Downs]] before intersecting Youngs Road. Stuhlman Road ends here; however, NY&nbsp;31 turns eastward onto Youngs Road, following it into the hamlet of Vernon Center. The route continues eastward into the center of the community, where it ends at a large [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n==History==\n===Early designations===\nIn 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] established a statewide [[legislative route]] system that initially consisted of 37 [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] routes. Much of what is now NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] became part of one of three routes, namely Route&nbsp;14, Route&nbsp;20, and Route&nbsp;30. Route&nbsp;30 began at the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] city line (delimited by modern [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]]) and followed current NY&nbsp;31 east to [[Sanborn, New York|Sanborn]], where it turned north onto modern [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. The route followed current NY&nbsp;429 to [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] in [[Porter, New York|Porter]], at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] in [[Ridgeway, New York|Ridgeway]]. Route&nbsp;30 went south here, utilizing modern NY&nbsp;63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY&nbsp;31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY&nbsp;31 to the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line. In the vicinity of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]], however, Route&nbsp;30 was routed on West Avenue and modern [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] instead. From the southeastern city line to [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]] in the [[Pittsford (village), New York|village of Pittsford]], Monroe Avenue (modern NY&nbsp;31) was part of Route&nbsp;14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY&nbsp;31 between current [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]] and [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] in the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of Macedon]] and [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] in Jordan was part of Route&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"1909book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA52 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

Among these was Route&nbsp;30, which was modified to follow Ridge Road instead between Ridgeway and Rochester. Its former routing from Medina eastward and the Lockport spur of Route&nbsp;30 mostly became part of an extended Route&nbsp;20, which now began in [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]] and followed modern NY&nbsp;425 and Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads north and east through Cambria Center to Lockport. From [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]] to Medina, however, Route&nbsp;20 was routed on modern NY&nbsp;31 instead.

The Marian Days offer opportunities for [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Reconciliation]] and prayer. There is also times of benediction and workshop for young families, the youth, the Virgin Mary, Vocation, and much more. Mass is celebrated by many bishops, priests, and other religious brothers and sisters.\n\nPilgrims turn the surrounding area into a large campground, as many nearby residents allow pilgrims to erect tents on their lawns. The pilgrims that come earlier to set up tents are expected to stay there or risk losing their tent spots. On Wednesday before the event begins, the brothers and priests of the congregation hold a Mass and procession in honor of Saint Joseph, who is the patron of the Marian Days. Although the celebrations are centered on liturgy, they also feature a number of other events. Dioceses with large Vietnamese populations set up large tents to sell traditional [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese food]]. Proceeds go to the parishes, orphanages, or a diocese in Vietnam such as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Phu Cuong|Ph\u00fa C\u01b0\u1eddng]].

The opening Mass on Thursday is in celebration of the Blessed Sacrament, which is when the event is officially opened, (by the local diocesan bishop; if the bishop is not present, this role is given to the director.) Following the Mass is a Eucharistic Procession around Our Lady of Peace Memorial Garden. The Friday Pontifical Mass is in honor of the 117 Vietnamese Martyr Saints. The Solemn Procession of the statue of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima begins on Saturday.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAt the end of the procession in honor of Our Lady of Fatima, two long firecrackers are lit, followed by the release of numerous balloons of all colors tied to two flags, one of blue and white, the Virgin Mary's colors, and the other of the South Vietnamese flag before that half of the country fell to communism. There also happens to be more balloons that are released afterward. This can be interpreted as symbolically going to the Blessed Virgin Mary. After the procession, the Pontifical Mass is celebrated in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These two celebrations are the central point of Marian Days every year. On Sunday, the closing Pontifical Mass is celebrated. Before Mass ends, the director for that year's Marian Days announces when the next Marian Days are, and then he officially closes Marian Days.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholicism in Vietnam]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/ Chi D\u00f2ng \u0110\u1ed3ng C\u00f4ng Hoa K\u1ef3]&nbsp;\u2013 organizer website\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/NTM/NTM2012/7-4-12/07-04-2012.htm 2012]&nbsp;\u2013 event history\n<!-- *{{in lang|vi}} [http://dongcong.net/Indexntm05.htm Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu 2005]\u00a0\u2013 2005 event website -->\n*[http://www.carthagepd.org/citizens-academy/marian-days/ Marian Days \u2013 Carthage Police Department]\n\n[[Category:Catholic Church in the United States]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American history]]\n[[Category:Overseas Vietnamese religious buildings and structures]]\n[[Category:Asian-American culture in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Marian shrines]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Jasper County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Catholic Mariology]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1978]]\n[[Category:Festivals in Missouri]]\n[[Category:1978 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American culture in Missouri]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Vietnamese American annual pilgrimage|Marian holy days of the liturgical year|Marian feast days}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox recurring event\n| native_name  = Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu\n| logo         = <!--INCLUDE \"[[File:Filename]]\" when entering file name-->\n| logo_caption =\n| image        = Marian Days 2007 - Carthage Missouri 03.jpg\n| imagesize    = frameless\n| caption      = Entrance to the 2007 Marian Days.\n| begins       = 1st Thursday of August\n| ends         = Following Sunday\n| frequency    = Annual\n| location     = [[Carthage, Missouri]], United&nbsp;States\n| coordinates = {{coord|37.1565|-94.3095|type:event|display=inline,title}}\n| years_active = 42\n| first        = 1978\n| last         = {{as of|2019|lc=on|alt=August 1\u20134, 2019}}\n| next         = {{as of|2019|lc=on|alt=August 6\u20139, 2020}}\n| participants = 60,000\u2013120,000<ref name=\"KOAM Garcia\">{{cite news|title=Marian Days event in Carthage shows impressive turnout|first=Angela|last=Garcia|location=Pittsburg, Kansas|publisher=[[KOAM-TV]]|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2011|url=http://www.koamtv.com/story/15218956/marian-days-event-in-carthage-shows-impressive-turnout|quote=Around 60,000 Vietnamese Roman Catholics travel to the campus of the Congregation of Mother of the Co-Redemptrix at this time of year.}}</ref>\n| genre        = Religious, cultural\n| budget       = \n| patron       = [[Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer]]\n| website      = {{URL|http://dongcong.us/}}\n{{URL|http://dongcong.net/}}\n| footnotes    = \n}}\n\n[[File:\u0110\u1ea1i H\u1ed9i Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu, l\u1ec5 b\u1ebf m\u1ea1c.jpg|thumb|right|Pilgrims beginning to leave after the closing Mass of the 28th Marian Days celebration.]]\n\nThe '''Marian Days''' ({{lang-vi|\u0110\u1ea1i H\u1ed9i Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu}}, officially ''c\u00e1c Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu''<ref name=\"Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu\">Using a title for the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] in Vietnamese Catholicism, [[:vi:Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu|also used]] for female deities in various other Vietnamese religions.</ref>) is the main festival and [[pilgrimage]] for [[Vietnamese American]] Roman Catholics.

The Marian Days offer opportunities for [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Reconciliation]] and prayer. There is also times of benediction and workshop for young families, the youth, the Virgin Mary, Vocation, and much more. Mass is celebrated by many bishops, priests, and other religious brothers and sisters.\n\nPilgrims turn the surrounding area into a large campground, as many nearby residents allow pilgrims to erect tents on their lawns. The pilgrims that come earlier to set up tents are expected to stay there or risk losing their tent spots. On Wednesday before the event begins, the brothers and priests of the congregation hold a Mass and procession in honor of Saint Joseph, who is the patron of the Marian Days. Although the celebrations are centered on liturgy, they also feature a number of other events. Dioceses with large Vietnamese populations set up large tents to sell traditional [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese food]]. Proceeds go to the parishes, orphanages, or a diocese in Vietnam such as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Phu Cuong|Ph\u00fa C\u01b0\u1eddng]]. Other organizations, such as a local [[Knights of Columbus]] chapter,<ref name=\"Press Westhoff\">{{cite news|title=Local Catholics celebrate with pilgrims|first=Andrea|last=Westhoff|location=Carthage, Missouri|work=[[The Carthage Press]]|publisher=[[GateHouse Media]]|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2011|url=http://www.carthagepress.com/entertainment/x919514472/Local-Catholics-celebrate-with-pilgrims|quote=The Knights of Columbus is a national Catholic men\u2019s service organization.

The opening Mass on Thursday is in celebration of the Blessed Sacrament, which is when the event is officially opened, (by the local diocesan bishop; if the bishop is not present, this role is given to the director.) Following the Mass is a Eucharistic Procession around Our Lady of Peace Memorial Garden. The Friday Pontifical Mass is in honor of the 117 Vietnamese Martyr Saints. The Solemn Procession of the statue of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima begins on Saturday.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAt the end of the procession in honor of Our Lady of Fatima, two long firecrackers are lit, followed by the release of numerous balloons of all colors tied to two flags, one of blue and white, the Virgin Mary's colors, and the other of the South Vietnamese flag before that half of the country fell to communism. There also happens to be more balloons that are released afterward. This can be interpreted as symbolically going to the Blessed Virgin Mary. After the procession, the Pontifical Mass is celebrated in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These two celebrations are the central point of Marian Days every year. On Sunday, the closing Pontifical Mass is celebrated. Before Mass ends, the director for that year's Marian Days announces when the next Marian Days are, and then he officially closes Marian Days.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholicism in Vietnam]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/ Chi D\u00f2ng \u0110\u1ed3ng C\u00f4ng Hoa K\u1ef3]&nbsp;\u2013 organizer website\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/NTM/NTM2012/7-4-12/07-04-2012.htm 2012]&nbsp;\u2013 event history\n<!-- *{{in lang|vi}} [http://dongcong.net/Indexntm05.htm Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu 2005]\u00a0\u2013 2005 event website -->\n*[http://www.carthagepd.org/citizens-academy/marian-days/ Marian Days \u2013 Carthage Police Department]\n\n[[Category:Catholic Church in the United States]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American history]]\n[[Category:Overseas Vietnamese religious buildings and structures]]\n[[Category:Asian-American culture in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Marian shrines]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Jasper County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Catholic Mariology]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1978]]\n[[Category:Festivals in Missouri]]\n[[Category:1978 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American culture in Missouri]]\n", "name_user": "Cooltravis778", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Days"}
