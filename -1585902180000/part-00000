The show premiered in 2002 on [[Comedy Central]] and returned to [[MTV2]] on February 9, 2007, running again until March 30, 2007. The show screened in Australia on [[SBS Television]] and [[The Comedy Channel]] between 2003 and 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn February 11, 2019, [[Jimmy Kimmel]] announced on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' that the show would be revived on Comedy Central for a fifth 20-episode season and mark the first project on Kimmel's new ''Kimmelot'' production imprint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/crank-yankers-comedy-central-revival-1203136228/|title='Crank Yankers' Revived at Comedy Central With Jimmy Kimmel Producing|work=Variety|date=February 11, 2019|accessdate=February 12, 2019}}</ref> The new season will include pranks on social media and other platforms. Kimmel's brother [[Jonathan Kimmel]] will serve as showrunner and executive producer.

Using the basic premises, the performers [[improvisation|improvise]] most of their lines, playing off of the responses of their marks, with the intention to keep them on the phone as long as possible.\n\nWith the exception of a few outside sources (including previous material from Jim Florentine and the [[Touch-Tone Terrorists]]), all the calls are made from [[Nevada]]. The [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]] makes it illegal in most states to record telephone calls without both parties' consent. Under Nevada law, only one of the parties has to give consent (i.e., the caller), so prank calls can be recorded without the consent of the prank victims. One result of this was the series' schedule of creating and airing new episodes was fairly sporadic due to most of the celebrities living in Los Angeles, having Los Angeles-based jobs, and so were only periodically able to go to Las Vegas to make calls. Carolla, for example, took [[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|his radio program]] to Las Vegas once or twice a year, and while there would record new calls for the program.\n\nThe puppet designs were drawn by artist [[Todd James]] before being constructed based on the various marks' voices, and, along with a series of stock characters (such as \"Niles Standish\", \"Bobby Fletcher\" and \"Special Ed\") based on the performers' character voices, the calls are re-enacted for the skits. \n\nThe main character puppets for the first season were constructed by Bob Flanagan's company Den Design with additional puppets built by BJ Guyer, Carol Binion, [[Rick Lyon]], Ron Binion, Jim Kroupa and Artie Esposito. An in-house puppet shop was set up for the following seasons to accommodate the fast-paced schedule of the show and the sheer volume of puppet characters required for each episode.\n\nThe puppets are puppeteered by Ron Binion, Rick Lyon, BJ Guyer, [[Victor Yerrid]], [[Paul McGinnis]], Alice Dinnean-Vernon and Artie Esposito.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOriginally, the show was titled ''Prank Puppets''; it was renamed after Comedy Central lawyers deemed that it implied [[Malice (law)|malice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adam Carolla Show: Matt Atchity (January 6, 2012)|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/matt-atchity-2/|work=Podcast|publisher=ACE Broadcasting|accessdate=7 January 2012|date=January 6, 2012|quote=@31:00min: Crank Yankers was originally called 'Prank Puppets' and the pussy fucking lawyers said ...}}</ref>\n\n==Regular characters==\n* '''Karl Malone''' (voiced by [[Jimmy Kimmel]]): Kimmel's impression of then-[[NBA]] star [[Karl Malone]].

call|crank calls]] made by show regulars and celebrity guests and re-enacted onscreen by [[Puppet|puppets]] for a visual aid to show the viewer what is happening in the call. The show premiered in 2002 on [[Comedy Central]] and returned to [[MTV2]] on February 9, 2007, running again until March 30, 2007. The show screened in Australia on [[SBS Television]] and [[The Comedy Channel]] between 2003 and 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn February 11, 2019, [[Jimmy Kimmel]] announced on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' that the show would be revived on Comedy Central for a fifth 20-episode season and mark the first project on Kimmel's new ''Kimmelot'' production imprint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/crank-yankers-comedy-central-revival-1203136228/|title='Crank Yankers' Revived at Comedy Central With Jimmy Kimmel Producing|work=Variety|date=February 11, 2019|accessdate=February 12, 2019}}</ref> The new season will include pranks on social media and other platforms. Kimmel's brother [[Jonathan Kimmel]] will serve as showrunner and executive producer. Season 5 premiered on September 25, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Crank Yankers\" Returns to Comedy Central(R) September 25 at 10:30 P.M.

Using the basic premises, the performers [[improvisation|improvise]] most of their lines, playing off of the responses of their marks, with the intention to keep them on the phone as long as possible.\n\nWith the exception of a few outside sources (including previous material from Jim Florentine and the [[Touch-Tone Terrorists]]), all the calls are made from [[Nevada]]. The [[Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968]] makes it illegal in most states to record telephone calls without both parties' consent. Under Nevada law, only one of the parties has to give consent (i.e., the caller), so prank calls can be recorded without the consent of the prank victims. One result of this was the series' schedule of creating and airing new episodes was fairly sporadic due to most of the celebrities living in Los Angeles, having Los Angeles-based jobs, and so were only periodically able to go to Las Vegas to make calls. Carolla, for example, took [[The Adam Carolla Show (terrestrial radio)|his radio program]] to Las Vegas once or twice a year, and while there would record new calls for the program.\n\nThe puppet designs were drawn by artist [[Todd James]] before being constructed based on the various marks' voices, and, along with a series of stock characters (such as \"Niles Standish\", \"Bobby Fletcher\" and \"Special Ed\") based on the performers' character voices, the calls are re-enacted for the skits. \n\nThe main character puppets for the first season were constructed by Bob Flanagan's company Den Design with additional puppets built by BJ Guyer, Carol Binion, [[Rick Lyon]], Ron Binion, Jim Kroupa and Artie Esposito. An in-house puppet shop was set up for the following seasons to accommodate the fast-paced schedule of the show and the sheer volume of puppet characters required for each episode.\n\nThe puppets are puppeteered by Ron Binion, Rick Lyon, BJ Guyer, [[Victor Yerrid]], [[Paul McGinnis]], Alice Dinnean-Vernon and Artie Esposito.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOriginally, the show was titled ''Prank Puppets''; it was renamed after Comedy Central lawyers deemed that it implied [[Malice (law)|malice]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adam Carolla Show: Matt Atchity (January 6, 2012)|url=http://www.adamcarolla.com/matt-atchity-2/|work=Podcast|publisher=ACE Broadcasting|accessdate=7 January 2012|date=January 6, 2012|quote=@31:00min: Crank Yankers was originally called 'Prank Puppets' and the pussy fucking lawyers said ...}}</ref>\n\n==Regular characters==\n* '''Karl Malone''' (voiced by [[Jimmy Kimmel]]): Kimmel's impression of then-[[NBA]] star [[Karl Malone]]. He regularly refers to himself in the third-person. \"Don't hang up on Karl Malone.\"\n* '''Gladys Murphy''' (voiced by [[Wanda Sykes]]): A boisterous black woman who makes embarrassing announcements, generally of a [[scatology|scatological]] or sexual nature. Her many children do things like gluing her buttocks to the toilet and stealing money from a malfunctioning bank machine.\n* '''Niles Standish''' (voiced by [[Tony Barbieri]]): The British Earl of Yankerville, a rich and eccentric middle-aged pervert with [[homosexuality|homosexual]] tendencies. He frequently calls various services and asks for their price, then orders them to \"double it\" (Once even confusing someone by telling them to \"cut it in half, and double it!\"). He has an assistant named Cavendish.\n* '''Special Ed''' (voiced by [[Jim Florentine]]): Bobby Fletcher's [[intellectual disability|mentally challenged]] younger cousin who constantly repeats himself, makes random comments and shouts his catchphrase \"Yay!\" until the other caller gets frustrated. He makes a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in one of Bobby's prank calls, \"Let Me Put My Brother on the Phone\". In two prank calls of his own (one to a movie theater and one to a video store), Ed reveals that his favorite film is ''[[Air Bud]]''. In the video-store call, he works in several references to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.\n* '''Dick Birchum''' (voiced by [[Adam Carolla]]): A [[psychosis|psychotic]] [[Vietnam War]] veteran whose hobbies include [[carpentry]], [[Shotokan|Shotokan karate]], spying on women in their beds or bathrooms by drilling holes or a hidden camera, and gun ownership. He has a 600-pound wife, a large 8-year-old son, and [[conjoined twin]] daughters. He lost part of his right leg in the war and 3 right-hand fingers in a carpentry accident. He frequently refers to his time in Vietnam and \"smoking hash out of a human skull\".\n* '''Jimmy''' (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel): A Kimmel-based grown man who lives with his mother. He also has two young children who swear and play juvenile pranks.\n* '''Bobby Fletcher''' (voiced by [[Jim Florentine]]): Ed's stoner underachieving older cousin. He is known to [[belch]] uncontrollably into the phone, which he uses to his advantage in order to annoy the victims of his prank calls.\n* '''Elmer Higgins''' (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel): A crabby, elderly man (based on Kimmel's grandfather). He makes complaint calls and frequently goes off on unrelated, long-winded tangents about his younger days and various irrelevant subjects. He sometimes mentions his brother Charlie, as well as his [[Homosexuality|gay]] grandson, Terrence Catheter.\n* '''Helen Higgins''' (voiced by [[Susie Essman]]): Elmer's beautiful wife of over 60 years, she is an elderly woman who likes to proposition young men. Her son gave her a pet parrot who is well-versed in profanity. In a late-in-the-series sketch about Elmer wanting driving lessons, he mentions that she has died.\n* '''Landalious \"The Truth\" Truefeld''' (voiced by [[David Alan Grier]]): A former football player who likes to rap.\n* '''Spoonie Luv''' (voiced by [[Tracy Morgan]]): A smooth-talking African American [[Hip hop culture|hip hop]]-type character who makes lewd and suggestive comments.

{"title_page": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|An amendment addressing citizenship as well as civil and political liberties}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2018}}\n{{US Constitution article series}}\n\nThe '''Fourteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XIV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]]. Arguably one of the most consequential amendments to this day, the amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law and was proposed in response to issues related to [[Freedman#United States|former slaves]] following the [[American Civil War]]. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) regarding racial segregation, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) regarding abortion, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000) regarding the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, and also those [[State actor|acting]] on behalf of such officials.\n\nThe amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since  the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.\n\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits state and local governments from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure. The Supreme Court has ruled this clause makes most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]] as it is to the federal government, as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.\n\nThe second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to \"rebellion, or other crime\" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for [[felony disenfranchisement]]. The fourth section was held, in ''[[Gold Clause Cases|Perry v. United States]]'' (1935), to prohibit a current Congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by \"appropriate legislation\"; however, under ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n{{anchor|Section 2}}'''Section 2.''' Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n'''Section 3.''' No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\n'''Section 4.''' The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n'''Section 5.''' The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html |title=Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11\u201327 |publisher=National Archives and Records Administration |accessdate=June 11, 2013 |archivedate=May 26, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526170111/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html |url-status=live  }}</ref>}}\n\n==Adoption==\n===Proposal by Congress===\n{{see also|Presidency of Andrew Johnson}}\n\nIn the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name=\"Stromberg111\">Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199\u2013200|isbn=978-0-8071-2234-1|date=1997-06-01}}</ref>\n\nAlthough strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=250\u2013251}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70}}</ref> Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71 71]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71}}</ref> Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey.

Bingham]] of Ohio, which would enable Congress to safeguard \"equal protection of life, liberty, and property\" of all citizens; this proposal failed to pass the House.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} In April 1866, the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress, a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and voting by ex-Confederates.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} The House of Representatives passed ''House Resolution 127, 39th Congress'' several weeks later and sent to the Senate for action. The resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed. Amendments to Sections 2, 3, and 4 were adopted on June 8, 1866, and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote (5 absent, not voting). The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138\u201336 vote (10 not voting). A concurrent resolution requesting the President to transmit the proposal to the executives of the several states was passed by both houses of Congress on June 18.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States and Amendments Thereto|year=1961|publisher=Virginia Commission on Constitutional Government|page=44|editor=James J.

That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.\" The court added in ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' (1883):<ref name=CRC /> \"It is State action of a particular character that is prohibited.

The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that no agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Jackson v.

Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.<ref name=\"bonfield\">{{cite journal|first=Arthur Earl|last=Bonfield|title=The Right to Vote and Judicial Enforcement of Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Cornell Law Review|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol46/iss1/5/|volume=46|issue=1|date=1960}}</ref>\n\nTwo solutions were considered:\n\n* reduce the Congressional representation of the former slave states (for example, by basing representation on the number of legal voters rather than the number of inhabitants)\n* guarantee freed slaves the right to vote\n\nOn January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used \"race or color\" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for ''any'' reason other than participation in crime. Later, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.\n\nThe effect of Section 2 was twofold:\n\n* Although the three-fifths clause was not formally repealed, it was effectively removed from the Constitution. In the words of the Supreme Court in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', Section 2 \"abrogated so much of the corresponding clause of the original Constitution as counted only three-fifths of such persons [slaves]\".\n* It was intended to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so\u2014something that it was thought the states would not accept.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/>\n\n===Enforcement===\nThe first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]]. Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that {{quote|should any state, after the passage of this Act, deny or abridge the right of any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, to vote at any election named in the amendments to the Constitution, article fourteen, section two, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the number of Representatives apportioned in this act to such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall have to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=17&page=29#|title=\"An Act for the Apportionment of Representatives to Congress among the States according to the ninth Census\", Forty-Second Congress, Sess. ii, Ch. xi, section 6.

More specifically the Court concluded that laws passed with a discriminatory purpose are not excepted from the operation of the Equal Protection Clause by the \"other crime\" provision of Section 2.

Arguably one of the most consequential amendments to this day, the amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection under the law and was proposed in response to issues related to [[Freedman#United States|former slaves]] following the [[American Civil War]]. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) regarding racial segregation, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' (1973) regarding abortion, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000) regarding the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, and also those [[State actor|acting]] on behalf of such officials.\n\nThe amendment's first section includes several clauses: the [[Citizenship Clause]], [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]], [[Due Process Clause]], and [[Equal Protection Clause]]. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since  the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'' (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.\n\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits state and local governments from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure. The Supreme Court has ruled this clause makes most of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] as [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applicable to the states]] as it is to the federal government, as well as to recognize [[Substantive due process|substantive]] and [[Procedural due process|procedural]] requirements that state laws must satisfy. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its [[jurisdiction]]. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.\n\nThe second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to \"rebellion, or other crime\" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for [[felony disenfranchisement]]. The fourth section was held, in ''[[Gold Clause Cases|Perry v. United States]]'' (1935), to prohibit a current Congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by \"appropriate legislation\"; however, under ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.\n\n==Text==\n{{quote|'''Section 1.''' All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\n{{anchor|Section 2}}'''Section 2.''' Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\n\n'''Section 3.''' No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\n'''Section 4.''' The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.\n\n'''Section 5.'''

Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]] grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated [[Southern United States|Southern States]]. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the [[Southern United States|Southern States]] would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref name=\"Stromberg111\">Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 111.</ref> Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674041424|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&pg=PA46&q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stromberg, \"A Plain Folk Perspective\" (2002), p. 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction|pages=199\u2013200|isbn=978-0-8071-2234-1|date=1997-06-01}}</ref>\n\nAlthough strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=250\u2013251}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70}}</ref> Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=978-0-7006-0190-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71 71]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71}}</ref> Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.<ref>Rosen, Jeffrey.

Bingham]] of Ohio, which would enable Congress to safeguard \"equal protection of life, liberty, and property\" of all citizens; this proposal failed to pass the House.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} In April 1866, the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress, a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and voting by ex-Confederates.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=253}} The House of Representatives passed ''House Resolution 127, 39th Congress'' several weeks later and sent to the Senate for action. The resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed. Amendments to Sections 2, 3, and 4 were adopted on June 8, 1866, and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote (5 absent, not voting). The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138\u201336 vote (10 not voting).

The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that no agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Jackson v.

Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.<ref name=\"bonfield\">{{cite journal|first=Arthur Earl|last=Bonfield|title=The Right to Vote and Judicial Enforcement of Section Two of the Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Cornell Law Review|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/clr/vol46/iss1/5/|volume=46|issue=1|date=1960}}</ref>\n\nTwo solutions were considered:\n\n* reduce the Congressional representation of the former slave states (for example, by basing representation on the number of legal voters rather than the number of inhabitants)\n* guarantee freed slaves the right to vote\n\nOn January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used \"race or color\" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for ''any'' reason other than participation in crime. Later, the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.\n\nThe effect of Section 2 was twofold:\n\n* Although the three-fifths clause was not formally repealed, it was effectively removed from the Constitution. In the words of the Supreme Court in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]'', Section 2 \"abrogated so much of the corresponding clause of the original Constitution as counted only three-fifths of such persons [slaves]\".\n* It was intended to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, it was hoped, would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so\u2014something that it was thought the states would not accept.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/>\n\n===Enforcement===\nThe first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the [[1870 United States Census|1870 census]]. Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation.<ref name=\"bonfield\"/> In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that {{quote|should any state, after the passage of this Act, deny or abridge the right of any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, to vote at any election named in the amendments to the Constitution, article fourteen, section two, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the number of Representatives apportioned in this act to such State shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall have to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=17&page=29#|title=\"An Act for the Apportionment of Representatives to Congress among the States according to the ninth Census\", Forty-Second Congress, Sess. ii, Ch. xi, section 6.

Underwood]]'' (1985), a case involving disenfranchising black [[Misdemeanor|misdemeanants]], the Supreme Court concluded that the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] cannot save legislation prohibited by the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment. More specifically the Court concluded that laws passed with a discriminatory purpose are not excepted from the operation of the Equal Protection Clause by the \"other crime\" provision of Section 2.

In the 1850s, after decades of urban growth under [[East India Company]] and [[British Raj]], the city's population reached half a million. The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of Mumbai peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than London at that time.<ref name=jn2010>Jan Nijman, A STUDY OF SPACE IN MUMBAI'S SLUMS, Tijdschrift Voor economic en social geographies, Volume 101, Issue 1, pages 4\u201317, February 2010</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanty dwellings, Railway tracks and Mosque in Dharavi Slum Mumbai India February 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Shanty dwellings next to railway tracks in Dharavi (about 2010).

The railway network provides mass transit to the slum residents.]]\nThe most polluting industries were tanneries, and the first tannery moved from peninsular Mumbai into Dharavi in 1887. People who worked with leather, typically a profession of lowest Hindu castes and of Muslim Indians, moved into Dharavi. Other early settlers included the Kumbars, a large Gujarati community of potters (another polluting industry). The colonial government granted them a 99-year land-lease in 1895. Rural migrants looking for jobs poured into Mumbai, and its population soared past 1 million. Other artisans, like the [[embroidery]] workers from [[Uttar Pradesh]], started the ready-made garments trade.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> These industries created jobs, labor moved in, but there was no government effort to plan or invest in any infrastructure in or near Dharavi. The living quarters and small scale factories grew haphazardly, without provision for sanitation, drains, safe drinking water, roads or other basic services. But some ethnic, caste and religious communities that have settled in Dharavi at that time helped build the settlement of Dharavi, by forming organizations and political parties, building school and temples, constructing homes and factories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dharavi's first mosque, Badi Masjid, started in 1887 and the oldest Hindu temple, Ganesh Mandir, was built in 1913.<ref name=jn2010/>\n\n===Post-independence===\nAt India's independence from colonial rule in 1947, Dharavi had grown to be the largest slum in Mumbai and all of India. It still had a few empty spaces, which continued to serve as waste-dumping grounds for operators across the city.<ref name=jn2010/> Mumbai, meanwhile, continued to grow as a city. Soon Dharavi was surrounded by the city, and became a key hub for informal economy.<ref>, Eyre, L. (1990), The shanty towns of central Bombay.

Furthermore, only those families who lived in the area before 2000 are slated for resettlement. Concerns have also been raised by residents who fear that some of their small businesses in the \"informal\" sector may not be relocated under the redevelopment plan. Due to this opposition, a trust has been proposed called the Dharavi Community Land Trust that will be made up of community members, landowners, and neighborhood associations.\n\nIn 2008 German students Jens Kaercher and Lucas Schwind won a Next Generation prize for their innovative redevelopment strategy designed to protect the current residents from needing to relocate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lafargeholcim-foundation.org/projects/realizing-solutions-for-the-redevelopment-of-dharavi-mumbai-in|title=Realizing solutions for the redevelopment of Dharavi, Mumbai, In|last=info@lafargeholcim-foundation.org|first=LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction|website=LafargeHolcim Foundation website|access-date=20 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820235021/https://www.lafargeholcim-foundation.org/projects/realizing-solutions-for-the-redevelopment-of-dharavi-mumbai-in|archive-date=20 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOther redevelopment schemes include the \"Dharavi Masterplan\" devised by British architectural and engineering firm Foster + Partners, that proposes \"double-height spaces that create an intricate vertical landscape and reflect the community\u2019s way of life\" built-in phases that the firm says would \"eliminate the need for transit camps,\" instead catalyzing the rehabilitation of Dharavi \"from within.\"\n\nA Dubai based firm \u2013 SecLink group has planned to redevelop the slum into a completely new area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/business/dubai-firm-to-transform-asias-biggest-slum-1.62097740|title=Dubai firm to transform Asia's biggest slum|website=gulfnews.com|language=en|access-date=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412182103/https://gulfnews.com/business/dubai-firm-to-transform-asias-biggest-slum-1.62097740|archive-date=12 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On setting up of the SPV, the private firm will have to bring in the equity of Rs 400 crore, while the state government will invest another Rs 100 crore.

Following the empowered committee\u2019s nod, the senior state officials said that an MoU will soon be executed between the state government, and the Dharavi Redevelopment Project Authority (DRPA) and the company. With an almost estimated cost of over Rs 26,000 crore, the Dharavi makeover project is the biggest brownfield redevelopment project in India.

Dharavi is southern end of Ward H East, and other residential and commercial areas in the Ward marked in dark blue include [[Santacruz, Mumbai|Santacruz]], [[Vile Parle]] and [[Mahim]].]]\nDharavi is a large area situated between Mumbai's two main suburban railway lines, the Western and Central Railways. To the west of Dharavi are [[Mahim]] and [[Bandra]], and to the north lies the [[Mithi River]]. The Mithi River empties into the [[Arabian Sea]] through the [[Mahim Creek]]. The area of [[Antop Hill]] lies to the east while the locality called [[Matunga]] is located in the South. Due to its location and poor sewage and drainage systems, Dharavi particularly becomes vulnerable to floods during the [[wet season]].\n\nDharavi is considered one of the largest slums in the world. The low-rise building style and narrow street structure of the area make Dharavi very cramped and confined. Like most slums, it is overpopulated. Compared to Mumbai's urban [[floor space index]] (FSI) of a range from 5 to 15, in Dharavi it is about 13.3 [[citation needed]]. Government officials are considering changing the Dharavi's floor space index to 4. Despite the expensive Mumbai lifestyle, Dharavi provides a cheap alternative where rent is as low as Rs.1000 per month.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Image:An embroidery unit in Dharavi, Mumbai.jpg|thumb|left|An embroidery unit in Dharavi.]]\nIn addition to the traditional [[pottery]] and textile industries in Dharavi,<ref name=\"natgeo\"/> there is an increasingly large [[recycling]] industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of [[Mumbai]].

Water access derives from public standpipes stationed throughout the slum. Additionally, with the limited lavatories they have, they are extremely filthy and broken down to the point of being unsafe. Mahim Creek is a local river that is widely used by local residents for urination and defecation causing the spread of contagious diseases.<ref name=\"natgeo\"/> The open sewers in the city drain to the creek causing a spike in water pollutants, septic conditions, and foul odors. Due to the air pollutants, diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and asthma are common among residents. There are government proposals in regards to improving Dharavi's sanitation issues. The residents have a section where they wash their clothes in water that people defecate in. This spreads the amount of disease as doctors have to deal with over 4,000 cases of typhoid a day. There is also an average of 1 toilet per 500 people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Epidemics and other disasters==\nDharavi has experienced a long history of epidemics and natural disasters, sometimes with significant loss of lives.

Inside the huts, it is, however, very clean, and some huts share some elements of beauty.

In the 1850s, after decades of urban growth under [[East India Company]] and [[British Raj]], the city's population reached half a million. The urban area then covered mostly the southern extension of Mumbai peninsula, the population density was over 10 times higher than London at that time.<ref name=jn2010>Jan Nijman, A STUDY OF SPACE IN MUMBAI'S SLUMS, Tijdschrift Voor economic en social geographies, Volume 101, Issue 1, pages 4\u201317, February 2010</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanty dwellings, Railway tracks and Mosque in Dharavi Slum Mumbai India February 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Shanty dwellings next to railway tracks in Dharavi (about 2010).

The railway network provides mass transit to the slum residents.]]\nThe most polluting industries were tanneries, and the first tannery moved from peninsular Mumbai into Dharavi in 1887. People who worked with leather, typically a profession of lowest Hindu castes and of Muslim Indians, moved into Dharavi. Other early settlers included the Kumbars, a large Gujarati community of potters (another polluting industry). The colonial government granted them a 99-year land-lease in 1895. Rural migrants looking for jobs poured into Mumbai, and its population soared past 1 million. Other artisans, like the [[embroidery]] workers from [[Uttar Pradesh]], started the ready-made garments trade.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/> These industries created jobs, labor moved in, but there was no government effort to plan or invest in any infrastructure in or near Dharavi. The living quarters and small scale factories grew haphazardly, without provision for sanitation, drains, safe drinking water, roads or other basic services. But some ethnic, caste and religious communities that have settled in Dharavi at that time helped build the settlement of Dharavi, by forming organizations and political parties, building school and temples, constructing homes and factories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Dharavi's first mosque, Badi Masjid, started in 1887 and the oldest Hindu temple, Ganesh Mandir, was built in 1913.<ref name=jn2010/>\n\n===Post-independence===\nAt India's independence from colonial rule in 1947, Dharavi had grown to be the largest slum in Mumbai and all of India. It still had a few empty spaces, which continued to serve as waste-dumping grounds for operators across the city.<ref name=jn2010/> Mumbai, meanwhile, continued to grow as a city. Soon Dharavi was surrounded by the city, and became a key hub for informal economy.<ref>, Eyre, L. (1990), The shanty towns of central Bombay.

Concerns have also been raised by residents who fear that some of their small businesses in the \"informal\" sector may not be relocated under the redevelopment plan.

Dharavi is southern end of Ward H East, and other residential and commercial areas in the Ward marked in dark blue include [[Santacruz, Mumbai|Santacruz]], [[Vile Parle]] and [[Mahim]].]]\nDharavi is a large area situated between Mumbai's two main suburban railway lines, the Western and Central Railways. To the west of Dharavi are [[Mahim]] and [[Bandra]], and to the north lies the [[Mithi River]]. The Mithi River empties into the [[Arabian Sea]] through the [[Mahim Creek]]. The area of [[Antop Hill]] lies to the east while the locality called [[Matunga]] is located in the South. Due to its location and poor sewage and drainage systems, Dharavi particularly becomes vulnerable to floods during the [[wet season]].\n\nDharavi is considered one of the largest slums in the world. The low-rise building style and narrow street structure of the area make Dharavi very cramped and confined. Like most slums, it is overpopulated. Compared to Mumbai's urban [[floor space index]] (FSI) of a range from 5 to 15, in Dharavi it is about 13.3 [[citation needed]]. Government officials are considering changing the Dharavi's floor space index to 4. Despite the expensive Mumbai lifestyle, Dharavi provides a cheap alternative where rent is as low as Rs.1000 per month.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Image:An embroidery unit in Dharavi, Mumbai.jpg|thumb|left|An embroidery unit in Dharavi.]]\nIn addition to the traditional [[pottery]] and textile industries in Dharavi,<ref name=\"natgeo\"/> there is an increasingly large [[recycling]] industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of [[Mumbai]].

Water access derives from public standpipes stationed throughout the slum. Additionally, with the limited lavatories they have, they are extremely filthy and broken down to the point of being unsafe. Mahim Creek is a local river that is widely used by local residents for urination and defecation causing the spread of contagious diseases.<ref name=\"natgeo\"/> The open sewers in the city drain to the creek causing a spike in water pollutants, septic conditions, and foul odors. Due to the air pollutants, diseases such as lung cancer, tuberculosis, and asthma are common among residents. There are government proposals in regards to improving Dharavi's sanitation issues. The residents have a section where they wash their clothes in water that people defecate in. This spreads the amount of disease as doctors have to deal with over 4,000 cases of typhoid a day. There is also an average of 1 toilet per 500 people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Epidemics and other disasters==\nDharavi has experienced a long history of epidemics and natural disasters, sometimes with significant loss of lives.

Inside the huts, it is, however, very clean, and some huts share some elements of beauty.
