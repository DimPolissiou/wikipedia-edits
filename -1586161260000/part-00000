{"title_page": "Bids for Olympic Games", "text_new": "{{Olympic Games infobox}}\n'''Bids for Olympic Games''' is the process where National Olympic Committees select from within their national territory cities to put forward bids to host an [[Olympic Games]]. The staging of the [[Paralympic Games]] is automatically included in the bid.<ref name=agreement/> Since the creation of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894, which successfully appropriated the name of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Ancient Greek Olympics]] to create a modern sporting event, interested cities have rivaled for selection as host of the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] or [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter]] Olympic Games.\n\nWhat follows is a list of the cities that have bid to host any of the Summer and Winter Olympics. 50 cities (including repeats) have been chosen to host the Olympics since their \"rebirth\"; two in [[Eastern Europe]], five in [[East Asia]], one in [[South America]], two in [[Oceania]] and the remainder in [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]. No [[Central America]]n, [[Africa]]n, [[Central Asia]]n, [[Middle East]]ern, [[South Asia]]n, or [[Southeast Asia]]n city has ever been chosen to host an Olympics. That is a result of the fact that Western countries are more prepared to host the Olympics and are able to stage profitable Games. Furthermore, Western countries are democracies, and that is also a factor.\n\nThe decision is made at an [[IOC Session]] seven years and eleven years to the games; for example, the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] were awarded to [[Tokyo]] on 7 September 2013, the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] were awarded to [[Beijing]] on 31 July 2015, the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] were awarded to [[Paris]] on 13 September 2017, the [[2026 Winter Olympics]] were awarded to [[Milan]]-[[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] on 24 June 2019 and the [[2028 Summer Olympics]] were awarded to [[Los Angeles]] on 13 September 2017.\n\n==IOC \u2013 IPC co-operation==\nIn June 2001, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the [[Paralympic Games]] is automatically included in the bid for the [[Olympic Games]].<ref name=agreement>[http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html IPC-IOC Co-operation], The official website of the [[International Paralympic Committee]]</ref> The agreement came into effect at the [[2008 Paralympic Summer Games]] in Beijing, and the [[2010 Paralympic Winter Games]] in Vancouver.  However, the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee]] (SLOC), chose to follow the practice of \"one bid, one city\" already at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, with one [[Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games|Organizing Committee]] for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Games in Athens and Turin in 2006.  The agreement was adjusted in 2003. An extension was signed in June 2006.<ref name=agreement/>\n\n==Summer Olympics bids==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2| Games\n!rowspan=2| Year\n!colspan=2| Candidate cities\n!rowspan=2| Non-candidate<br />applicant cities{{efn-lr|name=Shortlist|Those bids which were not shortlisted for the second and final bidding phase.}}\n!rowspan=2| IOC session\n|-\n!

The selection was made at the 70th IOC Session in [[Amsterdam]] on 12 May 1970. In a [[1972 Denver Winter Olympics referendum|statewide referendum]] on 7 November 1972, [[Colorado]] voters rejected funding for the games, and for the only time a city awarded the Games rejected them. Denver officially withdrew on 15 November, and the IOC then offered the games to [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]], Canada, but they too declined owing to a [[1972 British Columbia general election|change of government]] following elections.  Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]'s successful bid for the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games]]. [[Salt Lake City]] offered to host the games, but the IOC, still reeling from the Denver rejection, declined and selected [[Innsbruck]] to host the 1976 Winter Olympics, which had hosted the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] games twelve years earlier, on 5 February 1973.

The staging of the [[Paralympic Games]] is automatically included in the bid.<ref name=agreement/> Since the creation of the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) in 1894, which successfully appropriated the name of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Ancient Greek Olympics]] to create a modern sporting event, interested cities have rivaled for selection as host of the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] or [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter]] Olympic Games.\n\nWhat follows is a list of the cities that have bid to host any of the Summer and Winter Olympics. 50 cities (including repeats) have been chosen to host the Olympics since their \"rebirth\"; two in [[Eastern Europe]], five in [[East Asia]], one in [[South America]], two in [[Oceania]] and the remainder in [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]]. No [[Central America]]n, [[Africa]]n, [[Central Asia]]n, [[Middle East]]ern, [[South Asia]]n, or [[Southeast Asia]]n city has ever been chosen to host an Olympics. That is a result of the fact that Western countries are more prepared to host the Olympics and are able to stage profitable Games. Furthermore, Western countries are democracies, and that is also a factor.\n\nThe decision is made at an [[IOC Session]] seven years and eleven years to the games; for example, the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] were awarded to [[Tokyo]] on 7 September 2013, the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] were awarded to [[Beijing]] on 31 July 2015, the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] were awarded to [[Paris]] on 13 September 2017, the [[2026 Winter Olympics]] were awarded to [[Milan]]-[[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] on 24 June 2019 and the [[2028 Summer Olympics]] were awarded to [[Los Angeles]] on 13 September 2017.\n\n==IOC \u2013 IPC co-operation==\nIn June 2001, the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the [[Paralympic Games]] is automatically included in the bid for the [[Olympic Games]].<ref name=agreement>[http://www.paralympic.org/IPC/IPC-IOC_Co-operation.html IPC-IOC Co-operation], The official website of the [[International Paralympic Committee]]</ref> The agreement came into effect at the [[2008 Paralympic Summer Games]] in Beijing, and the [[2010 Paralympic Winter Games]] in Vancouver.  However, the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee]] (SLOC), chose to follow the practice of \"one bid, one city\" already at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, with one [[Organizing Committees for the Olympic Games|Organizing Committee]] for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Games in Athens and Turin in 2006.

the 1976 Winter Olympics consisted of four bids, and saw [[Denver]], United States, selected ahead of [[Sion, Switzerland|Sion]], Switzerland; [[Tampere]], Finland; and [[Vancouver]], Canada. The selection was made at the 70th IOC Session in [[Amsterdam]] on 12 May 1970. In a [[1972 Denver Winter Olympics referendum|statewide referendum]] on 7 November 1972, [[Colorado]] voters rejected funding for the games, and for the only time a city awarded the Games rejected them. Denver officially withdrew on 15 November, and the IOC then offered the games to [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]], Canada, but they too declined owing to a [[1972 British Columbia general election|change of government]] following elections.  Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]'s successful bid for the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games]]. [[Salt Lake City]] offered to host the games, but the IOC, still reeling from the Denver rejection, declined and selected [[Innsbruck]] to host the 1976 Winter Olympics, which had hosted the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] games twelve years earlier, on 5 February 1973. Salt Lake City would then host the Winter Olympics in [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/innsbruck-1976-winter-olympics |title=Innsbruck 1976 |work=Games

The storyline was that Bundy and Studd, along with Heenan, claimed that the Giant Machine was a masked Andre the Giant, and was competing under the mask and alias to circumvent an earlier suspension (due to no-showing for an event), but none of them ever proved that Andre and the Giant Machine were one and the same. Eventually, Bundy and Studd began teaming up with Heenan in a series of six-man tag team matches against the Machines (usually, Big and Super; as Andre's health was starting to deteriorate at this time, the Giant Machine made occasional appearances, but more often than not, it was either Captain [[Lou Albano]] or a number of popular faces\u2014often, Hogan, [[Roddy Piper]] and others\u2014who teamed with the other Machines). Bundy and Studd were regularly beaten, but won their last match over the Super-Big version of the Machines at Madison Square Garden. Also in the latter half of 1986, Bundy and Studd received shots at the WWF Tag Team Championship against [[The British Bulldogs]], but were unsuccessful, often losing by disqualification. Studd left the WWF shortly after their last match with the Machines, and Bundy went back to singles competition.\n\nAt [[WrestleMania III]], Bundy was involved in a mixed six-man tag team match, teaming up with [[Midget professional wrestler|midget wrestlers]] [[Shigeri Akabane|Little Tokyo]] and [[Eric Tovey|Lord Littlebrook]] against [[Hillbilly Jim]], the [[Raymond Kessler|Haiti Kid]] and [[Lionel Giroux|Little Beaver]]. During the match, after being pestered by Beaver, Bundy body-slammed him and delivered a big elbow, causing his team's disqualification and his own tag partners to turn against him.<ref name=\"WM III\">{{cite news|title=WrestleMania III Results|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/results/|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1-4165-3257-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/81 81]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/81}}</ref> At the [[King of the Ring (1987)|1987 King of the Ring]] on September 4, Bundy made it to the finals of the [[King of the Ring tournament]], where he was defeated by [[Randy Savage]].

Although no longer appearing on the WWF's syndicated TV shows, Bundy continued to wrestle house shows in early 1988 (often losing to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]); his last match during his initial WWF run was a televised match at [[Madison Square Garden]] in February 1988, teaming up with One Man Gang in a loss to [[Don Muraco]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]].\n\n=== Semi-retirement (1988\u20131994) ===\nAfter leaving the WWF in 1988, Bundy went into semi-retirement, wrestling only a handful of matches. In 1993, he wrestled in the main event of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]]'s inaugural [[November to Remember#1993|November to Remember]] [[Card (sports)#Supercard|supercard]], appearing as the mystery tag team partner of [[Terry Funk]] in a losing effort against [[Road Warrior Hawk]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]].

In April 1997, he resurfaced in magazines when he joined a faction managed by [[Kenny Casanova]] called \"Camp Casanova\" along with \"Danger\" Dave DeJohn and the Masked Maniac at times in USWF, NBW, and USA Power Pro Wrestling. In a match against \"the Seven Foot Tall\" Primo Canera III, Bundy knee-dropped his opponent and then \"Bundy-splashed\" him. The impact actually broke the ring, leaving the two grapplers in a pit in the center of the squared circle. This independent footage was picked up by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''.\n\nHis feuds against [[Jimmy Snuka|\"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka]], [[Doink the Clown]], and [[Tom Brandi]] were among many main events in the northeast independent circuit. In 1999, at the Kolf Arena in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] he won the [[WSL World Heavyweight Championship|AWA Superstars of Wrestling Heavyweight Championship]] from Jonnie Stewart. Later that same year, Bundy the reigning AWA heavyweight champion wrestled again headlining an AWA \"Super Event\" at the [[Dee Events Center]] in Ogden, Utah. That night ended differently for Bundy, losing a \"bodyslam match\" to Koszmar Polski who was managed by [[Ken Patera]]. Bundy still wrestled across the country, primarily in the Southern and Eastern United States. He continued to be a headliner and a crowd favorite at all events he attended.

The storyline was that Bundy and Studd, along with Heenan, claimed that the Giant Machine was a masked Andre the Giant, and was competing under the mask and alias to circumvent an earlier suspension (due to no-showing for an event), but none of them ever proved that Andre and the Giant Machine were one and the same. Eventually, Bundy and Studd began teaming up with Heenan in a series of six-man tag team matches against the Machines (usually, Big and Super; as Andre's health was starting to deteriorate at this time, the Giant Machine made occasional appearances, but more often than not, it was either Captain [[Lou Albano]] or a number of popular faces\u2014often, Hogan, [[Roddy Piper]] and others\u2014who teamed with the other Machines). Bundy and Studd were regularly beaten, but won their last match over the Super-Big version of the Machines at Madison Square Garden. Also in the latter half of 1986, Bundy and Studd received shots at the WWF Tag Team Championship against [[The British Bulldogs]], but were unsuccessful, often losing by disqualification. Studd left the WWF shortly after their last match with the Machines, and Bundy went back to singles competition.\n\nAt [[WrestleMania III]], Bundy was involved in a mixed six-man tag team match, teaming up with [[Midget professional wrestler|midget wrestlers]] [[Shigeri Akabane|Little Tokyo]] and [[Eric Tovey|Lord Littlebrook]] against [[Hillbilly Jim]], the [[Raymond Kessler|Haiti Kid]] and [[Lionel Giroux|Little Beaver]]. During the match, after being pestered by Beaver, Bundy body-slammed him and delivered a big elbow, causing his team's disqualification and his own tag partners to turn against him.<ref name=\"WM III\">{{cite news|title=WrestleMania III Results|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/results/|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1-4165-3257-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/81 81]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/81}}</ref> At the [[King of the Ring (1987)|1987 King of the Ring]] on September 4, Bundy made it to the finals of the [[King of the Ring tournament]], where he was defeated by [[Randy Savage]].

Although no longer appearing on the WWF's syndicated TV shows, Bundy continued to wrestle house shows in early 1988 (often losing to [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]); his last match during his initial WWF run was a televised match at [[Madison Square Garden]] in February 1988, teaming up with One Man Gang in a loss to [[Don Muraco]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]].\n\n=== Semi-retirement (1988\u20131994) ===\nAfter leaving the WWF in 1988, Bundy went into semi-retirement, wrestling only a handful of matches. In 1993, he wrestled in the main event of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]]'s inaugural [[November to Remember#1993|November to Remember]] [[Card (sports)#Supercard|supercard]], appearing as the mystery tag team partner of [[Terry Funk]] in a losing effort against [[Road Warrior Hawk]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. On May 13, 1994, Bundy defeated [[The Godfather (wrestler)|Papa Shango]] at NWA New Jersey.

In April 1997, he resurfaced in magazines when he joined a faction managed by [[Kenny Casanova]] called \"Camp Casanova\" along with \"Danger\" Dave DeJohn and the Masked Maniac at times in USWF, NBW, and USA Power Pro Wrestling. In a match against \"the Seven Foot Tall\" Primo Canera III, Bundy knee-dropped his opponent and then \"Bundy-splashed\" him. The impact actually broke the ring, leaving the two grapplers in a pit in the center of the squared circle. This independent footage was picked up by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''.\n\nHis feuds against [[Jimmy Snuka|\"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka]], [[Doink the Clown]], and [[Tom Brandi]] were among many main events in the northeast independent circuit. In 1999, at the Kolf Arena in [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] he won the [[WSL World Heavyweight Championship|AWA Superstars of Wrestling Heavyweight Championship]] from Jonnie Stewart. Later that same year, Bundy the reigning AWA heavyweight champion wrestled again headlining an AWA \"Super Event\" at the [[Dee Events Center]] in Ogden, Utah. That night ended differently for Bundy, losing a \"bodyslam match\" to Koszmar Polski who was managed by [[Ken Patera]]. Bundy still wrestled across the country, primarily in the Southern and Eastern United States. He continued to be a headliner and a crowd favorite at all events he attended. King Kong Bundy's last match is thought to have been at the Legends of Wrestling Show at the Pulaski County Fair in Somerset, Kentucky in 2007. Bundy lost to [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] in the main event.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |English commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe Firefly Fun House match between \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt and John Cena was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt and Cena suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering in an [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] shirt. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (with [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. McIntyre then countered an F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks to win the match and the championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |English commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe Firefly Fun House match between \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt and John Cena was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt and Cena suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering in an [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] shirt. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (with [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. McIntyre then countered an F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks to win the match and the championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.
