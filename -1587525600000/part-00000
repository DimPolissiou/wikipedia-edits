He was considered the leader of the [[Family Compact]], a group of families which effectively controlled the early government of Upper Canada.\n\n==Life and career==\nRobinson was born in 1791 at Berthier, [[Lower Canada]], the son of [[Christopher Robinson (Upper Canada politician)|Christopher Robinson]], a [[United Empire Loyalist]] of one of the [[First Families of Virginia]], whose ancestor, also named [[Christopher Robinson (planter and politician)|Christopher Robinson]], came there about 1666 as secretary to Sir [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]], [[Governor of Virginia]]. In 1792, the family moved to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in Upper Canada and then York (later renamed [[Toronto]]). After his father's death in 1798, he was sent to live and study in Kingston. In 1803, he moved to [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], where he lived and was educated at the school of the Reverend [[John Strachan]]. Afterwards he articled in law with [[D\u2019Arcy Boulton (1759-1834)|D\u2019Arcy Boulton]] and later [[John Macdonell]].\n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], he served with [[Isaac Brock]] and fought at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]. On the death of John Macdonell, he became acting attorney general for the province at the age of 21. He prosecuted the case of 18 settlers from [[Norfolk County, Ontario|Norfolk County]] who had committed treason by taking up arms against their neighbours on behalf of the [[United States|Americans]] in a series of trials later referred to as the \"[[Bloody Assize (1814)|Bloody Assize]]\". When D\u2019Arcy Boulton returned to Canada in 1814, Robinson was given the post of attorney general.\n\nRobinson acquired property on the north-east corner of John and Richmond streets in Toronto and built the prominent Beverley House.  Originally built as a small cottage around the time of the War of 1812, he added numerous wings to the property until the alterations filled the square.  Robinson lived in Beverley House until his death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 5: History of Beverley House|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/history-of-beverley-house/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto Revisited}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, Robinson was retained by the [[North West Company]] in their civil case against [[Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk|Lord Selkirk]]. When the company decided to press for criminal charges of theft and assault against Selkirk, Robinson prosecuted the case. Although he returned the company's retainer, there were allegations of [[conflict of interest]]. Robinson also represented the Crown in the case against [[Robert Fleming Gourlay]], a reformer critical of government policies. Gourlay was eventually banished from the province.\n\nIn 1820, Robinson was elected to the [[8th Parliament of Upper Canada]] representing the town of [[Toronto|York]]. Robinson played an important role in the expulsion of [[Barnabas Bidwell]], a former member of the [[United States Congress]] who was elected in a by-election in [[Lennox County, Ontario|Lennox]] & [[Addington County, Ontario|Addington]], from the Legislative Assembly. Robinson sailed to [[England]] in 1822, seeking to resolve problems with funding in the province. This culminated in the Canada Trade Act of August 1822 which established import duties on goods transported between the United States and Upper Canada, and Upper Canada's share of duties collected. During his time in England, he was also [[called to the bar]] after completing studies at [[Lincoln's Inn]].\n\nRobinson was the most important member of the [[Family Compact]], an unofficial clique of Upper Canada's elite, who held the true power in the province. One of the more contentious issues dealt with in the [[9th Parliament of Upper Canada|9th Parliament]] was the naturalization process for persons who had remained in the United States after 1783 and later came to Canada. Robinson supported a policy dictated by the British Colonial Office which required these people to renounce their American citizenship. He was embarrassed when a new colonial secretary reversed this decision under pressure from those who held opposing views. In 1827 Robinson had a disagreement with [[John Walpole Willis]], a [[puisne judge]]. Willis took an unusual course of stating in court that Robinson had neglected his duty and that he would feel it necessary \"to make a representation on the subject to his majesty's government\". Willis also took a strong stand on the question of the legality of the court as then constituted, and this led in June 1828 to Willis being removed from his position by the lieutenant-governor, [[Peregrine Maitland|Sir Peregrine Maitland]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Wills, John Walpole|work=[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]] |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogWe-Wy.html#willis1 |editor=[[Percival Serle]]|publisher= Angus and Robertson |year=1949}}</ref>\n\nIn 1829, Robinson became chief justice of the Court of King's Bench and held this post for 34 years. In 1830, he was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of Upper Canada|Legislative Council]] for the province. In the aftermath of [[Upper Canada Rebellion]], he pressed for executions of the rebel leaders, including [[Peter Matthews (rebel)]] and [[Samuel Lount]] (to quote: \"in his Opinion it was necessary for the ends of Justice, and due to the Loyal Inhabitants of the Province, that some examples should be made in the way of Capital punishments\"). Although he opposed the uniting of Upper and Lower Canada, several of his recommendations found their way into the [[Act of Union 1840|Union Act of 1840]]. In 1850, he was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB)<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=21156 |date=22 November 1850 |page=3095}}</ref> and created a [[baronet]] in 1854.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=21588 |date=29 August 1854 |page=2668}}</ref>\n\nRobinson married Emma Walker on June 5, 1817 while in England. They had four sons and three daughters. Three sons became lawyers. His youngest son attained the rank of major-general in the British Army. His second son, [[John Beverley Robinson]], entered politics, serving as [[Mayor of Toronto]], as a member of cabinet in the federal government and was appointed lieutenant governor of Ontario in the 1880s.\n\nHe was a first cousin of Sir [[Frederick Philipse Robinson]]. His brother [[William Benjamin Robinson]] married Elizabeth Ann, daughter of [[William Jarvis (Upper Canada official)]], and his elder sister Mary married Major Stephen Heward, formerly of the [[Grenadier Guards]] and later Auditor-General of [[Upper Canada]]. His younger sister Esther married D'Arcy Boulton (1785\u20131846), the son of [[G. D'Arcy Boulton]], who built [[The Grange (Toronto)]] and also served as Auditor-General of Upper Canada. He was the stepson of [[Elisha Beman]], one of the important founders of [[Newmarket, Ontario]].\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Robinson suffered a severe attack of gout and curtailed his work on the bench. He resigned from the Queen\u2019s Bench on March 15, 1862, and was appointed presiding judge of the Court of Error and Appeal. Later in 1862, he had another attack of gout and finally retired in January 1863. On January 28, Bishop Strachan gave him communion, and he died three days later.\n\nRobinson Street in Simcoe, Ontario is named is his honour.\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4676 ROBINSON, Sir JOHN BEVERLEY] at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online''\n<references/>\n\n==External

He was considered the leader of the [[Family Compact]], a group of families which effectively controlled the early government of Upper Canada.\n\n==Life==\nRobinson was born in 1791 at Berthier, [[Lower Canada]], the son of [[Christopher Robinson (Upper Canada politician)|Christopher Robinson]], a [[United Empire Loyalist]] of one of the [[First Families of Virginia]], whose ancestor, also named [[Christopher Robinson (planter and politician)|Christopher Robinson]], came there about 1666 as secretary to Sir [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]], [[Governor of Virginia]]. In 1792, the family moved to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in Upper Canada and then York (later renamed [[Toronto]]). After his father's death in 1798, he was sent to live and study in Kingston. In 1803, he moved to [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], where he lived and was educated at the school of the Reverend [[John Strachan]]. Afterwards he articled in law with [[D\u2019Arcy Boulton (1759-1834)|D\u2019Arcy Boulton]] and later [[John Macdonell]].\n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]], he served with [[Isaac Brock]] and fought at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]]. On the death of John Macdonell, he became acting attorney general for the province at the age of 21. He prosecuted the case of 18 settlers from [[Norfolk County, Ontario|Norfolk County]] who had committed treason by taking up arms against their neighbours on behalf of the [[United States|Americans]] in a series of trials later referred to as the \"[[Bloody Assize (1814)|Bloody Assize]]\". When D\u2019Arcy Boulton returned to Canada in 1814, Robinson was given the post of attorney general.\n\nRobinson acquired property on the north-east corner of John and Richmond streets in Toronto and built the prominent Beverley House.  Originally built as a small cottage around the time of the War of 1812, he added numerous wings to the property until the alterations filled the square.  Robinson lived in Beverley House until his death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 5: History of Beverley House|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/history-of-beverley-house/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto Revisited}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, Robinson was retained by the [[North West Company]] in their civil case against [[Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk|Lord Selkirk]]. When the company decided to press for criminal charges of theft and assault against Selkirk, Robinson prosecuted the case. Although he returned the company's retainer, there were allegations of [[conflict of interest]]. Robinson also represented the Crown in the case against [[Robert Fleming Gourlay]], a reformer critical of government policies. Gourlay was eventually banished from the province.\n\nIn 1820, Robinson was elected to the [[8th Parliament of Upper Canada]] representing the town of [[Toronto|York]]. Robinson played an important role in the expulsion of [[Barnabas Bidwell]], a former member of the [[United States Congress]] who was elected in a by-election in [[Lennox County, Ontario|Lennox]] & [[Addington County, Ontario|Addington]], from the Legislative Assembly. Robinson sailed to [[England]] in 1822, seeking to resolve problems with funding in the province. This culminated in the Canada Trade Act of August 1822 which established import duties on goods transported between the United States and Upper Canada, and Upper Canada's share of duties collected. During his time in England, he was also [[called to the bar]] after completing studies at [[Lincoln's Inn]].\n\nRobinson was the most important member of the [[Family Compact]], an unofficial clique of Upper Canada's elite, who held the true power in the province. One of the more contentious issues dealt with in the [[9th Parliament of Upper Canada|9th Parliament]] was the naturalization process for persons who had remained in the United States after 1783 and later came to Canada. Robinson supported a policy dictated by the British Colonial Office which required these people to renounce their American citizenship. He was embarrassed when a new colonial secretary reversed this decision under pressure from those who held opposing views. In 1827 Robinson had a disagreement with [[John Walpole Willis]], a [[puisne judge]]. Willis took an unusual course of stating in court that Robinson had neglected his duty and that he would feel it necessary \"to make a representation on the subject to his majesty's government\". Willis also took a strong stand on the question of the legality of the court as then constituted, and this led in June 1828 to Willis being removed from his position by the lieutenant-governor, [[Peregrine Maitland|Sir Peregrine Maitland]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Wills, John Walpole|work=[[Dictionary of Australian Biography]] |url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogWe-Wy.html#willis1 |editor=[[Percival Serle]]|publisher= Angus and Robertson |year=1949}}</ref>\n\nIn 1829, Robinson became chief justice of the Court of King's Bench and held this post for 34 years. In 1830, he was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of Upper Canada|Legislative Council]] for the province. In the aftermath of [[Upper Canada Rebellion]], he pressed for executions of the rebel leaders, including [[Peter Matthews (rebel)]] and [[Samuel Lount]] (to quote: \"in his Opinion it was necessary for the ends of Justice, and due to the Loyal Inhabitants of the Province, that some examples should be made in the way of Capital punishments\"). Although he opposed the uniting of Upper and Lower Canada, several of his recommendations found their way into the [[Act of Union 1840|Union Act of 1840]]. In 1850, he was appointed a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB)<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=21156 |date=22 November 1850 |page=3095}}</ref> and created a [[baronet]] in 1854.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=21588 |date=29 August 1854 |page=2668}}</ref>\n\nRobinson married Emma Walker on June 5, 1817 while in England. They had four sons and three daughters. Three sons became lawyers. His youngest son attained the rank of major-general in the British Army. His second son, [[John Beverley Robinson]], entered politics, serving as [[Mayor of Toronto]], as a member of cabinet in the federal government and was appointed lieutenant governor of Ontario in the 1880s.\n\nHe was a first cousin of Sir [[Frederick Philipse Robinson]]. His brother [[William Benjamin Robinson]] married Elizabeth Ann, daughter of [[William Jarvis (Upper Canada official)]], and his elder sister Mary married Major Stephen Heward, formerly of the [[Grenadier Guards]] and later Auditor-General of [[Upper Canada]]. His younger sister Esther married D'Arcy Boulton (1785\u20131846), the son of [[G. D'Arcy Boulton]], who built [[The Grange (Toronto)]] and also served as Auditor-General of Upper Canada. He was the stepson of [[Elisha Beman]], one of the important founders of [[Newmarket, Ontario]].\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Robinson suffered a severe attack of gout and curtailed his work on the bench. He resigned from the Queen\u2019s Bench on March 15, 1862, and was appointed presiding judge of the Court of Error and Appeal. Later in 1862, he had another attack of gout and finally retired in January 1863. On January 28, Bishop Strachan gave him communion, and he died three days later.\n\nRobinson Street in Simcoe, Ontario is named is his honour.\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=4676 ROBINSON, Sir JOHN BEVERLEY] at the ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online''\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/library/FindingAids/PF27.pdf Finding aid to the \"John Beverley Robinson fonds\" at the Archives of the Law Society of Upper Canada]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192300/http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/library/Robinson/intro.htm The John Beverley Robinson Letterbook] Exhibit produced by the [[Law Society of Upper Canada Archives]]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-legal}}\n{{succession box|\nbefore=Sir [[William Campbell (jurist)]]<br/>1825\u20131829|\ntitle=[[Chief Justice of Ontario|Chief Justice of Upper Canada (1829\u20131841) and Canada West (1841\u20131862)]] |\nyears='''1829\u20131862''' |\nafter=[[William Henry Draper (judge)|William Henry Draper]]<br/>1862\u20131867\n}}\n{{s-aca}}\n{{s-new|reason=college founded}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the [[University of Trinity College]]|\n  years=1852\u20131863}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[John Hillyard Cameron]]}}\n{{s-reg|uk-bt}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Robinson Baronets|Baronet]]<br>'''(of Toronto)''' | years=1854\u20131863 | before= New creation |  after=James Lukin Robinson}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{| border=\"1\" align=\"center\"\n|----- align=\"center\"\n| width=\"30%\" |\nPreceded by:<br>[[William Jarvis (Upper Canada official)|William Jarvis]]\n| [[Provincial Secretary of Upper Canada]] 1817\u20131838\n| width=\"30%\" |\nSucceeded by:<br>[[Robert Baldwin Sullivan]]\n|}\n\n{{Ontario Attorneys General}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robinson, John}}\n[[Category:1791 births]]\n[[Category:1863 deaths]]\n[[Category:Attorneys-General of Upper Canada]]\n[[Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Canadian Anglicans]]\n[[Category:Canadian baronets]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of Upper Canada]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath]]\n[[Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]]\n[[Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada]]\n[[Category:People from Old Toronto]]\n[[Category:People of United Empire Loyalist descent]]\n[[Category:Province of Canada judges]]\n", "name_user": "Blairall", "label": "safe", "comment": "added a heading", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Robinson,_1st_Baronet,_of_Toronto"}

In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi''). Prominent French language newspapers included ''Saigon Eco'', the only that currently is published is ''[[Le Courrier du Vietnam]]''.

The latest payTV supplier is K+ which is a joint venture between Vietnam Cable Television (VTVCab) and [[Canal+]], first broadcast in later 2009 via [[Direct To Home]] (DTH), and An Vi\u00ean Television Service, owned by Audio Visual Global JSC, first broadcast in 2011 via both [[DVB-T2]] [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) and [[Direct To Home]] (DTH)\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:Vovlogo.png|270x270px|right]]\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nPrior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the [[French Indochina|French colonial government]], which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s.\n\nVietnam's national radio station, now called the [[Voice of Vietnam]], started broadcasting from Hanoi just a week after the declaration of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Viet Nam]].\n\n[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.\n\nFollowing [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\nToday, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media. It broadcasts on many channels, repeated on [[AM broadcasting|Medium wave (MW) AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[shortwave|shortwave (SW) AM]] bands throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world:\n* VOV1 (MW and SW) - news, current affairs and music\n* VOV2 (MW and SW) - cultural and artistic programs\n* VOV3 (FM) - music & entertainment\n* VOV4 (MW) - [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic minority language]] programming\n* VOV5 (MW) - world service broadcasts in 11 foreign languages\n* VOV Transportation (FM) - updating information during rush hours to help people travel smoothly through traffic jams.\n* VOV English 24/7 (FM) - English-language programs\n* VOV 89 (FM) - health and safety consumering\n* VOV News - a website containing news and other aspects\n* VOVTV( Television Channel)- nationally broadcast which aims at delivering update news every 30 minutes per program\n* VOV newspaper 'the Voice of Vietnam'- a printed version with more in-depth contents of VOVnews website\nAs of 2004, it was estimated that VOV's programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam.\n\nIn addition, most cities and provinces has their own radio stations.\n* *[https://web.archive.org/web/20140201193140/http://www.delicest.com/2013/09/radio-stations-viet-nam-nghe-truc-tuyen.html Vietnam Radio Stations Online Full List Updated 2013 ] Listen all Vietnam AM / FM Radio Stations Online\n\n==Newspapers==\nAs Vietnam moves toward a free-market economy with its [[doi moi]] measures, the government has relied on the print media to keep the public informed about its policies. The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi''). Prominent French language newspapers included ''Saigon Eco'', the only that currently is published is ''[[Le Courrier du Vietnam]]''. There are other, smaller provincial newspapers such as the ''[[Ba Ria Vung Tau Daily Newspaper]]''.\n\nThe largest online newspapers are [[Zing.vn]], [[VnExpress]], [[VietNamNet]], [[Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb]], [[Thanh Ni\u00ean]], [[D\u00e2n Tr\u00ed]], [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation|VTC News]], and [[Vietnam News Agency|VietnamPlus]].

Batu was a son of [[Jochi]] and grandson of [[Genghis Khan]].  His ''ulus'' was the chief state of the Golden Horde, which ruled [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], [[Volga Bulgaria]], [[Cumania]], and the [[Caucasus]] for around 250 years, after also destroying the armies of Poland and Hungary. ''Batu'' or ''Bat'' literally means \"firm\" in the [[Mongolian language]]. After the deaths of Genghis Khan's sons, he became the most respected prince, called ''agha'' (\"elder brother\"), in the Mongol Empire.\n\n==Personality and appearance==\nAccording to [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], Batu was \"kind enough to his own people, but he is greatly feared by them. He is, however, most cruel in fight ; he is very shrewd and extremely crafty in warfare, for he has been waging war for a long time.\"{{sfn|Rockhill|1967}} [[William of Rubruck]] described him as about the height of his lord John de Beaumont and his entire face was covered with reddish spots.{{sfn|Rockhill|1967|p=123}}\n\n==Early years==\n\nAfter his son [[Jochi]]'s death, [[Genghis Khan]] assigned Jochi's appanages to his sons. But the [[Great Khan]] installed Batu as Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] (also known as the Ulus of Jochi or Kipchak Khanate). Jochi's eldest son, [[Orda Khan]], also agreed that Batu should succeed their father. Genghis Khan's youngest brother [[Tem\u00fcge]] attended the coronation ceremony as an official representative of Genghis.<ref>H. H. Howorth ''The history of the Mongols'', p.II, d.II, p. 37.</ref> When Genghis Khan died in 1227, he left 4,000 Mongol men to Jochi's family. Jochi's lands were divided between Batu and his older brother Orda. Orda's [[White Horde]] ruled the lands roughly between the [[Volga]] river and [[Lake Balkhash]], while Batu's Horde ruled the lands west of the Volga.\n\nIn 1229, [[\u00d6gedei]] dispatched three [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] under Kukhdei and Sundei to conquer the tribes on the lower [[Ural River]]. According to [[Abulghazi Bahadur|Abulghazi]], Batu joined \u00d6gedei's [[Mongol-Jin dynasty war|military campaign]] against the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in [[North China]] while his younger brother was fighting the [[Bashkirs]], the [[Cumans]], the [[Bulghars]] and the [[Alans]] in the west. Despite heavy resistance of their enemies, the Mongols conquered major cities of the [[Jurchens]] and made the Bashkirs their ally. In the 1230s, \u00d6gedei distributed lands in [[Shanxi]], China to Batu and the family of Jochi, but they appointed their officials under the supervision of the Imperial governor likewise in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Persia]].<ref>[[Thomas T. Allsen]] ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p. 45.</ref>\n\n== Conquest of [[Kievan Rus']] ==\n{{main|Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}\n\nAt the [[kurultai]] in [[Mongolia]] after the end of the [[Mongol-Jin War]], the Great Khan \u00d6gedei ordered Batu to conquer western nations. In 1235 Batu, who earlier had directed the conquest of the [[Crimean Peninsula]], was assigned an army of possibly 130,000 to oversee an invasion of Europe. His relatives and cousins [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]], [[B\u00fcri]], [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]], Khulgen, [[Khadan]], [[Baidar]] and notable Mongol generals [[Subutai]] (Subeedei), [[Borolday]], and Mengguser joined him by the order of his uncle \u00d6gedei. The army, actually commanded by [[Subutai]], crossed the [[Volga]] and invaded [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 1236. It took them a year to extinguish the resistance of the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, [[Kypchak]]s, and [[Alans|Alani]].\n\n[[File:suzdal-invasion2.jpg|thumb|left|Destruction of the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] by Mongol armies. From the medieval Russian annals]]\n\nIn November 1237 Batu Khan sent his envoys to the court of [[Yuri II]] of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] and demanded his allegiance. When Yuri refused to surrender the Mongols besieged [[Ryazan]]. After six days of bloody battle, the city was totally annihilated and never restored to its former glory. Alarmed by the news, Yuri II sent his sons to detain the horde, but they were soundly defeated. Having burnt [[Kolomna]] and Moscow, the horde laid siege to the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] on 4 February, 1238. Three days later the city was taken and burnt to the ground. The royal family perished in the fire, while the grand prince hastily retreated northward. Crossing the [[Volga]], he mustered a new army, which was totally exterminated by the Mongols [[Battle of the Sit River|on the Sit' River]] on 4 March.\n\nThereupon Batu Khan divided his army into smaller units, which ransacked fourteen Rus' cities: [[Rostov]], [[Uglich]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]], [[Kashina (village)|Kashin]], [[Ksnyatin]], [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]], [[Halych]], [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]], [[Yuryev-Polsky (town)|Yuriev-Polsky]], [[Dmitrov]], [[Volokolamsk]], [[Tver]], and [[Torzhok]]. The most difficult to take was the small town of [[Kozelsk]], whose boy-prince Titus and inhabitants resisted the Mongols for seven weeks. As the story goes, at the news of Mongol approach, the city of [[Kitezh]] was submerged in a lake with all its inhabitants, where it may be seen to this day. Khadan and Buri stormed the city in three days after they joined Batu. The only major cities to escape destruction were [[Smolensk]], which submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute, and [[Novgorod]] with [[Pskov]], which could not be reached by the Mongols on account of considerable distance and the intervening [[marshlands]].\n\n[[File:Sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan.jpg|thumb|200px|Warriors of the [[Golden Horde]] sack Suzdal.]]\n\nWhen Batu drank a cup of wine before the others at the victory banquet, Buri complained of the unfairness of Batu receiving such a vast and fertile steppe, and the Mongol army, along with G\u00fcy\u00fck and others, ridiculed Batu as an \"old woman with beard\". They then left the banquet. Batu sent an envoy to his uncle \u00d6gedei to complain of his cousins' rude behavior. \u00d6gedei got angry on hearing the news and recalled Buri and G\u00fcy\u00fck. According to some sources, Buri, who was sent to his grandfather Chagatai, never returned to join the Mongol conquest of Europe; G\u00fcy\u00fck returned to the Russian steppe after his father \u00d6gedei harshly criticized him.\n\nIn the summer of 1238, Batu Khan devastated the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and pacified [[Mordovia]] and the Kipchak-controlled steppe. In the winter of 1239, he sacked [[Chernigov]] and [[Pereyaslav]]. After several days of siege, [[Siege of Kiev (1240)|the Mongols stormed]] [[Kiev]] in December 1240. Despite fierce resistance by [[Danylo of Halych]], Batu Khan managed to take the two principal capitals of his land, [[Halych]] and [[Volodymyr-Volyns'kyi]]. Ruthenian principalities became [[vassal]]s of the [[Mongol Empire]].\n\n== Invasion of Central Europe ==\n{{main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\nThe [[Cuman]] [[refugee]]s took shelter in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Batu sent at least five messengers to [[B\u00e9la IV]], the king of Hungary, but they were all killed. For the last time Batu demanded that Bela have the Cumans returned and warned: \"It is much easier for the Cumans to escape than it is for you...you dwell in houses and have fixed towns and fortresses, so how will you escape me\"?<ref>Michael Prawdin, Gerard (INT) Chaliand ''The Mongol empire'', p. 262.</ref> Batu Khan then decided to \"reach the ultimate sea\", where the Mongols could proceed no further. Some modern historians speculate that Batu intended primarily to assure his flanks were safe for the future from possible interference from the Europeans, and partially as a precursor to further conquest. Most believe he intended the conquest of all Europe, as soon as his flanks were safe and his forces ready.\n\n[[File:Tatarsinvade.jpg|thumb|left|B\u00e9la IV flees from [[Battle of Mohi|Mohi]], detail from ''[[Chronicon Pictum]]'']]\n\nHaving devastated the various Rus' principalities, Subutai and Batu sent spies into Poland, Hungary, and as far as Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. With a clear picture of the European kingdoms, they brilliantly prepared an attack. Batu Khan was the overall leader, but Subutai was the actual commander in the field and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against Rus'. The Mongols invaded central Europe in three groups. One group invaded and devastated Poland, defeating a combined force under [[Henry II the Pious]], Duke of Silesia and the Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Order]] at [[Legnica]]. A second crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and a third followed the [[Danube]]. The armies swept the plains of Hungary over the summer, and in the spring of 1242 they regained impetus and extended their control into Austria and [[Dalmatia]], as well as invading [[Moravia|Morava]].\n\nWhile the northern force under \u00d6gedei's son [[Khadan]] and [[Baidar]], the son of [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], won the [[Battle of Legnica]], and another army of [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] or [[B\u00fcri]] triumphed in [[Transylvania]], Subutai was waiting for another victory over the [[Magyars]], the [[Croats]], and the [[Templars]] on the Hungarian plain. In 1241, a Tatar (Mongol) army led by Bujek crossed the mountains of the ''Kara Ulagh'' (\"Black Vlachs\"); Bujek defeated the [[Vlachs]] and one of their leader named [[Mislau|Mi\u0161lav]].<ref>Curta, Florin. ''Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages 500-1250''</ref> After the siege of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], Batu's army withdrew to the [[Sajo River]] and inflicted a tremendous defeat on King B\u00e9la IV and his allies at the [[Battle of Mohi]] on 11 April. Khadan, Baidar, and Orda went to Hungary, devastating [[Moravia]] en route. The Mongols appointed a [[darughachi]] in Hungary and minted coins in the name of the Khagan.<ref>[[Michael Prawdin]], Gerard (INT) Chaliand, ''The Mongol empire'', p. 268.</ref> The country of B\u00e9la was assigned to Orda by Batu as an [[appanage]]; Batu sent Khadan in pursuit of B\u00e9la, who fled to [[Croatia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} <!-- Prawdin is an unreliable source; see [[Michael Prawdin]] -->\n\n[[File:Batu.gif|thumb|right|150px|Medieval Chinese drawing of young Batu Khan (14th century).]]\n\nThe Mongol [[battalion]]s checked the forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg Austria]].<ref>H. H. Howorth ''The history of the Mongols'', p.II, d.II, pp. 48-50.</ref> During his campaign in [[Central Europe]], Batu demanded that [[Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor]], dethrone himself, and said: \"I am coming to usurp your throne instead of you\". The latter only replied that he would make a good falconer, for he understood birds very well.<ref>Albericus Trium Fontium, ''Monumenta'', scriptores, xxiii. 943.</ref>  The Emperor and [[Pope Gregory IX]] called for a [[crusade]] against the Mongol Empire, but Europe was plagued by internal strife. Subutai achieved lasting fame with his victories in Europe, as he had in Eastern Persia.\n\nBy late 1241, Batu and Subutai were finalizing plans to invade Austria, Italy, and Germany when the news came of the death of \u00d6gedei Khan, who died in December 1241.  Batu wanted to continue the war, but Subutai reminded him of the law of [[Yassa]] (\u0418\u0445 \u0417\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0433). The Mongols withdrew in late spring of 1242, as the Princes of the blood, and Subutai, were recalled to [[Karakorum (palace)|Karakorum]] where the ''[[kurultai]]'' was held. The [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] was forced to acknowledge Batu's [[supremacism|supremacy]]. Batu was a potential [[Great Khan]], but when he failed to gain the title he turned to consolidate his conquests in Asia and the [[Urals]].\n\n== Viceroy and struggle with G\u00fcy\u00fck ==\nWithdrawing from Hungary, Batu made his camps along the banks of the Volga. When the [[Khatun|Great Khatun]] [[T\u00f6regene]] invited him to elect the next [[Emperor]] of the Mongol Empire, Batu announced his inability to attend any immediate kurultai, thus delaying the succession for several years. Eventually, G\u00fcy\u00fck was elected Khagan in 1246, with Batu's brothers representing the Jochid lineage. As one of the oldest members of Chingisid [[Borjigin]], Batu became a [[viceroy]] over all the western parts of the empire, controlling routine affairs among the Russian princes, nominating Jochid retainers as governors of [[Iran]], and receiving in audience grandees from the [[Caucasus]]. At no point, however, did he openly challenge the authority of the Great Khan.\n\nDuring the absence of Batu, the Mongols who were left behind put to death Mstislav, the prince of [[Rylsk, Russia|Rylsk]], in [[Kievan Rus']]. On his return Batu summoned the Grand prince [[Yaroslav II of Vladimir]] to meet him. Yaroslav was well received by Batu, who confirmed him as [[suzerain]] over the other Russian princes, and gave him authority of Kiev. The princes of Suzdal followed Yaroslav's example. Batu sent Yaroslav to the imperial court of [[Karakorum]] to assist at the inauguration of G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan in 1246. [[Plano Carpini]], who got approval from Batu to go further, noted that the Great Khan's aunt was executed. At the same time Yaroslav was poisoned in [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[File:SmirnovVS KnMihailChern.jpg|thumb|left|Prince [[Michael of Chernigov]] was passed between fires in accordance with ancient Turco-Mongol tradition. Batu Khan stabbed him to death for his refusal to do obeisance to [[Genghis Khan]]'s shrine in the pagan ritual.]]\n\nBatu had commissaries in the various towns where the dependent Russian princes and other princes held their courts. The princes from Russian states such as Vladimir Constantine, Boris, Gleb, Vasili, Constatantine, Vladimir Constantinovich, Vasil'ko and [[Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich of Vladimir]], went to the court of Batu in person. When [[Michael of Chernigov]], who had murdered the Mongol envoy in Kiev, arrived, the Mongol overseers were engaged in taking a census of the inhabitants for the poll tax. Michael was ordered to repair to Batu. When summoned before Batu, he was made to pass between two fires and ordered to prostrate himself before the tablets of Genghis Khan. Michael replied that he did not object to do obeisance to Batu himself but to adore images of a dead man was repugnant. As he persisted in his refusal, Batu ordered his death.\n\nDanylo of Halych summoned to Batu and diplomatically made obeisance to the Mongols. Batu, addressing him, said \"You have for a long time refused to come, but have effaced your ill conduct by your obedience\" and saluted him with a draught of [[Kumis|airag]]. They exchanged hostages whereby 100 families of [[Keraites]] were re-settled in [[Carpathian-Galicia]]. After the defeat of the [[Sultanate of Rum]], [[Baiju]] freed [[David VII Ulu]] from [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] imprisonment and sent him to Batu and G\u00fcy\u00fck. Fearing Baiju's aggressive policy, [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]] sent her son [[David VI Narin]] to Batu's court to get official recognition as heir apparent. Batu supported David VI and granted him the rights above the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] and [[Armenia]]n nobles and the Mongol tammachis. But G\u00fcy\u00fck made David Ulu the senior king of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and ordered Batu's protege David Narin to be subordinate to David Ulu.\n\nSuspicion between Batu and G\u00fcy\u00fck increased, however, and G\u00fcy\u00fck replaced the officials in Iran and the Caucasus with his own men, including [[Eljigidei]]. G\u00fcy\u00fck gave a good reception to [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir|Andrey II]]. Andrey was assigned the throne of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] while Alexander was given southern Russia. When G\u00fcy\u00fck began moving west, [[Sorghaghtani Beki]], the widow of [[Tolui]], warned Batu that he was actually the Great Khan's target. When G\u00fcy\u00fck summoned Batu to appear before him, Batu moved slowly. Before meeting Batu, G\u00fcy\u00fck died suddenly. According to [[William of Rubruck]] and a Muslim chronicle, one of Batu's brothers murdered or poisoned the Great Khan G\u00fcy\u00fck and Batu then killed the imperial envoy, though this account is not completely confirmed by other major sources.\n\n== M\u00f6ngke and Batu ==\n[[File:Semiradsky Aleksandr Nevsky v Orde.jpg|thumb|right|Batu's loyal vassal [[Alexander Nevsky]] in the [[Golden Horde|Horde]]]]\n\nAn opportunity had arrived for deposing the [[House of \u00d6gedei]] from the overlordship of the Mongols, and Batu was determined to avail himself of it. But Batu seemed to allow [[Oghul Qaimish]] to serve as [[regent]]. He also suggested unruly princes listen to her words. When Batu was ill, M\u00f6ngke went to the Ulus of Jochi to greet him as his mother Sorghagtani advised. Batu was much delighted on seeing him.\n\nAt last, Batu called a kurultai on his own territory in 1250. Members of the \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid families refused to attend the kurultai beyond the [[Mongolia]]n heartland. The kurultai offered the throne to Batu Khan who had no interest in promoting himself as the new Grand Khan. Rejecting it, he instead nominated M\u00f6ngke, who led a Mongol army in Russia, the Northern Caucasus, and Hungary. The pro-Tolui faction rose up and supported his choice. Given its limited attendance and location, this kurultai was of questionable validity. Batu sent M\u00f6ngke under the protection of his brothers, [[Berke]] and Tukhtemur, and his son [[Sartaq]] to assemble a formal kurultai at Kodoe Aral in the heartland. The supporters of M\u00f6ngke invited Oghul Qaimish and other main \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid princes to attend the kurultai, but they refused each time, demanding descendants of \u00d6gedei must be khan. In response, Batu accused them of killing his aunt Altalaun and defying \u00d6gedei's nominee, Shiremun. After the assembled throng proclaimed M\u00f6ngke Great Khan of the Mongol Empire in 1251, he punished the \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid families for the organized plot against him. M\u00f6ngke sent Buri to Batu who had him executed by Buri's opponent general. Eljigidei was also ordered to be executed.\n\nThe Grand prince Andrey II allied with the rebellious-minded princes of western [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], giving umbrage to the Mongols. Batu sent a [[punitive expedition]] under Nevrui. On their approach, Andrey fled to Pskov and thence to Sweden. The Mongols spread over Vladimir and harshly punished the people there. The [[Livonian Knights]] stopped their advance to Novgorod and Pskov on hearing the news about the Mongols. Thanks to his friendship with Sartaq, Alexander was installed as the Grand Prince of Vladimir (i.e., the supreme Russian ruler) by Batu in 1252. In 1256 Andrey travelled to [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]] to ask pardon for his former infidelity and was shown mercy.\n\nDuring the reign of M\u00f6ngke, Batu's prestige as kingmaker and viceroy of the great khans in the west reached its height. Even so, Batu allowed M\u00f6ngke's census takers to operate freely in his realm. According to a Muslim chronicle and the [[History of Yuan]], Batu had free access to the imperial treasury.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Grousset ''The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia'', p. 596.</ref> Of all the grandsons of Genghis Khan, he and M\u00f6ngke seemed most capable and the most dedicated to following the spirit of Mongolian law.<ref>Jack Weatherford ''The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire'', p. 109.</ref>\n\nBatu dispatched a large Jochid delegation to participate in [[Hulagu]]'s [[Mongol invasion of Middle East|expedition in the Middle East]]. However, Berke's persuasion might have forced him to delay to strengthen Hulagu's force, little suspecting that it would result in eliminating the Jochid predominance there, for few years.\n\nBatu, M\u00f6ngke, and other princely lines shared rule over the area from [[Afghanistan]] to Turkey. He left state affairs to his son [[Sartaq]] before Batu died in 1255.\n\n== Family and legacy ==\n{{see also|Family tree of Genghis Khan}}\n\nBatu Khan was approximately five feet and seven inches tall (1.70 m), and had at least four children:\n* [[Sartaq]], khan of the Golden Horde from 1255\u20131256, son of Batu Khan and [[Boraqchin (Tatar)|Boraqchin]]\n* [[Toqoqan]]<ref>David Morgan, ''The Mongols'', p. 224.</ref>\n* Andewan\n* [[Ulaghchi|Ulagchi]] \u2013 probably the son of Sartaq often named Ju Lai (Dzhulaibek)\n\nBatu's mother Ukhaa ujin belonged to the Mongol [[Onggirat]] clan<ref>Rashid al-Din ''Universal History'', Jochids' tale</ref> while his chief khatun Boraqchin was an Alchi-[[Tatar]].\n\nWhen Batu and his son [[Sartak]] died, after a brief regency of [[Boraqchin (Tatar)|Boraqchin]] for [[Ulaghchi|Ulagchi]], Batu's brother [[Berke]] inherited the [[Golden Horde]]. Berke was not inclined to unity with his cousins in the Mongol family, making war on [[Hulagu Khan]], though Berke officially recognized M\u00f6ngke and the [[Empire of the Great Khan]] as his overlords.  In fact, Berke was an independent ruler by then. Berke did not share Batu's interest in conquering it, however, he demanded [[Nobility and royalty of the Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian King]] [[B\u00e9la IV]]'s submission and sent his general [[Borolday]] to [[Lithuania]] and Poland.\n\nThe Kipchak Khanate was known in Rus and Europe as the [[Golden Horde]] (''Zolotaya Orda'') some think because of the golden colour of the Khan's tent. \"Horde\" comes from the Mongol word \"orda/ordu\" or camp. \"Golden\" is thought to have had a similar meaning to \"royal\" (Royal Camp). Of all the Khanates, the Golden Horde ruled longest. Long after the expulsion of the [[Yuan dynasty]] from China to Mongolia, and the fall of [[Ilkhanate]] in Middle East, the descendants of Batu Khan continued to rule the steppes in what is now Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan. However, Batu's line had ruled the Jochid Ulus until 1360, a century after Berke's death in 1264. Descendants of his brothers, Orda and Tuqatimur, took the throne of the Golden Horde afterwards.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center | ref=<ref>Anne F.

Batu was a son of [[Jochi]] and grandson of [[Genghis Khan]].  His ''ulus'' was the chief state of the Golden Horde, which ruled [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], [[Volga Bulgaria]], [[Cumania]], and the [[Caucasus]] for around 250 years, after also destroying the armies of Poland and Hungary. ''Batu'' or ''Bat'' literally means \"firm\" in the [[Mongolian language]]. After the deaths of Genghis Khan's sons, he became the most respected prince, called ''agha'' (\"elder brother\"), in the Mongol Empire.\n\n==Personality and appearance==\nAccording to [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], Batu was \"kind enough to his own people, but he is greatly feared by them. He is, however, most cruel in fight ; he is very shrewd and extremely crafty in warfare, for he has been waging war for a long time.\"{{sfn|Rockhill|1967}} [[William of Rubruck]] described him as about the height of his lord John de Beaumont and his entire face was covered with reddish spots.{{sfn|Rockhill|1967|p=123}}\n\n==Early years==\n\nAfter his son [[Jochi]]'s death, [[Genghis Khan]] assigned Jochi's appanages to his sons. But the [[Great Khan]] installed Batu as Khan of the [[Golden Horde]] (also known as the Ulus of Jochi or Kipchak Khanate). Jochi's eldest son, [[Orda Khan]], also agreed that Batu should succeed their father. Genghis Khan's youngest brother [[Tem\u00fcge]] attended the coronation ceremony as an official representative of Genghis.<ref>H. H. Howorth ''The history of the Mongols'', p.II, d.II, p. 37.</ref> When Genghis Khan died in 1227, he left 4,000 Mongol men to Jochi's family. Jochi's lands were divided between Batu and his older brother Orda. Orda's [[White Horde]] ruled the lands roughly between the [[Volga]] river and [[Lake Balkhash]], while Batu's Horde ruled the lands west of the Volga.\n\nIn 1229, [[\u00d6gedei]] dispatched three [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] under Kukhdei and Sundei to conquer the tribes on the lower [[Ural River]]. According to [[Abulghazi Bahadur|Abulghazi]], Batu joined \u00d6gedei's [[Mongol-Jin dynasty war|military campaign]] against the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in [[North China]] while his younger brother was fighting the [[Bashkirs]], the [[Cumans]], the [[Bulghars]] and the [[Alans]] in the west. Despite heavy resistance of their enemies, the Mongols conquered major cities of the [[Jurchens]] and made the Bashkirs their ally. In the 1230s, \u00d6gedei distributed lands in [[Shanxi]], China to Batu and the family of Jochi, but they appointed their officials under the supervision of the Imperial governor likewise in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Persia]].<ref>[[Thomas T. Allsen]] ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p. 45.</ref>\n\n== Conquest of [[Kievan Rus']] ==\n{{main|Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n{{Campaignbox Mongol invasions}}\n\nAt the [[kurultai]] in [[Mongolia]] after the end of the [[Mongol-Jin War]], the Great Khan \u00d6gedei ordered Batu to conquer western nations. In 1235 Batu, who earlier had directed the conquest of the [[Crimean Peninsula]], was assigned an army of possibly 130,000 to oversee an invasion of Europe. His relatives and cousins [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]], [[B\u00fcri]], [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]], Khulgen, [[Khadan]], [[Baidar]] and notable Mongol generals [[Subutai]] (Subeedei), [[Borolday]], and Mengguser joined him by the order of his uncle \u00d6gedei. The army, actually commanded by [[Subutai]], crossed the [[Volga]] and invaded [[Volga Bulgaria]] in 1236. It took them a year to extinguish the resistance of the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, [[Kypchak]]s, and [[Alans|Alani]].\n\n[[File:suzdal-invasion2.jpg|thumb|left|Destruction of the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] by Mongol armies. From the medieval Russian annals]]\n\nIn November 1237 Batu Khan sent his envoys to the court of [[Yuri II]] of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] and demanded his allegiance. When Yuri refused to surrender the Mongols besieged [[Ryazan]]. After six days of bloody battle, the city was totally annihilated and never restored to its former glory. Alarmed by the news, Yuri II sent his sons to detain the horde, but they were soundly defeated. Having burnt [[Kolomna]] and Moscow, the horde laid siege to the capital of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] on 4 February, 1238. Three days later the city was taken and burnt to the ground. The royal family perished in the fire, while the grand prince hastily retreated northward. Crossing the [[Volga]], he mustered a new army, which was totally exterminated by the Mongols [[Battle of the Sit River|on the Sit' River]] on 4 March.\n\nThereupon Batu Khan divided his army into smaller units, which ransacked fourteen Rus' cities: [[Rostov]], [[Uglich]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Kostroma]], [[Kashina (village)|Kashin]], [[Ksnyatin]], [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]], [[Halych]], [[Pereslavl-Zalessky]], [[Yuryev-Polsky (town)|Yuriev-Polsky]], [[Dmitrov]], [[Volokolamsk]], [[Tver]], and [[Torzhok]]. The most difficult to take was the small town of [[Kozelsk]], whose boy-prince Titus and inhabitants resisted the Mongols for seven weeks. As the story goes, at the news of Mongol approach, the city of [[Kitezh]] was submerged in a lake with all its inhabitants, where it may be seen to this day. Khadan and Buri stormed the city in three days after they joined Batu. The only major cities to escape destruction were [[Smolensk]], which submitted to the Mongols and agreed to pay tribute, and [[Novgorod]] with [[Pskov]], which could not be reached by the Mongols on account of considerable distance and the intervening [[marshlands]].\n\n[[File:Sacking of Suzdal by Batu Khan.jpg|thumb|200px|Warriors of the [[Golden Horde]] sack Suzdal.]]\n\nWhen Batu drank a cup of wine before the others at the victory banquet, Buri complained of the unfairness of Batu receiving such a vast and fertile steppe, and the Mongol army, along with G\u00fcy\u00fck and others, ridiculed Batu as an \"old woman with beard\". They then left the banquet. Batu sent an envoy to his uncle \u00d6gedei to complain of his cousins' rude behavior. \u00d6gedei got angry on hearing the news and recalled Buri and G\u00fcy\u00fck. According to some sources, Buri, who was sent to his grandfather Chagatai, never returned to join the Mongol conquest of Europe; G\u00fcy\u00fck returned to the Russian steppe after his father \u00d6gedei harshly criticized him.\n\nIn the summer of 1238, Batu Khan devastated the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and pacified [[Mordovia]] and the Kipchak-controlled steppe. In the winter of 1239, he sacked [[Chernigov]] and [[Pereyaslav]]. After several days of siege, [[Siege of Kiev (1240)|the Mongols stormed]] [[Kiev]] in December 1240. Despite fierce resistance by [[Danylo of Halych]], Batu Khan managed to take the two principal capitals of his land, [[Halych]] and [[Volodymyr-Volyns'kyi]]. Ruthenian principalities became [[vassal]]s of the [[Mongol Empire]].\n\n== Invasion of Central Europe ==\n{{main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\nThe [[Cuman]] [[refugee]]s took shelter in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Batu sent at least five messengers to [[B\u00e9la IV]], the king of Hungary, but they were all killed. For the last time Batu demanded that Bela have the Cumans returned and warned: \"It is much easier for the Cumans to escape than it is for you...you dwell in houses and have fixed towns and fortresses, so how will you escape me\"?<ref>Michael Prawdin, Gerard (INT) Chaliand ''The Mongol empire'', p. 262.</ref> Batu Khan then decided to \"reach the ultimate sea\", where the Mongols could proceed no further. Some modern historians speculate that Batu intended primarily to assure his flanks were safe for the future from possible interference from the Europeans, and partially as a precursor to further conquest. Most believe he intended the conquest of all Europe, as soon as his flanks were safe and his forces ready.\n\n[[File:Tatarsinvade.jpg|thumb|left|B\u00e9la IV flees from [[Battle of Mohi|Mohi]], detail from ''[[Chronicon Pictum]]'']]\n\nHaving devastated the various Rus' principalities, Subutai and Batu sent spies into Poland, Hungary, and as far as Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. With a clear picture of the European kingdoms, they brilliantly prepared an attack. Batu Khan was the overall leader, but Subutai was the actual commander in the field and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against Rus'. The Mongols invaded central Europe in three groups. One group invaded and devastated Poland, defeating a combined force under [[Henry II the Pious]], Duke of Silesia and the Grand Master of the [[Teutonic Order]] at [[Legnica]]. A second crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and a third followed the [[Danube]]. The armies swept the plains of Hungary over the summer, and in the spring of 1242 they regained impetus and extended their control into Austria and [[Dalmatia]], as well as invading [[Moravia|Morava]].\n\nWhile the northern force under \u00d6gedei's son [[Khadan]] and [[Baidar]], the son of [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], won the [[Battle of Legnica]], and another army of [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] or [[B\u00fcri]] triumphed in [[Transylvania]], Subutai was waiting for another victory over the [[Magyars]], the [[Croats]], and the [[Templars]] on the Hungarian plain. In 1241, a Tatar (Mongol) army led by Bujek crossed the mountains of the ''Kara Ulagh'' (\"Black Vlachs\"); Bujek defeated the [[Vlachs]] and one of their leader named [[Mislau|Mi\u0161lav]].<ref>Curta, Florin. ''Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages 500-1250''</ref> After the siege of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], Batu's army withdrew to the [[Sajo River]] and inflicted a tremendous defeat on King B\u00e9la IV and his allies at the [[Battle of Mohi]] on 11 April.

The Mongols appointed a [[darughachi]] in Hungary and minted coins in the name of the Khagan.<ref>[[Michael Prawdin]], Gerard (INT) Chaliand, ''The Mongol empire'', p. 268.</ref> The country of B\u00e9la was assigned to Orda by Batu as an [[appanage]]; Batu sent Khadan in pursuit of B\u00e9la, who fled to [[Croatia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} <!-- Prawdin is an unreliable source; see [[Michael Prawdin]] -->\n\n[[File:Batu.gif|thumb|right|150px|Medieval Chinese drawing of young Batu Khan (14th century).]]\n\nThe Mongol [[battalion]]s checked the forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg Austria]].<ref>H. H. Howorth ''The history of the Mongols'', p.II, d.II, pp. 48-50.</ref> During his campaign in [[Central Europe]], Batu demanded that [[Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor]], dethrone himself, and said: \"I am coming to usurp your throne instead of you\". The latter only replied that he would make a good falconer, for he understood birds very well.<ref>Albericus Trium Fontium, ''Monumenta'', scriptores, xxiii. 943.</ref>  The Emperor and [[Pope Gregory IX]] called for a [[crusade]] against the Mongol Empire, but Europe was plagued by internal strife. Subutai achieved lasting fame with his victories in Europe, as he had in Eastern Persia.\n\nBy late 1241, Batu and Subutai were finalizing plans to invade Austria, Italy, and Germany when the news came of the death of \u00d6gedei Khan, who died in December 1241.  Batu wanted to continue the war, but Subutai reminded him of the law of [[Yassa]] (\u0418\u0445 \u0417\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0433). The Mongols withdrew in late spring of 1242, as the Princes of the blood, and Subutai, were recalled to [[Karakorum (palace)|Karakorum]] where the ''[[kurultai]]'' was held. The [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] was forced to acknowledge Batu's [[supremacism|supremacy]]. Batu was a potential [[Great Khan]], but when he failed to gain the title he turned to consolidate his conquests in Asia and the [[Urals]].\n\n== Viceroy and struggle with G\u00fcy\u00fck ==\nWithdrawing from Hungary, Batu made his camps along the banks of the Volga. When the [[Khatun|Great Khatun]] [[T\u00f6regene]] invited him to elect the next [[Emperor]] of the Mongol Empire, Batu announced his inability to attend any immediate kurultai, thus delaying the succession for several years. Eventually, G\u00fcy\u00fck was elected Khagan in 1246, with Batu's brothers representing the Jochid lineage. As one of the oldest members of Chingisid [[Borjigin]], Batu became a [[viceroy]] over all the western parts of the empire, controlling routine affairs among the Russian princes, nominating Jochid retainers as governors of [[Iran]], and receiving in audience grandees from the [[Caucasus]]. At no point, however, did he openly challenge the authority of the Great Khan.\n\nDuring the absence of Batu, the Mongols who were left behind put to death Mstislav, the prince of [[Rylsk, Russia|Rylsk]], in [[Kievan Rus']]. On his return Batu summoned the Grand prince [[Yaroslav II of Vladimir]] to meet him. Yaroslav was well received by Batu, who confirmed him as [[suzerain]] over the other Russian princes, and gave him authority of Kiev. The princes of Suzdal followed Yaroslav's example. Batu sent Yaroslav to the imperial court of [[Karakorum]] to assist at the inauguration of G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan in 1246. [[Plano Carpini]], who got approval from Batu to go further, noted that the Great Khan's aunt was executed. At the same time Yaroslav was poisoned in [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[File:SmirnovVS KnMihailChern.jpg|thumb|left|Prince [[Michael of Chernigov]] was passed between fires in accordance with ancient Turco-Mongol tradition. Batu Khan stabbed him to death for his refusal to do obeisance to [[Genghis Khan]]'s shrine in the pagan ritual.]]\n\nBatu had commissaries in the various towns where the dependent Russian princes and other princes held their courts. The princes from Russian states such as Vladimir Constantine, Boris, Gleb, Vasili, Constatantine, Vladimir Constantinovich, Vasil'ko and [[Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich of Vladimir]], went to the court of Batu in person. When [[Michael of Chernigov]], who had murdered the Mongol envoy in Kiev, arrived, the Mongol overseers were engaged in taking a census of the inhabitants for the poll tax. Michael was ordered to repair to Batu. When summoned before Batu, he was made to pass between two fires and ordered to prostrate himself before the tablets of Genghis Khan. Michael replied that he did not object to do obeisance to Batu himself but to adore images of a dead man was repugnant. As he persisted in his refusal, Batu ordered his death.\n\nDanylo of Halych summoned to Batu and diplomatically made obeisance to the Mongols. Batu, addressing him, said \"You have for a long time refused to come, but have effaced your ill conduct by your obedience\" and saluted him with a draught of [[Kumis|airag]]. They exchanged hostages whereby 100 families of [[Keraites]] were re-settled in [[Carpathian-Galicia]]. After the defeat of the [[Sultanate of Rum]], [[Baiju]] freed [[David VII Ulu]] from [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] imprisonment and sent him to Batu and G\u00fcy\u00fck. Fearing Baiju's aggressive policy, [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] of [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]] sent her son [[David VI Narin]] to Batu's court to get official recognition as heir apparent. Batu supported David VI and granted him the rights above the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] and [[Armenia]]n nobles and the Mongol tammachis. But G\u00fcy\u00fck made David Ulu the senior king of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and ordered Batu's protege David Narin to be subordinate to David Ulu.\n\nSuspicion between Batu and G\u00fcy\u00fck increased, however, and G\u00fcy\u00fck replaced the officials in Iran and the Caucasus with his own men, including [[Eljigidei]]. G\u00fcy\u00fck gave a good reception to [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir|Andrey II]]. Andrey was assigned the throne of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] while Alexander was given southern Russia. When G\u00fcy\u00fck began moving west, [[Sorghaghtani Beki]], the widow of [[Tolui]], warned Batu that he was actually the Great Khan's target. When G\u00fcy\u00fck summoned Batu to appear before him, Batu moved slowly. Before meeting Batu, G\u00fcy\u00fck died suddenly. According to [[William of Rubruck]] and a Muslim chronicle, one of Batu's brothers murdered or poisoned the Great Khan G\u00fcy\u00fck and Batu then killed the imperial envoy, though this account is not completely confirmed by other major sources.\n\n== M\u00f6ngke and Batu ==\n[[File:Semiradsky Aleksandr Nevsky v Orde.jpg|thumb|right|Batu's loyal vassal [[Alexander Nevsky]] in the [[Golden Horde|Horde]]]]\n\nAn opportunity had arrived for deposing the [[House of \u00d6gedei]] from the overlordship of the Mongols, and Batu was determined to avail himself of it. But Batu seemed to allow [[Oghul Qaimish]] to serve as [[regent]]. He also suggested unruly princes listen to her words. When Batu was ill, M\u00f6ngke went to the Ulus of Jochi to greet him as his mother Sorghagtani advised. Batu was much delighted on seeing him.\n\nAt last, Batu called a kurultai on his own territory in 1250. Members of the \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid families refused to attend the kurultai beyond the [[Mongolia]]n heartland. The kurultai offered the throne to Batu Khan who had no interest in promoting himself as the new Grand Khan. Rejecting it, he instead nominated M\u00f6ngke, who led a Mongol army in Russia, the Northern Caucasus, and Hungary. The pro-Tolui faction rose up and supported his choice. Given its limited attendance and location, this kurultai was of questionable validity. Batu sent M\u00f6ngke under the protection of his brothers, [[Berke]] and Tukhtemur, and his son [[Sartaq]] to assemble a formal kurultai at Kodoe Aral in the heartland. The supporters of M\u00f6ngke invited Oghul Qaimish and other main \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid princes to attend the kurultai, but they refused each time, demanding descendants of \u00d6gedei must be khan. In response, Batu accused them of killing his aunt Altalaun and defying \u00d6gedei's nominee, Shiremun. After the assembled throng proclaimed M\u00f6ngke Great Khan of the Mongol Empire in 1251, he punished the \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid families for the organized plot against him. M\u00f6ngke sent Buri to Batu who had him executed by Buri's opponent general. Eljigidei was also ordered to be executed.\n\nThe Grand prince Andrey II allied with the rebellious-minded princes of western [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']], giving umbrage to the Mongols. Batu sent a [[punitive expedition]] under Nevrui. On their approach, Andrey fled to Pskov and thence to Sweden. The Mongols spread over Vladimir and harshly punished the people there. The [[Livonian Knights]] stopped their advance to Novgorod and Pskov on hearing the news about the Mongols. Thanks to his friendship with Sartaq, Alexander was installed as the Grand Prince of Vladimir (i.e., the supreme Russian ruler) by Batu in 1252. In 1256 Andrey travelled to [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]] to ask pardon for his former infidelity and was shown mercy.\n\nDuring the reign of M\u00f6ngke, Batu's prestige as kingmaker and viceroy of the great khans in the west reached its height. Even so, Batu allowed M\u00f6ngke's census takers to operate freely in his realm. According to a Muslim chronicle and the [[History of Yuan]], Batu had free access to the imperial treasury.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Grousset ''The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia'', p. 596.</ref> Of all the grandsons of Genghis Khan, he and M\u00f6ngke seemed most capable and the most dedicated to following the spirit of Mongolian law.<ref>Jack Weatherford ''The Secret History of the Mongol Queens: How the Daughters of Genghis Khan Rescued His Empire'', p. 109.</ref>\n\nBatu dispatched a large Jochid delegation to participate in [[Hulagu]]'s [[Mongol invasion of Middle East|expedition in the Middle East]]. However, Berke's persuasion might have forced him to delay to strengthen Hulagu's force, little suspecting that it would result in eliminating the Jochid predominance there, for few years.\n\nBatu, M\u00f6ngke, and other princely lines shared rule over the area from [[Afghanistan]] to Turkey. He left state affairs to his son [[Sartaq]] before Batu died in 1255.\n\n== Family and legacy ==\n{{see also|Family tree of Genghis Khan}}\n\nBatu Khan was approximately five feet and seven inches tall (1.70 m), and had at least four children:\n* [[Sartaq]], khan of the Golden Horde from 1255\u20131256, son of Batu Khan and [[Boraqchin (Tatar)|Boraqchin]]\n* [[Toqoqan]]<ref>David Morgan, ''The Mongols'', p. 224.</ref>\n* Andewan\n* [[Ulaghchi|Ulagchi]] \u2013 probably the son of Sartaq often named Ju Lai (Dzhulaibek)\n\nBatu's mother Ukhaa ujin belonged to the Mongol [[Onggirat]] clan<ref>Rashid al-Din ''Universal History'', Jochids' tale</ref> while his chief khatun Boraqchin was an Alchi-[[Tatar]].\n\nWhen Batu and his son [[Sartak]] died, after a brief regency of [[Boraqchin (Tatar)|Boraqchin]] for [[Ulaghchi|Ulagchi]], Batu's brother [[Berke]] inherited the [[Golden Horde]]. Berke was not inclined to unity with his cousins in the Mongol family, making war on [[Hulagu Khan]], though Berke officially recognized M\u00f6ngke and the [[Empire of the Great Khan]] as his overlords.  In fact, Berke was an independent ruler by then. Berke did not share Batu's interest in conquering it, however, he demanded [[Nobility and royalty of the Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian King]] [[B\u00e9la IV]]'s submission and sent his general [[Borolday]] to [[Lithuania]] and Poland.\n\nThe Kipchak Khanate was known in Rus and Europe as the [[Golden Horde]] (''Zolotaya Orda'') some think because of the golden colour of the Khan's tent. \"Horde\" comes from the Mongol word \"orda/ordu\" or camp. \"Golden\" is thought to have had a similar meaning to \"royal\" (Royal Camp). Of all the Khanates, the Golden Horde ruled longest. Long after the expulsion of the [[Yuan dynasty]] from China to Mongolia, and the fall of [[Ilkhanate]] in Middle East, the descendants of Batu Khan continued to rule the steppes in what is now Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan. However, Batu's line had ruled the Jochid Ulus until 1360, a century after Berke's death in 1264. Descendants of his brothers, Orda and Tuqatimur, took the throne of the Golden Horde afterwards.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center | ref=<ref>Anne F.
