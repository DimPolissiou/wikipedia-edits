Laursen got involved with [[martial arts]] through his older brother Christian, and was 15 when he began training in Muay Thai.\n\nLaursen currently lives in Ubon Ratchatani, Thailand and fights out of his own Legacy Gym.\n\nLaursen trained with [[Peter J McCarthy]], the subject, director and producer of the documentary, [[Fight or Flight (documentary)|Fight of Flight]] which won \"Best Foreign Documentary\" at the Long Island Film Festival, New York as well as three other \"Best Documentary\" awards at festivals in Hamburg, Toronto and California. Laursen assisted the production team in Ubon Ratchatani.\n\n==Kickboxing / K-1 / Muay Thai career==\n\nAs an amateur Laursen had six fights before turning professional. He lost his first amateur bout, took a year off, and then came back with five straight wins \u2013 all by knockout, winning the 1998 Danish amateur kickboxing title in the process. He made his professional debut in 2000 and picked up his first major honour that summer, defeating Eval Denton to win the [[International Kickboxing Federation|I.K.F.]] European title.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.ikfkickboxing.com/NewsJulyAug2000.htm\n| title=IKF NIGHT Of CHAMPIONS In England!

Severely overmatched, he was dropped with a knee [[Liver shot|to the liver]] before being knocked out with a left high kick immediately after in round one.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2062:giorgio-petrosyan-vs-ole-laursen-march-2-in-italy&catid=37:kickboxing Giorgio Petrosyan vs. Ole Laursen, March 2 In Italy]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2334:giorgio-petrosyan-vs-ole-laursen-tomorrow-live-stream&catid=37:kickboxing Giorgio Petrosyan vs. Ole Laursen Tomorrow, Live Stream]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2335:march-madness-kickboxing-fights-to-watch-this-month&catid=34:demo-content March Madness: Kickboxing Fights to Watch This Month]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2339:giorgio-petrosyan-gets-first-ko-in-3-years-against-ole-laursen-video&catid=37:kickboxing Giorgio Petrosyan Gets First KO in 3 Years Against Ole Laursen (Video)]</ref>\n\n==Boxing career==\nLaursen had a trial with the Philippines National Boxing Team and was accepted but decided to move to Thailand instead of staying in the Philippines to pursue a career in boxing.<ref>http://filipinoboxingjournal.com/2011/07/20/boxing-philippines-pacquiao-folayang-mma-hotshot-ole-laursen-talks-fbj/</ref>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nLaursen made his professional MMA debut in 2006 and had two fights with the [[K-1]] [[Hero's]] promotion in Japan. He lost his first fight against [[Genki Sudo]] by decision and his second fight to [[Caol Uno]] by third round submission. Laursen was suffering from a knee injury and was not able to train properly for the fight with Uno.<ref>http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2011/8/2/2310952/one-fc-exclusive-ole-laursen-tuf-filipino-eduard-folayang-mma-news</ref>\n\nLaursen did not begin to fight MMA regularly again until 2010 because he was focused on his K-1 and Muay Thai career, a decision he has subsequently said he regrets.<ref>http://www.seamma.com/olelaursen.htm</ref> His next two fights were both in China, with Laursen submitting Liu Guang Yao in 2007 and knocking out Shawn David in 2009.\n\nIn 2010 he signed with [[ESPN Star Sports]] promotion Martial Combat in Singapore.

[[ONE FC]]'s [[Lightweight (MMA)|Lightweight]] division.\n\n==Early life==\nLaursen was born in Manila, Philippines to Danish father and a Spanish-Filipino mother and moved to Denmark with his family when he was two years old. Laursen got involved with [[martial arts]] through his older brother Christian, and was 15 when he began training in Muay Thai.\n\nLaursen currently lives in Ubon Ratchatani, Thailand and fights out of his own Legacy Gym.\n\nLaursen trained with [[Peter J McCarthy]], the subject, director and producer of the documentary, [[Fight or Flight (documentary)|Fight of Flight]] which won \"Best Foreign Documentary\" at the Long Island Film Festival, New York as well as three other \"Best Documentary\" awards at festivals in Hamburg, Toronto and California. Laursen assisted the production team in Ubon Ratchatani.\n\n==Kickboxing / K-1 / Muay Thai career==\n\nAs an amateur Laursen had six fights before turning professional. He lost his first amateur bout, took a year off, and then came back with five straight wins \u2013 all by knockout, winning the 1998 Danish amateur kickboxing title in the process. He made his professional debut in 2000 and picked up his first major honour that summer, defeating Eval Denton to win the [[International Kickboxing Federation|I.K.F.]] European title.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.ikfkickboxing.com/NewsJulyAug2000.htm\n| title=IKF NIGHT Of CHAMPIONS In England!

Severely overmatched, he was dropped with a knee [[Liver shot|to the liver]] before being knocked out with a left high kick immediately after in round one.<ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2062:giorgio-petrosyan-vs-ole-laursen-march-2-in-italy&catid=37:kickboxing Giorgio Petrosyan vs. Ole Laursen, March 2 In Italy]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2334:giorgio-petrosyan-vs-ole-laursen-tomorrow-live-stream&catid=37:kickboxing Giorgio Petrosyan vs. Ole Laursen Tomorrow, Live Stream]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2335:march-madness-kickboxing-fights-to-watch-this-month&catid=34:demo-content March Madness: Kickboxing Fights to Watch This Month]</ref><ref>[http://liverkick.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2339:giorgio-petrosyan-gets-first-ko-in-3-years-against-ole-laursen-video&catid=37:kickboxing Giorgio Petrosyan Gets First KO in 3 Years Against Ole Laursen (Video)]</ref>\n\n==Boxing career==\nLaursen had a trial with the Philippines National Boxing Team and was accepted but decided to move to Thailand instead of staying in the Philippines to pursue a career in boxing.<ref>http://filipinoboxingjournal.com/2011/07/20/boxing-philippines-pacquiao-folayang-mma-hotshot-ole-laursen-talks-fbj/</ref>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nLaursen made his professional MMA debut in 2006 and had two fights with the [[K-1]] [[Hero's]] promotion in Japan. He lost his first fight against [[Genki Sudo]] by decision and his second fight to [[Caol Uno]] by third round submission. Laursen was suffering from a knee injury and was not able to train properly for the fight with Uno.<ref>http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2011/8/2/2310952/one-fc-exclusive-ole-laursen-tuf-filipino-eduard-folayang-mma-news</ref>\n\nLaursen did not begin to fight MMA regularly again until 2010 because he was focused on his K-1 and Muay Thai career, a decision he has subsequently said he regrets.<ref>http://www.seamma.com/olelaursen.htm</ref> His next two fights were both in China, with Laursen submitting Liu Guang Yao in 2007 and knocking out Shawn David in 2009.\n\nIn 2010 he signed with [[ESPN Star Sports]] promotion Martial Combat in Singapore. He defeated Eduardo Pachu in the third round of their five-round 'super fight' at Martial Combat 1.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://redsports.sg/2010/05/14/mixed-martial-arts/\n| title=Ole Laursen beats Eduardo Pachu to win Lightweight Championship Belt in mixed martial arts\n| last= \n| first= \n| accessdate=2011-02-16\n| publisher=redsports.sg\n}}</ref> His second fight was against Nick LeConte at Martial Combat 8 and Laursen won by unanimous decision. His final fight for Martial Combat was against Malaysian Muay Thai champion Jian Kai Chee at Martial Combat 12 and Laursen won by TKO in the first round.\n\nIn November 2010 MMA website Bloody Elbow ranked Laursen number eight on a list of the top lightweight prospects in the world.<ref>http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/11/6/1797633/world-mma-lightweight-scouting-report-8-ole-laursen</ref>\n\n==ONE Fighting Championship==\nOn July 15, 2011 it was announced that Laursen had signed with [[One Fighting Championship]].<ref>http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Singapores-One-FC-Launches-Gracies-Filipino-Champs-Aboard-33963</ref> On July 18 it was announced that Laursen would be facing fellow Filipino [[Eduard Folayang]] at [[ONE Fighting Championship: Champion vs. Champion]] at the [[Singapore Indoor Stadium]] on September 3.<ref>http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Baroni-Yoshida-Gregor-Gracie-Added-to-One-FCs-Sept-3-Debut-34093</ref> On August 17, 2011 it was announced that Laursen had injured his knee in training and would be unable to fight Folayang at [[ONE Fighting Championship: Champion vs. Champion]].

In the first edition, [[Murshid Quli Khan]] was bought as a slave of Iran's high-ranking Mughal officer named [[Haji Shafi Isfahani]]. Isfahani educated him. On his return to India, he joined the [[Mughal Empire]]. In 6, he is converted to [[Islam]] in the presence of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]], who named him as Kartalab Khan, and appointed him as thr governor of Bengal. In another version he was the grandson of [[Maratha General]] [[Muhammad Quli Khan]]. But the most popular is that [[Murshid Quli Khan]] was born into a poor Deccan plateau [[Oriya]] [[Brahmin]] family. Before being sold as a slave to [[Haji Shafi Isfahan]] to a Persian merchant, who was a [[Shia]] muslim, he was converted to Islam. Some source says he changed his name to Muhammad Hadi or Mirza Hadi. He took a job under [[Dewan Haji Abdullah Quraishi]] in the province of Berar. Later, the Dewan emperor of Berar province came under [[Aurangzeb]].\n\nSome source states, born a [[Hindu]] in the [[Deccan Plateau]] {{circa}} 1670, [[Murshid Quli Khan]] was bought by Mughal noble Haji Shafi. After Shafi's death, he worked under the [[Divan]] of [[Vidarbha]], during which time he piqued the attention of the then-emperor [[Aurangzeb]], who sent him to [[Bengal]] as the divan {{circa}} 1700. However, he entered into a bloody conflict with the province's ''[[subahdar]]'', [[Azim-us-Shan]]. After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, he was transferred to the Deccan Plateau by Azim-us-Shan's father the Mughal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah I]]. However, he was brought back as deputy ''subahdar'' in 1710. In 1717, he was appointed as the ''Nawab Nazim'' of Murshidabad by [[Farrukhsiyar]]. During his reign, he changed the ''[[jagirdari]]'' system (land management) to the ''mal jasmani,'' which would later transform into the ''[[zamindari]]'' system. He also continued sending revenues from the state to the [[Mughal Empire]]. He built the [[Katra Masjid]] mosque at [[Murshidabad]] where he was buried under the steps of the staircase after his death on 30 June 1727. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Shuja ud Din Muhammad Khan.\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to [[Sir Jadunath Sarkar]], Murshid Quli Khan was originally a [[Hindu]]  as '''Surya Narayan Mishra''', born in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] {{circa}} 1670.<ref>Sarkar, p.400</ref> The book ''[[Ma'asir al-umara]]'' supports this statement.<ref name=\"MQK\">Chowdhury, p.16</ref> At the age of around ten years, he was sold to a Persian named Haji Shafi who circumcised him,{{refn|group=note|Shafi worked in various posts in the [[Mughal Empire]] which included Diwan-i-Tan and Dewan of Bengal.<ref name=\"MQK\"/>}} and raised him with the name Mohammad Hadi.<ref name=\"MQK\"/> In {{circa}} 1690, Shafi left his position in the Mughal court and returned to Persia accompanied by Murshid Quli Khan. About five years after Shafi's death, Murshid returned to India and worked under Abdullah Khurasani, the Diwan of [[Vidarbha]] in the Mughal Empire. Due to his expertise in revenue matters, he was noticed by Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] and played an important when applying the [[sharia]] based [[Fatwa Alamgiri's]] financial strategies.<ref name=\"MQK\"/>\n\nUnlike other Islamic rulers, Murshid Quli Khan had only one wife, Nasiri Banu Begum, and no concubines. He had three children, two daughters and one son. One of his daughters became the wife of [[Nawab]] [[Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan]] and mother of [[Sarfaraz Khan]].<ref>Chowdhury, p.87</ref>\n\n==First appointment in Bengal==\n\n===Conflict with Azim-us-Shan===\nAurangzeb appointed Quli Khan the Diwan of Bengal {{circa}} 1700. At that time, [[Azim-us-Shan]], a grandson of the Mughal emperor, was the ''subahdar'' of the province. He was not pleased at this appointment as he intend to use the revenue collected from the state to fund his campaign to occupy the Mughal throne after Aurangzeb's death.<ref name=\"MQ\">Chowdhury, p.17</ref> Immediately after being appointed to the post, Quli Khan went to Jahangirnagar (present day [[Dhaka]]) and transferred officials from the service of Azim-us-Shan to himself, enraging Azim-us-Shan.<ref name=\"MQ\"/>\n\n===Assassination attempt===\nAzim-us-Shan planned to assassinate Quli Khan. Taking advantage of the fact the soldiers had yet to be paid, he convinced them that Quli Khan was responsible for the situation. He planned to have them surround Quli Khan on the pretext of confronting him over non-payment of their wages, and he would then be stabbed.<ref name=\"MQ\"/>\n\nOne morning when Quli Khan was going to meet Azim-us-Shan, soldiers, under the leadership of Abdul Wahid, surrounded him and asked him for their wages. But, according to Historian Chowdhury, Quli Khan knew that us-Shan was responsible for inciting the soldiers,<ref name=\"MQ\"/> so he said to them: \"You have conspired to assassinate me. Remember that the ''Alamgir'' (Aurangzeb) will come to know everything. Abstain from doing such things, as it is a way of showing disrespect to the emperor. Be careful! If you kill me, then you will face dire consequences.\"<ref name=\"Sarkar, p.404\">Sarkar, p.404</ref>\n\nAzim-us-Shan was extremely worried Quli Khan knew of his assassination plans and was fearful of Aurangzeb's reaction. Quli Khan behaved as if he knew nothing of the plan assuring us-Shan they would remain friends in the future. However, he wrote about the matter to Aurangzeb, who in turn sent a letter to us-Shan warning him that if Quli Khan was \"harmed, then he would take revenge on him\".<ref name=\"ME\">Chowdhury, p.18</ref>\n\n==Foundation of Murshidabad==\nQuli Khan felt unsafe in Dhaka, so he moved the ''diwani'' office to Mukshudabad.{{refn|group=note|According to [[Ain-i-Akbari]], Mukshudabad was founded by a trader named Mukshud Khan in the sixteenth century who also built a ''sarai'' here. On Dutch traveller Valentijn's map, the city was shown as an island in the [[Ganges]] River. According to historian Nikhilnath Roy, during the reign of Sultan Hussain Shah, he was cured of fever by sage, so the city was named after it in 1702.<ref name=\"MQKTT\">Chowdhury, p.20</ref>}} He said that he relocated the office since Mukshudabad was situated in the central part of Bengal, making it easy to communicate throughout the province. As the city was on the banks of the Ganges, European trading companies had also set up their bases there. Quli Khan thought that it would be easy for him to keep a vigil over their actions. He also relocated the bankers to the new city. Azim-us-Shan felt betrayed as this was done without his permission. Historian Chowdhury says that Quli Khan was able to do this because he had the \"support\" of Aurangzeb.<ref name=\"MQN\">Choudhury, p.19</ref> A year later, in 1703, Aurangzeb transferred us-Shan from Bengal to [[Bihar]] and [[Farrukhsiyar]] was made the titular ''subahdar'' of the province. The ''[[subah]]'' office was then relocated to Mukshudabad. The city became a centre for all activities of the region.<ref name=\"MQN\"/>\n\nQuli Khan went to [[Bijapur]] to meet Aurangzeb, and to give him the revenue which was generated from the province. The emperor was happy with his work and gifted him clothes, flags, ''nagra,'' and a sword. He also gave him the title of Murshid Quli and gave him permission to rename the city [[Murshidabad]] (the city of Murshid Quli Khan), which he did when he returned to it.<ref name=\"Sarkar, p.404\"/>\n\nWhen the city was renamed is disputed by historians. [[Sir Jadunath Sarkar]] says that he was given the title on 23 December 1702, and his return to the city would have taken at least three months; so Mukshudabad was renamed in 1703.<ref>Sarkar, p.399</ref> But according to the newspaper ''Tarikh-i-Bangla,'' and Persian historian Riwaz-us-Salatin, the city was renamed in {{circa}} 1704. Chowdhury opines that this \"might be the correct date\" as the representative of the [[British East Indian Company]] in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] province met Quli Khan in early 1704. The fact that the first coins issued in Murshidabad are dated 1704 is strong evidence of the year of the name change.<ref>Chowdhury, p.21</ref>\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Death of Aurangzeb===\nUntil the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, all the powers of the ''subahdar'' were vested in the hands of Quli Khan. He was succeeded by Azim-us-Shan's father [[Bahadur Shah I]]. He reappointed his son as the ''subahdar'' of the province and made Quli Khan his deputy. Azim-us-Shan influenced his father to throw Quli Khan out of the province. As a result, he was appointed the Diwan of Deccan in 1708, and served in the post until 1709.<ref name=\"MQKTF\">Chowdhury, p.24</ref>\n\nBut, in 1710, Quli Khan was brought back as the ''[[Dewan|diwan]]'' (revenue officer) of the province on the advice of us-Shan. According to Sarkar, he did so to form an allegiance with him, as he thought that it would be impossible to occupy the Delhi throne without the support of local nobility. Though he was brought back, his relationship with the Mughal prince remained stained.<ref>Sarkar, p.405</ref>\n\nShah was succeeded by [[Jahandar Shah]] in 1712, (27 February 1712 \u2013 11 February 1713) and he was followed by Farrukhsiyar in 1713. In 1717,{{refn|group=note|Historian Abdul Karim disputes the date and claims it to be 1716, but all other sources use 1717.<ref name=\"MQKTF\"/>}} he gave Quli Khan the title of Zafar Khan and made him the Subahdar of Bengal, thus holding both the post of ''subahdar'' and ''diwan'' at the same time. He declared himself the [[Nawab]] of Bengal and became the first independent ''nawab'' of the province.<ref>Sarkar, p.407</ref> The capital was shifted from Dhaka to Murshidabad.<ref name=\"MQKTFive\"/>\n\n===Revenue===\nQuli Khan replaced the Mughal ''[[jagirdari]]'' system with the ''mal jasmani'' system, which was similar to France's ''[[Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale|fermiers generals]]''. He took security bonds from the contractors or ''ijardaars'' who later collected the land revenue. Though at first there remained many ''jagirdars'', they were shortly squeezed out by the contractors, who later came to be known as ''zamindars''.<ref>{{cite book |author1=U. A. B. Razia Akter Banu |year=1992 |title=Islam in Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyzqATEDPSgC&pg=PA21 |publisher=E. J. Brill |page=21 |isbn=978-90-04-09497-0}}</ref>\n\nQuli Khan continued his policy of sending part of the revenue collected to the Mughal Empire. He did so even when the empire was in decline with the emperor vesting no power, as the power became concentrated in the hands of kingmakers. He justified his action by saying that it would be impossible to run the Mughal Empire without the revenue he sent. Historian Chowdhury says that his real reason was to show his loyalty to the Mughal Emperor so that he could run the state according to his own wishes.<ref name=\"MQKTFive\">Chowdhury, p.25</ref>\n\nRecords show that every year 1 crore 30 lakh rupees was sent as the revenue to the Mughal emperor. Besides money revenue was also paid in kind.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} Quli Khan himself used to carry the money and other forms of revenue with the [[infantry]] and the [[cavalry]] to [[Bihar]] where they were given to the Mughal collector.<ref name=\"MQKTS\"/>\n\n===Structures built===\nWith Murshidabad evolving as the capital of [[Bengal]], it became necessary for Quli Khan to build buildings and offices for work to be carried out from that city. In the Dugharia region of the city he built a palace, a ''diwankhana'' (\"office of revenue collection\", a court of exchequer). He also built an inn and a mosque for foreign travellers. He also constructed a mint in the city in 1720.<ref name=\"MQKTS\">Chowdhury, p.26</ref> In the eastern end of the city he built the [[Katra Masjid]] mosque in 1724 where he was buried after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Begum |first=Ayesha |year=2012 |chapter=Katra Mosque, Murshidabad |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Katra_Mosque,_Murshidabad |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n\n===Conditions in Murshidabad===\nDuring Quli Khan's reign  the people of the Murshidabad used to participate in many festivals. One of them was the ''Punyah'' which occurred in the last week of the Bengali month of ''Chaitra''. The ''[[zamindar]]s,'' or their representatives, took part in it. However, the festival which was celebrated with the greatest pomp and grandeur was [[Mawlid]] the festival to celebrate the birth of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. During Mawlid people from neighbouring provinces came to the city to celebrate. On Quli Khan's order ''chirag'' or lamps were lit in all religious places such as mosques, and ''imambararas.''<ref name=\"MQKTSE\">Chowdhury, p.27</ref>\n\nQuli Khan also imitated the Mughal tradition of holding a ''durbar'' in the city which was attended by the city's bankers, foreign tourists, and European companies' representatives. Because of the increase in trade, a new class of businessmen arose who also attended his ''durbar''. Due to his pious nature, Quli Khan followed [[Islam]] strictly and, according to Islamic rules, visitors were fed twice a day.<ref name=\"MQKTSE\"/>\n\nPrior to Quli Khan being the nawab of Murshidabad, the city was a major exporter of [[rice]] across India. But, after he became the nawab {{circa}} 1720, he passed a law prohibiting the export of rice. For this reason, the cost of rice in the region rose.<ref>Murshidabader Itihash by Nikhilnath Roy, p.471</ref> According to his minister Gulam Hussain the cost became Rs 1 per 5 ''mon''.<ref name=\"MQKTSE\"/>\n\nHistorian Chowdhury says that the condition of Hindus during his reign was \"also good\" as \"they became more rich\"(''sic''). Though Quli Khan was a Muslim, Hindus were employed in the tax department primarily because he thought they were experts in the field; they could also speak fluent [[Persian language|Persian]]. However, if they were found guilty of cheating, Quli Khan imposed harsh punishments compared to those imposed upon Muslims.<ref>Chowdhury, p.28</ref>\n\n==Death and succession==\n[[File:TombofMurshidQuliKhan.jpg|thumb|Khan's tomb under the stairs of [[Katra Masjid]]]]\nQuli Khan died on 30 June 1727.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mohammed Yamin|title=Impact of Islam on Orissan Culture|publisher=Readworthy|isbn=9789350181027|page=46}}</ref> He was succeeded initially by his grandson [[Sarfaraz Khan]].

The ''[[subah]]'' office was then relocated to Mukshudabad. The city became a centre for all activities of the region.<ref name=\"MQN\"/>\n\nQuli Khan went to [[Bijapur]] to meet Aurangzeb, and to give him the revenue which was generated from the province. The emperor was happy with his work and gifted him clothes, flags, ''nagra,'' and a sword. He also gave him the title of Murshid Quli and gave him permission to rename the city [[Murshidabad]] (the city of Murshid Quli Khan), which he did when he returned to it.<ref name=\"Sarkar, p.404\"/>\n\nWhen the city was renamed is disputed by historians. [[Sir Jadunath Sarkar]] says that he was given the title on 23 December 1702, and his return to the city would have taken at least three months; so Mukshudabad was renamed in 1703.<ref>Sarkar, p.399</ref> But according to the newspaper ''Tarikh-i-Bangla,'' and Persian historian Riwaz-us-Salatin, the city was renamed in {{circa}} 1704. Chowdhury opines that this \"might be the correct date\" as the representative of the [[British East Indian Company]] in [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] province met Quli Khan in early 1704. The fact that the first coins issued in Murshidabad are dated 1704 is strong evidence of the year of the name change.<ref>Chowdhury, p.21</ref>\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Death of Aurangzeb===\nUntil the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, all the powers of the ''subahdar'' were vested in the hands of Quli Khan. He was succeeded by Azim-us-Shan's father [[Bahadur Shah I]]. He reappointed his son as the ''subahdar'' of the province and made Quli Khan his deputy. Azim-us-Shan influenced his father to throw Quli Khan out of the province. As a result, he was appointed the Diwan of Deccan in 1708, and served in the post until 1709.<ref name=\"MQKTF\">Chowdhury, p.24</ref>\n\nBut, in 1710, Quli Khan was brought back as the ''[[Dewan|diwan]]'' (revenue officer) of the province on the advice of us-Shan. According to Sarkar, he did so to form an allegiance with him, as he thought that it would be impossible to occupy the Delhi throne without the support of local nobility. Though he was brought back, his relationship with the Mughal prince remained stained.<ref>Sarkar, p.405</ref>\n\nShah was succeeded by [[Jahandar Shah]] in 1712, (27 February 1712 \u2013 11 February 1713) and he was followed by Farrukhsiyar in 1713. In 1717,{{refn|group=note|Historian Abdul Karim disputes the date and claims it to be 1716, but all other sources use 1717.<ref name=\"MQKTF\"/>}} he gave Quli Khan the title of Zafar Khan and made him the Subahdar of Bengal, thus holding both the post of ''subahdar'' and ''diwan'' at the same time. He declared himself the [[Nawab]] of Bengal and became the first independent ''nawab'' of the province.<ref>Sarkar, p.407</ref> The capital was shifted from Dhaka to Murshidabad.<ref name=\"MQKTFive\"/>\n\n===Revenue===\nQuli Khan replaced the Mughal ''[[jagirdari]]'' system with the ''mal jasmani'' system, which was similar to France's ''[[Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale|fermiers generals]]''. He took security bonds from the contractors or ''ijardaars'' who later collected the land revenue. Though at first there remained many ''jagirdars'', they were shortly squeezed out by the contractors, who later came to be known as ''zamindars''.<ref>{{cite book |author1=U. A. B. Razia Akter Banu |year=1992 |title=Islam in Bangladesh |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyzqATEDPSgC&pg=PA21 |publisher=E. J. Brill |page=21 |isbn=978-90-04-09497-0}}</ref>\n\nQuli Khan continued his policy of sending part of the revenue collected to the Mughal Empire. He did so even when the empire was in decline with the emperor vesting no power, as the power became concentrated in the hands of kingmakers. He justified his action by saying that it would be impossible to run the Mughal Empire without the revenue he sent. Historian Chowdhury says that his real reason was to show his loyalty to the Mughal Emperor so that he could run the state according to his own wishes.<ref name=\"MQKTFive\">Chowdhury, p.25</ref>\n\nRecords show that every year 1 crore 30 lakh rupees was sent as the revenue to the Mughal emperor. Besides money revenue was also paid in kind.{{clarify|date=July 2017}} Quli Khan himself used to carry the money and other forms of revenue with the [[infantry]] and the [[cavalry]] to [[Bihar]] where they were given to the Mughal collector.<ref name=\"MQKTS\"/>\n\n===Structures built===\nWith Murshidabad evolving as the capital of [[Bengal]], it became necessary for Quli Khan to build buildings and offices for work to be carried out from that city. In the Dugharia region of the city he built a palace, a ''diwankhana'' (\"office of revenue collection\", a court of exchequer). He also built an inn and a mosque for foreign travellers. He also constructed a mint in the city in 1720.<ref name=\"MQKTS\">Chowdhury, p.26</ref> In the eastern end of the city he built the [[Katra Masjid]] mosque in 1724 where he was buried after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Begum |first=Ayesha |year=2012 |chapter=Katra Mosque, Murshidabad |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Katra_Mosque,_Murshidabad |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n\n===Conditions in Murshidabad===\nDuring Quli Khan's reign  the people of the Murshidabad used to participate in many festivals. One of them was the ''Punyah'' which occurred in the last week of the Bengali month of ''Chaitra''. The ''[[zamindar]]s,'' or their representatives, took part in it. However, the festival which was celebrated with the greatest pomp and grandeur was [[Mawlid]] the festival to celebrate the birth of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. During Mawlid people from neighbouring provinces came to the city to celebrate. On Quli Khan's order ''chirag'' or lamps were lit in all religious places such as mosques, and ''imambararas.''<ref name=\"MQKTSE\">Chowdhury, p.27</ref>\n\nQuli Khan also imitated the Mughal tradition of holding a ''durbar'' in the city which was attended by the city's bankers, foreign tourists, and European companies' representatives. Because of the increase in trade, a new class of businessmen arose who also attended his ''durbar''. Due to his pious nature, Quli Khan followed [[Islam]] strictly and, according to Islamic rules, visitors were fed twice a day.<ref name=\"MQKTSE\"/>\n\nPrior to Quli Khan being the nawab of Murshidabad, the city was a major exporter of [[rice]] across India. But, after he became the nawab {{circa}} 1720, he passed a law prohibiting the export of rice. For this reason, the cost of rice in the region rose.<ref>Murshidabader Itihash by Nikhilnath Roy, p.471</ref> According to his minister Gulam Hussain the cost became Rs 1 per 5 ''mon''.<ref name=\"MQKTSE\"/>\n\nHistorian Chowdhury says that the condition of Hindus during his reign was \"also good\" as \"they became more rich\"(''sic''). Though Quli Khan was a Muslim, Hindus were employed in the tax department primarily because he thought they were experts in the field; they could also speak fluent [[Persian language|Persian]]. However, if they were found guilty of cheating, Quli Khan imposed harsh punishments compared to those imposed upon Muslims.<ref>Chowdhury, p.28</ref>\n\n==Death and succession==\n[[File:TombofMurshidQuliKhan.jpg|thumb|Khan's tomb under the stairs of [[Katra Masjid]]]]\nQuli Khan died on 30 June 1727.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mohammed Yamin|title=Impact of Islam on Orissan Culture|publisher=Readworthy|isbn=9789350181027|page=46}}</ref> He was succeeded initially by his grandson [[Sarfaraz Khan]]. But his son-in-law [[Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan]] did not accept the succession, and planned to fight a war against him.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a foil equal to [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role, because he had the charisma, charm and athleticism they felt was needed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further. Hutchison said that while he is just as \"scary\" as the other Salamancas, he is \"a little more circumspect about things.\" She explained that the producers wanted him to be \"a little charming\", in contrast to the other Salamancas, and \"There isn't something about them where you're like, \"Oh, he's scary, but he's kinda funny, too!\" We really liked the idea of having a Salamanca who's charming\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/better-call-saul-wiedersehen-interview-gennifer-hutchison-1148495 |title='Better Call Saul' Writer Breaks Down the \"Wiedersehen\" Rooftop Fight and That Famous Bell |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |date=October 1, 2018 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081655/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/better-call-saul-wiedersehen-interview-gennifer-hutchison-1148495 |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> Additional characterization was given in the season five finale \"[[Something Unforgivable]]\", which provided breadth of development not seen in prior episodes, according to Dalton. The episode shows Lalo early on as a charismatic person welcomed by his extended family and the leaders of the cartel, but later showing an evil and vengeful side after his family comes under attack.<ref name=\"variety dalton\" />\n\nGilligan and Gould gave Dalton the freedom to take Lalo's personality as he saw fit, in the same manner they had allowed [[Jonathan Banks]] to develop [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] during ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"vulture dalton\" /> According to Dalton, Lalo was not originally meant to be very charming: \"I saw ''Breaking Bad'' and I saw ''Better Call Saul'' before I got the job, and I thought there needs to be somebody besides [[Bob Odenkirk|Bob [Odenkirk]]], [...] who is also kind of smiling and carefree and a little bit mischievous in the bad guy's part\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> Dalton took inspiration from [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s character Jules Winnfield from ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' for acting as Lalo, \"Kind of this smart ass, sort of scary but kind of carefree, kind of cool guy\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> He also sought to differentiate Lalo from his hitman role in the [[HBO Latin America Group|HBO Latinoam\u00e9rica]] series ''[[Sr. \u00c1vila]]'', saying that the latter \"had zero personality. If he was standing against a wall, you couldn\u2019t tell him apart from the wall.\" Dalton avoided giving him a thick Mexican accent because \"he\u2019s kind of a second generation narco. He might have gone to a good school in Texas or Arizona or something because his family had money.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Segal |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/arts/television/tony-dalton-better-call-saul-finale.html |title=Tony Dalton Talks \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019: Sympathy for el Diablo |date=April 20, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 21, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421122045/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/arts/television/tony-dalton-better-call-saul-finale.html |archive-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> Dalton further distanced his character from the typical portrayal of cartel members in past works, who typically are presented as serious about their work, and instead took on a more upbeat personality to show Lalo's normally easy take on life. He pulled in a Mexican accent that he had developed from growing up around [[Laredo, Texas]] as a further means to distance Lalo from the typical cartel stereotype.<ref name=\"variety dalton\" />\n\nDalton did actually perform one of the action stunts in the show, that of Lalo jumping through the roof of the Travelwire store before attacking the store manager Fred in \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\". While Dalton was eager to do other stunts as Lalo, such as jumping onto Jimmy's car in \"[[Bad Choice Road]]\" and from the roof of his house in \"[[Something Unforgivable]]\", the producers insisted these be done by stuntmen.<ref name=\"vulture dalton\" />\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n=== Background ===\nEduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca is a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]] and one of many nephews of drug kingpin Hector Salamanca.

After Mike and Gus leave, Lalo enters the store and attempts to learn what Mike knows, but the clerk, Fred Whalen, refuses to tell him. Lalo kills Fred and reviews the footage himself, burns the store as he leaves, then begins calling travel resorts to track down Werner. Pretending to work for Gus, Lalo obtains some details about the construction of the meth lab before Mike arrives at Werner's location and ends the call.

Mike was tracking Jimmy for Gus and kills all but one of Jimmy's attackers. They are forced to walk through the desert for two days after Jimmy's car breaks down, before the two are able to work together to lure out and kill the sole remaining attacker.

Lalo tells Jimmy he plans to avoid a trial by returning to Mexico the next day. Lalo says goodbye to Hector, and then has Nacho take him to the same drop-off point where Jimmy met Leonel and Marco. Lalo realizes he did not see Jimmy's car, so he searches until he finds it where Jimmy and Mike pushed it over the edge of the road. Instead of returning to Mexico, Lalo instructs Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. At Kim's apartment, Lalo confronts Jimmy and Kim about Jimmy's cover story while Mike listens in via Jimmy's cell phone and keeps a sniper rifle aimed at Lalo.

The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a foil equal to [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role, because he had the charisma, charm and athleticism they felt was needed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further. Hutchison said that while he is just as \"scary\" as the other Salamancas, he is \"a little more circumspect about things.\" She explained that the producers wanted him to be \"a little charming\", in contrast to the other Salamancas, and \"There isn't something about them where you're like, \"Oh, he's scary, but he's kinda funny, too!\" We really liked the idea of having a Salamanca who's charming\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/better-call-saul-wiedersehen-interview-gennifer-hutchison-1148495 |title='Better Call Saul' Writer Breaks Down the \"Wiedersehen\" Rooftop Fight and That Famous Bell |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |date=October 1, 2018 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081655/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/better-call-saul-wiedersehen-interview-gennifer-hutchison-1148495 |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> Additional characterization was given in the season five finale \"[[Something Unforgivable]]\", which provided breadth of development not seen in prior episodes, according to Dalton. The episode shows Lalo early on as a charismatic person welcomed by his extended family and the leaders of the cartel, but later showing an evil and vengeful side after his family comes under attack.<ref name=\"variety dalton\" />\n\nGilligan and Gould gave Dalton the freedom to take Lalo's personality as he saw fit, in the same manner they had allowed [[Jonathan Banks]] to develop [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] during ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"vulture dalton\" /> According to Dalton, Lalo was not originally meant to be very charming: \"I saw ''Breaking Bad'' and I saw ''Better Call Saul'' before I got the job, and I thought there needs to be somebody besides [[Bob Odenkirk|Bob [Odenkirk]]], [...] who is also kind of smiling and carefree and a little bit mischievous in the bad guy's part\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> Dalton took inspiration from [[Samuel L. Jackson]]'s character Jules Winnfield from ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' for acting as Lalo, \"Kind of this smart ass, sort of scary but kind of carefree, kind of cool guy\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> He also sought to differentiate Lalo from his hitman role in the [[HBO Latin America Group|HBO Latinoam\u00e9rica]] series ''[[Sr. \u00c1vila]]'', saying that the latter \"had zero personality. If he was standing against a wall, you couldn\u2019t tell him apart from the wall.\" Dalton avoided giving him a thick Mexican accent because \"he\u2019s kind of a second generation narco. He might have gone to a good school in Texas or Arizona or something because his family had money.\"<ref>{{Cite news |last=Segal |first=David |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/arts/television/tony-dalton-better-call-saul-finale.html |title=Tony Dalton Talks \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019: Sympathy for el Diablo |date=April 20, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 21, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421122045/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/arts/television/tony-dalton-better-call-saul-finale.html |archive-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> Dalton further distanced his character from the typical portrayal of cartel members in past works, who typically are presented as serious about their work, and instead took on a more upbeat personality to show Lalo's normally easy take on life. He pulled in a Mexican accent that he had developed from growing up around [[Laredo, Texas]] as a further means to distance Lalo from the typical cartel stereotype.<ref name=\"variety dalton\" />\n\nDalton did actually perform one of the action stunts in the show, that of Lalo jumping through the roof of the Travelwire store before attacking the store manager Fred in \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\". While Dalton was eager to do other stunts as Lalo, such as jumping onto Jimmy's car in \"[[Bad Choice Road]]\" and from the roof of his house in \"[[Something Unforgivable]]\", the producers insisted these be done by stuntmen.<ref name=\"vulture dalton\" />\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n=== Background ===\nEduardo \"Lalo\" Salamanca is a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]] and one of many nephews of drug kingpin Hector Salamanca.

Lalo attaches the bell to Hector's wheelchair, enabling him to communicate more effectively with his right index finger, the only body part Hector can move after he emerges from his coma.

Mike stops at a money wire store and reviews security footage showing Werner looking at travel brochures, as Lalo watches from outside. Mike guesses Werner is going to a nearby spa to meet his wife and asks Gus to allow him to persuade Werner to return rather than killing him. After Mike and Gus leave, Lalo enters the store and attempts to learn what Mike knows, but the clerk, Fred Whalen, refuses to tell him. Lalo kills Fred and reviews the footage himself, burns the store as he leaves, then begins calling travel resorts to track down Werner. Pretending to work for Gus, Lalo obtains some details about the construction of the meth lab before Mike arrives at Werner's location and ends the call. Realizing that Lalo is partially aware of Werner's activities, Gus tells Mike Werner will have to be killed and offers to send men to do it. Mike accepts responsibility because Werner escaped on his watch, and kills Werner himself.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Winner |episode-link=Winner (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=October 8, 2018 |season=4 |number=10}}</ref>\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nGus draws Lalo to a meeting by having Nacho secretly slip [[methamphetamine]] into the Salamanca's share of the cartel's cocaine. At a meeting with Gus and [[Juan Bolsa]], Gus tells Lalo that Werner was working on a legitimate construction project, stole cocaine, and escaped, after which Gus had him killed and attempted to cover up the theft. The false cover story explains events of which Lalo is aware, so he accepts Gus's explanation and apology. Bolsa tells Lalo the cartel considers the matter closed.

Lalo arranges for his cousins [[Leonel and Marco Salamanca]] to deliver the cash to Jimmy at a remote desert location, and Jimmy agrees to go - in exchange for $100,000. On his return trip, Jimmy is attacked by gunmen sent by Bolsa, who believes he is protecting Gus's business by keeping Lalo in jail. Mike was tracking Jimmy for Gus and kills all but one of Jimmy's attackers. They are forced to walk through the desert for two days after Jimmy's car breaks down, before the two are able to work together to lure out and kill the sole remaining attacker. When Jimmy fails to arrive home as planned, Kim pretends to be Lalo's lawyer to gain access to Lalo in jail and asks him for Jimmy's location.

Lalo tells Jimmy he plans to avoid a trial by returning to Mexico the next day. Lalo says goodbye to Hector, and then has Nacho take him to the same drop-off point where Jimmy met Leonel and Marco. Lalo realizes he did not see Jimmy's car, so he searches until he finds it where Jimmy and Mike pushed it over the edge of the road. Instead of returning to Mexico, Lalo instructs Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. At Kim's apartment, Lalo confronts Jimmy and Kim about Jimmy's cover story while Mike listens in via Jimmy's cell phone and keeps a sniper rifle aimed at Lalo.

Lalo is awake at 3 a.m., so Nacho starts a fire in the house as a distraction. When Lalo goes to investigate, Nacho opens the gate and flees, while the gunmen enter.

Venantius modified the classical metres based on syllable quantity to an accentual metre more easily suitable to be chanted to music in Christian worship.  In the ninth century, [[Hrabanus Maurus]] also moved away from classical metres to produce Christian hymns such as ''[[Veni Creator Spiritus]]''.\n\nThe name ''sequentia'', on the other hand, came to be bestowed upon these hymns as a result of the works of [[Notker Balbulus]], who popularized the genre in the ninth century by publishing a collection of ''sequentiae'' in his ''Liber Hymnorum''. Since early sequences were written in rhythmical prose, they were also called [[prose]]s (Latin: ''prosae'').\n\nNotker's texts were meant to be sung.  In the Latin [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the [[Middle Ages]], it became customary to prolong the last syllable of the [[Alleluia]], while the [[deacon]] was ascending from the altar to the [[pulpit|ambo]], to sing or chant the Gospel.  This prolonged [[melisma]] was called the ''[[jubilus]],'' ''jubilatio'', or ''laudes'', because of its jubilant tone. It was also called  ''sequentia'', \"sequence,\" because it followed (Latin: ''sequi'') the Alleluia. Notker set words to this melisma in rhythmic prose for chanting as a [[Trope (music)|trope]]. The name ''sequence'' thus came to be applied to these texts; and by extension, to hymns containing [[rhyme]] and accentual metre. A collection of sequences was called the ''Sequentiale''.\n\nOne well-known sequence, falsely attributed to Notker during the Middle Ages, is the prose text ''[[Media vita in morte sumus]]'' (\"In the midst of life we are in death\"), which was translated by [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]] and became a part of the [[requiem|burial service]] in the [[funeral]] rites of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.  Other well-known sequences include the ninth-century ''[[Swan Sequence]]'', [[Tommaso da Celano]]'s ''[[Dies Irae]]'',  St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium|Pange lingua]]'' in praise of the [[Eucharist]], the anonymous medieval hymn ''[[Ave Maris Stella|Ave maris stella]]'' (\"Hail, star of the sea!\"), and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]] sequence ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' by [[Jacopone da Todi]].  During the Middle Ages, secular or semi-secular sequences, such as [[Peter of Blois]]' ''Olim sudor Herculis''<ref>{{cite web|title=Olim sudor Herculis|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-FF-00001-00017-00001/21|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aw1mHKhQlJUC&lpg=PA107&ots=vhfJBTevS2&dq=%22Peter%20of%20Blois%22%20%22Olim%20sudor%20Herculis%22&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false The Later Cambridge Songs: An English Song Collection of the Twelfth Century, edited by John E. Stevens], see p. 107</ref> (\"The labours of Hercules\") were written; the [[Goliard]]s, a group of Latin poets who wrote mostly [[satire|satirical]] verse, used the form extensively.  The ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' is a collection of these sequences.\n\n== Many sequences abolished ==\n\nIn the [[Tridentine Mass|Missal of Pius V]] (1570) the number of sequences for the entire [[Roman Rite]] was reduced to four: ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'' (11th century) for [[Easter]], ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]'' for [[Pentecost]] (12th century), ''[[Lauda Sion Salvatorem]]'' (c.1264) for [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], and ''[[Dies Irae]]'' (13th century) for [[All Souls' Day|All Souls]] and in [[Requiem Mass|Masses for the Dead]]. In 1727, the 13th century ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' for [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] was added to this list.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14239b.htm \"Stabat Mater\"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1917), Retrieved 14 June 2006.</ref> In 1970 the ''[[Dies Irae]]'' was removed from the Requiem Mass of the [[Mass of Paul VI|revised, new Roman Missal]] and was transferred to the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] to be sung ''[[ad libitum]]'' in the week before the beginning of [[Advent]].<ref>''Liturgia Horarum IV'', (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2000), p.489.</ref> The Christmas sequence ''Laetabundus'', not present in the Roman Missal, is found in the Dominican Missal. This sequence is permitted for the Third Mass of Christmas, the Epiphany, and Candlemas. The Third Edition of the Roman Missal, which was implemented in the United States in 2010, states that the Sequence is optional except on Easter Sunday and Pentecost Day, and it sung before the Alleluia.\n\n==The sequence as a musical genre==\n\nSequences are distinguished by a structure dominated by [[couplet]]s, in forms of AA'BB'CC'... and ABB'CC'DD'...Z. Although it is commonly understood that sequences fall into early, middle, and late periods, the history of developments in the genre is better thought of as unfolding in layers that overlap. In the early period, sequences such as Notker's often included single lines that were not part of a couplet.  These single lines most often appeared at the beginning or end of the sequence, but could also appear in the middle.  Sequences from the middle period, starting around the 11th century, such as the sequence for the Mass of [[Easter]] Day, ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'', are less likely to have single lines outside of couplets, and their couplets are more likely to rhyme.  By the 12th century, later sequences, such as the sequence for [[Pentecost]], ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]'', showed increasing regularity of structure, with rhyming couplets throughout.\n\nMedieval sequences are usually [[Musical mode|modal]] melodies. While primarily syllabic, sequences can occasionally have short neumatic moments, but they almost never contain [[melisma]]s. The two verses of each couplet are sung to the same musical line, usually ending on a tonally stabilizing pitch, with variety being created by couplets of different lengths and with different musical arches.  Although sequences are vocal and [[monophony|monophonic]], certain sequence texts suggest possible vocal harmonization in [[organum]] or instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe composition of sequences became less frequent when [[Humanist Latin]] replaced [[medieval Latin]] as the preferred [[literary language|literary style]] in Latin.  New sequences continued to be written in Latin; one of the best known later sequences is the [[Christmas carol]] ''[[Adeste Fideles]]'', known in English as \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\".\n\n==\u039dotes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | \nfirst=Richard | \nlast=Hoppin | \ntitle=Medieval Music | \npublisher=W.

During the Middle Ages, secular or semi-secular sequences, such as [[Peter of Blois]]' ''Olim sudor Herculis''<ref>{{cite web|title=Olim sudor Herculis|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-FF-00001-00017-00001/21|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aw1mHKhQlJUC&lpg=PA107&ots=vhfJBTevS2&dq=%22Peter%20of%20Blois%22%20%22Olim%20sudor%20Herculis%22&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false The Later Cambridge Songs: An English Song Collection of the Twelfth Century, edited by John E. Stevens], see p. 107</ref> (\"The labours of Hercules\") were written; the [[Goliard]]s, a group of Latin poets who wrote mostly [[satire|satirical]] verse, used the form extensively.  The ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' is a collection of these sequences.\n\n== Many sequences abolished ==\n\nIn the [[Tridentine Mass|Missal of Pius V]] (1570) the number of sequences for the entire [[Roman Rite]] was reduced to four: ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'' (11th century) for [[Easter]], ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]'' for [[Pentecost]] (12th century), ''[[Lauda Sion Salvatorem]]'' (c.1264) for [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]], and ''[[Dies Irae]]'' (13th century) for [[All Souls' Day|All Souls]] and in [[Requiem Mass|Masses for the Dead]]. In 1727, the 13th century ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' for [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] was added to this list.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14239b.htm \"Stabat Mater\"], ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1917), Retrieved 14 June 2006.</ref> In 1970 the ''[[Dies Irae]]'' was removed from the Requiem Mass of the [[Mass of Paul VI|revised, new Roman Missal]] and was transferred to the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] to be sung ''[[ad libitum]]'' in the week before the beginning of [[Advent]].<ref>''Liturgia Horarum IV'', (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2000), p.489.</ref> The Christmas sequence ''Laetabundus'', not present in the Roman Missal, is found in the Dominican Missal. This sequence is permitted for the Third Mass of Christmas, the Epiphany, and Candlemas. The Third Edition of the Roman Missal, which was implemented in the United States in 2010, states that the Sequence is optional except on Easter Sunday and Pentecost Day, and it sung before the Alleluia.\n\n==The sequence as a musical genre==\n\nSequences are distinguished by a structure dominated by [[couplet]]s, in forms of AA'BB'CC'... and ABB'CC'DD'...Z. Although it is commonly understood that sequences fall into early, middle, and late periods, the history of developments in the genre is better thought of as unfolding in layers that overlap. In the early period, sequences such as Notker's often included single lines that were not part of a couplet.  These single lines most often appeared at the beginning or end of the sequence, but could also appear in the middle.  Sequences from the middle period, starting around the 11th century, such as the sequence for the Mass of [[Easter]] Day, ''[[Victimae paschali laudes]]'', are less likely to have single lines outside of couplets, and their couplets are more likely to rhyme.  By the 12th century, later sequences, such as the sequence for [[Pentecost]], ''[[Veni Sancte Spiritus]]'', showed increasing regularity of structure, with rhyming couplets throughout.\n\nMedieval sequences are usually [[Musical mode|modal]] melodies. While primarily syllabic, sequences can occasionally have short neumatic moments, but they almost never contain [[melisma]]s. The two verses of each couplet are sung to the same musical line, usually ending on a tonally stabilizing pitch, with variety being created by couplets of different lengths and with different musical arches.  Although sequences are vocal and [[monophony|monophonic]], certain sequence texts suggest possible vocal harmonization in [[organum]] or instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe composition of sequences became less frequent when [[Humanist Latin]] replaced [[medieval Latin]] as the preferred [[literary language|literary style]] in Latin.  New sequences continued to be written in Latin; one of the best known later sequences is the [[Christmas carol]] ''[[Adeste Fideles]]'', known in English as \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\".\n\n==\u039dotes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | \nfirst=Richard | \nlast=Hoppin | \ntitle=Medieval Music | \npublisher=W.
