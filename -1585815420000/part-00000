The incumbent prime minister is [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]], who took office on 8 July 2019.\n\nThe officeholder's official seat (but not residence) is the [[Maximos Mansion]] in the centre of [[Athens]]. The office is described in the Constitution either as Prime Minister or '''President of the Government''' (\u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2). This is the reason why the prime minister is also addressed as \"Mr. President\".\n\n== Election and appointment of the Prime Minister ==\n\nThe Prime Minister is officially appointed by the [[President of Greece]].\n\nAccording to Article 37 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]], the [[President of Greece|President of the Hellenic Republic]] shall appoint the leader of the political party with the [[parliamentary majority|absolute majority]]  of seats in the [[Hellenic Parliament|parliament]] as prime minister. If no party has the [[parliamentary majority|absolute majority]], the president shall give the leader of the party with a [[Plurality (voting)|relative majority]] (plurality) an exploratory mandate in order to ascertain the possibility of forming a government enjoying the confidence of [[Hellenic Parliament|parliament]].\n\nIf this possibility cannot be ascertained, the president shall give the exploratory mandate to the leader of the second largest party in Parliament, and if this proves to be unsuccessful, to the leader of the third largest party in parliament. Each exploratory mandate shall be in force for three days.\n\nIf all exploratory mandates prove to be unsuccessful, the president summons all party leaders, and if the impossibility to form a cabinet enjoying the confidence of the parliament is confirmed, he shall attempt to form a cabinet composed of all parties in parliament for the purpose of holding parliamentary elections. If this fails, he shall entrust the president of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Supreme Administrative Court]] or of the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Supreme Civil and Criminal Court]] or of the [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Court of Auditors]] to form a cabinet as widely accepted as possible to carry out elections after he dissolves Parliament.\n\nTherefore, the election of members of a certain party to parliament is the equivalent to a vote for that party's leader for prime minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl50.html#A37|title=Constitution of Greece|work=hri.org}}</ref>\n\n== Oath of office ==\n===Religious oath of office===\nBefore taking office, the prime minister is sworn-in at a religious ceremony inside the [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|Presidential Mansion]]. Prime ministers are sworn in by the [[List of Archbishops of Athens|archbishop of Athens]] who is the head of the [[Church of Greece]]. The archbishop begins with a few prayers and the [[Kyrie Eleison]], and then the prime minister-elect places his hand on the [[Bible]] placed in between two lit candles, all on a table between him and the archbishop.

It is located in central Athens, near Syntagma Square. Although the building contains the offices of the head of the Greek Government, it is not used as the residence of the prime minister.\n\n==History of the office==\n\n===During the revolution (1821\u20131832)===\nDuring the [[Greek War of Independence]], different regions of Greece that were free of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control began establishing [[democracy|democratic]] systems for self-government, such as the Peloponnesian Senate. Meanwhile, a series of overarching [[Greek National Assembly|National Assemblies]], such as the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]], met from time-to-time to provide overall coordination. The First Assembly elected a 5-member executive council, which was headed by [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]].<ref name=\"Brewer, David 2001\">Brewer, David. ''The Greek War of Independence''. (Overlook Press, 2001).</ref>\n\nThe Executive continued to govern Greece until 1828, when [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] assumed the governance of the state as \"Governor of Greece\"\u2014simultaneously head of state and of the government.<ref name=\"Brewer, David 2001\"/> Kapodistrias was assassinated in 1831 and his government, presided over by his brother [[Augustinos Kapodistrias|Augustinos]], collapsed the following year. It was replaced by a series of collective governmental councils, which lasted until 1833, when Greece became a monarchy.\n\n===Under Otto's absolute monarchy (1832\u20131843)===\nIn 1832, Greece's nascent experiment with democracy was ended and a [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|monarchy]] was established with the underage [[Bavaria]]n Prince [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] as king. Initially the government was led by a [[regent|regency]] council made up of Bavarians. The president of this council, Count [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]] was the ''de facto'' head of government under Otto. Later Otto dismissed his Bavarian advisers and wielded power as an [[absolute monarch]], effectively as [[head of state]] and his own head of government.<ref name=\"Petropulos, John A. 1968\">Petropulos, John A., ''Politics and Statecraft in the Kingdom of Greece''.

Otto was forced to grant a [[Greek Constitution of 1844|constitution]] and [[Andreas Metaxas]] took power; he is credited with being the first Greek to formally serve as \"Prime Minister.\"<ref name=\"Clogg, Richard 1979\">Clogg, Richard.

Trikoupis was successful after the election of 1874 in forcing the king to accept the \"dedilomeni principle\" ({{lang-el|\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2}})--that the leader of the majority in parliament must be selected as prime minister by the king.<ref name=\"Clogg, Richard 1979\"/>\n\nThe Nationalists were later led by [[Theodoros Deligiannis]] who famously said \"was against everything Trikoupis was for.\"  This two-party system existed until 1910, even as [[Georgios Theotokis]] took over the New Party after the death of Trikoupis in 1895 and the assassination of Deligiannis in 1905 which led to a splintering of parties on the conservative and nationalist side.\n\n===Upheaval, revolts and war (1910\u20131946)===\nIn 1910, military officers sparked the fall of civilian government when they issued the [[Goudi Pronunciamento]]. This event led to the arrival in Greece of the [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]. His followers gathered in the [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]], which, despite Venizelos' dominant status, constituted the first true party in the modern sense, in that it was formed around a progressive, liberal and pro-[[republicanism|republican]] political agenda.\n\nThe Liberal Party was eventually opposed by the more conservative and pro-[[Monarchism|royalist]] [[People's Party (Greece)|People's Party]], initially led by [[Dimitrios Gounaris]].

The incumbent prime minister is [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]], who took office on 8 July 2019.\n\nThe officeholder's official seat (but not residence) is the [[Maximos Mansion]] in the centre of [[Athens]]. The office is described in the Constitution either as Prime Minister or '''President of the Government''' (\u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2). This is the reason why the prime minister is also addressed as \"Mr. President\".\n\n== Election and appointment of the Prime Minister ==\n\nThe prime minister is officially appointed by the [[president of Greece]].\n\nAccording to Article 37 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]], the [[President of Greece|president of the Hellenic Republic]] shall appoint the leader of the political party with the [[parliamentary majority|absolute majority]]  of seats in the [[Hellenic Parliament|parliament]] as prime minister. If no party has the [[parliamentary majority|absolute majority]], the president shall give the leader of the party with a [[Plurality (voting)|relative majority]] (plurality) an exploratory mandate in order to ascertain the possibility of forming a government enjoying the confidence of [[Hellenic Parliament|parliament]].\n\nIf this possibility cannot be ascertained, the president shall give the exploratory mandate to the leader of the second largest party in Parliament, and if this proves to be unsuccessful, to the leader of the third largest party in parliament. Each exploratory mandate shall be in force for three days.\n\nIf all exploratory mandates prove to be unsuccessful, the president summons all party leaders, and if the impossibility to form a cabinet enjoying the confidence of the parliament is confirmed, he shall attempt to form a cabinet composed of all parties in parliament for the purpose of holding parliamentary elections. If this fails, he shall entrust the president of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Supreme Administrative Court]] or of the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Supreme Civil and Criminal Court]] or of the [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Court of Auditors]] to form a cabinet as widely accepted as possible to carry out elections after he dissolves Parliament.\n\nTherefore, the election of members of a certain party to parliament is the equivalent to a vote for that party's leader for prime minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl50.html#A37|title=Constitution of Greece|work=hri.org}}</ref>\n\n== Oath of office ==\n===Religious oath of office===\nBefore taking office, the prime minister is sworn-in at a religious ceremony inside the [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|Presidential Mansion]].

We use\n\n:<math> \\vec{A} = \\frac{B}{2}(x\\hat{y} - y\\hat{x})</math>\n\nas our vector potential; this corresponds to a uniform and constant magnetic field ''B'' in the ''z'' direction. Here, the hats indicate unit vectors. Later in the article, however, they are used to distinguish quantum mechanical operators from their classical analogs. The usage should be clear from the context.\n\nExplicitly, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] amounts to just\n\n:<math>\nL = \\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2) + \\frac{qB}{2c}(x\\dot{y} - y\\dot{x}) - V(x, y) ~,\n</math>\n\nwhich leads to the equations of motion\n\n:<math>\nm\\ddot{x} = - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} + \\frac{q B}{c}\\dot{y}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\nm\\ddot{y} = - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} - \\frac{q B}{c}\\dot{x}.\n</math>\n\nFor a harmonic potential, the gradient of {{math|''V''}} amounts to just the coordinates, {{math|\u2212(''x'',''y'')}}.\n\nNow, in  the limit of a very large magnetic field, {{math|''qB''/''mc'' \u226b 1}}.  One may then  drop the kinetic term to produce a simple approximate Lagrangian,\n\n:<math>\nL = \\frac{qB}{2c}(x\\dot{y} - y\\dot{x}) - V(x, y)~,\n</math>\n\nwith first-order equations of motion\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{c}{q B}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{x} = -\\frac{c}{q B}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}~.\n</math>\n\nNote that this approximate Lagrangian is ''linear in the velocities'', which is one of the conditions under which the standard Hamiltonian procedure breaks down. While this example has been motivated as an approximation, the Lagrangian under consideration is legitimate and leads to consistent equations of motion in the Lagrangian formalism.\n\nFollowing the Hamiltonian procedure, however, the canonical momenta associated with the coordinates are now\n\n:<math>\np_x = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = -\\frac{q B}{2c}y\n</math>\n:<math>\np_y = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = \\frac{q B}{2c}x ~,\n</math>\n\nwhich are unusual in that they are not invertible to the velocities; instead, they are constrained to be functions of the coordinates: the four phase-space variables are linearly dependent, so the variable basis is [[overcompleteness|overcomplete]].\n\nA [[Legendre transformation]] then produces the Hamiltonian\n\n:<math>\nH(x,y, p_x, p_y) = \\dot{x}p_x + \\dot{y} p_y - L = V(x, y).\n</math>\n\nNote that this \"naive\" Hamiltonian has ''no dependence on the momenta'', which means that equations of motion (Hamilton's equations) are inconsistent.\n\nThe Hamiltonian procedure has broken down. One might try to fix the problem by eliminating two of the components of the {{math|4}}-dimensional phase space, say {{mvar|y}} and {{math|''p''<sub>''y''</sub>}}, down to a reduced phase space of {{math|2}} dimensions, that is  sometimes expressing the coordinates as momenta and sometimes as coordinates. However, this is neither a general nor rigorous solution. This  gets to the heart of the matter: that the definition of the canonical momenta implies a ''constraint on phase space'' (between momenta and coordinates) that was never taken into account.\n\n== Generalized Hamiltonian procedure ==\n\nIn Lagrangian mechanics, if the system has [[holonomic constraint]]s, then one generally adds [[Lagrange multipliers]] to the Lagrangian to account for them. The extra terms vanish when the constraints are satisfied, thereby forcing the path of stationary action to be on the constraint surface. In this case, going to the Hamiltonian formalism introduces a constraint on ''phase space'' in Hamiltonian mechanics, but the solution is similar.\n\nBefore proceeding, it is useful to understand the notions of '''weak equality''' and '''strong equality'''. Two functions on phase space, {{mvar|f}}  and  {{mvar|g}}, are weakly equal if they are equal ''when the constraints are satisfied, but not throughout the phase space'', denoted {{math| ''f \u2248 g''}}. If  {{mvar|f}} and  {{mvar|g}}  are equal independently of the constraints being satisfied, they are called strongly equal, written {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''g''}}. It is important to note that, in order to get the right answer, ''no weak equations may be used before evaluating derivatives or Poisson brackets''.\n\nThe new procedure works as follows, start with a Lagrangian and define the canonical momenta in the usual way. Some of those definitions may not be invertible and instead give a constraint in phase space (as above). Constraints derived in this way or imposed from the beginning of the problem are called '''primary constraints'''. The constraints, labeled {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, must weakly vanish, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''j'' </sub>(''p,q'') \u2248 0}}.\n\nNext, one finds the '''naive Hamiltonian''',  {{mvar|H}}, in the usual way via a Legendre transformation, exactly as in the above example. Note that the Hamiltonian can always be written as a function of {{math|''q''}}s and {{math|''p''}}s only, even if the velocities cannot be inverted into functions of the momenta.\n\n=== Generalizing the Hamiltonian ===\nDirac argues that we should generalize the Hamiltonian (somewhat analogously to the method of Lagrange multipliers) to\n\n:<math>\nH^* = H + \\sum_j c_j\\phi_j \\approx H,\n</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}} are not constants but functions of the coordinates and momenta. Since this new Hamiltonian is the most general function of coordinates and momenta weakly equal to the naive Hamiltonian, {{math|''H''<sup>*</sup>}} is the broadest generalization of the Hamiltonian possible\nso that {{math|''\u03b4H'' * \u2248 ''\u03b4H''}} when   {{math| ''\u03b4\u03c6<sub>j</sub>'' \u2248 0}}.\n\nTo further illuminate the  {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, consider how one gets the equations of motion from the naive Hamiltonian in the standard procedure. One expands the variation of the Hamiltonian out in two ways and sets them equal (using a somewhat abbreviated notation with suppressed indices and sums):\n\n:<math>\n\\delta H = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}\\delta q + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\\delta p\n         \\approx \\dot{q}\\delta p - \\dot{p}\\delta q  ~,\n</math>\n\nwhere the second equality holds after simplifying with the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion and the definition of canonical momentum. From this equality, one deduces the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian formalism from\n\n:<math>\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} + \\dot{p}\\right)\\delta q + \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} - \\dot{q}\\right)\\delta p = 0 ~,\n</math>\n\nwhere the weak equality symbol is no longer displayed explicitly, since by definition the equations of motion only hold weakly. In the present context, one cannot simply set the coefficients of   {{math| ''\u03b4q''}} and   {{math|''\u03b4p''}} separately to zero, since the variations are somewhat restricted by the constraints. In particular, the variations must be tangent to the constraint surface.\n\nOne can demonstrate the solution to\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_n A_n\\delta q_n + \\sum_n B_n\\delta p_n = 0,\n</math>\n\nfor the variations {{math|''\u03b4q''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and  {{math|''\u03b4p''<sub>''n''</sub>}} restricted by the constraints {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2248 0}} (assuming the constraints satisfy some [[regular function|regularity conditions]]) is generally<ref name = Henneaux>See page 8 in Henneaux and Teitelboim in the references.</ref>\n\n:<math>\nA_n = \\sum_m u_m \\frac{\\partial \\phi_m}{\\partial q_n}\n</math>\n:<math>\nB_n = \\sum_m u_m \\frac{\\partial \\phi_m}{\\partial p_n},\n</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''u''<sub>''m''</sub>}} are arbitrary functions.\n\nUsing this result, the equations of motion become\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{p}_j = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_j} - \\sum_k u_k \\frac{\\partial \\phi_k}{\\partial q_j}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{q}_j = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_j} + \\sum_k u_k \\frac{\\partial \\phi_k}{\\partial p_j}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\phi_j(q, p) = 0,\n</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''u<sub>k</sub>''}} are functions of coordinates and velocities that can be determined, in principle, from the second equation of motion above.\n\nThe Legendre transform between the Lagrangian formalism and the Hamiltonian formalism has been saved at the cost of adding new variables.\n\n=== Consistency conditions ===\n\nThe equations of motion become more compact when using the Poisson bracket, since if {{mvar|f}} is some function of the coordinates and momenta then\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{f} \\approx \\{f, H^*\\}_{PB} \\approx \\{f, H\\}_{PB} + \\sum_k u_k\\{f, \\phi_k\\}_{PB},\n</math>\n\nif one assumes that the Poisson bracket with the {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}} (functions of the velocity) exist; this causes no problems since the contribution weakly vanishes. Now, there are some consistency conditions which must be satisfied in order for this formalism to make sense. If the constraints are going to be satisfied, then their equations of motion must weakly vanish, that is, we require\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{\\phi_j} \\approx \\{\\phi_j, H\\}_{PB} + \\sum_k u_k\\{\\phi_j,\\phi_k\\}_{PB} \\approx 0.\n</math>\n\nThere are four different types of conditions that can result from the above:\n# An equation that is inherently false, such as {{math|1=1=0}} .\n# An equation that is identically true, possibly after using one of our primary constraints.\n# An equation that places new constraints on our coordinates and momenta, but is independent of the  {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}.\n# An equation that serves to specify the {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}.\n\nThe first case indicates that the starting Lagrangian gives inconsistent equations of motion, such as {{math|''L {{=}} q''}}. The second case does not contribute anything new.\n\nThe third case gives new constraints in phase space. A constraint derived in this manner is called a '''[[secondary constraint]]'''. Upon finding the secondary constraint one should add it to the extended Hamiltonian and check the new consistency conditions, which may result in still more constraints. Iterate this process until there are no more constraints. The distinction between primary and secondary constraints is largely an artificial one (i.e. a constraint for the same system can be primary or secondary depending on the Lagrangian), so this article does not distinguish between them from here on. Assuming the consistency condition has been iterated until all of the constraints have been found, then  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''j''</sub>}} will index all of them. Note this article uses secondary constraint to mean any constraint that was not initially in the problem or derived from the definition of canonical momenta; some authors distinguish between secondary constraints, tertiary constraints, et cetera.\n\nFinally, the last case helps fix the {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}.  If, at the end of this process, the {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are not completely determined, then that means there are unphysical (gauge) degrees of freedom in the system. Once all of the constraints (primary and secondary) are added to the naive Hamiltonian and the solutions to the consistency conditions for the  {{math|''u<sub>k</sub>''}} are plugged in, the result is called ''the total Hamiltonian''.\n\n=== Determination of  the  {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}===\nThe  ''u''<sub>k</sub> must solve a set of inhomogeneous linear equations of the form\n\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_j, H\\}_{PB} + \\sum_k u_k\\{\\phi_j,\\phi_k\\}_{PB} \\approx 0.\n</math>\n\nThe above equation must possess at least one solution, since otherwise the initial Lagrangian is inconsistent; however, in systems with gauge degrees of freedom, the solution will not be unique. The most general solution is of the form\n\n:<math>\nu_k = U_k + V_k,\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''U''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is a particular solution and  {{math|''V''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is the most general solution to the homogeneous equation\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_k V_k\\{\\phi_j,\\phi_k\\}_{PB}\\approx 0.\n</math>\n\nThe most general solution will be a linear combination of linearly independent solutions to the above homogeneous equation. The number of linearly independent solutions equals the number of  {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}  (which is the same as the number of constraints) minus the number of consistency conditions of the fourth type (in previous subsection). This is the number of unphysical degrees of freedom in the system. Labeling the linear independent solutions  {{math|''V''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>''a''</sup>}} where the index {{mvar|a}} runs from {{math|1}} to the number of unphysical degrees of freedom, the general solution to the consistency conditions is of the form\n\n:<math>\nu_k \\approx U_k + \\sum_a v_a V^a_k,\n</math>\n\nwhere the  {{math|''v''<sub>''a''</sub>}} are completely arbitrary functions of time. A different choice of the   {{math|''v''<sub>''a''</sub>}} corresponds to a gauge transformation, and should leave the physical state of the system unchanged.<ref>Weinberg, Steven, ''The Quantum Theory of Fields'', Volume 1. Cambridge University Press, 1995. {{isbn|0-521-55001-7}}</ref>\n\n=== The total Hamiltonian ===\nAt this point, it is natural to introduce the '''total Hamiltonian'''\n\n:<math>\nH_T = H + \\sum_k U_k\\phi_k + \\sum_{a, k} v_a V^a_k \\phi_k\n</math>\n\nand what is denoted\n:<math>\nH' = H + \\sum_k U_k \\phi_k.\n</math>\n\nThe time evolution of a function on the phase space, {{mvar|f}} is governed by\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{f} \\approx \\{f, H_T\\}_{PB}.\n</math>\n\nLater, the extended Hamiltonian is introduced. For gauge-invariant (physically measurable quantities) quantities, all of the Hamiltonians should give the same time evolution, since they are all weakly equivalent. It is only for nongauge-invariant quantities that the distinction becomes important.\n\n== The Dirac bracket ==\nAbove is everything needed to find the equations of motion in Dirac's modified Hamiltonian procedure. Having the equations of motion, however, is not the endpoint for theoretical considerations. If one wants to canonically quantize a general system, then one needs the Dirac brackets. Before defining Dirac brackets, '''first-class''' and '''second-class''' constraints need to be introduced.\n\nWe call a function {{math|''f(q, p)''}} of coordinates and momenta first class if its Poisson bracket with all of the constraints weakly vanishes, that is,\n\n:<math>\n\\{f, \\phi_j\\}_{PB} \\approx 0,\n</math>\n\nfor all {{mvar|j}}. Note that the only quantities that weakly vanish are the constraints  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, and therefore anything that weakly vanishes must be strongly equal to a linear combination of the constraints. One can demonstrate that the Poisson bracket of two first class quantities must also be first class. The first class constraints are intimately connected with the unphysical degrees of freedom mentioned earlier. Namely, the number of independent first class constraints is equal to the number of unphysical degrees of freedom, and furthermore the primary first class constraints generate gauge transformations. Dirac further postulated that all secondary first class constraints are generators of gauge transformations, which turns out to be false; however, typically one operates under the assumption that all first class constraints generate gauge transformations when using this treatment.<ref>See Henneaux and Teitelboim, pages 18-19.</ref>\n\nWhen the first-class secondary constraints are added into the Hamiltonian with arbitrary  {{math|''v''<sub>''a''</sub>}} as the first class primary constraints are added to arrive at the total Hamiltonian, then one obtains the '''extended Hamiltonian'''. The extended Hamiltonian gives the most general possible time evolution for any gauge-dependent quantities, and may actually generalize the equations of motion from those of the Lagrangian formalism.\n\nFor the purposes of introducing the Dirac bracket, of more immediate interest are the [[First class constraint#Second class constraints|second class constraints]]. Second class constraints are constraints that have nonvanishing Poisson bracket with at least one other constraint.\n\nFor instance, consider constraints   {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>}} and  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>2</sub>}} whose Poisson bracket is simply a constant, {{mvar|c}},\n\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_1,\\phi_2\\}_{PB} = c ~.\n</math>\n\nNow, suppose one wishes to employ canonical quantization, then the phase-space coordinates become operators whose commutators become  {{math|''i\u0127''}} times their classical Poisson bracket. Assuming there are no ordering issues that give rise to new quantum corrections, this implies that\n\n:<math>\n[\\hat{\\phi}_1, \\hat{\\phi}_2] = i\\hbar ~c,\n</math>\n\nwhere the hats emphasize the fact that the constraints are on operators.\n\nOn one hand, canonical quantization gives the above commutation relation, but on the other hand  {{mvar|\u03c6}}<sub>1</sub>  and {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>2</sub>}} are constraints that must vanish on physical states, whereas the right-hand side cannot vanish. This example illustrates the need for some generalization of the Poisson bracket which respects the system's constraints, and which leads to a consistent quantization procedure.  This new bracket should be bilinear, antisymmetric, satisfy the Jacobi identity as does the Poisson bracket, reduce to the Poisson bracket for unconstrained systems, and, additionally, ''the bracket of any constraint with any other quantity must vanish''.\n\nAt this point, the second class constraints will be labeled  {{math|{{overset|~|''\u03c6''}}<sub>''a''</sub>}}. Define a matrix with entries\n\n:<math>\nM_{ab} = \\{\\tilde{\\phi}_a,\\tilde{\\phi}_b\\}_{PB}.\n</math>\n\nIn this case, the Dirac bracket of two functions on phase space,  {{mvar|f}} and  {{mvar|g}}, is defined as\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math>\n\\{f, g\\}_{DB} = \\{f, g\\}_{PB} - \\sum_{a, b}\\{f,\\tilde{\\phi}_a\\}_{PB} M^{-1}_{ab}\\{\\tilde{\\phi}_b,g\\}_{PB} ~,\n</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F9FFF7}}\nwhere {{math|''M''<sup>\u22121</sup><sub>''ab''</sub>}} denotes the {{math|''ab''}} entry of {{mvar|M}} 's inverse matrix. Dirac proved that {{mvar|M}} ''will always be invertible''.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that the above definition of the Dirac bracket satisfies all of the desired properties, and especially the last one, of vanishing for an argument which is a constraint.\n\nWhen applying [[canonical quantization]] on a constrained Hamiltonian system, the commutator of the operators is supplanted by  {{math|''i\u0127''}} times their classical ''Dirac bracket''. Since the Dirac bracket respects the constraints, one need not be careful about evaluating all brackets before using any weak equations, as is the case with the Poisson bracket.\n\nNote that while the Poisson bracket of  bosonic (Grassmann even) variables with itself must vanish, the Poisson bracket of  fermions represented as a [[Grassmann number|Grassmann variables]] with itself need not vanish. This means that in the fermionic case it ''is'' possible for there to be an odd number of second class constraints.\n\n== Illustration on the example provided==\n\nReturning to the above example, the naive Hamiltonian and the two primary constraints are\n\n:<math>\nH = V(x, y)\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\phi_1 = p_x + \\tfrac{q B}{2c} y,\\qquad \\phi_2 = p_y - \\tfrac{q B}{2 c} x.\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the extended Hamiltonian can be written\n\n:<math>\nH^* = V(x, y) + u_1 \\left(p_x + \\tfrac{q B}{2c}y\\right) + u_2 \\left(p_y - \\tfrac{q B}{2c}x\\right).\n</math>\n\nThe next step is to apply the consistency conditions {{math|<nowiki>{</nowiki>''\u03a6''<sub>''j''</sub>, ''H''<sup>*</sup><nowiki>}</nowiki><sub>''PB''</sub> \u2248 0}}, which in this case become\n\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_1, H\\}_{PB}+\\sum_j u_j\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_j\\}_{PB} = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} + u_2 \\frac{q B}{c} \\approx 0\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_2, H\\}_{PB}+\\sum_j u_j\\{\\phi_2, \\phi_j\\}_{PB} = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} - u_1 \\frac{q B}{c} \\approx 0.\n</math>\n\nThese are ''not'' secondary constraints, but conditions that fix  {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}}   and  {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}}. Therefore, there are no secondary constraints and the arbitrary coefficients are completely determined, indicating that there are no unphysical degrees of freedom.\n\nIf one plugs in with the values of  {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}}   and  {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}}, then one can see that the equations of motion are\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{x} = \\{x, H\\}_{PB} + u_1\\{x, \\phi_1\\}_{PB} + u_2 \\{x, \\phi_2\\} = -\\frac{c}{q B} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{c}{q B} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{p}_x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{p}_y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y},\n</math>\n\nwhich are self-consistent and coincide with the Lagrangian equations of motion.\n\nA simple calculation confirms that  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>}} and  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>2</sub>}} are second class constraints since\n\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2\\}_{PB} = - \\{\\phi_2, \\phi_1\\}_{PB} = \\frac{q B}{c},\n</math>\n\nhence the matrix looks like\n\n:<math>\nM = \\frac{q B}{c} \n\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n 0 & 1\\\\\n-1 & 0\n\\end{matrix}\\right),\n</math>\n\nwhich is easily inverted to\n\n:<math>\nM^{-1} = \\frac{c}{q B}\n\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n 0 & -1\\\\\n 1 &  0\n\\end{matrix}\\right) \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad M^{-1}_{ab} = -\\frac{c}{q B_0} \\varepsilon_{ab},\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>''ab''</sub>}} is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. Thus, the Dirac brackets are defined to be\n\n:<math>\n\\{f, g\\}_{DB} = \\{f, g\\}_{PB} + \\frac{c\\varepsilon_{ab}}{q B}  \\{f, \\phi_a\\}_{PB}\\{\\phi_b, g\\}_{PB}.\n</math>\n\nIf one always uses the Dirac bracket instead of the Poisson bracket, then there is no issue about the order of applying constraints and evaluating expressions, since the Dirac bracket of anything weakly zero is strongly equal to zero. This means that one can just use the naive Hamiltonian with Dirac brackets, instead, to thus get the correct equations of motion, which one can easily confirm on the above ones.\n\nTo quantize the system, the Dirac brackets between all of the phase space variables are needed. The nonvanishing Dirac brackets for this system are\n\n:<math>\n\\{x, y\\}_{DB} = -\\frac{c}{q B}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\{x, p_x\\}_{DB} = \\{y, p_y\\}_{DB} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\n</math>\n\nwhile the cross-terms vanish, and\n\n:<math>\n\\{p_x, p_y\\}_{DB} = - \\frac{q B}{4c}.\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the correct implementation of [[canonical quantization]] dictates  the commutation relations,\n\n:<math>\n[\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}] = -i\\frac{\\hbar c}{q B}\n</math>\n:<math>\n[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}_x] = [\\hat{y}, \\hat{p}_y] = i\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n</math>\n\nwith the cross terms vanishing, and\n\n:<math>\n[\\hat{p}_x, \\hat{p}_y] = -i\\frac{\\hbar q B}{4c}~.\n</math>\n\nThis example has a nonvanishing commutator between  {{math|{{overset|&and;|''x''}}}} and  {{math|{{overset|&and;|''y''}}}}, which means this structure specifies a [[noncommutative geometry]]. (Since the two coordinates do not commute, there will be an [[uncertainty principle]] for the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} positions.)\n\n==Further Illustration for a hypersphere==\nSimilarly, for free motion on a hypersphere {{math|''S''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the {{math|n + 1}} coordinates are constrained, {{math|''x<sub>i</sub> x<sup>i</sup>'' {{=}} 1}}. From a plain kinetic Lagrangian, it is evident that their momenta are perpendicular to them, {{math|''x<sub>i</sub> p<sup>i</sup>'' {{=}} 0}}.

We use\n\n:<math> \\vec{A} = \\frac{B}{2}(x\\hat{y} - y\\hat{x})</math>\n\nas our vector potential; this corresponds to a uniform and constant magnetic field ''B'' in the ''z'' direction. Here, the hats indicate unit vectors. Later in the article, however, they are used to distinguish quantum mechanical operators from their classical analogs. The usage should be clear from the context.\n\nExplicitly, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] amounts to just\n\n:<math>\nL = \\frac{m}{2}(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2) + \\frac{qB}{2c}(x\\dot{y} - y\\dot{x}) - V(x, y) ~,\n</math>\n\nwhich leads to the equations of motion\n\n:<math>\nm\\ddot{x} = - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} + \\frac{q B}{c}\\dot{y}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\nm\\ddot{y} = - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} - \\frac{q B}{c}\\dot{x}.\n</math>\n\nFor a harmonic potential, the gradient of {{math|''V''}} amounts to just the coordinates, {{math|\u2212(''x'',''y'')}}.\n\nNow, in  the limit of a very large magnetic field, {{math|''qB''/''mc'' \u226b 1}}.  One may then  drop the kinetic term to produce a simple approximate Lagrangian,\n\n:<math>\nL = \\frac{qB}{2c}(x\\dot{y} - y\\dot{x}) - V(x, y)~,\n</math>\n\nwith first-order equations of motion\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{c}{q B}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{x} = -\\frac{c}{q B}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}~.\n</math>\n\nNote that this approximate Lagrangian is ''linear in the velocities'', which is one of the conditions under which the standard Hamiltonian procedure breaks down. While this example has been motivated as an approximation, the Lagrangian under consideration is legitimate and leads to consistent equations of motion in the Lagrangian formalism.\n\nFollowing the Hamiltonian procedure, however, the canonical momenta associated with the coordinates are now\n\n:<math>\np_x = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = -\\frac{q B}{2c}y\n</math>\n:<math>\np_y = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = \\frac{q B}{2c}x ~,\n</math>\n\nwhich are unusual in that they are not invertible to the velocities; instead, they are constrained to be functions of the coordinates: the four phase-space variables are linearly dependent, so the variable basis is [[overcompleteness|overcomplete]].\n\nA [[Legendre transformation]] then produces the Hamiltonian\n\n:<math>\nH(x,y, p_x, p_y) = \\dot{x}p_x + \\dot{y} p_y - L = V(x, y).\n</math>\n\nNote that this \"naive\" Hamiltonian has ''no dependence on the momenta'', which means that equations of motion (Hamilton's equations) are inconsistent.\n\nThe Hamiltonian procedure has broken down. One might try to fix the problem by eliminating two of the components of the {{math|4}}-dimensional phase space, say {{mvar|y}} and {{math|''p''<sub>''y''</sub>}}, down to a reduced phase space of {{math|2}} dimensions, that is  sometimes expressing the coordinates as momenta and sometimes as coordinates. However, this is neither a general nor rigorous solution. This  gets to the heart of the matter: that the definition of the canonical momenta implies a ''constraint on phase space'' (between momenta and coordinates) that was never taken into account.\n\n== Generalized Hamiltonian procedure ==\n\nIn Lagrangian mechanics, if the system has [[holonomic constraint]]s, then one generally adds [[Lagrange multipliers]] to the Lagrangian to account for them. The extra terms vanish when the constraints are satisfied, thereby forcing the path of stationary action to be on the constraint surface. In this case, going to the Hamiltonian formalism introduces a constraint on ''phase space'' in Hamiltonian mechanics, but the solution is similar.\n\nBefore proceeding, it is useful to understand the notions of '''weak equality''' and '''strong equality'''. Two functions on phase space, {{mvar|f}}  and  {{mvar|g}}, are weakly equal if they are equal ''when the constraints are satisfied, but not throughout the phase space'', denoted {{math| ''f \u2248 g''}}. If  {{mvar|f}} and  {{mvar|g}}  are equal independently of the constraints being satisfied, they are called strongly equal, written {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''g''}}. It is important to note that, in order to get the right answer, ''no weak equations may be used before evaluating derivatives or Poisson brackets''.\n\nThe new procedure works as follows, start with a Lagrangian and define the canonical momenta in the usual way. Some of those definitions may not be invertible and instead give a constraint in phase space (as above). Constraints derived in this way or imposed from the beginning of the problem are called '''primary constraints'''. The constraints, labeled {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, must weakly vanish, {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''j'' </sub>(''p,q'') \u2248 0}}.\n\nNext, one finds the '''naive Hamiltonian''',  {{mvar|H}}, in the usual way via a Legendre transformation, exactly as in the above example. Note that the Hamiltonian can always be written as a function of {{math|''q''}}s and {{math|''p''}}s only, even if the velocities cannot be inverted into functions of the momenta.\n\n=== Generalizing the Hamiltonian ===\nDirac argues that we should generalize the Hamiltonian (somewhat analogously to the method of Lagrange multipliers) to\n\n:<math>\nH^* = H + \\sum_j c_j\\phi_j \\approx H,\n</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}} are not constants but functions of the coordinates and momenta. Since this new Hamiltonian is the most general function of coordinates and momenta weakly equal to the naive Hamiltonian, {{math|''H''<sup>*</sup>}} is the broadest generalization of the Hamiltonian possible\nso that {{math|''\u03b4H'' * \u2248 ''\u03b4H''}} when   {{math| ''\u03b4\u03c6<sub>j</sub>'' \u2248 0}}.\n\nTo further illuminate the  {{math|''c''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, consider how one gets the equations of motion from the naive Hamiltonian in the standard procedure. One expands the variation of the Hamiltonian out in two ways and sets them equal (using a somewhat abbreviated notation with suppressed indices and sums):\n\n:<math>\n\\delta H = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q}\\delta q + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p}\\delta p\n         \\approx \\dot{q}\\delta p - \\dot{p}\\delta q  ~,\n</math>\n\nwhere the second equality holds after simplifying with the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion and the definition of canonical momentum. From this equality, one deduces the equations of motion in the Hamiltonian formalism from\n\n:<math>\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} + \\dot{p}\\right)\\delta q + \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} - \\dot{q}\\right)\\delta p = 0 ~,\n</math>\n\nwhere the weak equality symbol is no longer displayed explicitly, since by definition the equations of motion only hold weakly. In the present context, one cannot simply set the coefficients of   {{math| ''\u03b4q''}} and   {{math|''\u03b4p''}} separately to zero, since the variations are somewhat restricted by the constraints. In particular, the variations must be tangent to the constraint surface.\n\nOne can demonstrate the solution to\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_n A_n\\delta q_n + \\sum_n B_n\\delta p_n = 0,\n</math>\n\nfor the variations {{math|''\u03b4q''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and  {{math|''\u03b4p''<sub>''n''</sub>}} restricted by the constraints {{math|''\u03a6''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2248 0}} (assuming the constraints satisfy some [[regular function|regularity conditions]]) is generally<ref name = Henneaux>See page 8 in Henneaux and Teitelboim in the references.</ref>\n\n:<math>\nA_n = \\sum_m u_m \\frac{\\partial \\phi_m}{\\partial q_n}\n</math>\n:<math>\nB_n = \\sum_m u_m \\frac{\\partial \\phi_m}{\\partial p_n},\n</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''u''<sub>''m''</sub>}} are arbitrary functions.\n\nUsing this result, the equations of motion become\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{p}_j = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q_j} - \\sum_k u_k \\frac{\\partial \\phi_k}{\\partial q_j}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{q}_j = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p_j} + \\sum_k u_k \\frac{\\partial \\phi_k}{\\partial p_j}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\phi_j(q, p) = 0,\n</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''u<sub>k</sub>''}} are functions of coordinates and velocities that can be determined, in principle, from the second equation of motion above.\n\nThe Legendre transform between the Lagrangian formalism and the Hamiltonian formalism has been saved at the cost of adding new variables.\n\n=== Consistency conditions ===\n\nThe equations of motion become more compact when using the Poisson bracket, since if {{mvar|f}} is some function of the coordinates and momenta then\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{f} \\approx \\{f, H^*\\}_{PB} \\approx \\{f, H\\}_{PB} + \\sum_k u_k\\{f, \\phi_k\\}_{PB},\n</math>\n\nif one assumes that the Poisson bracket with the {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}} (functions of the velocity) exist; this causes no problems since the contribution weakly vanishes. Now, there are some consistency conditions which must be satisfied in order for this formalism to make sense. If the constraints are going to be satisfied, then their equations of motion must weakly vanish, that is, we require\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{\\phi_j} \\approx \\{\\phi_j, H\\}_{PB} + \\sum_k u_k\\{\\phi_j,\\phi_k\\}_{PB} \\approx 0.\n</math>\n\nThere are four different types of conditions that can result from the above:\n# An equation that is inherently false, such as {{math|1=1=0}} .\n# An equation that is identically true, possibly after using one of our primary constraints.\n# An equation that places new constraints on our coordinates and momenta, but is independent of the  {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}.\n# An equation that serves to specify the {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}.\n\nThe first case indicates that the starting Lagrangian gives inconsistent equations of motion, such as {{math|''L {{=}} q''}}. The second case does not contribute anything new.\n\nThe third case gives new constraints in phase space. A constraint derived in this manner is called a '''[[secondary constraint]]'''. Upon finding the secondary constraint one should add it to the extended Hamiltonian and check the new consistency conditions, which may result in still more constraints. Iterate this process until there are no more constraints. The distinction between primary and secondary constraints is largely an artificial one (i.e. a constraint for the same system can be primary or secondary depending on the Lagrangian), so this article does not distinguish between them from here on. Assuming the consistency condition has been iterated until all of the constraints have been found, then  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''j''</sub>}} will index all of them. Note this article uses secondary constraint to mean any constraint that was not initially in the problem or derived from the definition of canonical momenta; some authors distinguish between secondary constraints, tertiary constraints, et cetera.\n\nFinally, the last case helps fix the {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}.  If, at the end of this process, the {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are not completely determined, then that means there are unphysical (gauge) degrees of freedom in the system. Once all of the constraints (primary and secondary) are added to the naive Hamiltonian and the solutions to the consistency conditions for the  {{math|''u<sub>k</sub>''}} are plugged in, the result is called ''the total Hamiltonian''.\n\n=== Determination of  the  {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}===\nThe  ''u''<sub>k</sub> must solve a set of inhomogeneous linear equations of the form\n\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_j, H\\}_{PB} + \\sum_k u_k\\{\\phi_j,\\phi_k\\}_{PB} \\approx 0.\n</math>\n\nThe above equation must possess at least one solution, since otherwise the initial Lagrangian is inconsistent; however, in systems with gauge degrees of freedom, the solution will not be unique. The most general solution is of the form\n\n:<math>\nu_k = U_k + V_k,\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''U''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is a particular solution and  {{math|''V''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is the most general solution to the homogeneous equation\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_k V_k\\{\\phi_j,\\phi_k\\}_{PB}\\approx 0.\n</math>\n\nThe most general solution will be a linear combination of linearly independent solutions to the above homogeneous equation. The number of linearly independent solutions equals the number of  {{math|''u''<sub>''k''</sub>}}  (which is the same as the number of constraints) minus the number of consistency conditions of the fourth type (in previous subsection). This is the number of unphysical degrees of freedom in the system. Labeling the linear independent solutions  {{math|''V''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>''a''</sup>}} where the index {{mvar|a}} runs from {{math|1}} to the number of unphysical degrees of freedom, the general solution to the consistency conditions is of the form\n\n:<math>\nu_k \\approx U_k + \\sum_a v_a V^a_k,\n</math>\n\nwhere the  {{math|''v''<sub>''a''</sub>}} are completely arbitrary functions of time. A different choice of the   {{math|''v''<sub>''a''</sub>}} corresponds to a gauge transformation, and should leave the physical state of the system unchanged.<ref>Weinberg, Steven, ''The Quantum Theory of Fields'', Volume 1. Cambridge University Press, 1995. {{isbn|0-521-55001-7}}</ref>\n\n=== The total Hamiltonian ===\nAt this point, it is natural to introduce the '''total Hamiltonian'''\n\n:<math>\nH_T = H + \\sum_k U_k\\phi_k + \\sum_{a, k} v_a V^a_k \\phi_k\n</math>\n\nand what is denoted\n:<math>\nH' = H + \\sum_k U_k \\phi_k.\n</math>\n\nThe time evolution of a function on the phase space, {{mvar|f}} is governed by\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{f} \\approx \\{f, H_T\\}_{PB}.\n</math>\n\nLater, the extended Hamiltonian is introduced. For gauge-invariant (physically measurable quantities) quantities, all of the Hamiltonians should give the same time evolution, since they are all weakly equivalent. It is only for nongauge-invariant quantities that the distinction becomes important.\n\n== The Dirac bracket ==\nAbove is everything needed to find the equations of motion in Dirac's modified Hamiltonian procedure. Having the equations of motion, however, is not the endpoint for theoretical considerations. If one wants to canonically quantize a general system, then one needs the Dirac brackets. Before defining Dirac brackets, '''first-class''' and '''second-class''' constraints need to be introduced.\n\nWe call a function {{math|''f(q, p)''}} of coordinates and momenta first class if its Poisson bracket with all of the constraints weakly vanishes, that is,\n\n:<math>\n\\{f, \\phi_j\\}_{PB} \\approx 0,\n</math>\n\nfor all {{mvar|j}}. Note that the only quantities that weakly vanish are the constraints  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, and therefore anything that weakly vanishes must be strongly equal to a linear combination of the constraints. One can demonstrate that the Poisson bracket of two first class quantities must also be first class. The first class constraints are intimately connected with the unphysical degrees of freedom mentioned earlier. Namely, the number of independent first class constraints is equal to the number of unphysical degrees of freedom, and furthermore the primary first class constraints generate gauge transformations. Dirac further postulated that all secondary first class constraints are generators of gauge transformations, which turns out to be false; however, typically one operates under the assumption that all first class constraints generate gauge transformations when using this treatment.<ref>See Henneaux and Teitelboim, pages 18-19.</ref>\n\nWhen the first-class secondary constraints are added into the Hamiltonian with arbitrary  {{math|''v''<sub>''a''</sub>}} as the first class primary constraints are added to arrive at the total Hamiltonian, then one obtains the '''extended Hamiltonian'''. The extended Hamiltonian gives the most general possible time evolution for any gauge-dependent quantities, and may actually generalize the equations of motion from those of the Lagrangian formalism.\n\nFor the purposes of introducing the Dirac bracket, of more immediate interest are the [[First class constraint#Second class constraints|second class constraints]]. Second class constraints are constraints that have nonvanishing Poisson bracket with at least one other constraint.\n\nFor instance, consider constraints   {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>}} and  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>2</sub>}} whose Poisson bracket is simply a constant, {{mvar|c}},\n\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_1,\\phi_2\\}_{PB} = c ~.\n</math>\n\nNow, suppose one wishes to employ canonical quantization, then the phase-space coordinates become operators whose commutators become  {{math|''i\u0127''}} times their classical Poisson bracket. Assuming there are no ordering issues that give rise to new quantum corrections, this implies that\n\n:<math>\n[\\hat{\\phi}_1, \\hat{\\phi}_2] = i\\hbar ~c,\n</math>\n\nwhere the hats emphasize the fact that the constraints are on operators.\n\nOn one hand, canonical quantization gives the above commutation relation, but on the other hand  {{mvar|\u03c6}}<sub>1</sub>  and {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>2</sub>}} are constraints that must vanish on physical states, whereas the right-hand side cannot vanish. This example illustrates the need for some generalization of the Poisson bracket which respects the system's constraints, and which leads to a consistent quantization procedure.  This new bracket should be bilinear, antisymmetric, satisfy the Jacobi identity as does the Poisson bracket, reduce to the Poisson bracket for unconstrained systems, and, additionally, ''the bracket of any constraint with any other quantity must vanish''.\n\nAt this point, the second class constraints will be labeled  {{math|{{overset|~|''\u03c6''}}<sub>''a''</sub>}}. Define a matrix with entries\n\n:<math>\nM_{ab} = \\{\\tilde{\\phi}_a,\\tilde{\\phi}_b\\}_{PB}.\n</math>\n\nIn this case, the Dirac bracket of two functions on phase space,  {{mvar|f}} and  {{mvar|g}}, is defined as\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math>\n\\{f, g\\}_{DB} = \\{f, g\\}_{PB} - \\sum_{a, b}\\{f,\\tilde{\\phi}_a\\}_{PB} M^{-1}_{ab}\\{\\tilde{\\phi}_b,g\\}_{PB} ~,\n</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F9FFF7}}\nwhere {{math|''M''<sup>\u22121</sup><sub>''ab''</sub>}} denotes the {{math|''ab''}} entry of {{mvar|M}} 's inverse matrix. Dirac proved that {{mvar|M}} ''will always be invertible''.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that the above definition of the Dirac bracket satisfies all of the desired properties, and especially the last one, of vanishing for an argument which is a constraint.\n\nWhen applying [[canonical quantization]] on a constrained Hamiltonian system, the commutator of the operators is supplanted by  {{math|''i\u0127''}} times their classical ''Dirac bracket''. Since the Dirac bracket respects the constraints, one need not be careful about evaluating all brackets before using any weak equations, as is the case with the Poisson bracket.\n\nNote that while the Poisson bracket of  bosonic (Grassmann even) variables with itself must vanish, the Poisson bracket of  fermions represented as a [[Grassmann number|Grassmann variables]] with itself need not vanish. This means that in the fermionic case it ''is'' possible for there to be an odd number of second class constraints.\n\n== Illustration on the example provided==\n\nReturning to the above example, the naive Hamiltonian and the two primary constraints are\n\n:<math>\nH = V(x, y)\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\phi_1 = p_x + \\tfrac{q B}{2c} y,\\qquad \\phi_2 = p_y - \\tfrac{q B}{2 c} x.\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the extended Hamiltonian can be written\n\n:<math>\nH^* = V(x, y) + u_1 \\left(p_x + \\tfrac{q B}{2c}y\\right) + u_2 \\left(p_y - \\tfrac{q B}{2c}x\\right).\n</math>\n\nThe next step is to apply the consistency conditions {{math|<nowiki>{</nowiki>''\u03a6''<sub>''j''</sub>, ''H''<sup>*</sup><nowiki>}</nowiki><sub>''PB''</sub> \u2248 0}}, which in this case become\n\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_1, H\\}_{PB}+\\sum_j u_j\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_j\\}_{PB} = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} + u_2 \\frac{q B}{c} \\approx 0\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_2, H\\}_{PB}+\\sum_j u_j\\{\\phi_2, \\phi_j\\}_{PB} = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} - u_1 \\frac{q B}{c} \\approx 0.\n</math>\n\nThese are ''not'' secondary constraints, but conditions that fix  {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}}   and  {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}}. Therefore, there are no secondary constraints and the arbitrary coefficients are completely determined, indicating that there are no unphysical degrees of freedom.\n\nIf one plugs in with the values of  {{math|''u''<sub>1</sub>}}   and  {{math|''u''<sub>2</sub>}}, then one can see that the equations of motion are\n\n:<math>\n\\dot{x} = \\{x, H\\}_{PB} + u_1\\{x, \\phi_1\\}_{PB} + u_2 \\{x, \\phi_2\\} = -\\frac{c}{q B} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{y} = \\frac{c}{q B} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{p}_x = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\dot{p}_y = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y},\n</math>\n\nwhich are self-consistent and coincide with the Lagrangian equations of motion.\n\nA simple calculation confirms that  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>}} and  {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>2</sub>}} are second class constraints since\n\n:<math>\n\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2\\}_{PB} = - \\{\\phi_2, \\phi_1\\}_{PB} = \\frac{q B}{c},\n</math>\n\nhence the matrix looks like\n\n:<math>\nM = \\frac{q B}{c} \n\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n 0 & 1\\\\\n-1 & 0\n\\end{matrix}\\right),\n</math>\n\nwhich is easily inverted to\n\n:<math>\nM^{-1} = \\frac{c}{q B}\n\\left(\\begin{matrix}\n 0 & -1\\\\\n 1 &  0\n\\end{matrix}\\right) \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad M^{-1}_{ab} = -\\frac{c}{q B_0} \\epsilon_{ab},\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>''ab''</sub>}} is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. Thus, the Dirac brackets are defined to be\n\n:<math>\n\\{f, g\\}_{DB} = \\{f, g\\}_{PB} + \\frac{c\\epsilon_{ab}}{q B}  \\{f, \\phi_a\\}_{PB}\\{\\phi_b, g\\}_{PB}.\n</math>\n\nIf one always uses the Dirac bracket instead of the Poisson bracket, then there is no issue about the order of applying constraints and evaluating expressions, since the Dirac bracket of anything weakly zero is strongly equal to zero. This means that one can just use the naive Hamiltonian with Dirac brackets, instead, to thus get the correct equations of motion, which one can easily confirm on the above ones.\n\nTo quantize the system, the Dirac brackets between all of the phase space variables are needed. The nonvanishing Dirac brackets for this system are\n\n:<math>\n\\{x, y\\}_{DB} = -\\tfrac{c}{q B}\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\{x, p_x\\}_{DB} = \\{y, p_y\\}_{DB} = \\frac{1}{2}\n</math>\n\nwhile the cross-terms vanish, and\n\n:<math>\n\\{p_x, p_y\\}_{DB} = - \\tfrac{q B}{4c}.\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the correct implementation of [[canonical quantization]] dictates  the commutation relations,\n\n:<math>\n[\\hat{x}, \\hat{y}] = -i\\tfrac{\\hbar c}{q B}\n</math>\n:<math>\n[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}_x] = [\\hat{y}, \\hat{p}_y] = i\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n</math>\n\nwith the cross terms vanishing, and\n\n:<math>\n[\\hat{p}_x, \\hat{p}_y] = -i\\tfrac{\\hbar q B}{4c}~.\n</math>\n\nThis example has a nonvanishing commutator between  {{math|{{overset|&and;|''x''}}}} and  {{math|{{overset|&and;|''y''}}}}, which means this structure specifies a [[noncommutative geometry]]. (Since the two coordinates do not commute, there will be an [[uncertainty principle]] for the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} positions.)\n\n==Further Illustration for a hypersphere==\nSimilarly, for free motion on a hypersphere {{math|''S''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the {{math|n + 1}} coordinates are constrained, {{math|''x<sub>i</sub> x<sup>i</sup>'' {{=}} 1}}. From a plain kinetic Lagrangian, it is evident that their momenta are perpendicular to them, {{math|''x<sub>i</sub> p<sup>i</sup>'' {{=}} 0}}.  Thus the corresponding Dirac Brackets are likewise simple to work out,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Corrigan | first1 = E. | last2 = Zachos | first2 = C.

The Dirac brackets add simplicity and elegance, at the cost of excessive (constrained) phase-space variables.\n\nFor example, for free motion on a circle, {{math|1=''n'' = 1}},  for {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2261 z}} and eliminating {{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} from the circle constraint yields the unconstrained\n\n:<math>L=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac {{\\dot z}^2}{1-z^2}  ~,</math>\n\nwith equations of motion\n\n:<math>{\\ddot z} =-z  \\frac {{\\dot z}^2}{1-z^2} =-z 2E ~,</math>\n\nan oscillation;  whereas the equivalent constrained system with {{math|1=''H'' = ''p''<sup>2</sup>/2 = ''E''}} yields\n\n:<math>{\\dot x}^i  =\\{x^i,H\\}_{DB} = p^i~, </math> \n:<math>{\\dot p}^i   =\\{p^i,H\\}_{DB} = x^i ~  p^2~, </math>\n\nwhence, instantly, virtually by inspection, oscillation for both variables,\n\n:<math>{\\ddot x}^i = - x^i 2E ~. </math>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Canonical quantization]]\n* [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]\n* [[Poisson bracket]]\n* [[First class constraint]]\n* [[Second class constraints]]\n* [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]\n* [[Symplectic structure]]\n* [[Overcompleteness]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dirac Bracket}}\n[[Category:Mathematical quantization]]\n[[Category:Symplectic geometry]]\n[[Category:Hamiltonian mechanics]]\n[[Category:Theoretical physics]]\n", "name_user": "Cstarkjp", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made Levi-Civita symbol consistent.
