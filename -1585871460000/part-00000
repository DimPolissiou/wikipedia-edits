The first part of this process is the creation and conjugation of a specific drug into or onto a nanoparticle or other colloidal particle.<ref name=\":4\" /> Next, the nanoparticle is loaded into the hydrogel matrix of the contact lens.<ref name=\":4\" /> In this case, before the drug can diffuse out of the hydrogel matrix to reach the cornea, it must also diffuse or be released out of the nanoparticle.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Physical and chemical challenges of loading  ==\nIt is important to recognize the positives and negatives associated with each type of drug loading for using contact lenses as drug delivery devices. In order to seriously address the possibility of clinical translation of these devices, it is important to recognize the physical and chemical barriers. By understanding this better, the mechanism of drug loading and the controlled and sustained release of drugs to a patients eye can be optimized. \n\n=== Lens transparency ===\nSince contact lenses are used on a part of the body that is important for normal daily functioning (sight) it is integral that scientists take into account the transparency of the lens.<ref name=\":4\" /> As larger and more drugs/objects are loaded to a contact lens it begins to physically crowd the space available, making it more difficult for light to penetrate and reach the eye. \n Fundamental Concept Understanding: A simple analogy to this is a crowded versus an uncrowded area while it is raining outside. When individuals are packed tightly the rain falls and lands on people, making its way to the ground slowly but surely in a scattered way. In an uncrowded area, the rain can fall and land on the ground easily and without interference from the people. In this analogy, the rain is analogous to light and the people are analogous to drugs being loaded in a contact lens. The more drugs added to the contact lens, the less light that can penetrate without being randomly scattered. Random scattering of the light can result in unclear and unfocused sight. \nResearchers have noted that by using the nanoparticle loading technique, the transparency decreases by nearly 10%.<ref name=\":4\" /> Conversely, researchers have confirmed that by using the molecular imprinting and supercritical soaking methods of drug loading, the lens transparency of the contact lenses has stayed at or above the lens transparency of the contact lenses currently approved by the FDA.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Oxygen permeability ===\nThe oxygen permeability is another important feature of all contact lenses and much be optimized to the largest degree possible when creating drug delivery devices for the eye. The contact lens adheres to the external cornea of the eye which is made up of a layer of cells.<ref name=\":12\" /> Cells, being the basic component of living organisms, require sustained and constant access to oxygen in order to survive. The cornea of the eye is not supplied blood as most other cells in the body, making this a challenging part of the body to deliver drugs to.<ref name=\":12\" /> Decreasing oxygenation to the eye can result in undesirable side effects.<ref name=\":4\" /> Researchers in this field have noted that different types of contact lenses have varying degrees of oxygen permeability. For example, it has been shown that SCLs have limited oxygen permeability while silicon-based contact lenses have much better oxygen permeability.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> Silicon-base contact lenses have also been shown to have some other very important physical parameters.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> \n\nResearchers have attempted to make the thickness of the contact lenses in order to increase the drug loading capacity of the contact lens.<ref name=\":11\" /> However, for silicon-based lenses this parameter is inversely proportion to oxygen permeability (i.e. as thickness of the contact lens increases the oxygen permeability decreases).<ref name=\":11\" /> Moreover, it has been shown that as water content increases in silicon-based lenses, the oxygen permeability decreases, another relationship that is inversely proportional.<ref name=\":11\" /> Surprisingly, as SCLs increase with water content the oxygen permeability also increases (a directly proportional relationship).<ref name=\":11\" /> \n\nIn regards to whether silicon-based lenses or SCLs is a better candidate for a drug delivery device for ophthalmic delivery is a question that remains unanswered and is not uniformly agreed upon in the scientific community. For example, Ciolino et al. claim that silicon-based contact lenses are better candidates for patients that are long-term contact lens wearer.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Conversely, Kim et al. suggest that SCLs are better candidates because they show the possibility to be able to overcome the difficult of oxygen permeability as well as mechanical integrity of the lens.<ref name=\":6\" /> Kim et al. have shown that the mechanical strength can be increased for SCLs by incorporating a nanodiamond (ND) infrastructure into contact lens matrix.<ref name=\":6\" /> \n\nAdditionally, many researchers have investigated the implications of loading vitamin E into the contact lens matrix of SCLs.<ref name=\":5\" /> Although vitamin E incorporation into the matrix has been shown to slow the release of drugs into the eye and onto cornea (a desirable trait of a ophthalmic delivery system), it has also been shown to decrease oxygen permeability.<ref name=\":5\" /> Oxygen permeability continues to be an extremely important factor in the development of these devices and is one of the main reason that much research is beginning to focus on this area of drug delivery.\n\n=== Water content ===\nThe amount of water content that a particular contact lens can retain is another extremely important factor that must be taken into account when these devices are designed. Research in this specific area of design suggest that contact lens wearers find it more comfortable to wear lenses that retain water more than those that deter water.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> For SCLs, as the water content of a lens increases so does the oxygen permeability.<ref name=\":11\" /> Conversely, as the water content increases in silicon-based contact lenses, the oxygen permeability decreases.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> In reference to SCLs, higher water content in contact lenses allows for easier loading using the supercritical soaking method.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":14\" /> This could be due to the water acting as a lubricant to some drugs and allowing the drug to be more easily facilitated into the matrix. This would essentially allow for more drug to be loaded into contact lenses of this type.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> This increase in drug loading capacity is an important advancement and would allow for patients wince it may allow for a longer period of drug release time and would hopefully be more sustained.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nFurthermore, Guzman-Aranguez et al. has shown that when using the molecular imprinting method for loading drugs such as ketotifen and norfloxacin into the contact lens, the water content is not largely impacted.<ref name=\":4\" /> Additionally, it has been predicted by Peng et al. by using Fickian release kinetic models that although water content changes once contact lenses are inserted onto the cornea of the eye, this will not pose significant challenges when it comes to the release of rugs from SCLs.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n=== Drug release kinetics ===\n<br />\n=== Systemic side effects ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Index: Scientific Terms in Context of Ocular Drug Delivery\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n|pH responsive system\n|the ability for a biological system to undergo changes that promote activity, inactivity, release of compound(s), or degradation as a result of changes made in the pH of the microenvironment of a certain system\n|-\n|nasolacrimal drainage\n|drainage of particles/fluids into the body via the tear (nasolacrimal) duct\n|-\n|systemic\n|of or relating to the entire body\n|-\n|[[Timolol]]\n|[[File:Timolol.png|left|200x200px]]\n|-\n|[[Norfloxacin]]\n|[[File:Norfloxacin structure.svg|left|200x200px]]\n|-\n|[[Ketotifen]]\n|[[File:Ketotifen structure.svg|left|292x292px]]\n|-\n|[[Polyvinylpyrrolidone]]\n|[[File:Poliwinylopirolidon.svg|left|200x200px]]\n|-\n|[[Hyaluronic acid]]\n|[[File:Hyaluronic acid.svg|left|200x200px]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\n<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mikkelson TJ, Chrai SS, Robinson JR | title = Altered bioavailability of drugs in the eye due to drug-protein interaction | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 1648\u201353 | date = October 1973 | pmid = 4752109 | doi = 10.1002/jps.2600621014 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lloyd AW, Faragher RG, Denyer SP | title = Ocular biomaterials and implants | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 769\u201385 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11246945 | doi = 10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00237-4 }}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cope JR, Collier SA, Nethercut H, Jones JM, Yates K, Yoder JS | title = Risk Behaviors for Contact Lens-Related Eye Infections Among Adults and Adolescents - United States, 2016 | journal = MMWR.

By understanding this better, the mechanism of drug loading and the controlled and sustained release of drugs to a patients eye can be optimized. \n\n=== Lens transparency ===\nSince contact lenses are used on a part of the body that is important for normal daily functioning (sight) it is integral that scientists take into account the transparency of the lens.<ref name=\":4\" /> As larger and more drugs/objects are loaded to a contact lens it begins to physically crowd the space available, making it more difficult for light to penetrate and reach the eye. \n Fundamental Concept Understanding: A simple analogy to this is a crowded versus an uncrowded area while it is raining outside. When individuals are packed tightly the rain falls and lands on people, making its way to the ground slowly but surely in a scattered way. In an uncrowded area, the rain can fall and land on the ground easily and without interference from the people. In this analogy, the rain is analogous to light and the people are analogous to drugs being loaded in a contact lens. The more drugs added to the contact lens, the less light that can penetrate without being randomly scattered. Random scattering of the light can result in unclear and unfocused sight. \nResearchers have noted that by using the nanoparticle loading technique, the transparency decreases by nearly 10%.<ref name=\":4\" /> Conversely, researchers have confirmed that by using the molecular imprinting and supercritical soaking methods of drug loading, the lens transparency of the contact lenses has stayed at or above the lens transparency of the contact lenses currently approved by the FDA.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Oxygen permeability ===\nThe oxygen permeability is another important feature of all contact lenses and much be optimized to the largest degree possible when creating drug delivery devices for the eye. The contact lens adheres to the external cornea of the eye which is made up of a layer of cells.<ref name=\":12\" /> Cells, being the basic component of living organisms, require sustained and constant access to oxygen in order to survive. The cornea of the eye is not supplied blood as most other cells in the body, making this a challenging part of the body to deliver drugs to.<ref name=\":12\" /> Decreasing oxygenation to the eye can result in undesirable side effects.<ref name=\":4\" /> Researchers in this field have noted that different types of contact lenses have varying degrees of oxygen permeability. For example, it has been shown that SCLs have limited oxygen permeability while silicon-based contact lenses have much better oxygen permeability.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> Silicon-base contact lenses have also been shown to have some other very important physical parameters.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> \n\nResearchers have attempted to make the thickness of the contact lenses in order to increase the drug loading capacity of the contact lens.<ref name=\":11\" /> However, for silicon-based lenses this parameter is inversely proportion to oxygen permeability (i.e. as thickness of the contact lens increases the oxygen permeability decreases).<ref name=\":11\" /> Moreover, it has been shown that as water content increases in silicon-based lenses, the oxygen permeability decreases, another relationship that is inversely proportional.<ref name=\":11\" /> Surprisingly, as SCLs increase with water content the oxygen permeability also increases (a directly proportional relationship).<ref name=\":11\" /> \n\nIn regards to whether silicon-based lenses or SCLs is a better candidate for a drug delivery device for ophthalmic delivery is a question that remains unanswered and is not uniformly agreed upon in the scientific community. For example, Ciolino et al. claim that silicon-based contact lenses are better candidates for patients that are long-term contact lens wearer.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Conversely, Kim et al. suggest that SCLs are better candidates because they show the possibility to be able to overcome the difficult of oxygen permeability as well as mechanical integrity of the lens.<ref name=\":6\" /> Kim et al. have shown that the mechanical strength can be increased for SCLs by incorporating a nanodiamond (ND) infrastructure into contact lens matrix.<ref name=\":6\" /> \n\nAdditionally, many researchers have investigated the implications of loading vitamin E into the contact lens matrix of SCLs.<ref name=\":5\" /> Although vitamin E incorporation into the matrix has been shown to slow the release of drugs into the eye and onto cornea (a desirable trait of a ophthalmic delivery system), it has also been shown to decrease oxygen permeability.<ref name=\":5\" /> Oxygen permeability continues to be an extremely important factor in the development of these devices and is one of the main reason that much research is beginning to focus on this area of drug delivery.\n\n=== Water content ===\nThe amount of water content that a particular contact lens can retain is another extremely important factor that must be taken into account when these devices are designed. Research in this specific area of design suggest that contact lens wearers find it more comfortable to wear lenses that retain water more than those that deter water.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> For SCLs, as the water content of a lens increases so does the oxygen permeability.<ref name=\":11\" /> Conversely, as the water content increases in silicon-based contact lenses, the oxygen permeability decreases.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> In reference to SCLs, higher water content in contact lenses allows for easier loading using the supercritical soaking method.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":14\" /> This could be due to the water acting as a lubricant to some drugs and allowing the drug to be more easily facilitated into the matrix. This would essentially allow for more drug to be loaded into contact lenses of this type.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> This increase in drug loading capacity is an important advancement and would allow for patients wince it may allow for a longer period of drug release time and would hopefully be more sustained.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nFurthermore, Guzman-Aranguez et al. has shown that when using the molecular imprinting method for loading drugs such as ketotifen and norfloxacin into the contact lens, the water content is not largely impacted.<ref name=\":4\" /> Additionally, it has been predicted by Peng et al. by using Fickian release kinetic models that although water content changes once contact lenses are inserted onto the cornea of the eye, this will not pose significant challenges when it comes to the release of rugs from SCLs.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n=== Drug release kinetics ===\n\n=== Systemic side effects ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Index: Scientific Terms in Context of Ocular Drug Delivery\n!Term\n!Definition\n|-\n|pH responsive system\n|the ability for a biological system to undergo changes that promote activity, inactivity, release of compound(s), or degradation as a result of changes made in the pH of the microenvironment of a certain system\n|-\n|nasolacrimal drainage\n|drainage of particles/fluids into the body via the tear (nasolacrimal) duct\n|-\n|systemic\n|of or relating to the entire body\n|-\n|[[Timolol]]\n|[[File:Timolol.png|left|200x200px]]\n|-\n|[[Norfloxacin]]\n|[[File:Norfloxacin structure.svg|left|200x200px]]\n|-\n|[[Ketotifen]]\n|[[File:Ketotifen structure.svg|left|292x292px]]\n|-\n|[[Polyvinylpyrrolidone]]\n|[[File:Poliwinylopirolidon.svg|left|200x200px]]\n|-\n|[[Hyaluronic acid]]\n|[[File:Hyaluronic acid.svg|left|200x200px]]\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\n<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mikkelson TJ, Chrai SS, Robinson JR | title = Altered bioavailability of drugs in the eye due to drug-protein interaction | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 62 | issue = 10 | pages = 1648\u201353 | date = October 1973 | pmid = 4752109 | doi = 10.1002/jps.2600621014 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lloyd AW, Faragher RG, Denyer SP | title = Ocular biomaterials and implants | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 769\u201385 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11246945 | doi = 10.1016/S0142-9612(00)00237-4 }}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cope JR, Collier SA, Nethercut H, Jones JM, Yates K, Yoder JS | title = Risk Behaviors for Contact Lens-Related Eye Infections Among Adults and Adolescents - United States, 2016 | journal = MMWR.

His short stories often follow a [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]ian pattern. The characters in Trevor's work are typically marginalised members of society: children, the elderly, single middle-aged men and women, or the unhappily married. Those who cannot accept the reality of their lives create their own alternative worlds into which they retreat. A number of the stories use [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] elements to explore the nature of evil and its connection to madness. Trevor acknowledged the influence of [[James Joyce]] on his short-story writing, and \"the odour of ashpits and old weeds and offal\" can be detected in his work,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} but the overall impression is not of gloominess, since, particularly in his early work, the author's wry humour offers the reader a tragicomic version of the world. He  adapted much of his work for stage, television and radio. In 1990, ''[[Fools of Fortune]]'' was made into a film directed by [[Pat O'Connor (director)|Pat O'Connor]], along with a 1999 film adaptation of ''[[Felicia's Journey]]'', which was directed by [[Atom Egoyan]].\n\nTrevor's stories are set in both England and Ireland; they range from black comedies to tales based on Irish history and politics. Common themes in his works are the tensions between [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] (usually [[Church of Ireland]]) landowners and [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] tenants. His early books are peopled by eccentrics who speak in a pedantically formal manner and engage in hilariously comic activities that are recounted by a detached narrative voice. Instead of one central figure, the novels feature several protagonists of equal importance, drawn together by an institutional setting, which acts as a convergence point for their individual stories. The later novels are thematically and technically more complex. The operation of grace in the world is explored, and several narrative voices are used to view the same events from different angles. [[Unreliable narrator]]s and different perspectives reflect the fragmentation and uncertainty of modern life. Trevor also explored the decaying institution of the \"Big House\" in his novels ''Fools of Fortune'' and ''[[The Story of Lucy Gault]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\n==Awards and honours==\nTrevor was a member of the [[Irish Academy of Letters]] and [[Aosd\u00e1na]].

His short stories often follow a [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]ian pattern. The characters in Trevor's work are typically marginalised members of society: children, the elderly, single middle-aged men and women, or the unhappily married. Those who cannot accept the reality of their lives create their own alternative worlds into which they retreat. A number of the stories use [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] elements to explore the nature of evil and its connection to madness. Trevor acknowledged the influence of [[James Joyce]] on his short-story writing, and \"the odour of ashpits and old weeds and offal\" can be detected in his work,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} but the overall impression is not of gloominess, since, particularly in his early work, the author's wry humour offers the reader a tragicomic version of the world. He  adapted much of his work for stage, television and radio. In 1990, ''[[Fools of Fortune]]'' was made into a film directed by [[Pat O'Connor (director)|Pat O'Connor]], along with a 1999 film adaptation of ''[[Felicia's Journey]]'', which was directed by [[Atom Egoyan]].\n\nTrevor's stories are set in both England and Ireland; they range from black comedies to tales based on Irish history and politics. Common themes in his works are the tensions between [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] (usually [[Church of Ireland]]) landowners and [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] tenants. His early books are peopled by eccentrics who speak in a pedantically formal manner and engage in hilariously comic activities that are recounted by a detached narrative voice. Instead of one central figure, the novels feature several protagonists of equal importance, drawn together by an institutional setting, which acts as a convergence point for their individual stories. The later novels are thematically and technically more complex. The operation of grace in the world is explored, and several narrative voices are used to view the same events from different angles. [[Unreliable narrator]]s and different perspectives reflect the fragmentation and uncertainty of modern life.

He was educated at the Model School, Inchicore, where classes were taught in [[Irish Gaelic]], and at the [[O'Connell School]]s in North Richmond Street, Dublin. His father and grandfather both worked in [[Guinness]]'s Brewery.<ref>Fitzsimons, ''The Sea of Disappointment'', p. 156.</ref> He entered [[University College Dublin]] in 1946, initially to study science. After a few terms in college, he took a post in the [[Irish civil service]] in the Department of Finance and continued his university studies at night, having switched to humanities and arts.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/kinsellas-wife-reveals-her-hurt-at-the-poets-words-of-love-26522803.html Byrne, Andrea. \"Kinsella's wife reveals her hurt at the poet's words of love\", Independent.ie, 22 March 2009]</ref>\n\nKinsella's first poems were published in the University College Dublin magazine ''National Student''. His first pamphlet, '' The Starlit Eye'' (1952), was published by Liam Miller's [[Dolmen Press]], as was ''Poems'' (1956), his first book-length publication. These were followed by ''Another September'' (1958), ''Moralities'' (1960), ''Downstream'' (1962), ''Wormwood'' (1966), and the long poem ''Nightwalker'' (1967).\n\nMarked as it was by the influence of [[W. H. Auden]] and dealing with a primarily urban landscape and with questions of romantic love, Kinsella's early work marked him as distinct from the mainstream of Irish poetry in the 1950s and 1960s, which tended to be dominated by the example of [[Patrick Kavanagh]].\n\nHe received the Honorary Freedom of the City of Dublin in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dublincity.ie/image/libraries/foc076-thomas-kinsella| title=Dublin Artists receive Honorary Freedom | accessdate=2008-01-27 | format= | work= }}</ref>\n\nHe taught the Irish Tradition Programme at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nThe composer and member of [[Aosd\u00e1na]], [[John Kinsella (composer)|John Kinsella]] (born 1932), is his brother.\n\nIn December 2018, he was awarded Doctor in Littoris, Honoris Causa, by the University of Dublin ([[Trinity College Dublin]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/registrar/honorary-degrees/2018-19/|title=Registrar : Trinity College Dublin, the University of Dublin, Ireland|website=www.tcd.ie|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n\n==Translations and editing==\nAt Miller's suggestion, Kinsella turned his attention to the translation of early Irish texts. He produced versions of ''Longes Mac Unsnig'' and ''The Breastplate of St Patrick'' in 1954 and of ''Thirty-Three Triads'' in 1955. His most significant work in this area was collected in two important volumes. The first of these was '' The T\u00e1in'', (Dolmen 1969 and Oxford 1970), a version of the ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]'' illustrated by [[Louis le Brocquy]].\n\nThe second major work of translation was an anthology of Irish poetry ''An Duanaire: 1600-1900, Poems of the Dispossessed'' (1981), translated by Kinsella and edited by [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Tuama]]. He also edited [[Austin Clarke (poet)|Austin Clarke]]'s ''Selected Poems'' and ''Collected Poems'' (both 1974) for Dolmen and ''The New Oxford Book of Irish Verse'' (1986).\n\n==Later poetry==\n\nIn 1965, Kinsella left the civil service to become writer in residence at [[Southern Illinois University]], and in 1970 he became a professor of English at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]]. While at Temple, he developed a program for students to study in Ireland called \"the Irish Experience\".\n\nIn 1972, he started [[Peppercanister Press]] to publish his own work. The first Peppercanister production was ''Butcher's Dozen'', a satirical response to the [[Widgery Tribunal]] into the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]. This poem drew on the ''[[aisling]]'' tradition and specifically on [[Brian Merriman]]'s ''C\u00fairt An Mhe\u00e1n \u00d3iche''. Kinsella's interest in the publishing process dates back at least as far as helping set the type for '' The Starlit Eye'' 20 years earlier.\n\nIn the Peppercanister poems, Kinsella's work ceased to be Audenesque and became more clearly influenced by American modernism, particularly the poetry of [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Robert Lowell]]. In addition, the poetry started to focus more on the individual psyche as seen through the work of [[Carl Jung]]. These tendencies first appeared in the poems of '' Notes from the Land of the Dead'' (1973) and ''One'' (1974).\n\nIn the 1980s, books such as ''Her Vertical Smile'' (1985) ''Out of Ireland'' (1987) and ''St Catherine's Clock'' (1987) marked a move away from the personal to the historical. This continued into a sometimes darkly satirical focus on a contemporary landscape through the late 1980s and 1990s in such books as ''One Fond Embrace'' (1988), ''Personal Places'' (1990), ''Poems From Centre City'' (1990) and ''The Pen Shop'' (1996). His ''Collected Poems'' appeared in 1996 and again in an updated edition in 2001.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Poetry collections===\n* ''Poems 1956-1973'' (Dublin, The Dolmen Press, 1980);\n* ''Another September'' (Dolmen, 1958);\n* ''Poems & Translations'' (New York: Atheneum, 1961);\n* ''Downstream'' (Dolmen, 1962);\n* ''The Clergyman'' (Dublin: St Sepulchre's Press, 1965);\n* ''Tear'' (Cambridge, MA: Pym-Randall Press, 1969);\n* ''Nightwalker and Other Poems'' (Dolmen, Oxford, New York, Oxford University Press, 1968; New York, Knopf, 1969);\n* ''Ely Place'' (Dublin: Tara Telephone Publications/St. Sepulchre's Press, 1972);\n* ''The Good Fight'' (Peppercanister 1973);\n* ''Notes from the Land of the Dead and Other Poems'' (Knopf, 1973);\n* ''Fifteen Dead'' (Peppercanister, 1979);\n* ''One and Other Poems'' (Dolmen, Oxford University Press, 1979);\n* ''Peppercanister Poems'' 1972-1978 (Dolmen 1979; Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Wake Forest University Press, 1979);\n* ''One Fond Embrace'' (Deerfield, MA: Deerfield Press, 1981);\n* ''St Catherine's Clock'' (Oxford University Press, 1987);\n* ''Blood & Family'' (New York: Oxford Univ.

He was educated at the Model School, Inchicore, where classes were taught in [[Irish Gaelic]], and at the [[O'Connell School]]s in North Richmond Street, Dublin. His father and grandfather both worked in [[Guinness]]'s Brewery.<ref>Fitzsimons, ''The Sea of Disappointment'', p. 156.</ref> He entered [[University College Dublin]] in 1946, initially to study science. After a few terms in college, he took a post in the [[Irish civil service]] in the Department of Finance and continued his university studies at night, having switched to humanities and arts.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/kinsellas-wife-reveals-her-hurt-at-the-poets-words-of-love-26522803.html Byrne, Andrea. \"Kinsella's wife reveals her hurt at the poet's words of love\", Independent.ie, 22 March 2009]</ref>\n\nKinsella's first poems were published in the University College Dublin magazine ''National Student''. His first pamphlet, '' The Starlit Eye'' (1952), was published by Liam Miller's [[Dolmen Press]], as was ''Poems'' (1956), his first book-length publication. These were followed by ''Another September'' (1958), ''Moralities'' (1960), ''Downstream'' (1962), ''Wormwood'' (1966), and the long poem ''Nightwalker'' (1967).\n\nMarked as it was by the influence of [[W. H. Auden]] and dealing with a primarily urban landscape and with questions of romantic love, Kinsella's early work marked him as distinct from the mainstream of Irish poetry in the 1950s and 1960s, which tended to be dominated by the example of [[Patrick Kavanagh]].\n\nHe received the Honorary Freedom of the City of Dublin in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dublincity.ie/image/libraries/foc076-thomas-kinsella| title=Dublin Artists receive Honorary Freedom | accessdate=2008-01-27 | format= | work= }}</ref>\n\nHe taught the Irish Tradition Programme at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nThe composer and member of [[Aosd\u00e1na]], [[John Kinsella (composer)|John Kinsella]] (born 1932), is his brother.\n\nIn December 2018, he was awarded Doctor in Littoris, Honoris Causa, by the University of Dublin ([[Trinity College Dublin]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/registrar/honorary-degrees/2018-19/|title=Registrar : Trinity College Dublin, the University of Dublin, Ireland|website=www.tcd.ie|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n\n==Translations and editing==\nAt Miller's suggestion, Kinsella turned his attention to the translation of early Irish texts. He produced versions of ''Longes Mac Unsnig'' and ''The Breastplate of St Patrick'' in 1954 and of ''Thirty-Three Triads'' in 1955. His most significant work in this area was collected in two important volumes. The first of these was '' The T\u00e1in'', (Dolmen 1969 and Oxford 1970), a version of the ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]'' illustrated by [[Louis le Brocquy]].\n\nThe second major work of translation was an anthology of Irish poetry ''An Duanaire: 1600-1900, Poems of the Dispossessed'' (1981), translated by Kinsella and edited by [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Tuama]]. He also edited [[Austin Clarke (poet)|Austin Clarke]]'s ''Selected Poems'' and ''Collected Poems'' (both 1974) for Dolmen and ''The New Oxford Book of Irish Verse'' (1986).\n\n==Later poetry==\n\nIn 1965, Kinsella left the civil service to become writer in residence at [[Southern Illinois University]], and in 1970 he became a professor of English at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]]. While at Temple, he developed a program for students to study in Ireland called \"the Irish Experience\".\n\nIn 1972, he started [[Peppercanister Press]] to publish his own work. The first Peppercanister production was ''Butcher's Dozen'', a satirical response to the [[Widgery Tribunal]] into the events of [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]. This poem drew on the ''[[aisling]]'' tradition and specifically on [[Brian Merriman]]'s ''C\u00fairt An Mhe\u00e1n \u00d3iche''. Kinsella's interest in the publishing process dates back at least as far as helping set the type for '' The Starlit Eye'' 20 years earlier.\n\nIn the Peppercanister poems, Kinsella's work ceased to be Audenesque and became more clearly influenced by American modernism, particularly the poetry of [[Ezra Pound]], [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Robert Lowell]]. In addition, the poetry started to focus more on the individual psyche as seen through the work of [[Carl Jung]]. These tendencies first appeared in the poems of '' Notes from the Land of the Dead'' (1973) and ''One'' (1974).\n\nIn the 1980s, books such as ''Her Vertical Smile'' (1985) ''Out of Ireland'' (1987) and ''St Catherine's Clock'' (1987) marked a move away from the personal to the historical. This continued into a sometimes darkly satirical focus on a contemporary landscape through the late 1980s and 1990s in such books as ''One Fond Embrace'' (1988), ''Personal Places'' (1990), ''Poems From Centre City'' (1990) and ''The Pen Shop'' (1996). His ''Collected Poems'' appeared in 1996 and again in an updated edition in 2001.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Poetry collections===\n* ''Poems 1956-1973'' (Dublin, The Dolmen Press, 1980);\n* ''Another September'' (Dolmen, 1958);\n* ''Poems & Translations'' (New York: Atheneum, 1961);\n* ''Downstream'' (Dolmen, 1962);\n* ''The Clergyman'' (Dublin: St Sepulchre's Press, 1965);\n* ''Tear'' (Cambridge, MA: Pym-Randall Press, 1969);\n* ''Nightwalker and Other Poems'' (Dolmen, Oxford, New York, Oxford University Press, 1968; New York, Knopf, 1969);\n* ''Ely Place'' (Dublin: Tara Telephone Publications/St. Sepulchre's Press, 1972);\n* ''The Good Fight'' (Peppercanister 1973);\n* ''Notes from the Land of the Dead and Other Poems'' (Knopf, 1973);\n* ''Fifteen Dead'' (Peppercanister, 1979);\n* ''One and Other Poems'' (Dolmen, Oxford University Press, 1979);\n* ''Peppercanister Poems'' 1972-1978 (Dolmen 1979; Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Wake Forest University Press, 1979);\n* ''One Fond Embrace'' (Deerfield, MA: Deerfield Press, 1981);\n* ''St Catherine's Clock'' (Oxford University Press, 1987);\n* ''Blood & Family'' (New York: Oxford Univ.

Themes range from domestic and personal concerns to larger questions of Irish history.\n\n===Novels for adults===\n\nDoyle's first three novels, ''[[The Commitments (novel)|The Commitments]]'' (1987), ''[[The Snapper (novel)|The Snapper]]'' (1990) and  ''[[The Van (novel)|The Van]]'' (1991) comprise [[The Barrytown Trilogy]], a trilogy centred on the Rabbitte family. All three novels were made into successful films.\n\n''The Commitments'' is about a group of Dublin teenagers, led by Jimmy Rabbitte Jr., who decide to form a soul band in the tradition of [[Wilson Pickett]]. The novel was made into a [[The Commitments (film)|film]] in 1991. ''[[The Snapper (novel)|The Snapper]]'', made into a [[The Snapper (film)|film]] in 1993, focuses on Jimmy's sister, Sharon, who becomes pregnant. She is determined to have the child but refuses to reveal the father's identity to her family. In ''[[The Van (novel)|The Van]]'', which was shortlisted for the 1991 [[Booker Prize]] and made into a [[The Van (1996 film)|film]] in 1996, Jimmy Sr. is laid off, as is his friend Bimbo; the two buy a used [[fish and chips]] van and they go into business for themselves.\n\nIn 1993, Doyle published ''[[Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha]]'', winner of the 1993 [[Man Booker Prize]], which showed the world as described, understood and misunderstood by a ten-year-old Dubliner living in 1968.\n\nDoyle's next novel dealt with darker themes. ''[[The Woman Who Walked into Doors]]'', published in 1996, is the story of a battered wife, narrated by the victim Paula Spencer; despite her husband's increasingly violent behaviour, she defends him, using the classic excuse \"I walked into a door\" to explain her bruises. Ten years later, the protagonist returned in ''[[Paula Spencer (novel)|Paula Spencer]]'', published in 2006.\n\nDoyle's most recent trilogy of adult novels is ''[[The Last Roundup (novel)|The Last Roundup]]'' series, which follows the adventures of protagonist Henry Smart through several decades. ''[[A Star Called Henry]]'' (published 1999) is the first book in the series, and tells the story of Henry Smart, an IRA volunteer and 1916 Easter Rebellion fighter, from his birth in Dublin to his adulthood when he becomes a father. ''[[Oh, Play That Thing!]]'' (2004) continues Henry's story in 1924 America, beginning in the Lower East Side of New York City, where he catches the attention of local mobsters by hiring kids to carry his sandwich boards. He also goes to Chicago where he becomes a business partner with [[Louis Armstrong]]. The title is taken from a phrase that is shouted in one of Armstrong's songs, \"Dippermouth Blues\".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In the final novel in the trilogy, ''[[The Dead Republic]]'' (published 2010), Henry collaborates on writing the script for a Hollywood film. He returns to Ireland and is offered work as the caretaker in a school, when circumstances lead to him re-establishing his link with the IRA.\n\nDoyle frequently posts short comic dialogues on his [[Facebook]] page which are implied to be between two older men in a pub, often relating to current events in Ireland (such as the [[2015 Irish constitutional referendums|2015 marriage referendum]]<ref>Martin Doyle, [https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/roddy-doyle-adds-his-two-pints-worth-to-marriage-equality-yes-vote-campaign-1.2197104 \"Roddy Doyle adds his Two Pints worth to marriage equality Yes vote campaign\"], ''The Irish Times'', 1 May 2015.</ref>) and further afield. These developed into the novella ''Two Pints'' (2012). Other recent works are ''[[The Guts (novel)|The Guts]]'' (2013), which continues the story of the Rabbitte family from the Barrytown Trilogy, focusing on a 48-year-old Jimmy Rabbite and his diagnosis of [[bowel cancer]]<ref>{{cite news|first=Theo|last=Tait|title=Still singing the old songs|newspaper=The Guardian Review|location=London|date=3 August 2013|page=5}}</ref> and ''Two More Pints'' (2014).\n\n===Novels for children===\n\nDoyle has also written many novels for children, including the \"Rover Adventures\" series,<ref>Roddy Doyle. (2012). In Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale. Retrieved from  http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CH1000114801&v=2.1&u=ucdavis&it=r&p=LitRC&sw=w</ref> which includes ''The Giggler Treatment'' (2000), ''Rover Saves Christmas'' (2001), and ''The Meanwhile Adventures'' (2004).\n\nOther children's books include ''Wilderness'' (2007), ''Her Mother's Face'' (2008), and ''A Greyhound of a Girl'' (2011).\n\n===Plays, screenplays, short stories and non-fiction===\n\nDoyle is also a prolific dramatist, composing four plays and two screenplays. His plays with the Passion Machine Theatre company include ''Brownbread'' (1987) and ''War'' (1989), directed by [[Paul Mercier (film director and playwright)|Paul Mercier]] with set and costume design by Anne Gately. Later plays include ''The Woman Who Walked into Doors'' (2003); and a rewrite of ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'' (2007) with Bisi Adigun. This latter play was the subject of litigation about copyright which ended with the [[Abbey Theatre]] agreeing to pay Adigun \u20ac600,000.<ref>Ronan McGreevy, [https://www.irishtimes.com/news/abbey-to-pay-600-000-in-dispute-over-play-copyright-1.1255531 \"Abbey 'to pay \u20ac600,000' in dispute over play copyright\"], ''The Irish Times'', 31 January 2013.</ref>\n\nScreenplays include the television screenplay for ''[[Family (1994 TV series)|Family]]'' (1994), which was a [[BBC]]/[[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] [[Serial (literature)|serial]] and the forerunner of the 1996 novel ''The Woman Who Walked into Doors''. Doyle also authored ''[[When Brendan Met Trudy]]'' (2000), which is a romance about a timid schoolteacher (Brendan) and a free-spirited thief (Trudy).\n\nDoyle has written many short stories, several of which have been published in ''[[The New Yorker]]''; they have also been compiled in two collections. ''[[The Deportees and Other Stories]]'' was published in 2007, while the collection ''Bullfighting'' was published in 2011.

Themes range from domestic and personal concerns to larger questions of Irish history.\n\n===Novels for adults===\n\nDoyle's first three novels, ''[[The Commitments (novel)|The Commitments]]'' (1987), ''[[The Snapper (novel)|The Snapper]]'' (1990) and  ''[[The Van (novel)|The Van]]'' (1991) comprise [[The Barrytown Trilogy]], a trilogy centred on the Rabbitte family. All three novels were made into successful films.\n\n''The Commitments'' is about a group of Dublin teenagers, led by Jimmy Rabbitte Jr., who decide to form a soul band in the tradition of [[Wilson Pickett]]. The novel was made into a [[The Commitments (film)|film]] in 1991. ''[[The Snapper (novel)|The Snapper]]'', made into a [[The Snapper (film)|film]] in 1993, focuses on Jimmy's sister, Sharon, who becomes pregnant. She is determined to have the child but refuses to reveal the father's identity to her family. In ''[[The Van (novel)|The Van]]'', which was shortlisted for the 1991 [[Booker Prize]] and made into a [[The Van (1996 film)|film]] in 1996, Jimmy Sr. is laid off, as is his friend Bimbo; the two buy a used [[fish and chips]] van and they go into business for themselves.\n\nIn 1993, Doyle published ''[[Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha]]'', winner of the 1993 [[Man Booker Prize]], which showed the world as described, understood and misunderstood by a ten-year-old Dubliner living in 1968.\n\nDoyle's next novel dealt with darker themes. ''[[The Woman Who Walked into Doors]]'', published in 1996, is the story of a battered wife, narrated by the victim Paula Spencer; despite her husband's increasingly violent behaviour, she defends him, using the classic excuse \"I walked into a door\" to explain her bruises. Ten years later, the protagonist returned in ''[[Paula Spencer (novel)|Paula Spencer]]'', published in 2006.\n\nDoyle's most recent trilogy of adult novels is ''[[The Last Roundup (novel)|The Last Roundup]]'' series, which follows the adventures of protagonist Henry Smart through several decades. ''[[A Star Called Henry]]'' (published 1999) is the first book in the series, and tells the story of Henry Smart, an IRA volunteer and 1916 Easter Rebellion fighter, from his birth in Dublin to his adulthood when he becomes a father. ''[[Oh, Play That Thing!]]'' (2004) continues Henry's story in 1924 America, beginning in the Lower East Side of New York City, where he catches the attention of local mobsters by hiring kids to carry his sandwich boards. He also goes to Chicago where he becomes a business partner with [[Louis Armstrong]]. The title is taken from a phrase that is shouted in one of Armstrong's songs, \"Dippermouth Blues\".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In the final novel in the trilogy, ''[[The Dead Republic]]'' (published 2010), Henry collaborates on writing the script for a Hollywood film. He returns to Ireland and is offered work as the caretaker in a school, when circumstances lead to him re-establishing his link with the IRA.\n\nDoyle frequently posts short comic dialogues on his [[Facebook]] page which are implied to be between two older men in a pub, often relating to current events in Ireland (such as the [[2015 Irish constitutional referendums|2015 marriage referendum]]<ref>Martin Doyle, https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/roddy-doyle-adds-his-two-pints-worth-to-marriage-equality-yes-vote-campaign-1.2197104 \"Roddy Doyle adds his Two Pints worth to marriage equality Yes vote campaign\"], ''The Irish Times'', 1 May 2015.</ref>) and further afield. These developed into the novella ''Two Pints'' (2012).

A year later Boorman was executive producer on Jordan's first feature ''[[Angel (1982 Irish film)|Angel]]'', a tale of a musician caught up in the Troubles played by [[Stephen Rea]] who has subsequently appeared in almost all of Jordan's films to date. During the 1980s, he directed films that won him acclaim, including ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' and ''[[Mona Lisa (1986 film)|Mona Lisa]]'', both made in England. ''The Company of Wolves'', a dark and sexually-themed reimagining of the [[Little Red Riding Hood]] fairy tale based on short stories by [[Angela Carter]], became a cult favorite.\n\nAs a writer/director, Jordan has a highly idiosyncratic body of work, ranging from mainstream hits like ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' to commercial failures like ''[[We're No Angels (1989 film)|We're No Angels]]'' to a variety of more personal, low-budget [[arthouse]] pictures. He was also the driving force behind the cable TV series ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]''.\n[[File:Neil Jordan.4756.jpg|thumb|left|Neil Jordan at the German premiere of ''The Brave One'', 2007]]\n\nUnconventional sexual relationships are a recurring theme in Jordan's work, and he often finds a sympathetic side to characters that audiences would traditionally consider deviant or downright horrifying. His film ''[[The Miracle (1991 film)|The Miracle]]'', for instance, followed two characters who struggled to resist a strong, incestuous attraction. ''[[The Vampire Chronicles|Interview with the Vampire]]'', like the [[Anne Rice]] book it was based on, focused on the intense, intimate interpersonal relationship of two undead men who murder humans nightly (although the pair never have sex, they are clearly lovers of a sort), accompanied by an equally lusty vampire woman who is eternally trapped in the body of a little girl. While Lestat ([[Tom Cruise]]) is depicted in an attractive but villainous manner, his partner Louis ([[Brad Pitt]]) and the child vampire Claudia ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) are meant to capture the audience's sympathy despite their predatory nature. In the remake of ''[[The End of the Affair]]'', two people ([[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Julianne Moore]]) engage in a love affair that will end as suddenly as it started, with both not wanting its end.\n\nIn addition to the unusual sexuality of Jordan's films, he frequently returns to the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] of [[Northern Ireland]]. ''The Crying Game'' and ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'' both concern a transgender character (played by [[Jaye Davidson]] and [[Cillian Murphy]], respectively), both concern the Troubles, and both feature frequent Jordan leading man Stephen Rea. The two films, however, are very different, with ''Crying Game'' being a realistic thriller/romance and ''Breakfast on Pluto'' a much more episodic, stylized, darkly comic biography. Jordan also frequently tells stories about children or young people, such as ''The Miracle'' and ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]''.
