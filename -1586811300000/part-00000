Douglas\u2019 father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], disapproved strongly of the affair, and set out to humiliate Wilde, publicly accusing him of homosexuality. Wilde sued him for criminal [[libel]], but some of his intimate notes were discovered, and he was duly jailed. On his release, Wilde briefly lived with Douglas in Naples, but they were separated by the time Wilde died in 1900.\n\nDouglas married [[Olive Custance]] in 1902, and they produced a son, Raymond. Converting to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1911, he openly repudiated Wilde\u2019s homosexuality, and in a High-Catholic magazine, ''Plain English'', he expressed views that were openly [[anti-Semitic]], though he rejected the policies of [[Nazi Germany]]. He was also jailed for libeling [[Winston Churchill]] over claims of wartime misconduct.\n\nDouglas wrote several books of verse, some of it classified in the homoerotic [[Uranian poetry|Uranian]] genre. The phrase \"The love that dare not speak its name\" came from one of Douglas\u2019 poems, though it is widely misattributed to Wilde.\n\n==Early life and background==\n[[File:JohnSholtoDouglasMarquessofQueensberry.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|The 9th Marquess of Queensberry]]]]\nDouglas was born at Ham Hill House in [[Powick]], [[Worcestershire]], the third son of [[The Most Honourable|The Most Hon.]] [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] and his first wife, Sibyl Montgomery.\n\nHe was his mother's favourite child; she called him Bosie (a derivative of \"boysie\", as in boy), a nickname which stuck for the rest of his life.<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB|id=32869|title=Douglas, Lord Alfred Bruce (1870\u20131945)}}</ref> His mother successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his father's adultery.<ref>\"The Queensberry Divorce Case\", ''The Times'', 24 January 1887, p. 4</ref> The [[Marquess]] married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year.\n\nDouglas was educated at [[Wixenford School]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Rupert|last=Croft-Cooke|title=Bosie: The Story of Lord Alfred Douglas, His Friends and Enemies|publisher=[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=1963|isbn=978-1299419407|page=33}}</ref> [[Winchester College]] (1884\u201388) and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1889\u201393), which he left without obtaining a degree. At [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], he edited an undergraduate journal, ''The Spirit Lamp'' (1892\u20133), an activity that intensified the constant conflict between him and his father. Their relationship had always been a strained one and, during the Queensberry-Wilde feud, Douglas sided with Wilde, even encouraging Wilde to prosecute the Marquess for libel. In 1893, Douglas had a brief affair with [[George Cecil Ives|George Ives]].\n\nIn 1858 his grandfather, [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry]], died in what was reported as a shooting accident, but was widely believed to have been suicide.<ref>Linda Stratmann, The Marquess of Queensberry: Wilde's Nemesis, Yale University Press 2013 p.25</ref><ref>Neil McKenna, The Secret Life Of Oscar Wilde, Random House 2011 p.427</ref> In 1862, his widowed grandmother, Lady Queensberry, converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and took her children to live in [[Paris]].<ref name=schoolnet>[https://spartacus-educational.com/Fdixie.htm Lady Florence Dixie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320041127/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Fdixie.htm |date=20 March 2008 }} at Spartacus-Educational.com (accessed 26 February 2019)</ref>One of his uncles, Lord James Douglas, was deeply attached to his twin sister \"Florrie\" ([[Lady Florence Douglas]]) and was heartbroken when she married a baronet, [[Dixie baronets|Sir Alexander Beaumont Churchill Dixie]].

Montgomery Hyde, ''The Love That Dared not Speak its Name;'' p.144</ref><ref>Ellmann (1988:98)</ref> In 1894, the [[Robert Smythe Hichens|Robert Hichens]] novel ''[[The Green Carnation]]'' was published. Said to be a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' based on the relationship of Wilde and Douglas, it was one of the texts used against Wilde during his trials in 1895.\n\nDouglas has been described as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on men and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to funding his tastes. They often argued and broke up, but would also always reconcile.\n\nDouglas had praised Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' in the Oxford magazine, ''The Spirit Lamp'', of which he was editor (and used as a covert means of gaining acceptance for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written ''Salom\u00e9'' in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"''On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs''\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered  \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and  claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two men, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] and the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] when they themselves objected to Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to [[Robbie Ross]]: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but, in a gesture of reconciliation, suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title-page. Accepting this, Douglas, somewhat vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title-page as \"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman\".<ref name=\"Ellmann\" />\n\nIn 1894, Douglas came and visited Oscar Wilde in Worthing, much to the consternation of the latter's wife Constance.<ref>Antony Edmunds, ''Oscar Wilde's Scandalous Summer;'' p.26 [http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128075207/http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html |date=28 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nOn another occasion, while staying with Wilde in [[Brighton]], Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, but failed to return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] and, on Wilde's 40th birthday, sent him a letter saying that he had charged him the bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for [[blackmail]].<ref name=\"Ellmann\">''Oscar Wilde'' by Richard Ellman, published in 1987</ref>\n\nAlfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, suspected the liaison to be more than a friendship. He sent his son a letter, attacking him for leaving Oxford without a degree and failing to take up a proper career. He threatened to \"disown [Alfred] and stop all money supplies\". Alfred responded with a telegram stating: \"What a funny little man you are\".\n\nQueensberry's next letter threatened his son with a \"thrashing\" and accused him of being \"crazy\". He also threatened to \"make a public scandal in a way you little dream of\" if he continued his relationship with Wilde.\n\nQueensberry was well known for his temper and threatening to beat people with a horsewhip. Alfred sent his father a postcard stating \"I detest you\" and making it clear that he would take Wilde's side in a fight between him and the Marquess, \"with a loaded revolver\".\n\nIn answer Queensberry wrote to Alfred (whom he addressed as \"You miserable creature\") that he had divorced Alfred's mother in order not to \"run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself\" and that, when Alfred was a baby, \"I cried over you the bitterest tears a man ever shed, that I had brought such a creature into the world, and unwittingly committed such a crime&nbsp;... You must be demented\".\n\nWhen Douglas's eldest brother [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig|Francis Viscount Drumlanrig]] died in a suspicious hunting accident in October 1894, rumours circulated that he had been having a homosexual relationship with the Prime Minister, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], and that the cause of death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son, and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant, and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial.<ref>Ellmann (1988:101)</ref> He and a minder confronted the playwright in his own home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde during the premiere of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', but, forewarned of this, the playwright was able to deny him access to the theatre.\n\nQueensberry then publicly insulted Wilde by leaving, at the latter's club, a [[visiting card]] on which he had written: \"For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite {{sic}}\". The wording is in dispute \u2013 the handwriting is unclear \u2013 although Hyde reports it as this. According to [[Merlin Holland]], Wilde's grandson, it is more likely \"Posing somdomite\", while Queensberry himself claimed it to be \"Posing as somdomite\". Holland suggests that this wording (\"posing [as] ...\") would have been easier to defend in court.\n\n==The 1895 trials==\n{{Main|Oscar Wilde#Trials|l1=Oscar Wilde \u2013 Trials}}\nIn response to this card, and with Douglas's avid support, but against the advice of friends such as [[Robbie Ross]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]], Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal [[libel]] in a [[private prosecution]], as [[sodomy]] was then a criminal offence. According to libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction only by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was factually true, but that there was also some public interest in having made the charge publicly. [[Edward Carson]], Queensberry's lawyer, accordingly portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who habitually preyed upon naive young boys and, with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle, seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced into evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was closely questioned about the homoerotic themes in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and in ''The Chameleon'', a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed his 'Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young'.\n\n[[File:Somdomite.jpg|thumb|The calling card in question, labelled Exhibit A in the trial (bottom left corner)|left]]Queensberry's attorney announced in court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry's considerable legal costs, leaving him [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].\n\nBased on the evidence raised during the case, Wilde was arrested the next day and charged with committing criminal [[sodomy]] and \"[[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]]\", a charge only capable of being committed by two men and which covered sexual acts other than sodomy.\n\nDouglas's September 1892 poem \"[[s:Two Loves (1894 poem)|Two Loves]]\" (published in the Oxford magazine ''The Chameleon'' in December 1894), which was used against Wilde at the latter's trial, ends with the famous line that refers to homosexuality as ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'', a quote often falsely attributed to Wilde. Wilde gave an eloquent but counterproductive explanation of the nature of this love on the witness stand. The trial resulted in a [[hung jury]].\n\nIn 1895, when during his trials Wilde was released on bail, Douglas's cousin [[Sholto Johnstone Douglas]] stood [[surety]] for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]500 of the bail money.<ref>Borland, Maureen, ''Wilde's Devoted Friend: A Life of Robert Ross, 1869\u20131918'' (Lennard Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j2lnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&dq=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&ei=j1R5SfWUMpWyyQS4kNSwBg&pgis=1 p. 206] at books.google.com, accessed 22 January 2009</ref> The prosecutor opted to retry the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years' [[hard labour]], first at [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville]], then [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], then famously in [[HM Prison Reading|Reading Gaol]]. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.\n\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter titled ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', describing exactly what he felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but which may or may not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde's on which Ross consulted. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at [[Rouen]], but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.\n\n==Naples and Paris==\nThe meeting in Rouen was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together in Naples, but because of financial pressures and for other personal reasons, they separated. Wilde spent the remainder of his life primarily in Paris, and Douglas returned to Britain in late 1898.\n\nThe period when the two men lived in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed that Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually did gain funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he did give him occasional handouts. When Wilde died in 1900, he was still bankrupt. Douglas served as chief mourner, although there reportedly was an altercation at the grave between him and Robbie Ross. This struggle developed into a feud<ref>{{cite book|title=World Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvwIAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=E. Hulton}}</ref> which foreshadowed the later litigations between the two former lovers of Wilde.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Lady-alfred-douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady Alfred Douglas]]\nAfter Wilde's death, Douglas established a close friendship with [[Olive Custance]], a [[bisexual]] heiress and poet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Sarah|title='A Girl's Love': Lord Alfred Douglas as Homoerotic Muse in the Poetry of Olive Custance|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|location=London, England|date=September 2011|volume=22|issue=2\u20133|pages=220\u2013240|doi=10.1080/09574042.2011.585045|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/22672}}</ref> They married on 4 March 1902.

They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Custance also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up Catholicism. The health of their only child further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920s was all but over, although they never divorced.\n\n==Repudiation of Wilde==\nIn 1911, Douglas embraced Roman Catholicism, as Wilde had done earlier. More than a decade after Wilde's death, with the release of suppressed portions of Wilde's ''De Profundis'' letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by [[Maud Allan]] against [[Noel Pemberton Billing]] in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', of being part of a homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.\n\nDouglas also contributed to Billing's journal ''Vigilante'' as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem referring to [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]] \"bound with Lesbian fillets\" while her husband [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert]], the Prime Minister, gave money to Ross.<ref>Philip Hoare. (1999). ''Oscar Wilde\u2019s Last Stand: Decadence, Conspiracy, and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century''. Arcade Publishing, p.&nbsp;110.</ref> During the trial he described Wilde as \"the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years\". Douglas added that he intensely regretted having met Wilde, and having helped him with the translation of ''Salome'', which he described as \"a most pernicious and abominable piece of work\".\n\n==''Plain English''==\n\nIn 1920 Douglas founded a [[Far-right politics|right-wing]], Catholic, and \"deeply anti-Jewish\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Toczek|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2015|isbn=978-1138853485|page=239}}</ref> weekly magazine called ''Plain English'', on which he collaborated with [[Harold Sherwood Spencer]], and to begin with [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland]]. It regarded itself as the successor to ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', to which Douglas had been a contributing editor. ''Plain English'' ran until the end of 1922. Douglas later admitted that its policy was \"strongly anti-Semitic\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p. 302</ref><ref>Brown, William Sorley ''The Life and Genius of T.W.H. Crosland'' (1928) p394</ref>\n\nFrom August 1920 (issue No 8) ''Plain English'' began publishing a long running series of articles called \"The Jewish Peril\" by [[Arthur Cherep-Spiridovich|Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovitch]] the title of which was taken from the fore-title of [[George Shanks]]' version of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. ''Plain English'' advertised (from issue 20) [[The Britons]]' second edition of Shank's version of the ''Protocols''. Douglas challenged the ''Jewish Guardian'', published by the [[League of British Jews]], to take him to court suggesting they would not as they were \"well aware of the absolute truth of the allegations which we have made\".<ref>The \"Jewish Guardian\" Again, ''Plain English'' No 21, 27 November 1920</ref> The magazine suggested in 1921, \"we need a [[Ku Klux Klan]] in this country\",<ref>Lies, ''Plain English'' No 66, 8 October 1921</ref> but a promotion for ''[[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]'' magazine was generally not well received by readers.\n\nOther regular targets of the magazine included [[David Lloyd George]], [[Lord Northcliffe|Alfred Viscount Northcliffe]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. In December 1920 the magazine was the first to publish the secret constitution of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].\n\nFrom 25 December 1920 it began publishing regularly its most notorious series of articles alleging that a \"powerful individual in the Admiralty\" had alerted the Germans at the [[Battle of Jutland]] that the British had broken their code, and that [[Winston Churchill]] had falsified a report in return for a large sum of money from [[Ernest Cassel]] who thereby profited; in May 1921 Douglas would also insinuate that [[Herbert Kitchener|Herbert Earl Kitchener]] had been murdered by the Jews.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Heathorn|title=Haig and Kitchener in Twentieth-Century Britain: Remembrance, Representation and Appropriation|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2016|isbn=978-0754669654|pages=68\u201372}}</ref>\n\nDouglas ceased to be editor after issue 67 in 1921 after a row with Spencer.<ref>Toczek, p. 34</ref> He then produced a short lived, almost identical, rival magazine called ''Plain Speech'' in 1921 with [[Herbert Moore Pim]]. Its first issue contained a letter from a correspondent in Germany praising \"[[Adolf Hitler|Herr Hittler]]\" (as spelled in original) and \"[[Nazi Party|The German White Labour Party]]\".\n\nDouglas's view of a Jewish plot was nuanced. In 1920 he would, whilst recognizing \"the Jewish Peril\", noted that \"Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race\".<ref>Christian Charity and the Jews, ''Plain English'' No. 4, 31 July 1920, p. 78</ref> In 1921 he would state it was not acceptable to \"shift responsibility\" onto the Jews.<ref>\"The Jews, 'The Britons' and the ''Morning Post''\", ''Plain Speech'' No. 10, 24 December 1921, p. 149</ref> In his ''Autobiography'' in 1929 he wrote, \"I feel now that it is ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish\", and then indicated the country had only itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.<ref>''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) pp. 303\u2013304</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Colin Holmes (historian)|Colin Holmes]] indicated that while \"Douglas had been to the forefront of anti-semitism in the early 1920s, he was quite unable to come to terms with the vicious racist anti-semitism in Germany\" under the Nazis.<ref>Holmes, Colin ''Anti-Semitism in British Society, 1876\u20131939'' Routledge (1979) p. 218</ref> Politically he described himself as \"a strong Conservative of the 'Diehard' variety\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p220</ref>\n\n==Libel actions==\nDouglas started his \"litigious and libellous career\" by obtaining an apology and fifty guineas each from the Oxford and Cambridge university magazines ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]'' and ''Cambridge'' for defamatory references to him in an article on Wilde.<ref>(Murray p&nbsp;152)</ref>\n\nDouglas was either plaintiff or defendant in several trials for civil or [[criminal libel]]. In 1913 he was charged with libelling his father-in-law. Also in 1913 he accused [[Arthur Ransome]] of libelling him in his book ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study''. He saw this trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour and Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12530/page/77 The Edinburgh Gazette Publication date:17 January 1913 Issue: 12530, Page 77]</ref> Ransome did remove the offending passages from the second edition of his book.<ref>Ransome, Arthur, ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study'', 2nd edition, Methuen, 1913</ref>\n\nIn the most noted case, brought by the Crown on Winston Churchill's behalf in 1923, Douglas was found guilty of libelling Churchill and was sentenced to six months in prison. Churchill had been accused as cabinet minister, of falsifying an official report on the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 when, although suffering losses, the Royal Navy drove the German battle fleet off the high seas. Churchill was said to have reported that the British navy had in fact, been defeated; the motive was supposed to be that when this news was flashed, the prices of British securities would tumble on the world's stock exchanges, allowing a group of named Jewish financiers to snap them up cheaply. Churchill's reward was a houseful of furniture, valued at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]40,000.\n\nThe allegations were made by Douglas in his journal ''Plain English'' and later at a public meeting in London. A false report of a crushing British naval defeat had indeed been planted in the New York press by German interests but by this time (following the failure of his [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]]), Churchill was not connected with the Admiralty. As the attorney general asserted in court, on Churchill's behalf, there was \"no plot, no phoney communiqu\u00e9, no stock market raid and no present of fine furniture\".<ref>http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727630,00.html accessed 10/2/2017</ref><ref>http://www.jta.org/1923/12/13/archive/churchill-wins-libel-suit-against-douglas accessed 10/2/2017</ref>\n\nIn 1924, while in prison, Douglas, in an echo of Wilde's composition of ''De Profundis'' ([[Latin]] for \"From the Depths\") during his incarceration, wrote his last major poetic work, ''In Excelsis'' (In the Highest), which contains 17 [[canto]]s. Since the prison authorities would not allow Douglas to take the manuscript with him when he was released, he had to rewrite the work from memory. Douglas maintained that his health never recovered from his harsh prison ordeal, which included sleeping on a plank bed without a mattress.\n\n==Later life==\nFollowing his incarceration in 1924, Douglas's feelings towards Wilde began to soften. He wrote in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' that \"Sometimes a sin is also a crime (for example, a murder or theft), but this is not the case with homosexuality, any more than with adultery\".<ref>(Murray pp 309\u2013310)</ref> Throughout the 1930s and until his death Douglas maintained correspondence with many people, including [[Marie Stopes]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. [[Anthony Wynn]] wrote the play ''Bernard and Bosie: A Most Unlikely Friendship'' based on the letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas's final public appearances was his well-received lecture to the [[Royal Society of Literature]] on 2 September 1943, entitled ''The Principles of Poetry'', which was published in an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] and the talk was praised by [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[Augustus John]].<ref>(Murray pp 318\u2013319)</ref>\n\nDouglas's only child, Raymond, was diagnosed with [[schizoaffective disorder]] in 1927, at the age of 24 and entered [[St Andrew's Hospital]], a mental institution. He was decertified and discharged after five years but suffered another breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral and in June he was again decertified. His conduct rapidly deteriorated and he returned to St Andrew's in November. He stayed there until his death on 10 October 1964.

The earlier ones by Braybrooke and Freeman were not allowed to quote from Douglas's copyright work and ''De Profundis'' was unpublished. Later biographies were by Rupert Croft-Cooke, [[H.

Douglas\u2019 father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], disapproved strongly of the affair, and set out to humiliate Wilde, publicly accusing him of homosexuality. Wilde sued him for criminal [[libel]], but some of his intimate notes were discovered, and he was duly jailed. On his release, Wilde briefly lived with Douglas in Naples, but they were separated by the time Wilde died in 1900.\n\nDouglas married [[Olive Custance]] in 1902, and they produced a son, Raymond. Converting to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1911, he openly repudiated Wilde\u2019s homosexuality, and in a High-Catholic magazine, ''Plain English'', he expressed views that were openly [[anti-Semitic]], though he rejected the policies of [[Nazi Germany]]. He was also jailed for libeling [[Winston Churchill]] over claims of wartime misconduct.\n\nDouglas wrote several books of verse, some of it classified in the homoerotic [[Uranian poetry|Uranian]] genre. The phrase \"The love that dare not speak its name\" came from one of Douglas\u2019 poems, though it is widely misattributed to Wilde.\n\n==Early life and background==\n[[File:JohnSholtoDouglasMarquessofQueensberry.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|The 9th Marquess of Queensberry]]]]\nDouglas was born at Ham Hill House in [[Powick]], [[Worcestershire]], the third son of [[The Most Honourable|The Most Hon.]] [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry]] and his first wife, Sibyl Montgomery.\n\nHe was his mother's favourite child; she called him Bosie (a derivative of \"boysie\", as in boy), a nickname which stuck for the rest of his life.<ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB|id=32869|title=Douglas, Lord Alfred Bruce (1870\u20131945)}}</ref> His mother successfully sued for divorce in 1887 on the grounds of his father's adultery.<ref>\"The Queensberry Divorce Case\", ''The Times'', 24 January 1887, p. 4</ref> The [[Marquess]] married Ethel Weeden in 1893 but the marriage was annulled the following year.\n\nDouglas was educated at [[Wixenford School]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Rupert|last=Croft-Cooke|title=Bosie: The Story of Lord Alfred Douglas, His Friends and Enemies|publisher=[[Bobbs-Merrill Company]]|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|date=1963|isbn=978-1299419407|page=33}}</ref> [[Winchester College]] (1884\u201388) and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] (1889\u201393), which he left without obtaining a degree.

Said to be a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' based on the relationship of Wilde and Douglas, it was one of the texts used against Wilde during his trials in 1895.\n\nDouglas has been described as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on men and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to funding his tastes. They often argued and broke up, but would also always reconcile.\n\nDouglas had praised Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' in the Oxford magazine, ''The Spirit Lamp'', of which he was editor (and used as a covert means of gaining acceptance for homosexuality). Wilde had originally written ''Salom\u00e9'' in French, and in 1893 he commissioned Douglas to translate it into English. Douglas's French was very poor and his translation was highly criticised; for example, a passage that runs \"''On ne doit regarder que dans les miroirs''\" (\"One should look only in mirrors\") he rendered  \"One must not look at mirrors\". Douglas was angered at Wilde's criticism, and  claimed that the errors were in fact in Wilde's original play. This led to a hiatus in the relationship and a row between the two men, with angry messages being exchanged and even the involvement of the publisher [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] and the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] when they themselves objected to Douglas's work. Beardsley complained to [[Robbie Ross]]: \"For one week the numbers of telegraph and messenger boys who came to the door was simply scandalous\". Wilde redid much of the translation himself, but, in a gesture of reconciliation, suggested that Douglas be dedicated as the translator rather than credited, along with him, on the title-page. Accepting this, Douglas, somewhat vainly, likened a dedication to sharing the title-page as \"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman\".<ref name=\"Ellmann\" />\n\nIn 1894, Douglas came and visited Oscar Wilde in Worthing, much to the consternation of the latter's wife Constance.<ref>Antony Edmunds, ''Oscar Wilde's Scandalous Summer;'' p.26 [http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128075207/http://www.oscarwilde.org.uk/chapter-1.html |date=28 November 2018 }}</ref>\n\nOn another occasion, while staying with Wilde in [[Brighton]], Douglas fell ill with influenza and was nursed by Wilde, but failed to return the favour when Wilde himself fell ill in consequence. Instead Douglas moved to the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] and, on Wilde's 40th birthday, sent him a letter saying that he had charged him the bill. Douglas also gave his old clothes to male prostitutes, but failed to remove from the pockets incriminating letters exchanged between him and Wilde, which were then used for [[blackmail]].<ref name=\"Ellmann\">''Oscar Wilde'' by Richard Ellman, published in 1987</ref>\n\nAlfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, suspected the liaison to be more than a friendship. He sent his son a letter, attacking him for leaving Oxford without a degree and failing to take up a proper career. He threatened to \"disown [Alfred] and stop all money supplies\". Alfred responded with a telegram stating: \"What a funny little man you are\".\n\nQueensberry's next letter threatened his son with a \"thrashing\" and accused him of being \"crazy\". He also threatened to \"make a public scandal in a way you little dream of\" if he continued his relationship with Wilde.\n\nQueensberry was well known for his temper and threatening to beat people with a horsewhip. Alfred sent his father a postcard stating \"I detest you\" and making it clear that he would take Wilde's side in a fight between him and the Marquess, \"with a loaded revolver\".\n\nIn answer Queensberry wrote to Alfred (whom he addressed as \"You miserable creature\") that he had divorced Alfred's mother in order not to \"run the risk of bringing more creatures into the world like yourself\" and that, when Alfred was a baby, \"I cried over you the bitterest tears a man ever shed, that I had brought such a creature into the world, and unwittingly committed such a crime&nbsp;... You must be demented\".\n\nWhen Douglas's eldest brother [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig|Francis Viscount Drumlanrig]] died in a suspicious hunting accident in October 1894, rumours circulated that he had been having a homosexual relationship with the Prime Minister, [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]], and that the cause of death was suicide. The Marquess of Queensberry thus embarked on a campaign to save his other son, and began a public persecution of Wilde. Wilde had been openly flamboyant, and his actions made the public suspicious even before the trial.<ref>Ellmann (1988:101)</ref> He and a minder confronted the playwright in his own home; later, Queensberry planned to throw rotten vegetables at Wilde during the premiere of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', but, forewarned of this, the playwright was able to deny him access to the theatre.\n\nQueensberry then publicly insulted Wilde by leaving, at the latter's club, a [[visiting card]] on which he had written: \"For Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite {{sic}}\". The wording is in dispute \u2013 the handwriting is unclear \u2013 although Hyde reports it as this. According to [[Merlin Holland]], Wilde's grandson, it is more likely \"Posing somdomite\", while Queensberry himself claimed it to be \"Posing as somdomite\". Holland suggests that this wording (\"posing [as] ...\") would have been easier to defend in court.\n\n==The 1895 trials==\n{{Main|Oscar Wilde#Trials|l1=Oscar Wilde \u2013 Trials}}\nIn response to this card, and with Douglas's avid support, but against the advice of friends such as [[Robbie Ross]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[George Bernard Shaw]], Wilde had Queensberry arrested and charged with criminal [[libel]] in a [[private prosecution]], as [[sodomy]] was then a criminal offence. According to libel laws of the time, since his authorship of the charge of sodomy was not in question, Queensberry could avoid conviction only by demonstrating in court not only that the charge he had made was factually true, but that there was also some public interest in having made the charge publicly. [[Edward Carson]], Queensberry's lawyer, accordingly portrayed Wilde as a vicious older man who habitually preyed upon naive young boys and, with extravagant gifts and promises of a glamorous lifestyle, seduced them into a life of homosexuality. Several highly suggestive erotic letters that Wilde had written to Douglas were introduced into evidence; Wilde claimed they were works of art. Wilde was closely questioned about the homoerotic themes in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and in ''The Chameleon'', a single-issue magazine published by Douglas to which Wilde had contributed his 'Phrases and Philosophies for Use of the Young'.\n\n[[File:Somdomite.jpg|thumb|The calling card in question, labelled Exhibit A in the trial (bottom left corner)|left]]Queensberry's attorney announced in court that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. Wilde's lawyers advised him that this would make a conviction on the libel charge very unlikely; he then dropped the libel charge, on his lawyers' advice, to avoid further pointless scandal. Without a conviction, the libel law of the time left Wilde liable to pay Queensberry's considerable legal costs, leaving him [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].\n\nBased on the evidence raised during the case, Wilde was arrested the next day and charged with committing criminal [[sodomy]] and \"[[gross indecency between men|gross indecency]]\", a charge only capable of being committed by two men and which covered sexual acts other than sodomy.\n\nDouglas's September 1892 poem \"[[s:Two Loves (1894 poem)|Two Loves]]\" (published in the Oxford magazine ''The Chameleon'' in December 1894), which was used against Wilde at the latter's trial, ends with the famous line that refers to homosexuality as ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'', a quote often falsely attributed to Wilde. Wilde gave an eloquent but counterproductive explanation of the nature of this love on the witness stand. The trial resulted in a [[hung jury]].\n\nIn 1895, when during his trials Wilde was released on bail, Douglas's cousin [[Sholto Johnstone Douglas]] stood [[surety]] for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]500 of the bail money.<ref>Borland, Maureen, ''Wilde's Devoted Friend: A Life of Robert Ross, 1869\u20131918'' (Lennard Publishing, 1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=j2lnAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&dq=%22Sholto+Johnstone+Douglas%22&ei=j1R5SfWUMpWyyQS4kNSwBg&pgis=1 p. 206] at books.google.com, accessed 22 January 2009</ref> The prosecutor opted to retry the case. Wilde was convicted on 25 May 1895 and sentenced to two years' [[hard labour]], first at [[HM Prison Pentonville|Pentonville]], then [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth]], then famously in [[HM Prison Reading|Reading Gaol]]. Douglas was forced into exile in Europe.\n\nWhile in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a long and critical letter titled ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', describing exactly what he felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but which may or may not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until reference was made to it in a biography of Wilde's on which Ross consulted. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at [[Rouen]], but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.\n\n==Naples and Paris==\nThe meeting in Rouen was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together in Naples, but because of financial pressures and for other personal reasons, they separated. Wilde spent the remainder of his life primarily in Paris, and Douglas returned to Britain in late 1898.\n\nThe period when the two men lived in Naples later became controversial. Wilde claimed that Douglas had offered a home, but had no funds or ideas. When Douglas eventually did gain funds from his late father's estate, he refused to grant Wilde a permanent allowance, although he did give him occasional handouts. When Wilde died in 1900, he was still bankrupt. Douglas served as chief mourner, although there reportedly was an altercation at the grave between him and Robbie Ross. This struggle developed into a feud<ref>{{cite book|title=World Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvwIAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=E. Hulton}}</ref> which foreshadowed the later litigations between the two former lovers of Wilde.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Lady-alfred-douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady Alfred Douglas]]\nAfter Wilde's death, Douglas established a close friendship with [[Olive Custance]], a [[bisexual]] heiress and poet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Sarah|title='A Girl's Love': Lord Alfred Douglas as Homoerotic Muse in the Poetry of Olive Custance|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|publisher=[[Taylor and Francis]]|location=London, England|date=September 2011|volume=22|issue=2\u20133|pages=220\u2013240|doi=10.1080/09574042.2011.585045|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/22672}}</ref> They married on 4 March 1902.

They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Custance also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up Catholicism. The health of their only child further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920s was all but over, although they never divorced.\n\n==Repudiation of Wilde==\nIn 1911, Douglas embraced Roman Catholicism, as Wilde had done earlier. More than a decade after Wilde's death, with the release of suppressed portions of Wilde's ''De Profundis'' letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a defence witness in the libel case brought by [[Maud Allan]] against [[Noel Pemberton Billing]] in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde's play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', of being part of a homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.\n\nDouglas also contributed to Billing's journal ''Vigilante'' as part of his campaign against Robbie Ross. He had written a poem referring to [[Margot Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith|Margot Asquith]] \"bound with Lesbian fillets\" while her husband [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert]], the Prime Minister, gave money to Ross.<ref>Philip Hoare. (1999). ''Oscar Wilde\u2019s Last Stand: Decadence, Conspiracy, and the Most Outrageous Trial of the Century''. Arcade Publishing, p.&nbsp;110.</ref> During the trial he described Wilde as \"the greatest force for evil that has appeared in Europe during the last three hundred and fifty years\". Douglas added that he intensely regretted having met Wilde, and having helped him with the translation of ''Salome'', which he described as \"a most pernicious and abominable piece of work\".\n\n==''Plain English''==\n\nIn 1920 Douglas founded a [[Far-right politics|right-wing]], Catholic, and \"deeply anti-Jewish\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Toczek|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2015|isbn=978-1138853485|page=239}}</ref> weekly magazine called ''Plain English'', on which he collaborated with [[Harold Sherwood Spencer]], and to begin with [[Thomas William Hodgson Crosland]]. It regarded itself as the successor to ''[[The Academy (periodical)|The Academy]]'', to which Douglas had been a contributing editor. ''Plain English'' ran until the end of 1922. Douglas later admitted that its policy was \"strongly anti-Semitic\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p. 302</ref><ref>Brown, William Sorley ''The Life and Genius of T.W.H. Crosland'' (1928) p394</ref>\n\nFrom August 1920 (issue No 8) ''Plain English'' began publishing a long running series of articles called \"The Jewish Peril\" by [[Arthur Cherep-Spiridovich|Major-General Count Cherep-Spiridovitch]] the title of which was taken from the fore-title of [[George Shanks]]' version of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. ''Plain English'' advertised (from issue 20) [[The Britons]]' second edition of Shank's version of the ''Protocols''. Douglas challenged the ''Jewish Guardian'', published by the [[League of British Jews]], to take him to court suggesting they would not as they were \"well aware of the absolute truth of the allegations which we have made\".<ref>The \"Jewish Guardian\" Again, ''Plain English'' No 21, 27 November 1920</ref> The magazine suggested in 1921, \"we need a [[Ku Klux Klan]] in this country\",<ref>Lies, ''Plain English'' No 66, 8 October 1921</ref> but a promotion for ''[[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]'' magazine was generally not well received by readers.\n\nOther regular targets of the magazine included [[David Lloyd George]], [[Lord Northcliffe|Alfred Viscount Northcliffe]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Frank Harris]], and [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]. In December 1920 the magazine was the first to publish the secret constitution of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].\n\nFrom 25 December 1920 it began publishing regularly its most notorious series of articles alleging that a \"powerful individual in the Admiralty\" had alerted the Germans at the [[Battle of Jutland]] that the British had broken their code, and that [[Winston Churchill]] had falsified a report in return for a large sum of money from [[Ernest Cassel]] who thereby profited; in May 1921 Douglas would also insinuate that [[Herbert Kitchener|Herbert Earl Kitchener]] had been murdered by the Jews.<ref>{{cite book|first=Stephen|last=Heathorn|title=Haig and Kitchener in Twentieth-Century Britain: Remembrance, Representation and Appropriation|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=2016|isbn=978-0754669654|pages=68\u201372}}</ref>\n\nDouglas ceased to be editor after issue 67 in 1921 after a row with Spencer.<ref>Toczek, p. 34</ref> He then produced a short lived, almost identical, rival magazine called ''Plain Speech'' in 1921 with [[Herbert Moore Pim]]. Its first issue contained a letter from a correspondent in Germany praising \"[[Adolf Hitler|Herr Hittler]]\" (as spelled in original) and \"[[Nazi Party|The German White Labour Party]]\".\n\nDouglas's view of a Jewish plot was nuanced. In 1920 he would, whilst recognizing \"the Jewish Peril\", noted that \"Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race\".<ref>Christian Charity and the Jews, ''Plain English'' No. 4, 31 July 1920, p. 78</ref> In 1921 he would state it was not acceptable to \"shift responsibility\" onto the Jews.<ref>\"The Jews, 'The Britons' and the ''Morning Post''\", ''Plain Speech'' No. 10, 24 December 1921, p. 149</ref> In his ''Autobiography'' in 1929 he wrote, \"I feel now that it is ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are really much more typically English than Jewish\", and then indicated the country had only itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.<ref>''The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas'' (1929) pp. 303\u2013304</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Colin Holmes (historian)|Colin Holmes]] indicated that while \"Douglas had been to the forefront of anti-semitism in the early 1920s, he was quite unable to come to terms with the vicious racist anti-semitism in Germany\" under the Nazis.<ref>Holmes, Colin ''Anti-Semitism in British Society, 1876\u20131939'' Routledge (1979) p. 218</ref> Politically he described himself as \"a strong Conservative of the 'Diehard' variety\".<ref>The Autobiography of Lord Alfred Douglas (1929) p220</ref>\n\n==Libel actions==\nDouglas started his \"litigious and libellous career\" by obtaining an apology and fifty guineas each from the Oxford and Cambridge university magazines ''[[Isis magazine|Isis]]'' and ''Cambridge'' for defamatory references to him in an article on Wilde.<ref>(Murray p&nbsp;152)</ref>\n\nDouglas was either plaintiff or defendant in several trials for civil or [[criminal libel]]. In 1913 he was charged with libelling his father-in-law. Also in 1913 he accused [[Arthur Ransome]] of libelling him in his book ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study''. He saw this trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding that Ross would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour and Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit.<ref>[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/12530/page/77 The Edinburgh Gazette Publication date:17 January 1913 Issue: 12530, Page 77]</ref> Ransome did remove the offending passages from the second edition of his book.<ref>Ransome, Arthur, ''Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study'', 2nd edition, Methuen, 1913</ref>\n\nIn the most noted case, brought by the Crown on Winston Churchill's behalf in 1923, Douglas was found guilty of libelling Churchill and was sentenced to six months in prison. Churchill had been accused as cabinet minister, of falsifying an official report on the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 when, although suffering losses, the Royal Navy drove the German battle fleet off the high seas. Churchill was said to have reported that the British navy had in fact, been defeated; the motive was supposed to be that when this news was flashed, the prices of British securities would tumble on the world's stock exchanges, allowing a group of named Jewish financiers to snap them up cheaply. Churchill's reward was a houseful of furniture, valued at [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]40,000.\n\nThe allegations were made by Douglas in his journal ''Plain English'' and later at a public meeting in London. A false report of a crushing British naval defeat had indeed been planted in the New York press by German interests but by this time (following the failure of his [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]]), Churchill was not connected with the Admiralty. As the attorney general asserted in court, on Churchill's behalf, there was \"no plot, no phoney communiqu\u00e9, no stock market raid and no present of fine furniture\".<ref>http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,727630,00.html accessed 10/2/2017</ref><ref>http://www.jta.org/1923/12/13/archive/churchill-wins-libel-suit-against-douglas accessed 10/2/2017</ref>\n\nIn 1924, while in prison, Douglas, in an echo of Wilde's composition of ''De Profundis'' ([[Latin]] for \"From the Depths\") during his incarceration, wrote his last major poetic work, ''In Excelsis'' (In the Highest), which contains 17 [[canto]]s. Since the prison authorities would not allow Douglas to take the manuscript with him when he was released, he had to rewrite the work from memory. Douglas maintained that his health never recovered from his harsh prison ordeal, which included sleeping on a plank bed without a mattress.\n\n==Later life==\nFollowing his incarceration in 1924, Douglas's feelings towards Wilde began to soften. He wrote in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' that \"Sometimes a sin is also a crime (for example, a murder or theft), but this is not the case with homosexuality, any more than with adultery\".<ref>(Murray pp 309\u2013310)</ref> Throughout the 1930s and until his death Douglas maintained correspondence with many people, including [[Marie Stopes]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. [[Anthony Wynn]] wrote the play ''Bernard and Bosie: A Most Unlikely Friendship'' based on the letters between Shaw and Douglas. One of Douglas's final public appearances was his well-received lecture to the [[Royal Society of Literature]] on 2 September 1943, entitled ''The Principles of Poetry'', which was published in an edition of 1,000 copies. He attacked the poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] and the talk was praised by [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[Augustus John]].<ref>(Murray pp 318\u2013319)</ref>\n\nDouglas's only child, Raymond, was diagnosed with [[schizoaffective disorder]] in 1927, at the age of 24 and entered [[St Andrew's Hospital]], a mental institution. He was decertified and discharged after five years but suffered another breakdown and returned to the hospital. In February 1944, when his mother died of a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] at the age of 70, Raymond was able to attend her funeral and in June he was again decertified. His conduct rapidly deteriorated and he returned to St Andrew's in November. He stayed there until his death on 10 October 1964. He never married.<ref>[http://www.anthonywynn.com/bosietimeline/ \"Timeline to the Life of Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas\" anthonywynn.com] Retrieved 24 August 2011</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Lord Alfred Douglas grave.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Douglas' gravestone|The grave of Alfred Douglas (and mother) at the [[Friary Church of St Francis and St Anthony, Crawley]], Sussex, pictured in 2013]]\nDouglas died of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Lancing, West Sussex|Lancing]], Sussex, on 20 March 1945 at the age of 74.

The population was 469 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to Houck's History of Missouri, the town of Cooter was named in 1854 for the Madame Coutre, the owner of a brothel that served travelers that passed through the Missouri Bootheel. Madame Coutre is believed to have emigrated from [[France]] in the mid-1700s to the Franco-American village of [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve, Missouri]]. Marie Coutre travelled inland westward, and in 1795 is listed in documents as being a merchant and tavern owner in the area of present-day Cooter. \n\nShe was famous for her extra large vaginal labia that were sought out by riverboat crewmen looking for company. It was due to her renown vagina that cooter entered American English as a slang word. Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, was said to have paid for \"some cooter\" at least four times during his career as a riverboat pilot. Madame Marie Coutre ran the brothel until her death in 1812. Her daughter, Joan Cooter, took over the family business, which lasted five generations.\n\nThe Cooter Tavern Inn was shutdown in 1929 by a crack team of FBI agents enforcing Prohibition laws. The brothel was demolished, but the town retains the name of its legendary founder.<ref>A History of Missouri Vol. 2, by Louis Houck. Published by R.R.

Many of these troops were brought through [[Baltimore|Baltimore City]], a major transportation hub.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the Second Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn King Manuel I's orders, arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) was largely politically motivated.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the first armada included captain Nicolau Coelho, pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator Bartolomeu Dias, who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope, and his brother Diogo Dias, who had served as clerk on Gama's ship, also served as captains. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551). It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the Portuguese crown.\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest astrolabe and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe priority of the mission was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to Bartolomeu and Diogo Dias, was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  \n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether Cabral also had secret instructions from the king to lay claim to the landmass of Brazil\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> There are various reasons to presume the existence of such instructions unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south at that time. Christopher Columbus]had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]] coast and in early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now [[Cear\u00e1]], and perhaps went as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nThese expeditions, however, were too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself. It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them. Even if they were, it would not seem sensible for Cabral's Second Armada to be instructed to deviate from its original mission in India to pursue exploratory work which be far more efficiently accomplished by smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nOn March 9, Cabral's expedition set out from the [[Tagus]]. Thirteen days later, on March 22, Cabral's armada reached the island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires was too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returned to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref><ref group=note>Caminha's eyewitness account made no mention of Pires and instead reported that it was the Vasco de Ataide's crown ship that was lost around Cape Verde.</ref>\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral went southwest. It is unknown why he chose such an unusual direction, but the most probable hypothesis is that he was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope. Navigationally, the arc is sensible. From Cape Verde, the ship would cut across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catch the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], and turn into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies would easily carry the ships across the South Atlantic around the Cape of Good Hope. If instead of this arc, Cabral attempted to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it would go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. To reach the Cape from there would be a struggle, as Cabral would have had to sail against the southeasterly [[trade wind|trade winds]], as well as the [[Benguela Current]]. \n\nHow Cabral knew of this arc is unknown. Most likely, this was precisely the route followed by Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots Alenquer and Escobar\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref group=note>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did. How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before? Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance. The more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], is more straightforward: Since Bartolomeu Dias's 1488 expedition discovered the westerlies, the South Atlantic arc became \"navigationally obvious\" to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref> Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document intended for Cabral that instructs him to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve'). See Fonseca (1908, p. 211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938, p. 167)</ref> \n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest are that he was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet, that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships, or that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n\nCabral took the same path as Gama had, but made a slightly wider arc and went further west than Gama had. As a result, he hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of Brazil. After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21, Cabral's fleet found the first indications of nearby land.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |page=225 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref> The next day, the armada caught sight of the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they named [[Monte Pascoal]].\n\nThe armada anchored at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] the next day, and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembled on the beach. Cabral dispatched a small party, headed by Nicolau Coelho, in a longboat ashore to make first contact. Coelho tossed his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf was too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, so they returned to the ships.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fonseca |first=Faustino da |date=1908 |pages=241\u2013242 |title=A Descoberta to Brasil |language=Portuguese |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Livraria Central de Gomes de Carvalho |place=Lisbon}}</ref>\n\nStrong overnight winds prompted the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes, while [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat, spotted a native canoe, captured the two Indians on board, and brought them back to ship. The language barrier prevented questioning, but they were fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural difference was apparent: The natives spat out their honey and cake and were deeply surprised upon seeing a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nThe next day, on April 25, a party led by Coelho and Bartolomeu Dias went ashore, accompanied by the two natives. Armed Tupiniquim warily approached the beach, but upon a signal from the two natives, set down their bows, and allowed the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861)]]\n\nOn April 26, the Octave of Easter Sunday, the Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra went ashore to celebrate mass in front of 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  This is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nInteraction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increased throughout the week.  European iron nails, cloth, beads, and crucifixes were traded for American amulets, spears, parrots, and monkeys. There was only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''degredados'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the rest of the crew sleeps aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha's letter to the king, reporting the discovery of the \"Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\n\nOn May 1, Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras, determined that Brazil lay east of the Tordesillas line, prompting Cabral to formally claim it for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"). It was later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz''\u2014\"Land of the Holy Cross\"\u2014upon the realization that it was not an island).<ref group=note>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia saying it was named so because the departure date was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.

The fleet faced headlong winds for six straight days and four ship\u2014Bartolomeu Dias's, Aires Gomes da Silva's, Sim\u00e3o de Pina's, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde's\u2014are lost at sea in the process.<ref>Castanheda (1551)</ref><ref>Barros (1552)</ref><ref>G\u00f3is (1566)</ref><ref group=note>The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos. Similarly, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which has neither Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost.  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five. Some scholars also contend that Pires was lost at this point, and Vasco de Ata\u00edde had been lost earlier at Cape Verde.</ref> In this way, the fleet was reduced to seven ships. Facing strong winds, the armada split into smaller groups to meet again on the other side. Cabral's ship went with two others.\n\nOn June 16, 1500, Cabral's three-ship squadron reached the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] several leagues north of Sofala.  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, took flight. Cabral gave pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured. Upon questioning, it was discovered that these ships were owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of Malindi (who had received Vasco da Gama in 1498), so they were released. \n\nThe three ships landed on [[Mozambique Island]] on June 22. Despite the earlier quarrel with his ships, Cabral was given a warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique and was allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the Second Armada sailed into the island and joined with Cabral.  Only the ship of Diogo Dias remained missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decided not to wait for it and instead pressed on with his fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\n\nMore than a month later, on July 26, Cabral's armada reached [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], the dominant city-state of the East African coast and which Gama had never visited. Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala in Lisbon and had escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), went ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim<ref group=note>At the time, there was no ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]] as the previous one, al-Fudail, had been deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.</ref>\n\nA meeting was arranged between Cabral and Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in the harbor. Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Ibrahim was suspicious and remained resistant to the overtures. Cabral, sensing Ibrahim's resistance and worrying that they might miss the monsoon winds to India, broke off the negotiations and sailed on.\n\nPressing north, the Cabral fleet avoided the hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reached friendly Malindi (''Melinde'') on August 2.  There, he was well-received by the Sultan of Malindi and dropped off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  Leaving behind  two ''degredados'', Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado, and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally began its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7, 1500.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

Cabral's armada famously discovered [[Brazil]] for the Portuguese crown along the way. By and large, the 2nd Armada's diplomatic mission to [[India]] failed, and provoked the opening of hostilities between the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and the feudal city-state of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]].  Nonetheless, it managed to establish a factory in the nearby [[Kingdom of Cochin]], the first Portuguese [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Asia.\n\n== Fleet ==\n\nThe [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first India Armada]], commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]], arrived in Portugal in the summer of 1499, in rather sorry shape. Half of his ships and men had been lost thanks to battles, disease, and storms. Although Gama came back with a hefty cargo of spices that would be sold at enormous profit, he had failed in the principal objective of his mission: to negotiate a treaty with [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], the spice entrep\u00f4t on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India. Gama managed, however, to open the [[Portuguese India Armadas|sea route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and secured good relations with the African city-state of [[Malindi]], a critical staging post along the way.\n\nOn the orders of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], arrangements were immediately made to begin the assembly of a second armada in [[Cascais]].  Determined not to repeat Gama's mistakes, this one was to be a large and well-armed fleet of 13 ships and 1500 men, laden with valuable gifts and diplomatic letters to win over the potentates of the east.\n\nMany details of the composition of the fleet are missing. Only three ship names are known, and there is some conflict among the sources on the captains.

Cabral had no notable naval or military experience; his appointment as ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major) of the armada was largely a political one.  The exiled [[Crown of Castile|Castillian]] nobleman [[Sancho de Tovar]] was designated vice-admiral (''soto-capit\u00e3o'') and Cabral's successor should anything happen to him.<ref group=note>This is according to Castanheda and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is. Gaspar Correia identifies Sim\u00e3o de Miranda as the predesignated successor instead.</ref>\n\nVeteran pilot [[Pedro Escobar]] was given the overall technical command of the expedition. Other veterans of the [[1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|first (1497) armada]] include captain [[Nicolau Coelho]], pilot [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]], and clerks Afonso Lopes and [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]].  The famed navigator [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who was the first to double the Cape of Good Hope back in 1488, and his brother [[Diogo Dias]], who had served as clerk on Gama's ship in the first expedition, also served as captains in the trip. \n\nMost of the ships were either [[carracks]] (''naus'') or [[caravels]], and at least one was a small supply ship, although details on names and tonnage are missing.<ref group=note>Castanheda (1551) claims there were ten carracks and three caravels. The Anonymous Pilot refers to only twelve ships, plus a supply ship.</ref>  At least two ships, Cabral's flagship and Tovar's ''El Rei'', were said to be around 240 tons, that is, about twice the size of the largest ship in the first armada three years prior.\n\nTen ships were destined for [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (Malabar, India), while the two ships headed by the Dias brothers were destined for [[Sofala]] in East Africa and the supply ship was destined to be scuttled and burnt along the way.<ref group=note>The Sofala destination of the Dias brothers is found in Castanheda (1551).  It is confirmed in the Anonymous Pilot.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro das Armadas).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\n\nAt least two ships were privately owned and outfitted: Lu\u00eds Pires's ship was owned by Diogo da Silva e Meneses, [[Count of Portalegre]], while Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha's ''Anunciada'' was owned by the king's cousin D. [[\u00c1lvaro of Braganza]], and financed by an Italian consortium composed of the Florentine bankers [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] and [[Girolamo Sernigi]] and the Genoese Antonio Salvago. The remainder belonged to the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese crown]].\n\nAccompanying the expedition as translator was [[Gaspar da Gama]], who was a Jew captured in Angediva by Vasco Gama, as well as four Hindu hostages from Calicut taken by Gama in 1498 during negotiations. Also aboard was the ambassador of the Sultan of Malindi, who had arrived at Portugal with Gama, and was set to return to Malindi with Cabral's expedition.\n\nOther passengers on the expedition included Aires Correia, the designated [[Factor (agent)|factor]] for Calicut, his secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], Afonso Furtado, the designated factor for Sofala, and clerk Martinho Neto.  Accompanying them on the trip was the royal physician and amateur astronomer, Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], who brought along the latest [[astrolabe]] and new Arabic astronomical staves for navigational experiments.  One chronicler suggests that the knight [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] was also aboard.<ref group=note>[[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]] is the chronicler responsible for this claim.  This is not substantiated elsewhere.  Greenlee (1938, p. li) and Diffie and Winius (1977, p. 188fn) dismiss the possibility.</ref>\n\nThe fleet carried some twenty Portuguese ''[[degredado|degredados]]'', who were criminal convicts who could fulfill their sentences by being abandoned along the shores of various places and exploring inland on the crown's behalf. Four of the degredados are known: Afonso Ribeiro, Jo\u00e3o Machado, Luiz de Moura, and Antonio Fernandes, who was also a ship carpenter. \n\nFinally, the fleet carried eight [[Franciscan]] friars and eight chaplains, under the supervision of the head chaplain, Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra. They were the first Portuguese Christian missionaries to India.\n\nThere are three surviving eyewitness accounts of this expedition: (1) an extended letter written by [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] (possibly dictated by Aires Correia), written from Brazil on May 1, 1500, to King Manuel I; (2) the brief letter by Mestre [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]] to the king, also from Brazil; and (3) the account of an anonymous Portuguese pilot, first published in Italian in 1507 (commonly referred to as the ''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Piloto An\u00f4nimo'', sometimes believed to be the clerk [[Jo\u00e3o de S\u00e1]]).\n\n== Mission ==\n\nCabral's instructions were several-fold. The priority was to secure a treaty with [[Zamorin]]'s [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal commercial entrep\u00f4t of the [[Kerala]] spice trade and dominant feudal city-state on the [[Malabar coast]] of [[India]]. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first armada had visited Calicut in 1498, but had failed to impress the elderly ruling Manivikraman Raja ('Samoothiri Raja'), the [[Zamorin of Calicut]]. As such, no agreements had been signed. Cabral's instructions were to succeed where Gama had failed, and to this end was entrusted with magnificent gifts to present to the Zamorin. Cabral was under orders to establish a ''feitoria'' ([[Factory (trading post)|factory]]) in Calicut, which would be placed under Aires Correia.\n\nThe second priority, assigned to the brothers [[Bartolomeu Dias|Bartolomeu]] and [[Diogo Dias]], was to search out the East African port of [[Sofala]], near the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] river.<ref>Anonymous Pilot, p. 107</ref> Sofala had been secretly visited and described by the explorer [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]] during his overland expedition a decade earlier (c. 1487), and he identified it as the endpoint of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade.  The Portuguese crown was eager to tap into that gold source, but Gama's armada had failed to find it.  The Dias brothers were instructed to find and establish a factory at Sofala under designated factor Afonso Furtado.  To this end, the brothers were likely also instructed to secure the consent of [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city-state of the East African coast and putative overlord of Sofala.  Like Sofala, Kilwa had been visited by Covilh\u00e3, but not by da Gama.\n\nA minor objective included the delivery of a group of [[Franciscan]] missionaries to India. It is said that Vasco da Gama had misinterpreted the [[Hinduism]] he saw practiced in India as a form of \"primitive\" Christianity.  He believed its peculiar characteristics were a result of centuries of separation from the mainstream church in Europe. As such, Gama recommended that missionaries be sent to India to help bring the practices of the \"Hindu church\" up to date with Roman Catholic orthodoxy.  To this end, a group of Franciscan friars, led by Fr. Henrique Soares of Coimbra, joined the expedition.\n\nAs a final objective, the Second Armada was also a commercial spice run. The crown and private merchants who had outfitted the ships expected full cargoes of spices to return to Lisbon. \n\n=== Suspected Brazilian mission ===\n\nThere has been some debate over whether [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] also had secret instructions from King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] to lay claim to the landmass of [[Brazil]]\u2014or, more precisely, to swing as far west as possible to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]] and claim whatever lands or islands might be discovered there for the Portuguese crown, before the Spanish did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peres |first=Dami\u00e3o |date=1949 |title=O descobrimento do Brasil por Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral: antecedentes e intencionalidade |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Among the pieces of evidence is an indication of an island in the area in a 1448 map of [[Andrea Bianco]], apparently alluded to in the letter of Master Jo\u00e3o Faras; there is also the suggestion by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in his ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' that he had been sent on an expedition to a western landmass in 1498.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pacheco Pereira |first=Duarte |date=c. 1505 |title=Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis |url=https://archive.org/details/esmeraldodesitu00peregoog/page/n62/mode/2up |chapter=Cap 2: Da cantidade & grandeza da terra, & daugua qual destas he a mayor parte. |language=Portuguese}}</ref> That is about the full extent of the evidence of intentionality and this claim is largely speculative.<ref>{{cite book|last=Greenlee |first=William Brooks |date=1938 |pages=l\u2013lv |title=The Voyage of Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to Brazil and India: from contemporary documents and narratives |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1409414485}}</ref> In particular, there is little evidence of any such instructions from the King, and there are various reasons to presume them unlikely.\n\nSpanish explorers had certainly been tending south lately. [[Christopher Columbus]] had touched the coast of the South American mainland around [[Guyana]] in 1498 on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Third voyage|third trip]]. In late 1499, [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had discovered much of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan]], with one of his squadrons, under [[Amerigo Vespucci]], who was exploring parts of what is now northern Brazil.  In early 1500, [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] and [[Diego de Lepe]], via generous southerly swings from the [[Canary islands]], had reached at least what is now modern [[Cear\u00e1]], perhaps as far east as [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape of Santo Agostinho]] in [[Pernambuco]]. They had explored much of the northern Brazilian coast west of it. It is possible that the southerly Spanish tendencies were deliberate, aimed at securing more land for the Spanish crown.<ref group=note>Although the person from whom the Spanish crown was trying to claim land was not the king of Portugal, as that was already mediated by Tordesillas, but Christopher Columbus, their own vice-roy of the Indies. Ojeda, Pinz\u00f3n, and Lepe were all dispatched on separate royal capitulations by [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez de Fonseca|Bishop Fonseca]], an enemy of Columbus, with the deliberate intent of finding and claiming lands ''outside'' (i.e., to the south) of the Columbus-owned West Indian islands, thereby circumscribing Columbus's viceroyalty and limiting him to the islands he already had. This would figure in later lawsuits by the Columbus family.</ref>\n\nHowever, these Spanish expeditions were much too recent for their results to have been known in Lisbon before Cabral's departure in March 1500; indeed, they were unknown in Spain itself\u2014at that moment, Ojeda was still in [[Hispaniola]], and Pinz\u00f3n and Lepe were still out at sea.  It is very doubtful that the Portuguese were aware of them.  Even if they were, it would not seem sensible to alter Cabral's large and heavy Second Armada, prepared for an important mission to India, to satisfy the pursuit some open-ended exploratory work in unknown waters which could have been far more efficiently accomplished by a smaller caravels. \n\n== Outward journey ==\n\n[[File:Cabral armada of 1500 (Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu).jpg|thumb|350px|Fleet of the 2nd India Armada (Cabral, 1500), from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nMarch 9, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's expedition, the 2nd India Armada of 13 ships, sets out from the Tagus.\n\nMarch 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches [[Cape Verde]] island of [[S\u00e3o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Nicolau]] in the middle of a storm.  The privately outfitted ship of Lu\u00eds Pires is too damaged by the tempest to continue, and returns to Lisbon<ref>According to Barros (1552, II.5.2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA386#v=onepage&q&f=false p.386]); also Castanheda (1551), G\u00f3is (1566).</ref> (Note: Caminha's letter (see below) makes no mention of Pires and instead reports that it was the crown ship of Vasco de Ataide was lost around Cape Verde.)\n\nFrom Cape Verde, Cabral strikes southwest.  The reasons for this unusual direction have been speculated upon endlessly. The most probable hypothesis is that Cabral was simply following the wide arc in the South Atlantic to catch a favorable wind to carry them to the Cape of Good Hope.\n\n[Navigationally, the arc is perfectly sensible: from Cape Verde, the ship cuts across the [[doldrums]] below the equator, catches the southwest-bound [[South Equatorial Current|equatorial drift]], turns into the southbound [[Brazil Current]] that will carry them down to the [[horse latitudes]] (30\u00b0S), where the prevailing [[westerlies]] begin.  The westerlies will then carry them quickly straight across the South Atlantic around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In almost all of this trajectory, the sailing ship is going with the current and usually upwind.  If instead of his arc, a ship attempts to strike southeast from Cape Verde, it will go into the [[Gulf of Guinea]], and from there to the Cape of Good Hope is a struggle\u2014it means sailing against the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, and fighting against the [[Benguela Current]] to go south\u2014a much slower and more painful route, especially for square-rigged heavy ships which cannot [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] easily.]\n\nHow did Cabral know about this arc?  The most probable answer is that this was precisely the route followed by Vasco da Gama on his first trip in 1497. The veterans of the first fleet\u2014notably the pilots [[P\u00earo de Alenquer]] and [[Pedro Escobar]]\u2014would very likely have charted the same route for Cabral again.<ref>That this arc was sailed by Gama in 1497 is uncertain, but most modern historians have come to accept that he did.  How did Gama know about the arc when no one had yet sailed it before?  Some have speculated that the Portuguese crown might have dispatched secret exploratory expeditions to those waters in advance.  But, in the more widely accepted hypothesis, first forwarded by admiral [[Gago Coutinho]], it is more straightforward: since [[Bartolomeu Dias]]'s 1488 expedition discovered the [[westerlies]], the South Atlantic arc became 'navigationally obvious' to any sensible pilot, especially pilots as experienced as Alenquer and Escobar. See Gago Coutinho (1951\u201352) ''A Nautica dos Descobrimentos: os descobrimentos maritimos visitos por um navegador'', 2 vols., Lisbon: Agencia Geral do Ultramar.</ref>  Indeed, in the Lisbon archives, there is a draft of a document based on Gama and intended for Cabral that gives the essential instruction: to strike in a southwesterly direction when he reaches the doldrums.<ref>After Cape Verde, where the wind is weak ('vento escasso') the ships should strike in the open ocean arc ('ir na volta do mar'), until the Cape of Good Hope, as this is the shorter route ('a navega\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 mais breve').  See Fonseca (1908: p.211; see also p.224) [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7lI4gqh7PsC&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q&f=false copy of letter]; see also Greenlee (1938: p.167)</ref>  The difference is that this time the arc was a little wider, Cabral went further west than Gama had, and as a result hit upon the hitherto unknown landmass of [[Brazil]].\n\nAlternative hypotheses forwarded for Cabral striking southwest have been (1.) that Cabral was trying to reach the [[Azores]] to repair his storm-battered fleet; (2.) that he was searching for and rounding up missing tempest-tossed ships; (3.) the hypothesis, already considered above, that it was an intentional attempt to discover if there was any land by the Tordesillas line.\n\n=== Discovery of Brazil ===\n{{Cleanup-tense|date=July 2012}}\nApril 21, 1500 \u2013 After nearly 30 days of sailing (44 since departure), on April 21 (a Tuesday in the [[octave of Easter]]),<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.225)</ref> Cabral's fleet finds the first indications of nearby land.\n\nApril 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada sights the Brazilian coast, seeing the outlines of a hill they name [[Monte Pascoal]] (some 60&nbsp;km south of modern [[Porto Seguro]], [[Bahia]]).\n\nApril 23, 1500 \u2013 The armada anchors at the mouth of the [[Do Frade River|Frade river]] and a group of local [[Tupiniquim]] Indians assembles on the beach. Cabral dispatches a small party, headed by [[Nicolau Coelho]], in a longboat ashore to make first contact.  Coelho tosses his hat in exchange for a feathered headdress, but the surf is too strong for a proper landing and opening of communication, and so they return to the ships.<ref>Fonseca (1908: p.241-42)</ref>\n\nApril 23\u201324, 1500 \u2013 Strong overnight winds on prompt the armada to lift anchor and sail some 10 leagues (45&nbsp;km) north, finding harbor behind the reef at Cabr\u00e1lia Bay, just north of [[Porto Seguro]].  The pilot Afonso Lopes goes [[Sounding line|sounding]] in a rowboat. He spies a native canoe, captures the two Indians on board, and brings them back to ship.  The language barrier prevents questioning, but they are fed and given cloth and beads. The cultural differences were staggering, fed with honey and cake, they spit them out and were deeply surprised with the sight of a chicken.<ref>Guia politicamente incorreto da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, Leandro Narloch</ref>\n\nApril 25, 1500 \u2013 The next day a party led by [[Nicolau Coelho]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] goes ashore, accompanied by the two natives.  Armed Tupiniquim warily approach the beach, but on a signal from the two natives, lay down their bows, and allow the Portuguese to land and collect water.\n\n[[File:Meirelles-primeiramissa2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The First Mass in Brazil'' by [[Victor Meirelles]] (1861).]]\nApril 26, 1500 \u2013 (Octave of Easter Sunday) Franciscan friar Henrique Soares of Coimbra goes ashore to celebrate mass, curiously watched by some 200 Tupiniquim Indians.  It is the first known Christian mass on the American mainland.\n\nFor much of the week, interaction between the Portuguese and the Tupiniquim gradually increases.  There is a brisk trade in European iron nails, cloth, beads and crucifixes in return for American amulets, spears, parrots and monkeys. There is only the slightest hint that precious metals might be found in the hinterlands. Portuguese ''[[degredado]]s'' are assigned to spend the night in Tupiniquim villages, while the remainder of the crews sleep aboard ships.\n\n[[File:Carta-caminha.png|thumb|150px|Facsimile of the letter of [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]] to  King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], reporting the discovery of the 'Island of the True Cross\" (Brazil)]]\nMay 1, 1500 \u2013 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral makes preparations to resume the journey to India. The Portuguese pilots, assisted by the physician-astronomer Master Jo\u00e3o Faras and his astronomical instruments, determine that the land lies east of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas line]], prompting Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral to formally claim Brazil for the Portuguese crown, bestowing upon it the name of ''Ilha de Vera Cruz'' (\"Island  of the True Cross\"\u2014later renamed ''Terra de Santa Cruz'', \"Land of the Holy Cross\", upon the realization that it is not an island).<ref>Gaspar Correia ([https://books.google.com/books?id=YmVKAAAAYAAJ&dq=editions%3ALCCN05022145&as_brr=1&pg=PA152#v=onepage&q&f=false p.152]) and Jo\u00e3o de Barros ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Epo2AAAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3AUOM39015057112644&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA391#v=onepage&q&f=false p.391]) say it was named \"Santa Cruz\" from the start, with Correia noting it was named so because May 3 (the departure date) was the [[Feast of the Cross]] on the liturgical calendar.  But the letters of Caminha and Mestre Jo\u00e3o are both signed as written from \"Vera Cruz\" on May 1.</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 1500, Cabral dispatches the supply ship (captained either by [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]\u2014chronicles conflict on this<ref>Jo\u00e3o de Barros (1552: p.390) and Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is (1566: p.69) say Gaspar de Lemos; Gaspar Correia (c.1550: p.152) says Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves.

It also carries a separate private letter to the king from Master [[Jo\u00e3o Faras]], in which he identifies the main guiding constellation in the southern hemisphere, the [[Southern Cross]] (''Cruzeiro'').<ref>Some sources claim that the ''Cruzeiro'' constellation had already been identified by [[Alvise Cadamosto]] in the 1450s</ref>  The supply ship will arrive in Lisbon in June.\n\nMay 3, 1500 \u2013 Leaving behind a couple of Portuguese ''degredados'' with the Tupiniquim of Porto Seguro,<ref>Anonymous Pilot [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCsOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false p.110]</ref> Cabral orders the eleven remaining ships to set sail and continue on their route to India.\n\n=== Crossing to India ===\n\nLate May, 1500 \u2013 After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral's armada reaches the [[Cape of Good Hope]].  The fleet faces headlong winds for six straight days. Four ships are lost at sea in the process\u2014most tragically, the Sofala-destined ship of [[Bartolomeu Dias]].  The famous navigator, the first to round the Cape back in 1488, fatally fails to round it this time. The three others are the crown-owned ships of Aires Gomes da Silva, Sim\u00e3o de Pina and Vasco de Ata\u00edde <ref>Castanheda (1551), Barros (1552) and G\u00f3is (1566) all identify the same four (B. Dias, A. Gomes da Silva, S. da Pina, V. d' Ata\u00edde) as lost at the Cape.  The ''Rela\u00e7ao das Naos'' mistakenly substitutes Sim\u00e3o de Miranda for Sim\u00e3o da Pina in the losses, although this is corrected in the marginal gloss. Gaspar Correia (1550) almost concurs\u2014but as he does not have Aires Gomes da Silva on his original captain list, he identifies the fourth ship lost as Gaspar de Lemos.   Analogously, the ''Livro de Lisuarte d'Abreu'' (1563), which doesn't have Pina nor Gomes da Silva on its list, say it was Diogo de Figueir\u00f3 and Luis Pires who were lost (in addition to Vasco d'Ata\u00edde and Bartolomeu Dias).  Diogo do Couto (c.1600) mistakenly adds P\u00earo d'Ataide to the list, bringing the losses to five.</ref> (if Ata\u00edde had not been lost earlier at Cape Verde, he is certainly lost now; some scholars contend Pires was lost now, and Ata\u00edde was lost earlier).  In any case, the fleet is reduced to seven ships.  Facing strong winds, the seven split into smaller groups, to meet again on the other side.  Cabral holds two ships together with his own.\n\nJune 16, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's battered three-ship squadron reaches the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (several leagues north of Sofala).  Two local merchant ships, catching sight of Cabral, take flight.  Cabral gives pursuit\u2014one of them runs aground and the other is captured.  Questioning quickly determines that these ships are owned by a cousin of the sultan Fateima of [[Malindi]] (who had received Vasco da Gama so graciously back in 1498), so they are released without harm.\n\nJune 22, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's three-ship squadron hobble on to [[Mozambique Island]].  Despite the earlier quarrel with Gama, Cabral is given an unexpectedly warm reception by the Sultan of Mozambique, and allowed to collect water and supplies.  Shortly after, three more ships of the 2nd Armada sail into Mozambique island and make junction with Cabral.  Only the ship of [[Diogo Dias]] (Bartolomeu's brother) remains missing.  As Dias's mission was for Sofala anyway, Cabral decides not to wait for it but rather to press on with his current fleet of six ships.\n\n[[File:Map of Cabral route, 1500.gif|thumb|340px|Approximate route of outward journey of Cabral's 2nd Armada (also route of stray ship of Diogo Dias)]]\nJuly 26, 1500 \u2013 Cabral's armada reaches the city-state of [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), the dominant city of the East African coast (which Gama had never visited).  Afonso Furtado, who had been appointed factor for Sofala back in Lisbon and mercifully escaped death (Furtado had been aboard Bartolomeu Dias's ship, but moved to the flagship just before the Cape crossing), goes ashore to open negotiations with the strongman ruler, Emir Ibrahim  [Note: There is no current ruling [[Kilwa Sultanate|Sultan of Kilwa]]\u2014the last one, al-Fudail, was deposed in a coup (c. 1495) by his minister, Emir Ibrahim, who had since ruled Kilwa with a vacant throne.]\n\nA meeting is arranged between Cabral and Emir Ibrahim, conducted on a couple of rowboats in Kilwa harbor.  Cabral presents a letter from King Manuel I proposing a treaty, but Emir Ibrahim is suspicious and, for all the formal pleasantries, resistant to the overtures.  Cabral, feeling there's nothing to be achieved here and worried about missing the [[monsoon]] winds to India, decides to break off the negotiations and sail on.\n\nAugust 2, 1500, Pressing north, the Cabral fleet avoid hostile [[Mombassa]] (''Momba\u00e7a'') and finally reach friendly [[Malindi]] (''Melinde'').  There he drops off the Malindi ambassador that Gama had taken the previous year.  The Sultan of Malindi gives Cabral an excellent reception. Leaving behind  two ''degredados'' (Lu\u00eds de Moura and Jo\u00e3o Machado) and picking up two Gujarati pilots, Cabral's six-ship armada finally begins its Indian Ocean crossing on August 7.\n\n== Cabral in India ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\nAugust 22, 1500 \u2013 After an uneventful ocean crossing, Cabral's six ships land in [[Anjediva Island]] (''Angediva'', Anjadip), where they rest and recuperate, repair and repaint the ships.\n\nSeptember 13, 1500 \u2013 Sailing down the Indian coast, Cabral's expedition finally reaches at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode, the capital of the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] kingdom of same name ruled by Zamorins, or Nediyuiruppu Swarupam). Gaily decorated native boats come out to greet them, but remembering Gama's experience, Cabral refuses to go ashore until hostages are exchanged.  He dispatches Afonso Furtado and the four Calicut hostages taken by Gama the previous year, to negotiate the details of the landing. This eventually done, Cabral finally goes ashore himself and meets new [[Zamorin]] of Calicut (the wary old Zamorin that Gama had met, had recently died). The Portuguese are better-prepared this time\u2014Cabral presents the young Zamorin with much finer and more luxurious gifts than Gama had brought, and more respectful and personalized letters of address from King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].\n\nA commercial treaty is successfully negotiated, and the Zamorin gives Cabral a security-of-trade certificate etched on a silver plate. The Portuguese are allowed to establish a ''[[Factory (trading post)|feitoria]]'' in Calicut and Aires Correia, the designated factor for Calicut, goes ashore with some 70 men. Once the factory is set up, Cabral releases the ship hostages as a sign of trust. Correia immediately sets about buying spices in Calicut's markets for the ships to take home.\n\nOctober (?), 1500 \u2013 Not long after, the Zamorin of Calicut dispatches a service request to Cabral's idling fleet. Arab merchants allied with rival city-state of [[Cochin kingdom]] are returning from [[Ceylon]] with a cargo of [[war elephants]] destined for the Sultan of [[Cambay]] (Khambhat, Gujarat).  Claiming it to be illegal contraband (and the Zamorin could probably use the elephants himself), Cabral is asked if he can intercept them.  Cabral sends one of his caravels, brimming with cannon, under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]] (nicknamed 'Inferno'), to capture it.  Hoping for a spectacle, the Zamorin himself comes down to the beachfront to witness the engagement, but leaves in disgust when the Arab ship deftly slips past Ataide.  But Ata\u00edde gives chase and eventually catches up with it near [[Kannur|Cannanore]] and successfully seizes the vessel.  Cabral presents the captured ship, with its nearly intact elephant cargo (one pachyderm was killed in the engagement), to the Zamorin as a gift.\n\n=== Calicut Massacre ===\n\nDecember 1500 \u2013 After two months of operation, factor Aires Correia has only been able to buy enough spices to load two of the ships. He complains to Cabral his suspicions that the [[guild]] of Arab merchants in Calicut have been [[collusion|colluding]] to shut out Portuguese purchasing agents from the city's spice markets which is not unlikely. Arab traders had reportedly used similar collusive tactics to drive out Chinese merchants earlier in the 15th century from various ports on the [[Malabar Coast]]. It would make sense if they tried doing so again\u2014particularly as the Portuguese had arrived trumpeting their hatred of 'the Moors' and demanding trading privileges and preferences, a clear danger to their own trade.\n\nHistorians cite murkier elements to this, in particular, that the Portuguese traders might have been unwitting counters in on-going quarrels between competing older and newer Arab merchant guilds in Calicut and or used as pawns in the personal power struggles among the Zamorin's leading advisors, etc. There were certainly more dimensions to this affair, the full details of which will likely never be clearly known.\n\nCabral presents the complaint to the Zamorin, and requests that he crack down on the Arab merchant guild or enforce Portuguese priority in the spice markets.  But the Zamorin refuses to intervene in the matter\u2014or rather makes only some vague promises, but disdains to get actively involved in the matter, as Cabral demands.\n\nDecember 17, 1500 \u2013 Frustrated by the Zamorin's inaction, Cabral decides to take matters into his own hands.  On the advice of Aires Correia, Cabral orders the seizure of an Arab merchant ship from [[Jeddah]], then loading up with spices in Calicut harbor, claiming that as the Zamorin had promised the Portuguese priority in the spice markets, the cargo is rightfully theirs.  Incensed, the Arab merchants around the quay immediately raise a riot in Calicut and direct mobs to attack the Portuguese factory.  The Portuguese ships, anchored out in the harbor and unable to approach the docks, helplessly watch the unfolding massacre.  After three hours of fighting, some 53 (some say 70) Portuguese are slaughtered by the mobs\u2014including the factor Aires Correia, the secretary [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], and three (some say five) of the Franciscan friars.  Around twenty Portuguese then in the city manage to escape the riot by jumping into the harbor waters and swimming to the ships.  The survivors report to Cabral that the Zamorin's own [[Hindu]] guards were seen either standing aside or actively helping the rioters.\n\nAt least one Portuguese, a man called Gon\u00e7alo Peixoto, survived the massacre, sheltered from the mob by a local merchant (whom the chronicles call \"Coja Bequij\").  In the aftermath, the wares in the Portuguese factory are impounded by the Calicut authorities.\n\n=== War with Calicut ===\n\nDecember 18\u201322, 1500 \u2013 Incensed at the attack on the factory, Cabral waits one day for redress by the Zamorin.  When this is not forthcoming, Cabral takes his revenge. The Portuguese seize around ten Arab merchant ships then in harbor, confiscating their cargoes, killing their crews, and burning their ships.  Then, accusing the Zamorin of sanctioning the riot, Cabral orders a full day [[shore bombardment]] of Calicut, doing immense damage to the unfortified city (estimates of Calicut casualties reach up to 600). Cabral proceeds to also bomb the nearby Zamorin-owned port of Pandarane (Pantalayani Kollam, near present-day [[Koyilandy]]) as well.<ref>The port of ''Pandarane'' has since vanished.  Its location is usually identified as 'Pantalyini Kollam', a port that has since been annexed by the growing city of [[Koyilandy]]; it is also sometimes identified with modern [[Kappad]]. (Dames, 1918: p.85)</ref>\n\nThus opened the war between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Zamorin of Calicut.  The war will drag on for the next decade.  Future [[Portuguese India Armadas]] have to contend with this conflict, it will dictate Portuguese strategy in the Indian Ocean and draw in other participants.  The conflict will also overturn the political order on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India, and shape a different future for [[Kerala]].\n\n=== Alliance with Cochin kingdom ===\n\n[[File:Kerala cities at time of Cabral (1500).gif|thumb|250px|India [[Malabar Coast]] c. 1500]]\nDecember 24, 1500 \u2013 Cabral leaves smoldering Calicut, unsure of what to do next. At the suggestion of [[Gaspar da Gama]] (the Goese Jew who had been accompanying the expedition), Cabral sets sail south along the coast towards [[Cochin kingdom]] (''Cochim'', Kochi or Perumpadappu Swarupam), a small [[Hindu]] [[Nair]] city-state at the outlet of the [[brackish]] [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]] lagoon in the Kerala backwaters. Half-in-vassalage and half-at-war with Zamorin's Calicut, Cochin kingdom had long chafed at the dominance of its larger neighbor and was looking for an opportunity to break away.\n\nArriving in Cochin, a Portuguese emissary, accompanied by a [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] picked up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], are set ashore to make contact with the Trimumpara Raja (Unni Goda Varma), the [[Nair]] [[Hindu]] prince of [[Cochin kingdom]].<ref>The exact status of the 'Trimumpara Raja', the ruling prince of Cochin, is a bit unclear.  It seems the formal ruler of Cochin was the king of [[Edapalli]], across the lagoon on the mainland, that the Cochinese peninsula (with capital at [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]]) had at some point been detached as an appanage for a son, who, in turn, had detached the northern tip, Cochin proper, for another son.  Moreover, it seems these appanages were not supposed to be permanent fiefs, but rather to serve as temporary 'training' grounds for princely heirs before they moved up in succession order.  In other words, the ruler of Cochin was the second heir of Edapalli.  Upon the death of the ruler of Edapalli, the first heir was supposed to leave the peninsula and take up his duties in Edapalli, and the second heir move from Cochin to Perumpadappu, and assign Cochin to his own successor (the new second heir). It seems the Portuguese arrived at a time when the princely heirs were somewhat at odds with each other\u2014possibly because of some violation in the rules of succession, or simply because the ruler of Cochin was tired of waiting for his turn. It is only  under Portuguese protection that the rulers of Cochin finally became proper kings in their own right.  Thus, the Raja Trimumpara's search for a Portuguese alliance have more to do with his own family quarrels than with the exactions of the Zamorin of Calicut.  See Dames (1918: p.86n).</ref> The Portuguese are greeted warmly\u2014the bombardment of hated Zamorin's Calicut outweighing the earlier matter of the war elephants.  All the cordialities and hostage-swapping quickly fulfilled, Cabral himself goes ashore and negotiates a treaty of alliance between Portugal and Cochin kingdom, directed against Zamorin's Calicut. Cabral promises to make the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin the ruler of kingdom of Calicut, upon the city's capture.\n\nA Portuguese factory is set up in Cochin, with Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa as chief factor (the pre-designated Aires Correia having perished in the Calicut Massacre). A smaller, poorer city, the spice markets of Cochin are not nearly as well supplied as Calicut, but the trade is good enough to begin loading ships.  The stay in Cochin is not without incident\u2014the factory is set ablaze one evening (probably at the instigation of Arab traders in the city), but the Trimumpara Raja will not countenance a repeat of the events of Calicut.  He cracks down on the arsonists, takes the Portuguese under his protection (the factors stay in his palace), and assigns his personal [[Nair]] guards to escort the Portuguese factors in the city's markets and protect the factory against any further incidents.\n\nEarly January 1501 \u2013 While in Cochin, Cabral receives missives from the rulers of [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur or Kolathunad, further north, another of Calicut's reluctant rivals) and [[Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam or Venad Swarupam, further south, once a great Syrian Christian merchant city-state, entrepot for cinnamon, ginger and dyewood).  They commend Cabral's actions against Zamorin's Calicut, and invite the Portuguese to trade in their cities instead. Not wishing to offend his gracious Cochinese host, Cabral politely declines the invitations, promising only to visit those cities at some future date.\n\nWhile still at Cochin, Cabral receives yet another invitation, this one from nearby [[Kodungallur Kovilakam|Cranganore kingdom]] (''Cranganor'', Kodungallur). Once a great city on the northern end of the Vembanad lagoon, capital of the [[Chera dynasty]] of [[Sangam period]], Cranganore had since fallen on hard times.  Mother nature delivered Cranganore two severe blows\u2014silting up the channels that connected Cranganore to the waterways, and breaking open a competing sea outlet by Cochin in the 14th century.<ref>Cochin was originally just a village along a long embankment.  Violent overflows of the [[Periyar River]] in 1341 forced the opening of the outlet between the Vembanad lagoon and the Arabian Sea at the juncture where Cochin now sits, separating the long Cochinese peninsula from what is now [[Vypin]] island. See Hunter's ''Imperial Gazetteer'' (1908: p.360).</ref> Cochin's rise had been principally due to the re-routing of commercial traffic away from Cranganore. Nonetheless, the remaining merchants of the dwindling city still maintained their old connections to the Kerala pepper plantations in the interior. Finding the supply in Cochin running low, Cabral takes up the offer to top up their cargo at Cranganore.\n\nThe visit to Cranganore turns out to be an eye-opener for the Portuguese, for among the city's remaining inhabitants are substantial established communities of [[Cochin Jews|Malabari Jews]] and [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christians]].  The encounter with a clearly recognizable Christian community in Kerala confirms to Cabral what the Franciscan friars had already suspected back in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]\u2014namely, that Vasco da Gama's earlier hypothesis about a 'Hindu Church' was mistaken. If real Christians have existed alongside Hindus in India for centuries, then clearly [[Hinduism]] must be a distinct and separate religion, 'heathen idolaters', as the Portuguese friars characterized them, rather than a 'primitive' form of Christianity.  Two Syrian Christian priests from Cranganore apply to Cabral for passage to Europe (one of them, known as Jos\u00e9 de Cranganore or Joseph the Indian (''Josephus Indus''), will provide instrumental intelligence about India to the Portuguese.<ref>Upon arrival in Lisbon, Joseph the Indian spent a couple of years being intensely interviewed by the Portuguese court and the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], relating to them his detailed knowledge of the history and geography of India and points east, expanding Portuguese intelligence dramatically.  It is likely that the detailed depiction of the east Indian coast and the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 is owed in large part to Joseph's information.  Around 1503, Joseph proceeded to Rome to meet [[Pope Alexander VI]] and report on the condition of the Malabari [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani|Syrian Christian]] church.  It was on this trip that Joseph dictated his famous narrative on India to an Italian scribe, which was eventually published in 1507 (in Italian) as part of a collection, ''Paesi Novamente Retrovati'', edited by Fracanzio da Montalboddo.  The narrative includes Joseph's own account of Cabral's expedition.  See Vallavanthara (2001).</ref>\n\nJanuary 16, 1501 \u2013 News arrives that the Zamorin of Calicut had assembled and dispatched a fleet of around 80 boats against the Portuguese in Cochin.  Despite the Trimumpara Raja of Cochin's offer of military assistance against the Calicut fleet, Cabral decides to precipitously lift anchor and slip away rather than risk a confrontation.  Cabral's armada leave behind the factor Gon\u00e7alo Gil Barbosa and six assistants in Cochin.  In their hasty departure, the Portuguese inadvertently take along two of the Trimumpara's officers (Idikkela Menon and Parangoda Mennon), who had been serving as noble hostages aboard the vessels.\n\nHeading north, Cabral's armada takes a wide sweep to avoid Calicut, and pays a quick visit to [[Kannur|Cannanore]].  Cabral is warmly received by the [[Kolathiri]] Raja of Cannanore who, eager for a Portuguese alliance, offers to sell the Portuguese spices on credit. Cabral accepts the cargo but pays him nonetheless (not a splendid cargo\u2014only low-quality ginger, as it turns out, but Cabral is appreciative of the gesture.)\n\nHis ships now filled with spices, Cabral decides not to visit [[Quilon]], as he had earlier promised, but to make way back home to Portugal.\n\n== Diogo Dias' misadventures ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nWhile Cabral's main fleet was in India, [[Diogo Dias]], captain of the missing seventh ship of the armada, was going through his own set of adventures.\n\n[[File:Detail of Diogo Dias's ship (Cabral Armada).jpg|thumb|180px|Ship of [[Diogo Dias]], detail from the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas'']]\nShortly after being separated from the main fleet at the Cape in June 1500, Dias had struck out too far east into the Indian Ocean and sighted the western coast of the island of [[Madagascar]].  Although the island was not unknown (its Arab name, \"island of the Moon\", was already reported by [[Pero de Covilha|Covilh\u00e3]]), Diogo Dias was the first Portuguese captain to have sighted it and is often credited with renaming it the island of ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'', on account of it being found on [[St. Lawrence]]'s day (August 10, 1500).  However, a proper landing on Madagascar would not be undertaken until 1506 and it would only be extensively explored in 1508.\n\nProbably thinking he was on a South African island, Diogo Dias tried to find the African coast by sailing straight north from Madagascar, hoping to reconnect with Cabral's armada there, or at least to make it to [[Sofala]] (Dias's formal destination).  But to no avail.  He had struck too far east, and was heading along north in open ocean.  Dias sighted the African coast only around [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''). By this time, Cabral had already crossed the Indian Ocean, and the change in the monsoon winds prevented Dias from undertaking his own crossing. Dias pushed up the coast, unexpectedly going past [[Cape Guardafui]] into the [[Gulf of Aden]], waters as yet unsailed by Portuguese ships.  Dias spent the next few months in the area\u2014trapped by contrary winds, battered by tempests, attacked by Arab pirates, and forced aground on the [[Eritrea]]n coast, in a desperate search for water and food.\n\nDias eventually (in late 1500 and early 1501) managed to procure supplies, repair his ship and catch a favorable wind to take him out of that harrowing trap.  With his remaining six crewmen, Dias set sail back to Portugal, hoping to catch Cabral's armada on the return journey.\n\n== Return journey ==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2020}}\nLate January, 1501 \u2013 Cabral takes aboard an ambassador from Cannanore, and starts his ocean crossing back to East Africa.  On the way, the Portuguese capture a  Gujarati ship, replete with a magnificent cargo.  They steal the cargo, but spare the crew, once they realize they are not Arabs.\n\nFebruary, 1501 \u2013 As Cabral's expedition approaches [[Malindi]], vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]], sailing at the front, runs his spice-laden ship, the ''El Rei'', aground on the Malindi coast.  Irreparable, the great ship is burnt (to recover the iron fittings) and the crews and the cargo reallocated.  Cabral's armada is now reduced to five ships. Cabral authorizes the king of Malindi to recover the cannons from the ''El Rei'' wreck and keep them for himself.\n\nSpring, 1501 \u2013 Cabral's fleet reaches [[Mozambique Island]].  As there is no sign or news from [[Diogo Dias]] awaiting him, Cabral realizes he must take responsibility for the Sofala mission himself.  Cabral orders the private ship ''Anunciada'' of Nuno Leit\u00e3o da Cunha, the fastest in the fleet, to be placed under the command of veteran hand [[Nicolau Coelho]], and dispatched ahead of the rest of the fleet and deliver the results of the voyage to Portugal.  Vice-admiral [[Sancho de Tovar]] (who had lost the ''El-Rei'') is given the chance to make amends by taking command of the caravel ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (hitherto commanded by [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]) and seek out Sofala and to proceed home alone from there.  Ata\u00edde is transferred to the command of Coelho's old nau.\n\nIn the meantime, Cabral lands a ''[[degredado]]'' Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes on the African coast, with letters of instruction for Diogo Dias and any passing Portuguese expeditions, informing them of the dramatic turn of events in India, and warning them to avoid Calicut.\n\n[It is uncertain exactly where Cabral left Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes or where he was ordered to go.  According to Ata\u00edde, Fernandes was ordered to go to Mombassa (odd, as Mombassa was then on hostile terms with the Portuguese); others suggest he was supposed to go to Kilwa (which is where the 3rd Armada of [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]] will find him). Others have speculated that Fernandes was left in Kilwa on the outward leg, and that Cabral's letters were dispatched to him by a local messenger from Mozambique on the return.  Another possibility is that Fernandes was instructed to make his way to Sofala overland, meet Tovar's ship there, and then proceed to explore inland from there to locate [[Monomatapa]] (but then why give him the letters?).  Finally, some conjecture Fernandes is being confused with another degredado, Jo\u00e3o Machado, who had been left in Malindi on the first leg, that he was picked up on the return, and now sent back once again with the letters.]\n\nMarch\u2013April, 1501 \u2013 Matters settled, Cabral takes the remaining three ships\u2014his own flagship, the large nau of Sim\u00e3o de Miranda and Coelho's ship (now under [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]])\u2014and sets sail out of Mozambique island.\n\nAta\u00edde gets separated from the other two in the [[Mozambique Channel]] soon after departure. He hurries to S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), hoping to find Cabral there waiting for him.  But he is out of luck\u2014Cabral and Miranda had decided to proceed on together towards Lisbon without him.  Not finding any trace of the others, Ata\u00edde decides to make his way home on his own, leaving behind a letter in a boot by a local watering hole giving an account of the expedition (Ataide's note will be found later that year by [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd Armada]]).\n\nIn the meantime, Sancho de Tovar, aboard the ''S\u00e3o Pedro'', finally sights [[Sofala]], the entrepot of Monomatapa gold.  He doesn't go ashore, and instead contents himself with scouting the city from his ship, and then sets sail back home alone.\n\n=== Conference at Bezeguiche ===\n\nJune 2, 1501 \u2013 Following up on the discovery of Brazil the previous year, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] had assembled a small exploratory expedition of three caravels under an unnamed Portuguese captain, and carrying the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine]] cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] aboard, to explore and map the coast of Brazil.  The exact identity of the captain is uncertain - some speculate it to be [[Gaspar de Lemos]] or [[Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves (explorer)|Andr\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves]], whichever of the two had commanded the supply vessel that had delivered the news in June 1500; others conjecture Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves went merely as passengers, and that the expedition itself was commanded by [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]].<ref>[[Amerigo Vespucci]] wrote two detailed accounts of this Brazilian mapping expedition - in ''Mundus Novus'' (pub. 1502/03) and as the \"third voyage\" in ''Lettera a Soderini'' (pub.1504/05) - but does not identify the Portuguese captain by name in either.  Chronicler [[Gaspar Correia]], writing a half-century later, identifies the mapping captain as the same captain who steered the returning supply ship - ergo the Lemos/Gon\u00e7alves identification.  Greenlee (1945) suggests the captain was [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]], although this has been dismissed by others (e.g. Roukema, 1963).  More recently, historians have drawn attention to a nautical chart by [[Vesconte de Maggiolo]], which identifies the Brazilian landmass with the label ''Tera de Gonsalvo Coigo Vocatur Santa Cruz'' (translated as \"Land of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] called Santa Cruz\").  [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]] is known to have led a later expedition to Brazil (which set out in 1503), but it is commonly estimated that Coelho was still out at sea when Maggiolo composed his chart (c. 1504-05), thereby suggesting Coelho might have also captained the previous 1501 mapping expedition as well. (Morison, 1974, vol. 2, p.281)</ref> Setting out from Lisbon in May 1501, the little Brazilian mapping expedition made a watering stop in early June at ''Bezeguiche'' (as the bay of [[Dakar]] (Senegal) was known to the Portuguese sailors of the time) and stumbles upon  [[Diogo Dias]] cooling his heels there. Dias relates to the Portuguese captain and Vespucci the tales of his misadventures\u2014how he had been separated from Cabral at the Cape, how he had ventured up to the Gulf of Aden, and, finding no trace of Cabral on his return, decided to wait for him in Bezeguiche. Just two days later, the lead ship of the returning India fleet\u2014the ''Anunciada'' under [[Nicolau Coelho]]\u2014sails into Bezeguiche, surprised to find both Dias and the Brazilian mapping expedition there (apparently  Bezeguiche must have been a pre-arranged point of encounter for the Second Armada).\n\nFor the next two weeks, the captains and crews of the different ships exchange tales of their travels and adventures.  It has been since speculated that it was during this time that Amerigo Vespucci came up with his \"[[New World]]\" hypothesis.  After all, Vespucci was quite familiar with the Americas, having participated in [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]]'s 1499 expedition to the coasts of South America, and it is said he had intense discussions at Bezeguiche with [[Gaspar da Gama]], the Goese Jew aboard Coelho's ship, undoubtedly the person most familiar with the East Indies. Comparing notes, it probably dawned on Vespucci that it was simply impossible to square what he knew of the Americas with what the men of the 2nd Armada knew of Asia.  While still at Bezeguiche, Vespucci wrote a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici (1463\u20131503)|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], relating his encounter, which he sends back with some Florentine passengers on the ''Anunciada''.<ref>Vespucci's 1501 letter is reproduced in Varnhagen (1865).   An English translation can be found in W.H.Greenlee (1938: p.152ff).</ref>  This was a prelude to an even more famous letter of Vespucci to Lorenzo in 1503, shortly after his return, where he finally asserts that the Brazilian landmass was in fact a continent, that the lands discovered to the west were definitely not part of Asia, but must be an entirely different continent, a \"[[New World]]\".<ref>Vespucci (1503). After leaving Bezeguiche, the mapping expedition would make landfall at [[Cape S\u00e3o Roque]] in August 1501, and proceeded to sail south along the Brazilian coast, possibly as far as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] coast. They returned to Lisbon before September 1502, perhaps as early as June. A second mapping expedition, this time more certainly under [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], also accompanied by Vespucci (his \"fourth voyage\"), set out for Brazil in April, 1503.</ref>\n\nMid-June, 1501 \u2013 Lemos & Vespucci leave Bezeguiche for Brazil. Shortly after, the pair [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda themselves reach Bezeguiche, where they find Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho awaiting them. Cabral sends Coelho's swift ''Anunciada'' ahead to Lisbon to announce their return, while the remainder rest and wait in Bezeguiche for the remaining two ships.  [[P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde]]'s ship (making his way alone from Mossel Bay) and [[Sancho de Tovar]]'s ''S\u00e3o Pedro'' (returning from Sofala) arrive in Bezeguiche by the end of June.\n\nJune 23, 1501 \u2013 The ''Anunciada'', commanded by [[Nicolau Coelho]], arrives in Lisbon and anchors in [[Bel\u00e9m]].  (Just as in case of Vasco da Gama's expedition, it turns out Nicolau Coelho is once again the first to deliver the news!)  The merchants of the consortium led by [[Bartolomeo Marchionni]] (who own the ''Anunciada'') are delighted.  Letters are immediately fired off throughout Europe announcing the results.\n\nThe news arrives too late for [[Jo\u00e3o da Nova]]'s [[3rd Portuguese India Armada (Nova, 1501)|3rd India Armada]], which departed for India in April.  But Nova will collect the necessary information along the way\u2014from the note in Ata\u00edde's shoe in Mossel Bay, and from Cabral's letters in the possession of Ant\u00f3nio Fernandes in Kilwa.\n\nJuly 21, 1501 \u2013 One month after Coelho's arrival, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral and Sim\u00e3o de Miranda, the two larger ships, finally arrive in Lisbon. The other three ships arrive a few days later: Sancho de Tovar and P\u00earo de Ata\u00edde on July 25 and the hapless Diogo Dias, with his empty caravel, on July 27.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Refimprove-section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Bernardelli - Monumento a Cabral.jpg|thumb|180px|Monument to [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in Lisbon, copy of a Brazilian monument by Rodolpho Bernardelli]]\nOn the surface, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's 2nd Armada had been a failure and the reaction was conspicuously muted.\n\nShip losses were very heavy. Of the thirteen ships sent out, only five returned with cargo (four crown, one private), five were lost at sea, three returned without cargo (Gaspar de Lemos, Lu\u00eds Pires and Diogo Dias).\n\nHuman losses were even more disheartening.  This included all the crews and captains of the four ships lost at the Cape (notably, the celebrated discoverer Bartolomeu Dias).  Another fifty-something Portuguese (including the factor Aires Correia) had been killed in the Calicut massacre.\n\nThen there were the mission failures.  Relative to the instructions given to him in Lisbon, Cabral had failed on nearly every count:\n*1. failed to establish a treaty with the Zamorin of Calicut\u2014indeed, Calicut was now more hostile than ever.\n*2. failed to establish a factory at Calicut (massacred);\n*3. failed to bring the 'Hindu Church' in line (the friars that survived reported the Hindus weren't Christians after all, just 'idolaters');\n*4. failed to make a treaty with Kilwa;\n*5. failed to establish a factory at Sofala (seen from afar by Tovar, but that is all).\n\nOn the other hand, in his defense, Cabral could point to some positive achievements.\n\n*1. opening of friendly relations with Cochin, Canannore and Quilon;\n*2. a factory in Cochin, poorer than Calicut perhaps, but workable;\n*3. discovery of true Christian communities in Cranganore, etc.;\n*4. Sofala was at least discovered and scouted;\n*5. discovery of Brazil, which might serve as a useful staging post for future India runs;\n*6. Diogo Dias's discovery of Madagascar and exploration of the African coast up to Cape Guardafui and the Gulf of Aden was useful information.\n*7. Finally, Cabral did bring back tons of spices, which were off-loaded into the Lisbon warehouses and sold at no small profit for the crown treasury.\n\nHowever, it was the ship and human losses that weighed heavily against Cabral being honored or rewarded. Allegations of 'incompetence' flew easily in the circles that mattered. Although Cabral was initially offered the command of the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]], scheduled for 1502, it seemed more like a ''pro forma'' gesture than a sincere offer.<ref>Subrahmanyam (1997: p.191)</ref> The crown made it clear that Cabral's command would be limited and supervised \u2013 conditions humiliating enough to force Cabral to withdraw his name.  The 4th Armada would be placed under the command of Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlthough the reaction of Portuguese court opinion in 1501, on Cabral's return, was generally low, it ascended retrospectively.  Cabral's discovery of Brazil, initially received as a minor discovery of little interest, turned out to be much more momentous.  The follow-up Brazilian mapping expeditions of 1501-02 and 1503-04, under the captaincy of [[Gon\u00e7alo Coelho]], carrying the Florentine cosmographer [[Amerigo Vespucci]], revealed a massive continent - which Vespucci famously labelled a \"[[New World]]\" (''Mundus Novus'').  The plentitude of [[brazilwood]] (''pau-brasil'') discovered by the mapping expeditions on its shores lured the interest of European cloth industry, and led to the 1505 contract granted to [[Fern\u00e3o de Loronha]] for the commercial exploitation of Brazil. The lucrative brazilwood trade eventually drew competition from French and Spanish interlopers, forcing the Portuguese government to take a more active interest in Cabral's \"[[Name of Brazil|Land of Vera Cruz]]\", finally leading to the establishment of the first Portuguese colonies in [[Colonial Brazil]] in 1532.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Carta de P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]]\n* [[Portuguese India Armadas]]\n* [[Portuguese India]]\n* [[Alternative theory of the European discovery of Brazil]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note |30em}}\n\n== References == \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n'''Eyewitness Accounts'''\n\n* [Anonymous Pilot] \"Navigationi del Capitano Pedro Alvares Cabral Scrita per un Piloto Portoghese et Tradotta di Lingua Portoghese in Italiana\", first published in Francanzano Montalbado, 1507, editor, ''Paesi novamente retrovati et Novo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato'', Vicenza.

He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].\n\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].\n\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\n[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]\nBorn in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].\n\nIn 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.\n\n==Provincial administrator, 1837\u20131843==\n[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]\nOn 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />\n\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=31}}\n\nPecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=37}}\n\n==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==\n[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]\nIn 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\n\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].\n\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=52}}\n\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>\n\n==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878==\n\n===Papal assistant===\n[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>K\u00fchne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\n\n===Provincial council===\nPecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\n\n===Charitable activities===\n[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]\nPecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n===Defending the papacy===\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=105}}\n\n===Organizing the First Vatican Council===\nOn 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\n\nDuring the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=129}}\n\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard.

It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.\n\n(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)\n\n==Papacy, 1878\u20131903==\n{{Social teachings of the popes}}\n[[File:Vatican Observatory 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Silver medal celebrating the 1891 Pope Leo XIII's inauguration of the new observatory]]\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII 1898.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Photogram of the 1896 film ''Sua Santit\u00e1 papa Leone XIII'', the first time a Pope appeared on film.]]\n[[File:XIII.Leop\u00e1pa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]\n\nAs soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.

Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.\n\nWhile Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\n\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nLeo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nAmong the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878.

In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=S\u00e6pe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops.

Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev.

In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>\n\n====Thomism====\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism\u2014the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas\u2014as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\n\nFollowing this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.\n\n====Consecrations====\n[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863\u20131899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\n\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\n\n====Scriptures====\nIn his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\n\n====Theological research====\n[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>\n\n====Mariology====\n{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}\nHis predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].\n\n====Social teachings====\n{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\n\n=====Church and state=====\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=====''Rerum novarum''=====\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1900]]\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].\n\n===Canonizations and beatifications===\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\n* 8 December 1881: [[Clare of Montefalco]] (d. 1308), [[John Baptist de Rossi]] (1696\u20131764), [[Lawrence of Brindisi]] (d. 1619), and [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] (1748\u201383)\n* 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the [[Servite Order]], [[Peter Claver]] (1581\u20131654), [[John Berchmans]] (1599\u20131621), and [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]] (1531\u20131617)\n* 27 May 1897: [[Anthony Maria Zaccaria|Antonio Maria Zaccaria]] (1502\u201339) and [[Peter Fourier]] (1565\u20131640)\n* 24 May 1900: [[John Baptist de la Salle]] (1651\u20131719) and [[Rita of Cascia]] (1381\u20131457)\n\nLeo XIII also beatified several of his predecessors: [[Urban II]] (14 July 1881), [[Victor III]] (23 July 1887) and [[Innocent V]] (9 March 1898).

Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope.

Lewis Pecci'''}}; 2 March 1810 \u2013 20 July 1903) was the visible head of the [[Catholic Church]] from 20 February 1878 to his death. He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].\n\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].\n\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\n[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]\nBorn in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].\n\nIn 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.\n\n==Provincial administrator, 1837\u20131843==\n[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]\nOn 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />\n\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=31}}\n\nPecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=37}}\n\n==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==\n[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]\nIn 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\n\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].\n\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=52}}\n\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>\n\n==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878==\n\n===Papal assistant===\n[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>K\u00fchne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\n\n===Provincial council===\nPecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\n\n===Charitable activities===\n[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]\nPecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n===Defending the papacy===\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=105}}\n\n===Organizing the First Vatican Council===\nOn 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\n\nDuring the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=129}}\n\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard. '' Life of Leo XIII'', Charles L. Webster & Company, New York, 1887]</ref>\n\n===Papal conclave, 1878===\n{{Main|Papal conclave, 1878}}\nPope Pius IX died on 7 February 1878,<ref name=Oreilly /> and during his closing years, the Liberal press had often insinuated that the [[Kingdom of Italy]] should take a hand in the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] and occupy the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]] and the sudden death of [[Victor Emmanuel II]] (9 January 1878) distracted the government's attention.\n\nIn the conclave, the cardinals faced varied questions and discussed issues like [[church-state relations (Catholic Church)|church\u2013state relations]] in Europe, specifically Italy, divisions in the church, and the status of the First Vatican Council. It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.\n\n(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)\n\n==Papacy, 1878\u20131903==\n{{Social teachings of the popes}}\n[[File:Vatican Observatory 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Silver medal celebrating the 1891 Pope Leo XIII's inauguration of the new observatory]]\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII 1898.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Photogram of the 1896 film ''Sua Santit\u00e1 papa Leone XIII'', the first time a Pope appeared on film.]]\n[[File:XIII.Leop\u00e1pa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]\n\nAs soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.  When he firmly re-asserted the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] doctrine that science and religion co-exist, he required the study of [[Thomas Aquinas]]<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |title=Aeterni Patris&nbsp;\u2013 On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy |publisher=Catholic forum |type=encyclical |date=4 August 1879 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225040233/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0256dd.htm |archivedate=25 February 2007 }}.</ref> and opened the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to qualified researchers, among whom was the noted historian of the Papacy [[Ludwig von Pastor]]. He also re-founded the [[Vatican Observatory]]\n\"so that everyone might see clearly that the Church and her Pastors are not opposed to true and solid science, whether human or divine, but that they embrace it, encourage it, and promote it with the fullest possible devotion.\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |title=Ut Mysticam |language=Latin |date=14 March 1891}}.</ref>\n\nLeo XIII was the first Pope of whose voice a [[sound recording]] was made.

Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.\n\nWhile Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\n\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nLeo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

In his first [[papal consistory|consistory]] in 1879, he elevated his older brother, [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]], to the cardinalate. He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nAmong the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878.

In [[British India]], too, Leo established a Catholic hierarchy in 1886, and regulated some long-standing conflicts with the Portuguese authorities.  A Papal Rescript (20 April 1888) condemned the Irish [[Plan of Campaign#Papal Encyclical 1888|Plan of Campaign]] and all clerical involvement in it as well as boycotting, followed in June by the Papal encyclical \"Saepe Nos\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Pecci |first=Vincenzo Gioacchino Raffaele Luigi |author-link=Pope Leo XIII |publisher=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm |title=S\u00e6pe nos |language=Latin}}.</ref> that was addressed to all the Irish bishops.

Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev.

In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>\n\n====Thomism====\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism\u2014the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas\u2014as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\n\nFollowing this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.\n\n====Consecrations====\n[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863\u20131899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\n\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\n\n====Scriptures====\nIn his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\n\n====Theological research====\n[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>\n\n====Mariology====\n{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}\nHis predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].\n\n====Social teachings====\n{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\n\n=====Church and state=====\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=====''Rerum novarum''=====\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1900]]\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].\n\n===Canonizations and beatifications===\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\n* 8 December 1881: [[Clare of Montefalco]] (d. 1308), [[John Baptist de Rossi]] (1696\u20131764), [[Lawrence of Brindisi]] (d. 1619), and [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] (1748\u201383)\n* 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the [[Servite Order]], [[Peter Claver]] (1581\u20131654), [[John Berchmans]] (1599\u20131621), and [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]] (1531\u20131617)\n* 27 May 1897: [[Anthony Maria Zaccaria|Antonio Maria Zaccaria]] (1502\u201339) and [[Peter Fourier]] (1565\u20131640)\n* 24 May 1900: [[John Baptist de la Salle]] (1651\u20131719) and [[Rita of Cascia]] (1381\u20131457)\n\nLeo XIII also beatified several of his predecessors: [[Urban II]] (14 July 1881), [[Victor III]] (23 July 1887) and [[Innocent V]] (9 March 1898).

Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope.

{"title_page": "Southern Caribbean", "text_new": "{{Coord missing|Trinidad and Tobago}}\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Update|date=October 2010}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Southern Caribbean''' is a group of islands that neighbor mainland South America in the [[West Indies]]. [[Saint Lucia]] lies to the north of the region, [[Barbados]] in the east, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] at its southernmost point, and [[Aruba]] at the most westerly section.\n\n==Physical geography of the region==\nThe Southern Caribbean has the Caribbean to the north and west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the [[Gulf of Paria]] to the south. Most of the islands are in the [[windward islands]] chain and the (former) [[Netherlands Antilles]].\n\nGeologically, the islands are referred to as being a sub-continent of North America, although most islands sit on the South American continental plate. All of the Southern Caribbean islands are small, and are either volcanic or made of limestone coral, as they form at the ridge of the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates.\n\nThe majority of the islands are covered in tropical rainforests and swamps; the densest of these are in Grenada, [[St Lucia]], and [[Tobago]]. Various other islands' rainforests have decreased in size over the last century due to deforestation.\n\nDue to the close proximity of the equator, the Southern Caribbean has all year around tropical weather. Islands such as [[Aruba]] and [[Barbados]] occasionally suffer droughts, while [[Grenada]] receives a great deal of rainfall.  Dry seasons on Aruba and Barbados may occur even while Grenada is receiving rain.\n\n==Countries==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Country\n!Capital\n!Population\n|-\n|[[Aruba]]\n|[[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]\n|103,484\n|-\n|[[Barbados]]\n|[[Bridgetown]]\n|294,210\n|-\n|[[Cura\u00e7ao]]\n|[[Willemstad]]\n|183,000\n|-\n|[[Grenada]]\n|[[St. George's, Grenada|St George's]]\n|103,000\n|-\n|[[Saint Lucia]]\n|[[Castries]]\n|170,000\n|-\n|[[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]\n|[[Kingstown]]\n|125,000\n|-\n|[[Trinidad and Tobago]]\n|[[Port of Spain]]\n|1,328,019 <ref name=\"Census 2011\">[http://www.cso.gov.tt/sites/default/files/content/images/census/TRINIDAD%20AND%20TOBAGO%202011%20Demographic%20Report.pdf Trinidad and Tobago 2011 Population and Housing Census Demographic Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230527/http://www.cso.gov.tt/sites/default/files/content/images/census/TRINIDAD%20AND%20TOBAGO%202011%20Demographic%20Report.pdf |date=May 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n|-\n|\n|''Total:''\n|2,306,713\n|}\n\n;Associates:\n:{{Flagicon|Colombia}}  [[Colombia]]\n:{{Flagicon|Guyana}}    [[Guyana]]\n:{{Flagicon|Venezuela}} [[Venezuela]]\n\n== History ==\nThe Caribbean had been inhabited for about 7000 years by the [[Arawaks]], [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], [[Ta\u00ednos]] and their ancestors, who came to the Southern Caribbean on canoes from South America (primarily [[Venezuela]]).<ref name=\"Reid\">Reid, Basil A. ''Myths and Realities of Caribbean History'', University of Alabama Press, 2009.</ref> In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European explorers and colonizers arrived. The Europeans replaced virtually the entire population of the native tribes through various means. The natives disappeared due to various reasons, including diseases brought in by Europeans to which they had no immunity, warring, enslavement and the removal of the natural resources upon which these tribes depended.<ref name=\"Reid\" /> European countries then made the Caribbean islands part of their respective empires. Most of these islands were disputed and fought over by European empires, such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[The Netherlands]]:\n\n*Spain claimed: [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]] (Briefly).\n*Portugal claimed: [[Barbados]].\n*France claimed: [[Saint Lucia]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], Trinidad and Tobago (Briefly).\n*Britain claimed: Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia.\n*Netherlands claimed: [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]].\n\nEventually all of the islands in the region except the Dutch islands Aruba and Netherlands Antilles were occupied by the British, who were in control from the 18th century onwards. The various islands declared their independence during the 1960s. The Dutch Caribbean islands are still part of Holland and none have yet declared full independence. Trinidad & Tobago was the first nation in the Southern Caribbean to become independent in 1962, followed by Barbados in 1966. All of the islands (except the Dutch Antilles) were part of the [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 until its dissolution in 1962.\n\n== Culture ==\nLike other Caribbean nations, the Southern Caribbean island states share similar cultures. Cricket is widely enjoyed in the region and rum is the local drink. African traditions are primarily influential on these islands, particularly in Grenada and St Lucia and Indian Traditions in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. Influences from the European cultures are heavily based in Barbados and the former Netherlands Antilles. Other than English, the main language, [[French-based creole languages|French creole]], [[Portuguese creole]], Dutch, Spanish, and [[Papiamento]] are also spoken in the region, as well as [[Hindi]].\n\n==Demographics==\nThe Southern Caribbean is very diverse, with over 70% of its population of [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] descent, who originated from West Africa and were brought to the Caribbean as slaves to work on plantations. Indo-Caribbeans originally from India and [[Bangladesh]] are primarily in [[Trinidad]], although large numbers can also be found in Barbados and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], many more live on the other islands too. [[Chinese people|Chinese]] arrived in the region as laborers from [[Hong Kong]], and are found on most islands. [[European ethnic groups|European]]s are found all over the West Indies due to colonization of the region by countries such as France, Spain, United Kingdom, [[The Netherlands]], and Portugal. French Creoles may be found inhabiting the islands of St Lucia, [[Trinidad]] and Grenada; while [[Portuguese people]] make up a sizeable group of Barbados' European population - numbering over 2,000 - third in size to the English and [[Irish people]] on the island. Spanish people settled on Trinidad and still have small numbers of descendants, while the [[Dutch people]] have a strong influence on [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Neighbouring South America has had a massive influence on the ethnic diversity of the Southern Caribbean. Many Brazilian mulattoes and Brazilian Jews went to Barbados, where their descendants still live. Many Venezuelans arrive in Trinidad, Barbados, and [[Aruba]] each year, and many [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] and [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] people migrate to the Southern Caribbean along with many [[Guyana|Guyanese]]. In addition, the area receives a lot of expatriates from the US, Canada, and Europe.\n\n==Music==\nEach island has its own musical flair and individuality, but musically [[Soca music|soca]] is the most dominant of the English-speaking islands in the region. Invented in Trinidad, the closest islands, Barbados and Grenada, were the first islands to promote and produce the music out of Trinidad & Tobago. Since the 1960s, many other islands have been promoting their styles of music, such as [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[St Kitts & Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], [[Dominica]], and [[Jamaica]] (although to a much lesser extent). The [[steel pan]], a famous symbol of the Caribbean, was invented in Trinidad also during the 1940s, during [[World War II]]. Many oil drums from the USA had been transported to Trinidad, and there, an inspired musician moulded the base in order to make a drum. It now is a universally recognized symbol of Trinidad and Tobago and the West Indies.\n\n===Island music===\n'''Barbados''' - Soca-Samba: A fusion of Brazilian [[Samba]] and [[Soca music]]. Samba was introduced to Barbados by [[Afro-Brazilian]]s. The music had never really been produced by Bajan artists until in 1999 when [[Square One (band)|Square One]] released \"Faluma\", spoken in the language of the Saamaka tribe in Suriname, a song featuring the Soca-Samba bass. Rupee had also produced \"Jump\", which had a soca-samba essence (although some argue it is pure soca). Barbados also produced [[Rihanna]], one of the Caribbean's more famous international artists, as well as [[Rupee (musician)|Rupert Clarke]] (Rupee) and [[Alison Hinds]].\n\n'''Grenada''' - Grenadian Calypso: Derived from neighbouring Trinidad & Tobago, Grenadian music uses many African drums in their music, such as the \"Big Drum\", which arrived in Grenada when enslaved Africa were brought to the island by British and French colonizers. Carriacou has similar music to that of the French West Indies. [[Boula (music)|Boula]] music is a type of music made using hand drums from old rum casks.\n\n'''St Lucia''' - Soca and calypso music are St Lucia's main types of music, just as in Trinidad and the Eastern Caribbean islands. St Lucia also holds a jazz festival; many U.S artists perform there. St Lucia is the number one island to produce [[zouk]] music featuring the French [[accordion]] with various percussion instruments.\n\n'''Trinidad & Tobago''' - Soca: A fusion of soul and its predecessor calypso gave the name soul-calypso (or shortened as soca). Used in traditional carnivals, its features are a quick tempo with bass, hi-hat, bongo, and tassa drums, just as are used in Soca, as well as guitars. Trinidad's famous steel-pan music is made from oil drums, and is also used in carnivals. Trinidad has contributed artists such as [[Machel Montano]], [[Destra Garcia]], [[Calypso Rose]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[David Rudder]].\n\n==Sport==\nCricket is the major sport in the Southern Caribbean. Barbados is a hub for cricket fans and sportsmen, with legendary Sir [[Garfield Sobers]] and [[Clyde Walcott]] hailing from the island. [[Brian Lara]] from [[Trinidad]] is also a key player in the [[West Indies cricket team]]. In 2007, the West Indies region hosted the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]]. Apart from [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[Jamaica]], and [[St Kitts & Nevis]], all other matches were played in the Southern Caribbean in [[Queen's Park Oval]],  Trinidad, [[Beausejour Stadium]], St Lucia, [[Queen's Park, Grenada]], and the final held at the [[Kensington Oval]] (seats 28,000), in Barbados.\n\nFootball (or called soccer in the USA) is the second sport in the area, after Trinidad & Tobago was the first team in the Southern Caribbean (and third in the Caribbean after Haiti and Jamaica), to qualify for the World Cup. They were the  Caribbean favourites in the 1974 World Cup Qualifiers but lost out to Haiti under questionable officiating. Again coming close to qualifying for the 1990 World Cup, The \"Soca Warriors fell by a single goal to the always powerful USA team despite only needing a draw to qualify.  The \"Soca Warriors\" were knocked out in the group stages as they competed in Group B along with [[England]], [[Sweden]],   and [[Paraguay]], at the [[2006 World Cup]] in Germany.  Trinidad and Tobago are still the smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup in football.\n\n[[Netball]], [[Hockey]], and [[Volleyball]] are also competitive sports in the region, although are not as widely recognized as are Cricket and [[Soccer]]. [[Golf]] is a sport which is mainly based in Barbados' [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane]] resort, which hosted the World Golf Championships-World Cup in 2006. [[Tennis]] and [[badminton]] are on the steady increase in Barbados and Trinidad & Tobago, but they occasionally send national teams to the [[Commonwealth Games]]. [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] is a well established category of sport in the Southern Caribbean in both the [[Olympics]] and the [[Commonwealth games]]. Sprinters hailing from the Southern Caribbean include [[Obadele Thompson]] of Barbados, who won Bronze at a 100m sprint at the Sydney Olympic Games; [[Ato Boldon]] of Trinidad & Tobago, who won Silver at the 100m sprint at the Sydney Olympic Games; [[Marc Burns]] of Trinidad & Tobago, who won Bronze at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games; Trinidad's 1976 [[Montreal]] Olympics Gold Medallist [[Hasely Crawford]]; and Grenada's [[Alleyne Francique]], who ran the 400m sprint and won the silver medal at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games (2006). During the 2008 [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]], Trinidad & Tobago earned a silver medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 m men's relay, coming second to fellow West Indian island, [[Jamaica]].\n\n==Diaspora of the Southern Caribbean==\nThere are over two million people involved in the Southern Caribbean diaspora. Grenada has more expatriates than any other island in the region, and with most leaving the island for the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US, although some migrate to nearer countries such as [[Trinidad]] and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. Trinidad has a growing diaspora to Canada, mostly to [[Toronto]], that has contributed the Toronto Caribana in the city. The Trinidadian diaspora is only second in size to the Jamaican diaspora in Canada from the Caribbean. Grenada and Guyana are two nations whose populations are migrating elsewhere, as the two countries are some of the least developed countries in the Americas. Many Guyanese have chosen the nearby island of Barbados, and many people on the island have Guyanese relatives or relations. Other than that, the Guyanese have settled in England (mostly London) and Canada, similar to Vincentians and St Lucians. Barbados has the least migration as it's developing a successful economy, and the living conditions are better than in some other Southern Caribbean countries. However, after World War II, many Barbadians moved to the USA ([[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]), Canada, and primarily the UK. It has a smaller diaspora compared to its neighbouring islands, however.  Arubans most often migrate to the Netherlands or the US, but a small portion migrate to Canada or Venezuela. Many black British and mixed race people have Southern Caribbean heritage, and a few possess dual heritage of two Caribbean nations. Mostly with Jamaica, (Jamaican/Trinidadian), (Jamaican/Bajan), (Jamaican/Grenadian), and to a lesser extent, a mixture of the Southern nations, (Bajan/Guyanese), (Trini/Grenadian), and (Trini/Bajan). In the United Kingdom, parts of Canada, and the US, Caribbean independence days are held in cities and are celebrated by people of Caribbean descent.\n\n==Jamaica vs \"The Smallies\"==\nIn the US, Canada, and the UK, the non-Anglophone Caribbean community is mixed with many from the [[Languages of the Caribbean#English|Anglophone Caribbean]] community. Some cases of segregation have arisen among West Indian people, however, which causes a commonly found rivalry between people from the larger island of Jamaica and those from the smaller \"Smallie\" islands of the Southern Caribbean. From the 1960s to the 1980s, many Jamaicans would not associate with someone from Trinidad/Barbados/Grenada, and vice versa. Tensions between the regions originate from the days of slavery, as both regions blame each other for \"selling them out\" to Europeans. During the 1960s-1980s, this racial tension reached a high point as many Caribbean people were discouraged from intermingling with those from other nations. They were even encouraged to marry only their \"own people\", that is, Jamaican man with a Jamaican woman, Trinidadian man with a Trinidadian woman and so forth.\n\nHowever, it was not frowned upon for a Southern Caribbean person to marry another Southern Caribbean person (Trinidadian man with a Barbadian woman), as they classed themselves the same (unlike the Jamaicans). Jamaicans coined the term \"Smallie\" (meaning \"small Islander\") as a derogatory word used for Trinidadians, Barbadians, Grenadians, Vincentians, and St Lucians, as well as Kittians and Antiguans. For people who were not Jamaican, the Jamaican use of the term \"Smallies\" helped create a stereotype of Jamaicans being sneaky, common, and violent. This rift was well known in London until the [[Brixton Riots (disambiguation)|Brixton Riots]] united the black Caribbean population, which now has a growing number of bi-national Caribbean descendants. Friendlier rivalry now occurs, such as the soca vs. reggae rivalry, which recently escalated between Jamaica's [[I Wayne]] and Trinidad's [[Bunji Garlin]], after I Wayne labeled soca \"Devil music\".

[[Saint Lucia]] lies to the north of the region, [[Barbados]] in the east, [[Trinidad and Tobago]] at its southernmost point, and [[Aruba]] at the most westerly section.\n\n==Physical geography of the region==\nThe Southern Caribbean has the Caribbean to the north and west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the [[Gulf of Paria]] to the south. Most of the islands are in the [[windward islands]] chain and the (former) [[Netherlands Antilles]].\n\nGeologically, the islands are referred to as being a sub-continent of North America, although most islands sit on the South American continental plate. All of the Southern Caribbean islands are small, and are either volcanic or made of limestone coral, as they form at the ridge of the Caribbean and South American tectonic plates.\n\nThe majority of the islands are covered in tropical rainforests and swamps; the densest of these are in Grenada, [[St Lucia]], and [[Tobago]]. Various other islands' rainforests have decreased in size over the last century due to deforestation.\n\nDue to the close proximity of the equator, the Southern Caribbean has all year around tropical weather. Islands such as [[Aruba]] and [[Barbados]] occasionally suffer droughts, while [[Grenada]] receives a great deal of rainfall.  Dry seasons on Aruba and Barbados may occur even while Grenada is receiving rain.\n\n==Countries==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Country\n!Capital\n!Population\n|-\n|[[Aruba]]\n|[[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]]\n|103,484\n|-\n|[[Barbados]]\n|[[Bridgetown]]\n|294,210\n|-\n|[[Cura\u00e7ao]]\n|[[Willemstad]]\n|183,000\n|-\n|[[Grenada]]\n|[[St. George's, Grenada|St George's]]\n|103,000\n|-\n|[[Saint Lucia]]\n|[[Castries]]\n|170,000\n|-\n|[[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]\n|[[Kingstown]]\n|125,000\n|-\n|[[Trinidad and Tobago]]\n|[[Port of Spain]]\n|1,328,019 <ref name=\"Census 2011\">[http://www.cso.gov.tt/sites/default/files/content/images/census/TRINIDAD%20AND%20TOBAGO%202011%20Demographic%20Report.pdf Trinidad and Tobago 2011 Population and Housing Census Demographic Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230527/http://www.cso.gov.tt/sites/default/files/content/images/census/TRINIDAD%20AND%20TOBAGO%202011%20Demographic%20Report.pdf |date=May 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n|-\n|\n|''Total:''\n|2,306,713\n|}\n\n;Associates:\n:{{Flagicon|Colombia}}  [[Colombia]]\n:{{Flagicon|Guyana}}    [[Guyana]]\n:{{Flagicon|Venezuela}} [[Venezuela]]\n\n== History ==\nThe Caribbean had been inhabited for about 7000 years by the [[Arawaks]], [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], [[Ta\u00ednos]] and their ancestors, who came to the Southern Caribbean on canoes from South America (primarily [[Venezuela]]).<ref name=\"Reid\">Reid, Basil A. ''Myths and Realities of Caribbean History'', University of Alabama Press, 2009.</ref> In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European explorers and colonizers arrived. The Europeans replaced virtually the entire population of the native tribes through various means. The natives disappeared due to various reasons, including diseases brought in by Europeans to which they had no immunity, warring, enslavement and the removal of the natural resources upon which these tribes depended.<ref name=\"Reid\" /> European countries then made the Caribbean islands part of their respective empires. Most of these islands were disputed and fought over by European empires, such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and [[The Netherlands]]:\n\n*Spain claimed: [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]] (Briefly).\n*Portugal claimed: [[Barbados]].\n*France claimed: [[Saint Lucia]], [[Grenada]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], Trinidad and Tobago (Briefly).\n*Britain claimed: Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia.\n*Netherlands claimed: [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]].\n\nEventually all of the islands in the region except the Dutch islands Aruba and Netherlands Antilles were occupied by the British, who were in control from the 18th century onwards. The various islands declared their independence during the 1960s. The Dutch Caribbean islands are still part of Holland and none have yet declared full independence. Trinidad & Tobago was the first nation in the Southern Caribbean to become independent in 1962, followed by Barbados in 1966. All of the islands (except the Dutch Antilles) were part of the [[West Indies Federation]] from 1958 until its dissolution in 1962.\n\n== Culture ==\nLike other Caribbean nations, the Southern Caribbean island states share similar cultures. Cricket is widely enjoyed in the region and rum is the local drink. African traditions are primarily influential on these islands, particularly in Grenada and St Lucia and Indian Traditions in Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana. Influences from the European cultures are heavily based in Barbados and the former Netherlands Antilles. Other than English, the main language, [[French-based creole languages|French creole]], [[Portuguese creole]], Dutch, Spanish, and [[Papiamento]] are also spoken in the region, as well as [[Hindi]].\n\n==Demographics==\nThe Southern Caribbean is very diverse, with over 70% of its population of [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] descent, who originated from West Africa and were brought to the Caribbean as slaves to work on plantations. Indo-Caribbeans originally from India and [[Bangladesh]] are primarily in [[Trinidad]], although large numbers can also be found in Barbados and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], many more live on the other islands too. [[Chinese people|Chinese]] arrived in the region as laborers from [[Hong Kong]], and are found on most islands. [[European ethnic groups|European]]s are found all over the West Indies due to colonization of the region by countries such as France, Spain, United Kingdom, [[The Netherlands]], and Portugal. French Creoles may be found inhabiting the islands of St Lucia, [[Trinidad]] and Grenada; while [[Portuguese people]] make up a sizeable group of Barbados' European population - numbering over 2,000 - third in size to the English and [[Irish people]] on the island. Spanish people settled on Trinidad and still have small numbers of descendants, while the [[Dutch people]] have a strong influence on [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. Neighbouring South America has had a massive influence on the ethnic diversity of the Southern Caribbean. Many Brazilian mulattoes and Brazilian Jews went to Barbados, where their descendants still live. Many Venezuelans arrive in Trinidad, Barbados, and [[Aruba]] each year, and many [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] and [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] people migrate to the Southern Caribbean along with many [[Guyana|Guyanese]]. In addition, the area receives a lot of expatriates from the US, Canada, and Europe.\n\n==Music==\nEach island has its own musical flair and individuality, but musically [[Soca music|soca]] is the most dominant of the English-speaking islands in the region. Invented in Trinidad, the closest islands, Barbados and Grenada, were the first islands to promote and produce the music out of Trinidad & Tobago. Since the 1960s, many other islands have been promoting their styles of music, such as [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[St Kitts & Nevis]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], [[Dominica]], and [[Jamaica]] (although to a much lesser extent). The [[steel pan]], a famous symbol of the Caribbean, was invented in Trinidad also during the 1940s, during [[World War II]]. Many oil drums from the USA had been transported to Trinidad, and there, an inspired musician moulded the base in order to make a drum. It now is a universally recognized symbol of Trinidad and Tobago and the West Indies.\n\n===Island music===\n'''Barbados''' - Soca-Samba: A fusion of Brazilian [[Samba]] and [[Soca music]]. Samba was introduced to Barbados by [[Afro-Brazilian]]s. The music had never really been produced by Bajan artists until in 1999 when [[Square One (band)|Square One]] released \"Faluma\", spoken in the language of the Saamaka tribe in Suriname, a song featuring the Soca-Samba bass. Rupee had also produced \"Jump\", which had a soca-samba essence (although some argue it is pure soca). Barbados also produced [[Rihanna]], one of the Caribbean's more famous international artists, as well as [[Rupee (musician)|Rupert Clarke]] (Rupee) and [[Alison Hinds]].\n\n'''Grenada''' - Grenadian Calypso: Derived from neighbouring Trinidad & Tobago, Grenadian music uses many African drums in their music, such as the \"Big Drum\", which arrived in Grenada when enslaved Africa were brought to the island by British and French colonizers. Carriacou has similar music to that of the French West Indies. [[Boula (music)|Boula]] music is a type of music made using hand drums from old rum casks.\n\n'''St Lucia''' - Soca and calypso music are St Lucia's main types of music, just as in Trinidad and the Eastern Caribbean islands. St Lucia also holds a jazz festival; many U.S artists perform there. St Lucia is the number one island to produce [[zouk]] music featuring the French [[accordion]] with various percussion instruments.\n\n'''Trinidad & Tobago''' - Soca: A fusion of soul and its predecessor calypso gave the name soul-calypso (or shortened as soca). Used in traditional carnivals, its features are a quick tempo with bass, hi-hat, bongo, and tassa drums, just as are used in Soca, as well as guitars. Trinidad's famous steel-pan music is made from oil drums, and is also used in carnivals. Trinidad has contributed artists such as [[Machel Montano]], [[Destra Garcia]], [[Calypso Rose]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[David Rudder]].\n\n==Sport==\nCricket is the major sport in the Southern Caribbean. Barbados is a hub for cricket fans and sportsmen, with legendary Sir [[Garfield Sobers]] and [[Clyde Walcott]] hailing from the island. [[Brian Lara]] from [[Trinidad]] is also a key player in the [[West Indies cricket team]]. In 2007, the West Indies region hosted the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]]. Apart from [[Antigua & Barbuda]], [[Jamaica]], and [[St Kitts & Nevis]], all other matches were played in the Southern Caribbean in [[Queen's Park Oval]],  Trinidad, [[Beausejour Stadium]], St Lucia, [[Queen's Park, Grenada]], and the final held at the [[Kensington Oval]] (seats 28,000), in Barbados.\n\nFootball (or called soccer in the USA) is the second sport in the area, after Trinidad & Tobago was the first team in the Southern Caribbean (and third in the Caribbean after Haiti and Jamaica), to qualify for the World Cup. They were the  Caribbean favourites in the 1974 World Cup Qualifiers but lost out to Haiti under questionable officiating. Again coming close to qualifying for the 1990 World Cup, The \"Soca Warriors fell by a single goal to the always powerful USA team despite only needing a draw to qualify.  The \"Soca Warriors\" were knocked out in the group stages as they competed in Group B along with [[England]], [[Sweden]],   and [[Paraguay]], at the [[2006 World Cup]] in Germany.  Trinidad and Tobago are still the smallest nation to ever qualify for the World Cup in football.\n\n[[Netball]], [[Hockey]], and [[Volleyball]] are also competitive sports in the region, although are not as widely recognized as are Cricket and [[Soccer]]. [[Golf]] is a sport which is mainly based in Barbados' [[Sandy Lane (resort)|Sandy Lane]] resort, which hosted the World Golf Championships-World Cup in 2006. [[Tennis]] and [[badminton]] are on the steady increase in Barbados and Trinidad & Tobago, but they occasionally send national teams to the [[Commonwealth Games]]. [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] is a well established category of sport in the Southern Caribbean in both the [[Olympics]] and the [[Commonwealth games]]. Sprinters hailing from the Southern Caribbean include [[Obadele Thompson]] of Barbados, who won Bronze at a 100m sprint at the Sydney Olympic Games; [[Ato Boldon]] of Trinidad & Tobago, who won Silver at the 100m sprint at the Sydney Olympic Games; [[Marc Burns]] of Trinidad & Tobago, who won Bronze at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games; Trinidad's 1976 [[Montreal]] Olympics Gold Medallist [[Hasely Crawford]]; and Grenada's [[Alleyne Francique]], who ran the 400m sprint and won the silver medal at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games (2006). During the 2008 [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]], Trinidad & Tobago earned a silver medal in the 4 \u00d7 100 m men's relay, coming second to fellow West Indian island, [[Jamaica]].\n\n==Diaspora of the Southern Caribbean==\nThere are over two million people involved in the Southern Caribbean diaspora. Grenada has more expatriates than any other island in the region, and with most leaving the island for the United Kingdom, Canada, and the US, although some migrate to nearer countries such as [[Trinidad]] and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. Trinidad has a growing diaspora to Canada, mostly to [[Toronto]], that has contributed the Toronto Caribana in the city. The Trinidadian diaspora is only second in size to the Jamaican diaspora in Canada from the Caribbean. Grenada and Guyana are two nations whose populations are migrating elsewhere, as the two countries are some of the least developed countries in the Americas. Many Guyanese have chosen the nearby island of Barbados, and many people on the island have Guyanese relatives or relations. Other than that, the Guyanese have settled in England (mostly London) and Canada, similar to Vincentians and St Lucians. Barbados has the least migration as it's developing a successful economy, and the living conditions are better than in some other Southern Caribbean countries. However, after World War II, many Barbadians moved to the USA ([[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]), Canada, and primarily the UK. It has a smaller diaspora compared to its neighbouring islands, however.  Arubans most often migrate to the Netherlands or the US, but a small portion migrate to Canada or Venezuela. Many black British and mixed race people have Southern Caribbean heritage, and a few possess dual heritage of two Caribbean nations. Mostly with Jamaica, (Jamaican/Trinidadian), (Jamaican/Bajan), (Jamaican/Grenadian), and to a lesser extent, a mixture of the Southern nations,(Bajan/Guyanese),(Trini/Grenadian), and (Trini/Bajan). In the United Kingdom, parts of Canada, and the US, Caribbean independence days are held in cities and are celebrated by people of Caribbean descent.\n\n==Jamaica vs \"The Smallies\"==\nIn the USA, Canada, and the UK, the non-Anglophone Caribbean community is mixed with many from the [[Languages of the Caribbean#English|Anglophone Caribbean]] community. Some cases of segregation have arisen among West Indian people, however, which causes a commonly found rivalry between people from the larger island of Jamaica and those from the smaller \"Smallie\" islands of the Southern Caribbean. From the 1960s to the 1980s, many Jamaicans would not associate with someone from Trinidad/Barbados/Grenada, and vice versa. Tensions between the regions originate from the days of slavery, as both regions blame each other for \"selling them out\" to Europeans. During the 1960s-1980s, this racial tension reached a high point as many Caribbean people were discouraged from intermingling with those from other nations. They were even encouraged to marry only their \"own people\", that is, Jamaican man with a Jamaican woman, Trinidadian man with a Trinidadian woman and so forth.\n\nHowever, it was not frowned upon for a Southern Caribbean person to marry another Southern Caribbean person (Trinidadian man with a Barbadian woman), as they classed themselves the same (unlike the Jamaicans). Jamaicans coined the term \"Smallie\" (meaning \"small Islander\") as a derogatory word used for Trinidadians, Barbadians, Grenadians, Vincentians, and St Lucians, as well as Kittians and Antiguans. For people who were not Jamaican, the Jamaican use of the term \"Smallies\" helped create a stereotype of Jamaicans being sneaky, common, and violent. This rift was well known in London until the [[Brixton Riots (disambiguation)|Brixton Riots]] united the black Caribbean population, which now has a growing number of bi-national Caribbean descendants. Friendlier rivalry now occurs, such as the soca vs. reggae rivalry, which recently escalated between Jamaica's [[I Wayne]] and Trinidad's [[Bunji Garlin]], after I Wayne labeled soca \"Devil music\". Other than that, the two regions challenge each other to who can \"wuk up\" the best.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Caribbean South America]]\n*[[ABC Islands (Leeward Antilles)|ABC Islands]]\n*[[Lesser Antilles]]\n*[[Spanish Main]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070406055746/http://www.cruisecritic.com/ports/article.cfm?ID=70 Fun Facts: Southern Caribbean]\n\n{{Caribbean topic}}\n{{Caribbean topics}}\n\n[[Category:Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Geography of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Regions of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Geography of Aruba]]\n[[Category:Geography of Barbados]]\n[[Category:Geography of Bonaire]]\n[[Category:Geography of Grenada]]\n[[Category:Geography of Cura\u00e7ao]]\n[[Category:Geography of Saint Lucia]]\n[[Category:Geography of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]\n[[Category:Geography of Trinidad and Tobago]]\n[[Category:Geography of South America]]\n", "name_user": "Danielt998", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: ,( \u2192 , ( (2),typo(s) fixed: the USA \u2192 the US", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Caribbean"}
