At $90 million, it was meant to be a modern replacement of its current cross-street neighbor, The MECCA (now the [[UW\u2013Milwaukee Panther Arena]]), built in 1950. The arena was built as an attempt to attract an [[expansion team|expansion franchise]] for the [[National Hockey League]], though this never occurred, and the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]]'s [[Milwaukee Admirals]] (later moving to the [[American Hockey League]]) used the arena for the majority of its existence. The MECCA, during much of its time operating as an NBA facility, had the league's smallest seating capacity, holding just over 11,000 people.  Funds to build the Center were donated as a gift to the State of Wisconsin by broadcaster/Admirals owner [[Lloyd Pettit]] and his wife, [[Jane Bradley Pettit]], in memory of Jane's late father, [[Harry Lynde Bradley]] of the [[Allen-Bradley]] company.\n\nDespite being one of the premier NBA facilities when completed in 1988, it was one of the oldest active [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] arenas by the end of the Bucks' tenancy in 2018, only behind [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, and [[Oracle Arena]] in Oakland, though both had been renovated during the Bradley Center's lifetime, and the latter was replaced by the [[Chase Center (San Francisco)|Chase Center]] in [[San Francisco]] in 2019. The donation from the Pettits did not include provisions for the building's long-term capital needs or annual operating expenses. While the facility was self-sufficient, its tenants had been at a disadvantage compared with other NBA teams due to the arrangement in the arena's later years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bradley Center a Home-Court Disadvantage |first=Don |last=Walker |url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/36087854.html |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=December 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor several years, former Bucks owner and former U.S. Senator [[Herb Kohl]] proposed constructing a new, state-of-the-art downtown arena, but the community reaction to the idea of a publicly funded arena was mostly negative. In 2009, Wisconsin Governor [[Jim Doyle]] included a provision in the state's capital budget seeking $5 million in state bonding support to renovate the Bradley Center.  The Bradley Center's board of directors told state officials that the building needs $23 million in renovations, so they reportedly agreed to raise the remaining $18 million on their own.<ref>{{cite news |title=Doyle Budget Includes Help for Bradley Center |first=Don |last=Walker |url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/41916182.html |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |date=March 26, 2009 |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, the arena's longtime Sony [[Jumbotron]] scoreboard was replaced with a new 3.5-million-pixel LED unit manufactured by TS Sports and Lighthouse Technologies, and was put into service in October 2010 at the start of the Admirals season.

At $90 million, it was meant to be a modern replacement of its current cross-street neighbor, The MECCA (now the [[UW\u2013Milwaukee Panther Arena]]), built in 1950. The arena was built as an attempt to attract an [[expansion team|expansion franchise]] for the [[National Hockey League]], though this never occurred, and the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]]'s [[Milwaukee Admirals]] (later moving to the [[American Hockey League]]) used the arena for the majority of its existence. The MECCA, during much of its time operating as an NBA facility, had the league's smallest seating capacity, holding just over 11,000 people.  Funds to build the Center were donated as a gift to the State of Wisconsin by broadcaster/Admirals owner [[Lloyd Pettit]] and his wife, [[Jane Bradley Pettit]], in memory of Jane's late father, [[Harry Lynde Bradley]] of the [[Allen-Bradley]] company.\n\nDespite being one of the premier NBA facilities when completed in 1988, it was one of the oldest active [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] arenas by the end of the Bucks' tenancy in 2018, only behind [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, and [[Oracle Arena]] in Oakland, though both had been renovated during the Bradley Center's lifetime, and the latter was replaced by the [[Chase Center (San Francisco)|Chase Center]] in [[San Francisco]] in 2019. The donation from the Pettits did not include provisions for the building's long-term capital needs or annual operating expenses. While the facility was self-sufficient, its tenants had been at a disadvantage compared with other NBA teams due to the arrangement in the arena's later years.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bradley Center a Home-Court Disadvantage |first=Don |last=Walker |url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/36087854.html |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=December 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFor several years, former Bucks owner and former U.S. Senator [[Herb Kohl]] proposed constructing a new, state-of-the-art downtown arena, but the community reaction to the idea of a publicly funded arena was mostly negative.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a progressive [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air Line cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson has been a controversial figure in British journalism and politics. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]].

the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a progressive [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008, he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and the [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|Emirates Air Line cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.
