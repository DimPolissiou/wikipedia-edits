Ghani influenced many generations of Persian-and Urdu writing poets in South Asia including Mir Taqi Mir, Ghalib and most importantly, [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]]. Ghani's \"forte\" lies in creating delightful poetic images, usually by stating an abstract idea in the first hemistich and following it up with a concrete exemplification in the other. He also stands out for his multi-layered poems, which exploit the double meaning of words.\n\nAnother name is the Sheikh Yaqub Sarfi (1521-1595), a 16th-century Sufi poet-philosopher who was internationally acknowledged and who had for students, amongst others, well-known religious scholar [[Ahmad Sirhindi]] (more particularly, he taught him [[Hadith studies|hadith]])<ref>Anna Zelkina, ''In Quest for God and Freedom: The Sufi Response to the Russian Advance in the North Caucasus'', C.

Of course, Kashmiri Pandits too played a role in that school, and one exceptional case was [[Pandit Taba Ram Turki]] (1776\u20131847), who was a celebrity as far as Central Asia.\n\n==Writers in Urdu==\n\nDespite being a numerically reduced community (less than one million), the [[Kashmiri Pandits]] are over-represented in their contribution to Urdu literature. One important early example is [[Daya Shankar Kaul Nasim]] (1811\u20131845), a renowned Urdu poet of the 19th century, and hundreds of others followed his path.<ref>Shri Ram Bakshi, ''Kashmir: Valley and Its Culture'', Sarun & Son (1997), p. 165</ref>\n\nSome eminent Urdu literary personalities of Kashmiri origins (from both the Valley and the diaspora) include (in [[chronological]] order):\n*Mir Tafazzul Hussain Khan Kashmiri (1727-1800), originally from [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir]],<ref>Hamid Afaq Qureshi, ''The Mughals, the English & the rulers of Awadh, from 1722 A.D. to 1856 A.D.'', New Royal Book Co (2003), p.79</ref><ref>Amaresh Misra, ''Lucknow, fire of grace: the story of its revolution, renaissance and the aftermath'', HarperCollins Publishers India (1998), p. 57</ref><ref>Purnendu Basu, ''Oudh and the East India Company, 1785-1801'', Maxwell Company (1943), p. 22</ref> born in [[Sialkot]]<ref>[[Simon Schaffer]], ''The Brokered World: Go-Betweens and Global Intelligence, 1770-1820'', Science History Publications (2009), p. 53</ref> where his parents moved and himself based in [[Lucknow]] where he served as [[Prime Minister]] (or ''diwan'') to the [[Nawab of Oudh]] [[Asaf-ud-Daula]] thanks his erudition.

Ghani influenced many generations of Persian-and Urdu writing poets in South Asia including Mir Taqi Mir, Ghalib and most importantly, [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]]. Ghani's \"forte\" lies in creating delightful poetic images, usually by stating an abstract idea in the first hemistich and following it up with a concrete exemplification in the other. He also stands out for his multi-layered poems, which exploit the double meaning of words.\n\nAnother name is the Sheikh Yaqub Sarfi (1521-1595), a 16th-century Sufi poet-philosopher who was internationally acknowledged and who had for students, amongst others, well-known religious scholar [[Ahmad Sirhindi]] (more particularly, he taught him [[Hadith studies|hadith]])<ref>Anna Zelkina, ''In Quest for God and Freedom: The Sufi Response to the Russian Advance in the North Caucasus'', C.

Of course, Kashmiri Pandits too played a role in that school, and one exceptional case was [[Pandit Taba Ram Turki]] (1776\u20131847), who was a celebrity as far as Central Asia.\n\n==Writers in Urdu==\n\nDespite being a numerically reduced community (less than one million), the [[Kashmiri Pandits]] are over-represented in their contribution to Urdu literature. One important early example is [[Daya Shankar Kaul Nasim]] (1811\u20131845), a renowned Urdu poet of the 19th century, and hundreds of others followed his path.<ref>Shri Ram Bakshi, ''Kashmir: Valley and Its Culture'', Sarun & Son (1997), p. 165</ref>\n\nSome eminent Urdu literary personalities of Kashmiri origins (from both the Valley and the diaspora) include (in [[chronological]] order):\n*Mir Tafazzul Hussain Khan Kashmiri (1727-1800), originally from [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir]],<ref>Hamid Afaq Qureshi, ''The Mughals, the English & the rulers of Awadh, from 1722 A.D. to 1856 A.D.'', New Royal Book Co (2003), p.79</ref><ref>Amaresh Misra, ''Lucknow, fire of grace: the story of its revolution, renaissance and the aftermath'', HarperCollins Publishers India (1998), p. 57</ref><ref>Purnendu Basu, ''Oudh and the East India Company, 1785-1801'', Maxwell Company (1943), p. 22</ref> born in [[Sialkot]]<ref>[[Simon Schaffer]], ''The Brokered World: Go-Betweens and Global Intelligence, 1770-1820'', Science History Publications (2009), p. 53</ref> where his parents moved and himself based in [[Lucknow]] where he served as [[Prime Minister]] (or ''diwan'') to the [[Nawab of Oudh]] [[Asaf-ud-Daula]] thanks his erudition.

Their god [[Huitzilopochtli]] told them to go and look for a promised land. They first arrived around the territory known as [[Culiac\u00e1n]] by 960&nbsp;CE, but then left and returned to Aztlan.<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/> Wandering from Aztlan again around the year \"1 Tecpatl\" or 1064\u201365 according to the codices [[Codex Chimalpahin|Chimalpahin]], [[Codex Aubin|Aubin]] and the [[Anales de Tlalteloco]], they soon arrived at [[P\u00e1tzcuaro]]. They thought that was the land promised to them by Huitzilopochtli, but the god told them to continue. They went east and arrived at [[Chapultepec]], on the edge of what was then [[Lake Texcoco]]. The god told them that their promised land was close but that they would have to fight for it. Their first opponent was a chief named C\u00f3pil, son of a witch named [[Malinalxochitl]] and sister of Huitzilopochtli. The Mexica surrounded C\u00f3pil's forces, captured and sacrificed the chief's heart to Huitzilopochtli.<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/>\n[[File:FundacionMexicoDF.JPG|thumb|Nineteenth-century Painting of the Foundation of Tenochtitlan by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Jara]]]]\nHowever, their arrival was still opposed by the lords of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]], [[Tlacopan]], [[Coyoac\u00e1n]] and [[Colhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]]. At first they tried diplomacy to convince the Mexica to leave. The Mexica fought these lords and lost, retreating to a place called Acocolco and hid in the marshes, becoming subjects of a people named the Colhuas. Two years later, the Colhuas asked the Mexicas to fight with them against [[Xochimilco]]. While the Mexica impressed the Colhuas with their battle skills, they were expelled again when they sacrificed the hearts of their captives to Huitzilopochtli. They went to Tizapan. After that, they wandered the rim of Lake Texcoco. The migration lasted around 260 years; from 1064 to 1065 to 1325.\n[[File:MoctezumaChapultepec.JPG|thumb|left|Moctezuma in Chapultepec by Daniel del Valle]]\nThe god indicated that they were getting closer when they arrived at a place called [[Nexticpan]], which is where the [[San Antonio Abad Hospital]] is now, and later to a place called Mixiuhcan, now the colonia of [[Magdalena Mixiuhcan]]. They wandered another 36&nbsp;years knowing that they were extremely close. Then they sent two priests named [[Axol\u00f3hua]] and [[Cuauhcoatl]] to look for the sign promised by their god. The two found an islet near the western shore of Lake Texcoco surrounded by green water. In the middle of the islet was a [[nopal]] and perched upon it was an eagle with its wings spread and its face looking toward the sun. When the eagle left, Axol\u00f3hua submerged himself into the waters around the island and Cuaucoatl went back to report what he saw. The people were confused because what the two priests had seen was only part of the sign they were told to expect. Twenty-four hours later Axol\u00f3hua returned stating that while underwater, he saw the god [[Tlaloc]] who told him that they did indeed find the place and that they were welcome. They moved to the islet and began to construct their city. Later versions of the story have a snake in the eagle's mouth. The Mexica called their city Tenochtitlan meaning \"place of the nopal,\" referring to the myth of its discovery. [[Gongora]] gives the day 18 July 1327, but at least three other codices (Azcatitlan, Mexicanus and Mendoza) placed the time of its founding in the year 1325, and los Anales de Tlatelolco adds the day-sign \"1 Zipaktli,\" correlated to the beginning of [[summer solstice]] on 20 June.\n\n===Tenochtitlan at its height===\n[[File:Aztec Empire c 1519.png|thumb|extent of Aztec empire]]\nThirteen years after the founding of Tenochtitlan, the population of the islet had grown and there was internal strife.  A portion of the population left and went to the nearby island of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], establishing a monarchy there, with their first ruler being [[Acamapitzin]].  Shortly thereafter, the people of Tenochtitlan had their own monarchy. The two cities became rivals. Eventually, Tenochtitlan conquered Tlatelolco eliminating its rulers and incorporated the city into Tenochtitlan and was named Mexico which some natives didn't like.<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/>\n\nAt its height, just before the Spanish arrived, Tenochtitlan was the center of the vast Aztec Empire, stretching from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts and south towards the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] and [[Oaxaca]]. With a vast income of tribute, Tenochtitlan grew to become one of the largest and richest urban areas in the world at that time. The city had services and infrastructure that was unheard of in the rest of the world: potable water brought in by aqueducts, drainage systems and wide, paved streets. Their markets boasted of products from nearly every part of [[Mesoamerica]].<ref name=\"ciudadmexico\"/>\n[[File:Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|left|diagram of Tenochtitlan]]\n\nTenochtitlan roughly correlates with the historic center of modern Mexico City.

The towers, temples and canoes filled with crowds who gathered to look at the strange men and their horses. Moctezuma came out from the center of Tenochtitlan onto the causeway to greet them. The two processions met at the entrance to the city. Moctezuma was in a litter draped with fine cotton mantles and borne on the shoulders of a number of lords. He emerged from the litter and the two leaders exchanged gifts. The Aztecs led the Spaniards into the heart of the city where Moctezuma gave them with more gifts and then quartered them in lavish apartments. However, Aztec accounts of the first meeting indicate that Moctezuma was too deferent and generous to the newcomers.<ref name=\"pbs1\"/> An Aztec account relates how the people of Tenochtitlan felt: \"as if everyone had eaten stupefying mushrooms..., as if they had seen something astonishing. Terror dominated everyone, as if all the world were being disembowelled.... People fell into a fearful slumber....\"<ref name=\"pbs1\"/>\n\nHowever, the camaraderie between the two leaders did not last long.  While the Spaniards marveled at the city's artifacts and strange foods, they were horrified by the religious rites involving human sacrifice and, being vastly outnumbered, Cortes worried greatly that Moctezuma was plotting to destroy him.  So on 16 November, Cort\u00e9s detained Moctezuma, placing him under house arrest. In this way, Cort\u00e9s hoped to rule through the emperor. However, Moctezuma's power was dwindling in the eyes of his people. The Aztecs grew ever more resentful of the Spaniards' attacks on their religion and their relentless demands for gold. Resistance broke out on one of the lakeside settlements, which Cort\u00e9s tried to quell by having a formal ceremony where the emperor swore allegiance to the Spanish king. He also tried to have the Mexica [[Cult image|idols]] in the [[Templo Mayor|main temple]] replaced by Christian ones or at least put them side by side.<ref name=\"pbs2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_f00.html \n|title= November, 1519 Montezuma Arrested \n|accessdate= 17 October 2008}}</ref> To add to Cort\u00e9s' troubles, the Spanish governor of [[Cuba]] sent an arrest party for Cort\u00e9s, as his orders were not to conquer but simply to trade.

He created the [[ayuntamiento]] or town council of the Spanish capital there, so that he could choose where the city would finally be. No one but Cort\u00e9s wanted to rebuild the Aztec site. Most of the other conquistadors wanted the new city to be closer to the mountains, pastures and groves they would need for supplies, for example in [[Tacuba]] or in Coyoac\u00e1n. Some accounts state that the Aztec islet was chosen because its location was strategic, allowing for rapid communication by boat to communities on the shorelines.  However, the decision was Cort\u00e9s's alone.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of Indians in the Valley of Mexico, 1519\u20131810'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 368.</ref><ref>George Kubler, ''Mexican Architecture of the Sixteenth Century'', volume 1, New Haven: Yale Historical Publications, History of Art V, 1948, pp. 69\u201371.</ref> According to [[:es:Bernardino V\u00e1zquez de Tapia|Bernardino V\u00e1zquez de Tapia]], Cort\u00e9s's reason was cultural.<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/> Leaving the site as it was would leave a memory of what was and would perhaps allow for a rival city to emerge.  So the site was chosen so that all remains of the old empire could be erased.<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/> Major flooding in the early seventeenth century, however, raised again the question of where the capital should be located, with elite property owners facing losses if the capital were moved.<ref>Louisa Schell Hoberman, \"Bureaucracy and Disaster: Mexico City and the Flood of 1629\", Journal of Latin American Studies 6(2) November 1974, pp. 226\u201327.</ref>\n\nAlthough the fall of Tenochtitlan was a swift and definitive occurrence, this did not imply that the Spanish domination of the entire city, or the rest of Mexico, would be a rapid process. Indian cooperation in the destruction of Aztec power ensured that Cort\u00e9s would have to take allied interests into consideration as well.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> In a number of ways, this made the Spaniards another factor in the ongoing political conflicts between rival native peoples, not to mention that Spanish were vastly outnumbered. For much of the colonial period, parts of Mexico City would remain very indigenous in character, with elements of these cultures surviving into modern times.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> Two separate parts of the capital were under indigenous rule, San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco, with Nahua governors who were intermediaries between the indigenous population and the Spanish rulers, although the capital was designated a ''ciudad de espa\u00f1oles'' (Spanish city).,<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 368</ref>\n\nCort\u00e9s did not establish an independent, conquered territory under his own personal rule, but remained loyal to the [[Habsburg]] Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who was also King of Spain and its associated European territories.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> Although Cort\u00e9s was portrayed to the Spanish court as an ambitious and untrustworthy adventurer by his enemies, he sought to prove his loyalty.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> First, he wrote the ''Five Letters'' to explain what he had done and why, and between 1528 and 1530, he traveled to see the emperor in [[Toledo, Spain]]. However, the emperor decided not to appoint him as governor of [[New Spain]] but instead the noble hereditary title of Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, with vast numbers of tributary Indians there and elsewhere. The first [[viceroy]] Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] of the new [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later. But Mexico City had long since been the major settlement of \"conquerors and immigrant [Spaniards, who] for their own reasons already made ... Mexico City their principal [seat]\" before the establishment of the high court (Audiencia), the archbishop, and the viceroy.<ref>James Lockhart, \"Trunk Lines and Feeder Lines: The Spanish Reaction to American Resources,\" in ''Of Things of the Indies: Essays Old and New in Early Latin American History'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1999, p. 142-43.</ref> The town council (''cabildo'') of the city had power that extended far beyond the city's established borders, due to the existence of areas on the mainland that in the prehispanic period were subordinate to Tenochtitlan. Such was approved by Charles V in 1522, authorizing the city to step into rural affairs to \"protect and benefit\" Indians as well as the Spanish.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nBetween late 1521 and mid-1522, Alonso Garc\u00eda Bravo and [[:es:Bernardino V\u00e1zquez de Tapia|Bernardino V\u00e1zquez de Tapia]] were tasked with the layout of the new Spanish city.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  They were assisted by two Aztecs, but their names are lost to history. The Spaniards decided to keep the main north\u2013south and east\u2013west roads that divided the city into four and the boundaries of the city were set with an area of 180&nbsp;hectares, which was divided into 100 blocks. There were eight principal canals in the Aztec city, including the one that ran on the south side of the main plaza (today [[Z\u00f3calo]]), which were renamed.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nAround the main plaza, which became the Plaza Mayor or [[Z\u00f3calo]] in the colonial period, Cort\u00e9s took over what were the \"Old Houses\" of [[Axayacatl]] and the \"New Houses\" of Moctezuma, both grand palaces, for his own.  Other conquistadors of the highest rank took positions around this square. In the northeast corner, [[Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila]] built his house at the foot of the old Aztec main temple. To the south, on what is now Avenida Pino Su\u00e1rez were the homes of [[Pedro de Alvarado]], and the Altamirano family, cousins of Cort\u00e9s. To the north of the plaza, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s established a monastery, in an area now known as [[Santo Domingo (Mexico City)|Santo Domingo]]. Most of these houses were built to be residences, warehouses or stores, and fortresses all at once.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nThe Spaniards began to build houses, copying the luxury residences of [[Seville]]. Being of firmer ground and less subject to subsidize, the area east of the main plaza was built up first, with the lake's waters up against the walls of a number of these constructions. The west side grew more slowly as flooding was more of an issue, and it was farther from the city's docks that brought in needed supplies.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nThe Spanish may well have found \"Tenochtitlan\" hard to say. They did shift the accent from Nahuatl pronunciation from Tenocht\u00edtlan (with the standard emphasis on the penultimate syllable) to Tenochtitl\u00e1n.<ref>Ida Altman et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Pearson 2003, p. 7, no.2</ref> and eventually adopted the city's secondary name \"Mexico\", the \"place of the Mexica\" or Aztecs.  For a period, the city was called by the dual name Mexico-Tenochtitlan,<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford University Press 1964, 368.</ref> but at some point, the capital of the viceroyalty's name was shortened to Mexico.  The name \"Tenochtilan\" endured in one of the capital's two indigenous-ruled sections, known as San Juan Tenochtitlan.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs under Spanish Rule'', p. 371.</ref>\n\n==Colonial period 1521\u20131821==\n{{See also|List of colonial churches in Mexico City|Spanish Colonial architecture}}\n[[File:Palacio Nacional, M\u00e9xico D.F., M\u00e9xico, 2013-10-16, DD 119.JPG|thumb|left|[[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace, Mexico City]], built by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and acquired by the Spanish crown to be the palace of the viceroy.]]\n\n===Growth of city===\nAfter the conquest, the Spaniards generally left the existing Nahua city-states or [[altepetl]] largely intact, but Mexico City was an exception since it became the seat of Spanish political power.  It was established as a ''ciudad de espa\u00f1oles'' (city of Spaniards) and initially kept the remnants of its prehispanic place name, being called \"Mexico-Tenochtitlan\".<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 368.</ref> No longer the seat of Aztec power, the Spaniards allowed two areas to be ruled through Nahua governors (''gobernadores'') and town councils (''cabildos''), separate from the Spanish city council.  San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco became the mechanism for the crown to rule through indigenous intermediaries, particularly important in the Spanish capital since it also had a significant indigenous population.  San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco were not called by the Nahuatl term for polity, altepetl, but rather \"partes\" or \"parcialidades\" of Mexico City, with their new place names having a Christian saint's name preceding the [[Precolombian|prehispanic]] designation, in typical colonial fashion.<ref name=\"Gibson, p. 371\">Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', p. 371.</ref> The structure in these two indigenous-ruled sections of the capital were on the same pattern of Indian towns elsewhere in central Mexico.  In the sixteenth century, these indigenous political structures mobilized tribute and labor rendered to the Spanish capital.<ref name=\"Gibson, p. 371\"/> Even though prehispanic Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco was built on an island in the middle of the major lake system, they had political power over holdings on the mainland, a standard pattern of scattered rather than compact settlement and rule. These mainland holdings or ''estancias'' rendered tribute and labor in the prehispanic period; in the colonial period this pattern continued during the early colonial period, but during the later period (ca. 1650\u20131821), the pattern broke down and estancias were separated.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', p. 371-72.</ref>\n\nThe city grew with buildings all near the same height and with the same terraced roofs ''(azoteas)'', with only the tower and cross of the convent of San Francisco peaking up from above it all. This profile was due to royal decree.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Even the [[Mexico City Cathedral|new cathedral]] being built had limitations as to its height.  Near the end of the 16th century however, there was a proliferation of churches with bell towers, leading to a zigzag profile of the city, which was then later modified by church [[cupola]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} For centuries afterward, this profile remained constant with only the continuous building of the main Cathedral making any change in the [[skyline]]. In the 19th century, the tallest structures were all churches. In addition to the Cathedral, there were the bell towers and cupolas of Santa Teresa la Antigua, the College of Saints Peter and Paul and the chapel of San Felipe Neri as landmarks.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nThe new city inherited much of the old city's look, oriented to the four cardinal directions with both canals and streets to move people and goods.  However, the canals had already begun to shrink due to efforts to make the land streets wider.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}The first public building was called Las Atarazanas, where the [[brigantine]]s used to lay siege to Tenochititlan were kept, at a place called [[Metro San L\u00e1zaro|San L\u00e1zaro]]. Shortly thereafter, the [[Federal District buildings|Palacio de Ayuntamiento]] was started, with the first coin production facilities. Mechlor D\u00e1vila built the [[Old Mercantile Center|Portales de Mercadores]] on the southwest side of the main plaza. Las Casas Consistoriales was built on the south side next to the Palacio de Ayuntamiento, which later became known as the Casa de las Flores.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nThe first extension of the originally-laid city occurred on the north and east sides, taking over lands originally held by native peoples.  One example is the neighborhood known as Lecumberri, founded by Basques, meaning \"new, good land.\"<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nIn 1600, the city grew again, towards the east to what is now the Circuito Interior and to the north towards Tlatelolco, which was then called Real de Santa Ana, stopping at the Calzada de los Misterios, which was a pre-Hispanic processional route to the sanctuary of [[Tonantzin]], the mother of the gods in Tepeyac.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\n===Flooding, the Desag\u00fce, and Environmental Changes===\nSince Mexico City was built on an island in the center of a large but shallow lake system, flooding became a serious issue during the colonial period.  Spaniards denuded hillsides of their trees from the early conquest era on, so that mud and silt made the lake system even shallower, exacerbating the periodic flooding.  Spaniards had not maintained the Aztec drainage system, which included a major dike. Major floods in Mexico City were recorded in 1555, 1580, 1604, and 1607, Indian labor was diverted when crown officials undertook a major project to divert water via a drainage system, known as the ''[[Desag\u00fce]]''. In 1607, 4,500 Indians were drafted to build the 8-mile-long combination drainage ditch and tunnel and 1608, the work was continued with 3,000.<ref>Louisa Schell Hoberman, \"Bureaucracy and Disaster: Mexico City and the Flood of 1629,\" Journal of Latin American Studies, 6(2), November 1974, p. 224.</ref><ref>Richard Boyer, ''La gran inundaci\u00f3n: Vida y sociedad en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (1629\u20131638)'', Mexico: Sep Setentas 1975.</ref><ref>Vera Candiani. \"The Desag\u00fce Reconsidered: Environmental Dimensions of Class Conflict in Colonial Mexico.\" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 92.1 (2012) 5\u201339.</ref> Flooding was controlled in the short term, and in subsequent years the Desag\u00fce infrastructure was not maintained.  In 1629, rains inundated the capital and flood waters remained in the capital for the next few years. Viceroy Don [[Rodrigo Pacheco, 3rd Marquis of Cerralvo]], the Mexico City council (cabildo), secular and regular clergy, and elite Spanish residents of Mexico City combined efforts to provide immediate relief, and taxes and diversion of Indian labor to construction of the Desag\u00fce aimed at dealing with the long-term problem of flooding. A number of Spaniards moved to dry land to the nearby settlement of [[Coyoac\u00e1n]] (now part of Mexico City), increasing the displacement of Indian ownership of land there. In 1630, there was a serious proposal to move the capital to dry land rather than continue dealing with constant flooding.  Elite Mexico City property owners and the city council opposed the plan, since they would incur huge real estate losses.<ref>Hoberman, ibid. pp. 226\u2013227.</ref> There was another major push to deal with flooding, but the pattern of neglect of the desag\u00fce infrastructure and subsequent inundation of the capital recurred, with flooding in 1645, 1674, 1691, 1707, 1714, 1724, 1747 and 1763.<ref>Hoberman, ibid., p. 228.</ref> Floods continued into the early republic after independence. \n\nFrom the early eighteenth century, the city was able to grow as the waters of the lake receded. In 1700, the city advanced towards the east and south and west, as the north was still bounded by water. To the west, it expanded to what is now Balderas Street. In the latter half of the 18th century the populated area reached eastward to the lakeshore, which then was just beyond the now Circuito Interior and the [[La Merced Market, Mexico City|La Merced Market]]. To the south began to appear houses in an area now called [[Colonia Doctores]]. To the west, following what is now Avenida Chapultepec towards the Ciudadela, now the National Library, near [[Metro Balderas]]. To the north past Tlatelolco and to the south to Topacioa and the now Calzada de la Viga.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nAfter independence, there were continued attempts to complete the drainage project, with activity in the early 1830s.  During the U.S. invasion of the valley of Mexico, its army made a study of the problem, but the withdrawal of U.S. forces with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo put an end to that attempt.  During the Liberal Reform of the 1850s, there was a revived plan for solving the problem, settling on a plan proposed by Francisco de Garay for a series of open canals to channel water out of the capital and through the mountains.<ref>James A. Garza, \"Conquering the Environment and Surviving Natural Disasters,\" in ''A Companion to Mexican History and Culture''. New York: Wiley-Blackwell 2011, pp. 318\u2013319.</ref><ref>M.

D\u00edaz created a commission to oversee work, but the project went further than merely controlling rainwater and stagnation and sought the expansion of water rights under its control for a growing population. This affected indigenous communities around the lake system.<ref name=\"Garza p. 319\">Garza, \"Conquering the Environment,\" p. 319.</ref> The commission sought foreign loans from the British firm of Pearson and Sons and foreign technology was utilized. The government authorized securing land for area through which the canal was to be built. D\u00edaz considered the Desag\u00fce a top priority, since Mexico's capital was considered a very dangerous place in terms of health.<ref name=\"Garza p. 319\"/>\n\nWhen the engineering project was successfully finished the cycle of flooding finally ended.<ref>Hoberman, ibid., 229-30.</ref> The lake waters ceased to threaten the capital as they disappeared in the modern era.<ref name=\"citydata\"/>\n\n===Political power===\n[[File:Castillo de Chapultepec (Museo Nacional de Historia).JPG|thumb|right|[[Chapultepec Castle]], a neo-classical palace commissioned by Viceroy [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], built 1785-7]]\nBy the 1530s, Mexico City was given jurisdiction over other town councils of New Spain{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and quickly established itself as the most populous and powerful city in the Americas. Like that of the Aztecs, the Spaniards' grasp extended well beyond the capital and the Valley of Mexico\u2014only much farther. As the site of the viceroyalty of New Spain and archbishopric of Mexico, as well as economic elites, Mexico City was the center of power.  Socially, the viceregal government and ecclesiastical authorities remained the pillars of Spanish colonialism. Its prestige as representing civilization allowed the colonial system to function during the long period from the 1640s to the 1760s when crown authorities in Mexico City were too weak politically to regulate much of the economic activities over such a vast territory. These institutions' close association with Mexico City also ensured this city's dominance in the political territory of New Spain, providing the links that kept the vast and expanding empire together.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\n===Religious power===\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral}}\n[[File:MexicoCityCathedralSter.jpg|thumb|The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]], which was under construction during most of the colonial period]]\n[[File:PortalInquisDF.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palace of the Inquisition]], built in the early 18th c.]]\nAs the seat of the Archbishopric of Mexico and the site of many diocesan institutions and those of mendicant orders and the Jesuits, and nunneries, Mexico City had a concentration of religious institutional power. The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] of Mexico City was built over an extended period of time and designed to show the religious power of the Catholic Church. Built on the Plaza Mayor, or [[Z\u00f3calo]], its architecture reflected several styles of [[Spanish Colonial architecture]].\n\nDespite this concentration of Catholic power, the indigenous population's understanding of Catholic doctrine and practice was not thorough, even in the capital itself. Residual native practices survived and were reflected in the natives' practice of the new faith. Franciscan friar [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] suspected that the emerging cult of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]], which is said to have originated with the vision at Tepeyac Hill to the north of the city's borders in 1531, represented a post-Conquest adoption of the Aztec cult of [[Tonantzin]].<ref>Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''General History of the Things of New Spain: Florentine Codex, Introductory Volume''. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University 1982, p. 90</ref> He was also concerned that the prior cult of Quetzalcoatl would find its way into the new religion by equating this god with the Apostle [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], as an earlier attempt to evangelize the Indians before the Spanish conquest.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\nThe Spanish also brought with them the [[Inquisition]] as a social and political tool. Public hangings and even burnings, not unusual in Europe at the time, were also used in New Spain, especially in Mexico City, as demonstrations of the joint power of the Church and the State over individual actions and social status. One group that suffered during this time were the so-called \"crypto-Jews\" of Portuguese descent. Many converted Portuguese Jews came to New Spain looking for commercial opportunities. In 1642, 150 of these individuals were arrested within three or four days, and the Inquisition began a series of trials on suspicion of still practicing Judaism. Many of these were merchants involved in New Spain's principal economic activities. On 11 April 1649, twelve were burned after being strangled and one person was burned alive. A similar fate was in store for those found guilty of homosexuality. Men were burned at the stake in 1568, 1660, 1673 and 1687 after being denounced. While not as likely to be executed, scholars had to be careful at this time, too. Academics such as Fray Diego Rodr\u00edguez who advocated the separation of science and theology found themselves the subject of investigations by the Holy Office. Booksellers who did not have their inventory approved by the Church faced fines and possible [[excommunication]].<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n<gallery>\nFile:MuseoSCPDF.JPG|Palace of the Archbishop of Mexico City, now a [[Museo de la Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico|museum]]\nFile:ChurchSantoDomingoDF.JPG|[[Santo Domingo (Mexico City)|Church of Santo Domingo, Mexico City]]\nFile:TemploSanFelipeNeriDF.JPG|[[Temple of San Felipe Neri \"La Profesa\"]], 17th c.

The elevation of silver mining as a profession and the ennoblement of silver miners was a development of the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon Reforms]]]]\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of its primacy. It was the capital of the viceroyalty, seat of the archbishopric, residence of civil and religious officials of all ranks, as well as wealthy merchants who engaged in international trade, but also the center of much regional trade.  The establishment of a [[consulado de mercaderes]] (merchant [[guild]]) in Mexico City indicates the concentration and organization of this economic elite.\n\nThe consulado was founded in Mexico City in 1594, controlled by [[peninsulars|peninsular]] wholesale merchants who dealt in long-distance trade, who often married into local elite families with commercial ties. Their assets had to amount to at least 28,000 pesos.  Although they were not supposed to deal in local retail trade, they often did some indirectly.<ref>Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson 2003, p. 178.</ref> They mainly lived in Mexico City and had positions on the city council [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]].

In fact, the [[Philippines]] were colonized and evangelized from Mexico City rather than directly from Spain itself. From the late 1560s until 1813, the annual [[Manila galleon]] took Mexican silver from the port of [[Acapulco]] across the Pacific Ocean to [[Manila]], in exchange for Chinese silks and [[porcelain]] from [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. The viceroy in Mexico City sought to restrict cargoes and frequency on the grounds that the Asiatic trade diverted silver from the principal route which was to Europe. There were also attempts to restrict, then prohibit, trade between Peru and Mexico City in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the objective of keeping control of Peruvian silver. The overall goal was to keep Spain's colonies dependent on trade with the motherland, rather than with each other and even less with colonies of other European powers. Although the viceroy's attempts were not 100%&nbsp;effective, they were effective enough that Mexico City merchants lost control of the Pacific trade, which fell under the control of contrabandists operating from the smaller ports in [[Guatemala]] and [[Nicaragua]].<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\n=== Population of Mexico City ===\n[[File:Vista de la Plaza Mayor de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico - Cristobal de Villalpando.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Plaza Mayor of Mexico city (ca. 1695) by [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando]]. The painting shows the damage to the viceroy's palace following the riot of 1692.]]\n\n====Size====\nPopulation figures for the city are inexact for Spaniards, mixed-race castas, and indigenous.  Some idea of the indigenous can be discerned from tribute records. In 1525, the city had perhaps 22,000 indigenous inhabitants, dropping precipitously starting around 1550. A figure for Tenochtitlan tributaries in 1562 is 12,971.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', figure 17, p. 379; Appendix 4, 460\u2013462.</ref> The estimates of the European population in Mexico City is also imprecise, with figures coming from a variety of sources.  In 1525 there were 150 households occupied by Spaniards, with the European population increasing steadily during the entire colonial period.  The highest estimate for the colonial era is by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who estimated ca. 1802 that there were 67,500 whites in Mexico City.<ref>Gibson, ''Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', table 27 \"Estimates of the White Population in Mexico City\", p. 381.</ref>\n\nThe size of Mexico City's population and its demographic contours have been enduring questions for crown officials as well as modern scholars.  There were major epidemics that affected the population, starting with the smallpox epidemic of 1520 that was a factor in the [[Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire]], but there were other major epidemics throughout the colonial period.  There were estimates taken in the late seventeenth century, with the largest and most detailed census mandated by Viceroy [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Revillagigedo]] in 1790.<ref>Dennis Nod\u00edn Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline of the \u2018'Sociedad de Castas'\u2019 in Mexico City.\" PhD dissertation, University of Michigan 1978.

In the early period after the conquest, the Spanish population played a pivotal role in the capital.<ref>[[Ida Altman|Altman, Ida]]. \"Spanish Society in Mexico City after the Conquest.\" ''The Hispanic American Historical Review'', vol. 71, no. 3, 1991, pp. 413\u2013445.

The census of the Intendancy is found in the Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n (M\u00e9xico), Impresos Officiales, 51.</ref> The total number of Mexico City residents counted in 1793 was 104,760 (which excludes 8,166 officials) and in the intendancy as a whole 1,043,223, excluding 2,299 officials.  In both the capital and the intendancy, the European population was the smallest percentage, with 2,335 in the capital (2.2%) and the intendancy 1,330 (.1%).  The listing for Spaniard (espa\u00f1ol) was 50,371 (48.1%), with the intendancy showing 134,695 (12.9%). For [[mestizo]]s (in which he has merged the castizos), in the capital there were 19,357 (18.5%) and in the intendancy 112,113 (10.7%).  For the mulatto category, the capital listed 7,094 (6.8%) with the intendancy showing 52,629 (5.0%).  There is apparently no separate category for blacks (Negros).  The category Indian showed 25,603 (24.4%), with the intendancy with 742,186 (71.1).  The capital thus had the largest concentration of Spaniards and [[castas]], with the countryside being overwhelmingly Indian.  The population of the capital \"indicates that conditions favoring mestizaje were more favorable in the city than the outlying area\" and that there were more high status occupations in the city.<ref>Nodin Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\" p. 58.</ref>\n\nFurther analysis of the two censuses found that the population of the capital was older and had more women.<ref>Nodin Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\", Tables 2.3 and 2.4, p.59</ref> Women migrated to the capital in higher numbers than men from the surrounding countryside.<ref>Nodin Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\", p. 60.</ref>\n\n====Racial Residential Patterns====\nIn studying the 1811 census, there is no absolute segregation by race.<ref>Nodin Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\" p. 62; Chart 2.5, p. 64. The census is found in Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n (M\u00e9xico), Padrones 53\u201376.</ref> The highest concentration of Spaniards was around the ''traza'', the central sector of the city where the civil and religious institutions were based and where there was the highest concentration of wealthy merchants. But non-Spaniards also lived there.  Indians were found in higher concentrations in the sectors on the fringes of the capital. Castas appear as residents in all sectors of the capital.\n\n===Nobility in Mexico City \u2013 \"City of Palaces\"===\n{{see also|Mexican nobility}}\n[[File:Casa de Azulejos 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Casa de los Azulejos]], built 1737, home of the counts of Orizaba.

A noble title here did not mean one exercised great political power as one's power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not.<ref name=\"Ladd\">{{cite book \n|title= Artes de Mexico Palacios de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a The Mexican Nobility \n|last= Ladd \n|first= Doris M \n|year= 1998 \n|publisher= Artes de Mexico y del Mundo \n|location= Mexico City \n|isbn= 978-968-6533-61-3 \n|pages=84\u201386 }}</ref> Between the 16th and 18th centuries, most of those who had titles gained them after their families had accumulated wealth over several generations. Many of these nobles made their money outside of the capital at large haciendas or in mining but spent their fortunes in the capital. Those who made their money in the city were usually wholesalers from lower social backgrounds. The merchant-financiers became almost as prominent as the landowners because they were the decisive element of the city's economy. Many of the leading figures were of Spanish origin, although their principal economic interests and family connections were within New Spain. For example, the [[Andalusia]]n, [[Pedro Romero de Terreros]], who became Count of [[Regla]] in 1768, made his money in silver mining at [[Real del Monte]], near [[Pachuca]], from 1742. This blending of wealth of landowners and merchant-financiers led to a blending of traditional and modern practices. Matrimony and personal ties continued to be the principal means of solidifying business interests. Nephews, other relatives and friends formed broad networks of interest over a wide geographical area from the capital cities into the countryside and through the span of economic activities.  The landowners, however, remained in a slightly higher social position because their livelihoods stemmed from their close working arrangement with the colonial state.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\nSome landowners' holdings were almost kingdoms. Between the 1730s and the 19th century, the Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo had amassed properties that combined were about two-thirds the size of Portugal, or {{convert|19000000|acre|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Marquesado de San Miguel de Aguayo y su obra indiana |url=http://www.vacarizu.es/d6/articulo/el-marquesado-de-san-miguel-de-aguayo-y-su-obra-indiana |publisher=vacarizu.es }}</ref> These estates were centered in the modern-day state of [[Durango]], and their specialty was sheep-raising. Meat from their stock supplied Mexico City and [[wool]] was sold to various textile workshops. The Aguayos left these estates in the hands of administrators, backed by armed guards to ward off Indian attack, to live off the revenues in Mexico City, where they possessed four palatial residences. Their title had been awarded in 1682, but the land purchases by the family dated from the 1580s.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\nThe concept of [[Mexican nobility|nobility in Mexico]] was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family, not the individual. For an individual to receive a noble title, he would have to prove his family's bloodline as well as their loyalty to God and king for a number of generations prior. Such a quest was costly but once a title was secured the costs did not stop there.<ref name=\"Ladd\"/>\n\nNobles in New Spain had to continually reinforce their devotion to both God and king.  To show their piety, most nobles donated temporal goods to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], by building churches, funding missionary activities and charities. Sometimes nobles would also hold religious office or give one or more children (usually daughters) to a religious vocation but this was relatively rare. Demonstrating loyalty to king meant paying taxes to maintain their titles, sometimes purchasing military rank as well.<ref name=\"Ladd\"/>\n\nTheir last duty was to maintain a certain show of luxury. It was not a case of \"keeping up with the Jones'\", but rather a requirement of the position.  Families that could not keep up a certain level of luxury were scolded by royal officers as not honoring their title. Such [[conspicuous consumption]] manifested itself in dress, jewels, furniture and especially in the building of mansions and palaces.<ref name=\"Ladd\"/>\n\nThe pressure to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Nobles leveled old buildings, using their Aztec stones and Spanish bricks to build more fashionable [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and Neo classic style mansions. Many of the most costly were on what was called San Francisco street (now [[Madero street]]) and near the [[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]].  Near the Alameda were the homes of the Marquis of Guardiola, of the Borda family and the house of the Marquis of Prado Alegre as well as the home of the Counts of the Valley of Orizaba who covered the entire fa\u00e7ade with [[talavera (pottery)|talavera]] tiles from [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. On San Francisco Street, the most famous house was that of the Marquis of Jaral. It was a former convent that the marquis converted into a replica of the royal palace of [[Palermo]] for his daughter and her [[Sicily|Sicilian]] husband. Later it was the home of [[Felix Calleja]] and then [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], who accepted the crown of Mexico from its balcony. Today it is known as the [[Palace of Iturbide]].<ref name=\"Ladd\"/>\n\nMost of these palaces still remain in the city center. Their abundance led [[Charles Joseph Latrobe]], a man of high standing in Australia, to name Mexico City the \"city of palaces\" in his book \"The rambler in Mexico.\"<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/><ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> This moniker is often erroneously attributed to the famous scientist and savant [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who traveled extensively through New Spain and wrote ''The Political Essay of the Kingdom of New Spain'', published in 1804.\n\nSuch need for pomp made for an extreme social class difference. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] reported that foreigners were often horrified at the differences between how the nobles lived and the misery of the common people.<ref name=\"Ladd\"/> In the late 18th century and early 19th century, there was a strong desire among nobles to transform colonial absolutism to something like an autonomous, constitutional state. More specifically, they looked for more power in the rural regions outside of Mexico City where their holdings were. There was an experience in such decentralization in September 1808, when tensions between the metropolis and the other regions of New Spain were high.  Then regional elites used this situation to subvert the colonial government in the city, turning to popular mobilization against the elite of Mexico City when they failed to subvert the colonial militia.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\n===The urban poor in Mexico City===\n[[File:NatMontePiedadZocaloDF.JPG|thumb|250px|National Monte de Piedad Building off the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City.]]\nMexico City also has a long tradition of urban poverty, while at the same time being home to the largest concentration of wealthy people in [[New Spain]]. There were institutions designed both to control the urban poor, but also aid them, created by private donors, the Church, and the crown.  The establishment of the [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]], the pawnshop still in operation in modern Mexico City, allowed urban dwellers who had any property at all to pawn access to interest-free, small-scale credit. It was set up in 1777, by the Count of [[Regla]], who had made a fortune in silver mining, and the pawnshop continues to operate as a national institution in the twenty-first century, with its headquarters still right off the [[Z\u00f3calo]] in Mexico City with branches in many other places in Mexico.  The Count of Regla's donation is an example of private philanthropy in the late colonial period. A much earlier example was the endowment that conqueror [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] gave to establish the Hospital de Jes\u00fas, which is the only venue in Mexico City that has a bust of the conqueror.  Another eighteenth-century example of private philanthropy that then became a crown institution was the \u2018'Hospicio de Pobres'\u2019, the Mexico City Poor House, founded in 1774 with funds of a single ecclesiastical donor, Choirmaster of the Cathedral, Fernando Ortiz Cort\u00e9s, who became its first director.<ref>Arrom, ''Containing the Poor'', p. 44.</ref> That institution lasted about a century, until 1871, going from a [[poor house]] or [[work house]] for adults to mainly being an orphanage for abandoned street children.<ref>Silvia Arrom, \u2018'Containing the Poor: The Mexico City Poor House, 1774\u20131871.

[[Miguel Cabrera]], 1763, oil on canvas, Waldo-Dentzel Art Center.]]\nDuring the viceroyalty of [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Revillagigedo]], there were attempts to control the public behavior of the poor in Mexico City.  Ordinances such as forbidding public defecation and urination had little effect, especially since there was no alternative for the poor to relieving one's self on the street. Also forbidden were the discarding of trash buckets, dead dogs and horse in the streets and gutters. A local police force was tasked with creating order and tidiness. The crown also attempted to regulate taverns, where the poor congregated, drank, gambled and in the estimate of elites, generally got up to no good.  Revillagigedo focused special attention on cleaning up the Plaza Mayor and the viceregal palace, removing pulque stalls, garbage, wandering dogs, cows, and pigs, moved the market area elsewhere.  He had the area paved with cobblestones, and the area was illuminated with newly place streetlamps. The Alameda park was cleaned and the entrance to it was guarded to prevent the poorly-clad plebe from entering. Public space was thus regulated cultural space, separating elites from the poor.<ref>Pamela Voekel, \"Peeing on the Palace: Bodily Resistance to Bourbon Reforms in Mexico City,\" ''Journal of Historical Sociology 5, no. 2 (June 1992), 183\u2013208.</ref>\n\nThe founding of the Royal Cigar Factory was another eighteenth-century crown project, part of the establishment of the royal tobacco monopoly, which both brought significant revenue to the crown in the sale of cigars and cigarettes, but the factory in Mexico City and a few other major colonial centers, created thousands of good jobs for the urban poor including women.<ref>Arrom, \u2018'Containing the Poor,\u2019\u2019 p. 15.</ref><ref>Susan Deans-Smith, ''Bureaucrats, Planters, and Workers: The Making of the Tobacco Monopoly in Bourbon Mexico.''

It was as much an act of charity as prudent state planning to prevent bread riots.  Mexico City had experienced two major riots in the seventeenth century, one in 1624 that ousted the viceroy who attempted to eliminate excessive profits for grain and other goods by creole traders.<ref>Jonathan I.

Berkeley: University of California Press 1983.</ref> For women who needed protection, the Church created the ''recogimientos de mujeres'', a kind of shelter for healthy women who voluntarily wished to live a sheltered life in a religious atmosphere; some other institutions for women were to reform prostitutes and were not voluntary.

They were considered a kind of criminal class, contributing to the disorder of Mexico City.  Research has found that they included [[mestizo]]s, Indians, and poor whites (espa\u00f1oles). ''L\u00e9peros'' were viewed as unrespectable people (''el pueblo bajo'') by polite society (''la gente culta''), who judged them as being morally and biologically inferior.<ref>Michael Scardaville, \"Crime and the Urban Poor: Mexico City in the Late Colonial Period.\" PhD dissertation, University of Florida 1977, pp.23\u201324.</ref> L\u00e9peros supported themselves as they could through petty commerce or begging, but many resorted to crime. A study of crime in eighteenth-century Mexico City based on official arrest records of the two police forces of Mexico City indicates that l\u00e9peros were \"neither marginal types nor dregs of the lower classes.

Arrest records indicate that many of these women had provincial origins and the women migrated to the capital leaving a spouse behind.

While the nobility in Mexico City also did not like the absolute colonial system, their goal was limited representation and autonomy within the Spanish empire.  They decided to make their stand in 1820, after the rural insurgency had been going on for several years, choosing Colonel [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] to push their interests militarily.  Iturbide had fought against Morelos between 1813 and 1816.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> However, between 1816 and 1820, Iturbide was becoming sympathetic to the idea of some degree of independence for Mexico. In 1821, Iturbide was the supreme commander of the royalist forces and had put down all but one of the major rebels, [[Vicente Guerrero]]. Iturbide decided to meet with Guerrero, after becoming convinced that independence was the only real course for Mexico. However, Iturbide's idea was a Mexican monarchy with ties to King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].<ref name=\"Iturbide\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.casaimperial.org/augustin.htm\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040411084151/http://www.casaimperial.org/augustin.htm\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 11 April 2004\n |title      = Don Agustin de Iturbide\n |accessdate = 20 October 2008\n}}</ref>\nAfter switching sides, Iturbide chose to pressure the colonial government by repeating Hidalgo's strategy of closing in on the city from the surrounding area.  Iturbide was able to succeed where Hidalgo had not because the Spanish-born commanders in the city supported Iturbide's idea of limited autonomy, and many the royalist forces were in the field battling insurgents like Guerrero. Iturbide's [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] (Independence, Union, Religion) entered Mexico City on 21 September 1821.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> On the following 27 September, Mexico was declared independent.<ref name=\"Iturbide\"/>\nThe Mexico City nobles sought to preserve as much of the old as possible, and garnered the support of a substantial section of the royalist army to recreate central power. Their objective was to halt the devolution of power to the regions outside the city and the lower echelons of society.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> Shortly after his triumphant entrance into the city, Iturbide declared what is now known as the [[First Mexican Empire]], with himself as emperor, from the palace that now bears his name.<ref name=\"ciudadmexico\"/> The coronation of Agust\u00edn as emperor and his wife Ana Mar\u00eda as empress took place amid much pomp and circumstance on 21 July 1822 at the Cathedral of Mexico City. The [[Archbishop Fonte]] presided over the anointment of the Emperor who following [[Napoleon]]'s example, crowned himself.<ref name=\"Iturbide\"/>\nFollowing his coronation, the new empire was politically and financially unstable. Iturbide was accused of taking too much power for himself, and his main rival was [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]. In the spring of 1823, Iturbide offered his abdication, which was accepted by his political opponents and then left the country for Europe.<ref name=\"Iturbide\"/> \nMexico was then declared a republic. The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|republican constitution of 1824]] established Mexico City as the nation's capital.

A fortified hacienda in the town of San Antonio covered the southeastern approach, while the town of [[San \u00c1ngel]] covered the southwestern. Between them lay a vast, seemingly impenetrable lava field, called El Pedr\u00e9gal. General [[Gabriel Valencia]] decided to move his troops from San \u00c1ngel to the then town of [[Magdalena Contreras|Contreras]]. Despite being forewarned of U.S. intentions by a tactical mistake, the Mexicans found themselves outgunned by the invading army at Contreras. This allowed the Americans to cross the Pedr\u00e9gal and move in on the Mexican troops at San Antonio from behind.<ref name=\"Contreras\">{{cite web \n|url= https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/contreras.html \n|title= The Battle of Contreras \n|accessdate=18 October 2008 }}</ref> The assault on the carefully laid defenses at San Antonio became known as the [[Battle of Churubusco]]. Knowing of the Americans' approach, Santa Anna ordered General [[Pedro Mar\u00eda de Anaya]] to move his troops to a monastery in [[Churubusco]]. While Anaya's position was eventually overrun, he held off the Americans for some time. However, the Mexican army lost 10,000&nbsp;defenders.<ref name=\"Churubusco\">{{cite web \n|url= https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/churubusco.html \n|title= The Battle of Churubusco \n|accessdate=18 October 2008 }}</ref> The [[Battle of Molino del Rey]] was the last just before the Americans entered the old city itself. The war ended with the attack of [[Chapultepec Castle]], headquarters of the military college, where young students defended the castle. In this place died in the battle the [[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]], students of the college with ages from 13 to 19 years. General [[Gideon Pillow]] and his 2,500&nbsp;men led the assault, starting from the Molino del Rey to the west of Chapultepec. General [[John Quitman]] entered in from the south to cut Chapultepec off from reinforcements, while General [[David Twiggs]] fought against positions further east. Inside the walls, General [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]] realized that his 1,000&nbsp;men were too few to hold the castle, but he attempted to do so. Mexican troops on the western slope of the castle held for a while, but Pillow's men captured the castle by 9:30&nbsp;am the day of the attack.<ref name=\"storming\"/> \nTo end the war officially, American and Mexican representatives met at the [[Villa of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], across from the shrine of the patron saint of Mexico, in what is now the far north of the city.

Santa Anna's losses to the Americans created great discontent among his political opponents who coalesced to call themselves the Reform movement or the Liberals.  Those who supported Santa Anna's regime and the power of the Catholic Church were called the Conservatives. The [[Reform War]] lasted from 1857 to 1861. For a time, the two factions had parallel governments with the Liberals in Veracruz and the Conservatives in Mexico City. When the Liberals were victorious, Liberal president [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] moved his government to the capital city.<ref name=\"periodico\">{{cite web \n|url= http://www.elperiodicodemexico.com/historia_reforma.php \n|title= La historia de la Reforma \n|language= Spanish \n|accessdate= 18 October 2008 \n|url-status= dead \n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090105231107/http://www.elperiodicodemexico.com/historia_reforma.php \n|archivedate= 5 January 2009 \n}}</ref> Since the Catholic Church was as much a target of the Reform movement as the government was, a number of ecclesiastical buildings were torn down or turned to other uses.  The liberals' urban program was to transform \"an ecclesiastical capital into a secular one.\"<ref>Barbara Tenenbaum, \"Streetwise History: The Paseo de la Reforma and the Porfirian State, 1876\u20131910\" in William Beezley et al., eds.

Rowman and Littlefield 1994, p. 29.</ref> However, Ju\u00e1rez was soon faced with a new threat when he suspended payments for foreign powers of money borrowed by the conservatives, which sparked the [[French intervention in Mexico]]. The intervention, supported by Mexican conservatives, installed [[Maximilian of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]] as the ruler of a newly created monarchy, the [[Second Mexican Empire]].\n\nEmperor Maximilian undertook an accelerated program of urban renovation under the supervision of Mexican architect, Francisco Somera. Somera had served on the city council of the capital and dealt with the city's infrastructure, such as roads, sewers, canals, and pavement.  His portfolio and expertise meant he was concerned with the ongoing problem of flooding in the capital, especially during heavy rains, which the major colonial-era project of drainage, the ''Desag\u00fce'', had not solved. He was also significantly involved with the expansion of the city from its historic urban core.<ref>Mar\u00eda Dolores Morales, \"Francisco Somera y el primer fraccionamiento de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico,\" ''Formaci\u00f3n y desarrollo de la burgues\u00eda en M\u00e9xico'', Ciro Cardoso, ed. Mexico: Siglo XXI 1978, 188\u2013230</ref>\n\nFor the most part, growth of Mexico City in the 19th century, was based on extending the rectangular layout of the original Spanish colonial city, even if its borders had an irregular, even zigzag, appearance. In 1865, Emperor Maximilian had a wide avenue, ''Paseo del Emperador'' or ''Paseo de la Emperatriz'', planned by Francisco Somera, and built to connect the emperor's residence at [[Chapultepec Castle]] with the National Palace in the downtown core. All along this avenue there were plans to place statues of heroes of Mexican history, which were not realized until the regime of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], starting in 1877. However, the thoroughfare extends southwest to northeast, breaking the north\u2013south, east\u2013west orientation of roads before it. With the ouster of the imperial French in 1867 and return to Mexico City of republican president Benito Ju\u00e1rez, the avenue was initially renamed Calzada Degollado and then in 1872 changed to [[Paseo de la Reforma]].<ref>Agostoni, Claudia.

Photo taken on a Sunday when the boulevard is closed to vehicular traffic and used by pedestrians and bicyclists.]]\nPresident [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] ruled the nation for more than three decades between 1876 and 1910. During this time, he developed the city's infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation, and communication systems. He also encouraged foreign investment and laid the groundwork for industrial development. In Mexico City, these improvements were most apparent, since this is where government elites, foreign investors, and domestic entrepreneurs lived and worked, while the countryside and smaller cities and pueblos languished.\n\nWith the ouster of the French occupiers and the political exile of their conservative Mexican supporters, liberalism put its stamp on Mexico City in the form of new monuments and the renaming of streets.  Most prominently, the new, wide avenue became Paseo de la Reforma, with statues of liberal heroes and others important to Mexican history lining its route. The monument mania on the Paseo started in 1877 with the [[Monument to Christopher Columbus (Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City)|Monument to Christopher Columbus]] donated by Mexican railway magnate [[:es:Antonio Escand\u00f3n|Antonio Escand\u00f3n]] designed by French sculptor [[Charles Cordier]], followed by the [[Monument to Cuauht\u00e9moc]], both in major traffic circles (''glorietas'').\n\nAs with earlier regimes, Diaz re-purposed a number of older buildings. One was [[Belem Prison]], a colonial-era building that was used to produce pseudoscience about criminals. The police had started to take photos of prisoners in Belem in the 1850s, to identify them in case of an escape. Diaz wanted to professionalize the police and the [[Mexico City Police]] adopted the [[Bertillon method]] to catalogue and identify repeat offenders. The [[Palacio de Lecumberri]] prison in Mexico City drew on the [[panopticon]] concepts of Jeremy Bentham and was completed in 1900. It became symbolic for Diaz's attempt to put criminals under visual [[surveillance]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Public Spectacles of Violence: Sensational Cinema and Journalism in Early Twentieth-Century Mexico and Brazil|last= Navitski|first= Rielle|publisher=Duke University Press |year=2017 |isbn=9780822372899}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910, Mexico celebrated the 1810 Hidalgo revolt that initiated the independence movement in Mexico. D\u00edaz had been in power since 1876 and saw the occasion of the centenary as an opportunity for the creation of new buildings and monuments and to invite world dignitaries to show off Mexico's progress. For buildings, much advance planning and other work was needed to have them completed in time for September 1910. During that month in Mexico City, there were \"inaugurations of a new modern mental hospital, a popular hygiene exhibition, an exhibition of Spanish art and industry, exhibitions of Japanese products and avant-garde Mexican art, a monument to [[Alexander von Humboldt]] at the National Library, a seismological station, a new theater in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, primary schools, new buildings for ministries, and new large schools for teachers.\"<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''I Speak of the City: Mexico City at the Turn of the Twentieth Century''.

However, the regime concentrated resources and wealth in the hands of a few people. The majority of the nation languished in poverty. Social injustice led to nationwide revolts, and ultimately the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910\u20131917). The city was not untouched by the revolution. Battles were fought on its streets, and thousands of displaced villagers became refugees in the city. During the revolution, the city was briefly taken over by the famous revolutionaries [[Pancho Villa|Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]].<ref name=\"citydata\"/> While most of the Mexican Revolution was not fought within the city, one major episode of this era was. [[La decena tr\u00e1gica]] (\"The Ten Tragic Days\") was a series of events leading to a coup d'\u00e9tat in Mexico City between 9&nbsp;and 22 February 1913 against President [[Francisco I. Madero]] and his vice president, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]]. After deposing President Porfirio D\u00edaz and taking power in 1911, Mexicans expected Madero to make widespread changes in government but were surprised and disappointed to find Madero following many of the same policies and employing the same personnel as the D\u00edaz government. This eventually resulted in revolts against the Madero regime. Madero's fear of these revolts led him to commission [[Victoriano Huerta]] as chief general of the [[Huerta's Federal Army|Federal Army]]. Huerta was effective in putting down rebellions, but had ambitions that Madero was blind to.  Military success gave Huerta power, and he saw an opportunity to make himself dictator.  La decena tr\u00e1gica began when military academy cadets quartered in [[Tacubaya]] revolted and began an attack against the National Palace. Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez returned to the Palace to address the crisis, calling in reserves from other military academies and the forces of [[Felipe \u00c1ngeles]] in [[Cuernavaca]] to assist in defense. Meanwhile, Huerta convinced Madero to allow him to take over defense of the National Palace. Huerta betrayed Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez forcing Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez to sign resignations. On the night of 22 February, Huerta ordered Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez to be transferred to the [[Palacio de Lecumberri|Lecumberri prison]], supposedly to be held for transfer to exile. Before the car reached the prison, it was pulled over by armed men and Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez were shot and killed.<ref name=\"redescolar\">{{cite web \n|url= http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/sigloxx/xx_dece.htm \n|title= La Decena Tr\u00e1gica, febrero de 1913 \n|language= Spanish \n|accessdate= 19 October 2008 \n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130620151846/http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/sigloxx/xx_dece.htm \n|archive-date= 20 June 2013 \n|url-status= dead \n}}</ref>\n\n==20th century to present==\n===Loss of democracy and recovery===\n[[File:Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas (cropped).jpg|80px|thumb|left|Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]]\nMexico City lost its democratically-elected mayor and legislature/city council in 1928, which left its urban middle class and workers without legislative redress. The [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|mayor]] was appointed by the President of Mexico.  Residents of the densely populated capital became dependent on the newly formed [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Party of National Revolution (PNR)]] to dress its concerns.  During the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas presidency (1934\u201340), the government reduced spending in the capital, leaving infrastructure, such as water, sewage, lighting, without resources. C\u00e1rdenas did not implement rent control or aid urban renters, and in 1938\u201339, renters attempted to gain advantage by organizing rent strikes. The middle class and the urban poor joined in the attempt.<ref>Davis, Diane. \"Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Organizaciones Populares, CNOP\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

Many street names were changed to commemorate the deeds of revolutionary heroes, including [[Francisco Madero]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]], whose democratically-elected government was overthrown by military coup in 1913.\n\n===Growth of the city===\n[[File:Mexico City seen from Torre Latinoamericana.JPG|thumb|left|Mexico City as seen from the [[Torre Latinoamericana]], looking toward the [[Z\u00f3calo]]]]\nIn 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.<ref name=\"larosa\"/> By the end of the 19th century, the perimeter of the city had noticeably grown again and by 1929, the boundaries lost any sense of regularity. The city had grown to reach Tacuba, [[Nextengo]], Popotla, east of now [[Metro San L\u00e1zaro]] and [[Metro Tasque\u00f1a]], [[Miguel \u00c1ngel de Quevedo]] to the south and [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] and Azcapotzalco to the west and north as the last of the lake dried up.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> The city continued to modernize at a rapid pace. Old palaces and colonial homes were demolished to make way for new roads and modern buildings. By 1924, [[Avenida de los Insurgentes]], considered today one of the world's longest avenues, was being laid out.<ref name=\"citydata\"/>\n\nThe city would begin to extend south starting in 1905, breaking the [[Chapultepec aqueduct|Avenida Chapultepec/Arcos de Belen]] southern boundary that had existed for centuries. Colonia Hidalgo (now [[Colonia Doctores]]) was being established with [[Colonia Obrera]] and [[Colonia Roma]] being laid out in a rectangular fashion, similar to the older part of the city.  Obrera was named after the artisans that populated the place when it was established, and Roma was for the upper-classes, reaching the height of its splendor between 1917 and 1922.  Another wealthy neighborhood that was established at this time was [[Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico City|Colonia Ju\u00e1rez]], naming their streets after the capitals of Europe. In the first decades of the 20th century, the city extended north to the R\u00edo de Consulado, east to [[Metro Jamaica]], west to [[Chapultepec]] and south to roughly were the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|Secretariat of Communications and Transportation]] building at Xola is now.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nFrom the 1930s on, Mexico City would see an increase in the rate of growth of the city. Colonias Roma and Ju\u00e1rez prospered rapidly and this with the wide Paseo de Reforma to help with transportation, led to the establishments of colonias heading west such as [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] and [[Condesa|Hipodromo]], extending the city past the Chapultepec forest (now a park). The extension of Insurgentes Avenue southward to where the [[Metro Chilpancingo|Chilpancingo Metro station]] is now, led to the establishment of even more colonias. Between 1928 and 1953, other western colonias such as [[Colonia Anzures|Anzures]], and [[Polanco, Mexico City|Polanco]] for the wealthy, and colonias [[Colonia 20 de Noviembre|20 de Noviembre]], [[Colonia Bondojito|Bondojito]], [[Colonia Gertrudis Sanchez|Gertrudis S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Colonia Petrolera|Petrolera]] for the working class arose with another additional 585 colonias.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nBy 1940 Mexico City had become not only the political and economic capital of Mexico, but also the world's largest [[megalopolis]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Planning Latin America's Capital Cities, 1850\u20131950| editors=Arturo Almandoz & Arturo Almandoz Marte|publisher=Psychology Press |year=2002|isbn=9780415272650|pages=140}}</ref> Between 1929 and 1953, growth spread east to establish colonias [[Colonia Federal|Federal]], [[Colonia Moctezuma|Moctezuma]] and [[Colonia Jardin Balbuena|Jard\u00edn Balbuena]], to the north and urban area included all of Azcapotzalco and reached [[Ampliacion Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez]] including Ticoman, [[Zacatenco]] and [[Santa Isabel Tola]]. To the west, the most notable growth was from [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] west to the limits of the [[State of Mexico]]. Areas such as [[Tacubaya]], [[Villa de Guadalupe, Mexico City|Villa de Guadalupe]], [[Coyoac\u00e1n]] and San \u00c1ngel were still considered separate entities.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> A major infrastructure project for mass transit was the ring road, or ''Anillo Perif\u00e9rico'', completed in 1964.

The column with the [[Angel of Independence]] was erected in 1910 for the centenary of Mexican Independence, the ironwork [[Congress of Mexico|Legislative Palace]], [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] and a building called La Nacional.  The first skyscraper, 40-story [[Torre Latinoamericana]] was built in the 1950s. All of these were in the main core of the city, laid out in the sixteenth century.\n\nA major departure in location and scale was the construction of the [[University City of Mexico|Ciudad Universitaria]] from 1950 to 1953 in the south of the city.  It had a noticeable effect on subsequent architecture in the city. The most notable buildings are the Rector\u00eda designed by [[Salvador Ortega]], [[Mario Pani]] and [[Enrique del Moral]], the Library, by [[Juan O'Gorman]], [[Gustavo Saavedra]] and [[Juan Mart\u00ednez de Velasco]] and the Science Building by [[Ra\u00fal Cacho]], [[Eugenio Peschard]] and [[F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez]].<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> Much of what makes the campus culturally significant is its huge murals that decorate the facades of many of the buildings.  These murals were done by [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]] and others, with themes relating to [[History of Mexico|Mexican history]] and identity.<ref name=\"ciudadmexico\"/>\n[[File:Palacio de los Deportes.JPG|thumb|left|Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]] brought about the construction of large sporting facilities such as the [[Palacio de los Deportes]] (Sports Palace), the [[Vel\u00f3dromo Ol\u00edmpico]] and the 24 buildings of the Olympic Village.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> \n[[File:Mexico_City_Metro_System_Map_(2013-03-01).png|thumb|left|[[Mexico City Metro lines]]]]\n[[File:AdoratoriodeEh\u00e9catlMetroPinoDF.JPG|thumb|left|Aztec sculpture of [[Ehecatl]] unearthed in 1967 during the construction of the Metro, which remains in the center of the Metro Pino Su\u00e1rez station]] \n[[File:Metro Cuahutemoc.jpg|thumb|left|Sign for Line 1 [[Metro Cuauht\u00e9moc]]. Lines use a single color; stations have an icon associated with the station's name. \"Cuauhtemoc\" is named for the last Aztec emperor, whose name translates to \"falling eagle\" and the icon is of an eagle head.]]\nThe construction of the [[Mexico City Metro]] was not ready in time for the 1968 Olympics, but in 1969, [[Mexico City Metro Line 1|Line 1, the \"Pink Line\"]] the underground rapid transit system of the city, was inaugurated by President [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]].<ref name=\"ciudadmexico\"/> The subway system was a huge infrastructure project, designed to be mass transit for those in Mexico City without cars.  There had been proposals for a subway system dating back decades, but political forces in favor of car owners (middle class and elites) blocked the plans for underground mass transit. The subway system allows for movement of large numbers of people to increasingly far flung areas of the city. When the [[University City of Mexico|Ciudad Universitaria]] opened, which relocated [[UNAM]] to the south of the city, there was no metro line.\n\nExplosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to 8,831,079.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> Under relentless growth, Mexico City had lost its charm by the 1970s, when the government could barely keep up with services. Mexico City was choking in smog and pollution. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge [[shanty town]]s that extended for many miles.<ref name=\"citydata\"/>\n\nMexico City is still the cultural, economic, and industrial center for the nation. With a metropolitan-area population approaching 20 million, roughly equivalent to the entire state of Texas, it is a magnet of growth. People in large numbers still migrate from rural areas to the city in search of work and the other economic. Many of these immigrants settle illegally in the urban fringe with the hope that the government will eventually provide public services. The provision of water and wastewater service for the growing population of Mexico City is the problem air pollution was in the 1970s and 1980s. Such growth rates and patterns mean substandard potable water supplies and waste water treatment, if they exist at all. Over 70% of Mexico City's potable water from the aquifer below it, which is being [[overexploited]], causing the city to sink.<ref name=\"water\">{{cite book \n|title= Mexico City's Water Supply : Improving the Outlook for Sustainability\n\n|year= 1995 \n|publisher= National Academies Press \n|location= Washington, D.C., USA \n|page= 4 }}</ref>\n\nThe south of the Federal District contains a number of ecological reserves; one of the most important being the [[Ajusco]] reserve. Growth pushing of the edges of this reserve has been causing both economic and political struggles which include fraudulent real estate schemes, illegal development of [[ejido|ejidal]] property, along with popular resistance and opposition movements. A major problem is the illegal movement of the poor building shantytowns, then resisting eviction, often with violence, often until the government gives into demands to build popular-sector housing in the area.  While such housing is needed, the whole process is ecologically destructive.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite book \n|title= Livable Cities? : Urban Struggles for Livelihood and Sustainability \n|editor=Evans, Peter B.\n|year= 2002 \n|location= Ewing, New Jersey, USA \n|pages= 196|publisher =University of California Press }}</ref>\n\n===Decline and revitalization of the city center===\nFrom Aztec times, the [[Centro (Mexico City)|Centro Hist\u00f3rico]] used to be where the wealthy and elite lived.  However, in the early 20th century, these classes began to move to areas west and southwest of the Centro, to neighbourhoods such as [[Colonia Ju\u00e1rez (Mexico City)|Colonia Ju\u00e1rez]], [[Colonia Cuauht\u00e9moc, Mexico City|Colonia Cuauht\u00e9moc]], [[Colonia Roma]] and [[Condesa|Colonia Condesa]]. The Centro remained the commercial, political and intellectual center through the mid 20th century, although it was around this time that [[UNAM]] moved most of its facilities to the new Ciudad Universitaria.<ref name=\"Lonely\"/> The reason for the decline of the city center was partly man-made and partly natural.  In the 1940s, the city government froze rents so that until 1998, when the government repealed the law, tenants were still paying what they were in the 1950s. With no financial incentive to keep up their properties, landlords let their buildings disintegrate. The [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|1985 earthquake]] took its toll on a number of these structures, which were never fixed or rebuilt, leading to slums with and garbage-strewn vacant lots. The result was the loss of about 100,000&nbsp;residents of the \"Colonia Centro\", leaving the area almost deserted at night.<ref name=\"belated\">{{cite journal \n|last=Butler \n|first=Ron \n|date=September 2002 \n|title=Center of Belated Attention \n|journal=Economist \n|volume=364 \n|issue=8290 \n|pages=37 \n}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1980s, so much had fled the Centro that many of its former mansions were either abandoned or turned into tenements for the poor,<ref name=\"Lonely\"/><ref name=\"facelift\">{{cite journal \n|last=Smith \n|first=Geri \n|date=May 2004 \n|title=Mexico City gets a face-lift \n|journal=Business Week \n|issue=3884 \n|id=00077135 \n}}</ref> and its sidewalks and streets taken over by [[pickpocket]]s and milling vendors.<ref name=\"belated\"/><ref name=\"facelift\"/> For many people, especially international visitors, Mexico City's reputation for pollution, traffic and crime has made the city someplace \"get into and out of as fast as you can,\"<ref name=\"facelift\"/> seeing it as little more than an airport through which to make their connecting flights to the more attractive resort areas.<ref name=\"belated\"/><ref name=\"facelift\"/> Until recently, many of the restaurants of the area, even the best, would close early to allow employees time to get home because the area was not particularly safe at night.<ref name=\"newface\">{{cite journal \n|last=Butler \n|first=Ron \n|date=Nov\u2013Dec 1999 \n|title=A New Face for the Zocalo \n|journal=Americas \n|volume=51 \n|issue=6 \n|pages=4\u20136 \n|id=03790940 \n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AllendeStreetCentroDF.JPG|thumb|Allende Street near Tacuba Street.

Starting in the early 2000s, it infused 500&nbsp;million [[Mexican peso|pesos]] (US$55&nbsp;million) into the Historic Center Trust<ref name=\"belated\"/> and entered into a partnership with a business group led by [[Carlos Slim]], to buy dozens of centuries-old buildings and other real estate to rehabilitate.<ref name=\"facelift\"/> Work began with renovating 34&nbsp;blocks west of the Z\u00f3calo, digging up the antiquated drainage system and improving water supply. An architect was put in charge of each of the thirteen main streets to restore the facades of more than 500&nbsp;buildings.<ref name=\"belated\"/> The latest infrastructure projects of this type have been centered on the southeast portions of the area, on Rep\u00fablica de El Salvador, Talavera, Correo Mayor, Mesones and Pino Su\u00e1rez streets, mostly focusing on repaving streets and updating the very old drainage system of the area.  In the process, the construction is unearthing artifacts from the pre-Hispanic period to the present day.<ref name=\"Jornada\">{{cite news|first=Cruz |last=Alejandro |title=Arrasa con vestigios prehisp\u00e1nicos rescate del Centro Hist\u00f3rico |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2008/08/30/arrasan-con-vestigios-prehispanicos-obras-urbanas |publisher=La Jornada |date=30 August 2008 |accessdate=2 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901214403/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2008/08/30/arrasan-con-vestigios-prehispanicos-obras-urbanas |archivedate=1 September 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAll over the historic center, streets have been pedestrianized, buildings have been remodeled and restored, and new museums opened.  In the 1990s, after many years of controversy, protests and even riots, most street vendors were evicted to other parts of the city.<ref name=\"Lonely\"/> The impetus to bring things back to the city center included the construction of the new mayoral residence just off the Z\u00f3calo.<ref name=\"newface\"/> The government has buried electric and telephone cables in the area, and replaced old asphalt with paving stones. It has also installed nearly 100&nbsp;security cameras to help with crime issues.<ref name=\"facelift\"/> This paved the way for the opening of upscale eateries, bars and fashionable stores.<ref name=\"Lonely\"/> Also, young people are moving into downtown lofts. To attract more tourists, there are new red double-decker buses.<ref name=\"facelift\"/>\n\n===The city's political position===\n[[File:1985 Mexico Earthquake - Pina Suarez Apartment Complex.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Apartment Complex Pino Su\u00e1rez, in the wake of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.]]\nFrom the days of the Aztecs, Mexico City has been the center of power for much of Mesoamerica and the Mexican nation. This centralism simply changed hands when the Spanish arrived, The [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI), which came to power after the Mexican Revolution, again consolidated political power to the city, which benefited to the detriment of other parts of the country. The rapid expansion of Mexico City is related to the country's economic development in the period after World War II, the widening of the manufacturing sector, the success of the oil industry, and the country's proximity to U.S. markets. This growth allowed for the tolerance of PRI's authoritarianism.<ref name=\"larosa\"/> It still experienced economic growth up to the 1960s, but problems brought on by the one-party system were beginning to show. In 1968, Mexico City hosted the Summer Olympic Games. The event was meant to signal the prosperity of a developing nation, but serious problems had been masked by the PRI's authoritarian regime. Shortly before the inauguration of the Games, [[Tlatelolco massacre|government troops massacred]] an unknown number of protesting students in Tlatelolco.<ref name=\"citydata\"/> However, the last straw may have been the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]].

The event caused between three and four billion USD in damage as 412&nbsp;buildings collapsed and another 3,124&nbsp;were seriously damaged in the city.

C\u00e1rdenas promised a more democratic government, and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. He resigned in 1999 to run (unsuccessfully) for the presidency.

At its height, Tenochtitlan had enormous temples and palaces, a huge ceremonial center, residences of political, religious, military, and merchants.

This led to the founding of a number of semi-autonomous urban centers around [[Lake Texcoco]] each claiming legitimacy as descendants of the Toltecs. By the early 16th century, at least a dozen of these city-states had reached 10,000 in population with Tenochtitlan by far the largest at 150,000 and perhaps as high as 200,000.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/><ref>Frances F.

Their god [[Huitzilopochtli]] told them to go and look for a promised land. They first arrived around the territory known as [[Culiac\u00e1n]] by 960&nbsp;CE, but then left and returned to Aztlan.<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/> Wandering from Aztlan again around the year \"1 Tecpatl\" or 1064\u201365 according to the codices [[Codex Chimalpahin|Chimalpahin]], [[Codex Aubin|Aubin]] and the [[Anales de Tlalteloco]], they soon arrived at [[P\u00e1tzcuaro]]. They thought that was the land promised to them by Huitzilopochtli, but the god told them to continue. They went east and arrived at [[Chapultepec]], on the edge of what was then [[Lake Texcoco]]. The god told them that their promised land was close but that they would have to fight for it. Their first opponent was a chief named C\u00f3pil, son of a witch named [[Malinalxochitl]] and sister of Huitzilopochtli. The Mexica surrounded C\u00f3pil's forces, captured and sacrificed the chief's heart to Huitzilopochtli.<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/>\n[[File:FundacionMexicoDF.JPG|thumb|Nineteenth-century Painting of the Foundation of Tenochtitlan by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Jara]]]]\nHowever, their arrival was still opposed by the lords of [[Azcapotzalco (altepetl)|Azcapotzalco]], [[Tlacopan]], [[Coyoac\u00e1n]] and [[Colhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]]. At first they tried diplomacy to convince the Mexica to leave. The Mexica fought these lords and lost, retreating to a place called Acocolco and hid in the marshes, becoming subjects of a people named the Colhuas. Two years later, the Colhuas asked the Mexicas to fight with them against [[Xochimilco]]. While the Mexica impressed the Colhuas with their battle skills, they were expelled again when they sacrificed the hearts of their captives to Huitzilopochtli. They went to Tizapan. After that, they wandered the rim of Lake Texcoco. The migration lasted around 260 years; from 1064 to 1065 to 1325.\n[[File:MoctezumaChapultepec.JPG|thumb|left|Moctezuma in Chapultepec by Daniel del Valle]]\nThe god indicated that they were getting closer when they arrived at a place called [[Nexticpan]], which is where the [[San Antonio Abad Hospital]] is now, and later to a place called Mixiuhcan, now the colonia of [[Magdalena Mixiuhcan]]. They wandered another 36&nbsp;years knowing that they were extremely close. Then they sent two priests named [[Axol\u00f3hua]] and [[Cuauhcoatl]] to look for the sign promised by their god. The two found an islet near the western shore of Lake Texcoco surrounded by green water. In the middle of the islet was a [[nopal]] and perched upon it was an eagle with its wings spread and its face looking toward the sun. When the eagle left, Axol\u00f3hua submerged himself into the waters around the island and Cuaucoatl went back to report what he saw. The people were confused because what the two priests had seen was only part of the sign they were told to expect. Twenty-four hours later Axol\u00f3hua returned stating that while underwater, he saw the god [[Tlaloc]] who told him that they did indeed find the place and that they were welcome. They moved to the islet and began to construct their city. Later versions of the story have a snake in the eagle's mouth. The Mexica called their city Tenochtitlan meaning \"place of the nopal,\" referring to the myth of its discovery. [[Gongora]] gives the day 18 July 1327, but at least three other codices (Azcatitlan, Mexicanus and Mendoza) placed the time of its founding in the year 1325, and los Anales de Tlatelolco adds the day-sign \"1 Zipaktli,\" correlated to the beginning of [[summer solstice]] on 20 June.\n\n===Tenochtitlan at its height===\n[[File:Aztec Empire c 1519.png|thumb|extent of Aztec empire]]\nThirteen years after the founding of Tenochtitlan, the population of the islet had grown and there was internal strife.  A portion of the population left and went to the nearby island of [[Tlatelolco (altepetl)|Tlatelolco]], establishing a monarchy there, with their first ruler being [[Acamapitzin]].  Shortly thereafter, the people of Tenochtitlan had their own monarchy. The two cities became rivals. Eventually, Tenochtitlan conquered Tlatelolco eliminating its rulers and incorporated the city into Tenochtitlan and was named Mexico which some natives didn't like.<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/>\n\nAt its height, just before the Spanish arrived, Tenochtitlan was the center of the vast Aztec Empire, stretching from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts and south towards the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] and [[Oaxaca]]. With a vast income of tribute, Tenochtitlan grew to become one of the largest and richest urban areas in the world at that time. The city had services and infrastructure that was unheard of in the rest of the world: potable water brought in by aqueducts, drainage systems and wide, paved streets. Their markets boasted of products from nearly every part of [[Mesoamerica]].<ref name=\"ciudadmexico\"/>\n[[File:Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|left|diagram of Tenochtitlan]]\n\nTenochtitlan roughly correlates with the historic center of modern Mexico City.

The calpullis were named Cuepopan, Atzacualco, Moyotla and Zoquipan, which had subdivisions and a \"tecpan\" or district council for each one.

The towers, temples and canoes filled with crowds who gathered to look at the strange men and their horses. Moctezuma came out from the center of Tenochtitlan onto the causeway to greet them. The two processions met at the entrance to the city. Moctezuma was in a litter draped with fine cotton mantles and borne on the shoulders of a number of lords. He emerged from the litter and the two leaders exchanged gifts. The Aztecs led the Spaniards into the heart of the city where Moctezuma gave them with more gifts and then quartered them in lavish apartments. However, Aztec accounts of the first meeting indicate that Moctezuma was too deferent and generous to the newcomers.<ref name=\"pbs1\"/> An Aztec account relates how the people of Tenochtitlan felt: \"as if everyone had eaten stupefying mushrooms..., as if they had seen something astonishing. Terror dominated everyone, as if all the world were being disembowelled....

While the Spaniards marveled at the city's artifacts and strange foods, they were horrified by the religious rites involving human sacrifice and, being vastly outnumbered, Cortes worried greatly that Moctezuma was plotting to destroy him.  So on 16 November, Cort\u00e9s detained Moctezuma, placing him under house arrest. In this way, Cort\u00e9s hoped to rule through the emperor. However, Moctezuma's power was dwindling in the eyes of his people. The Aztecs grew ever more resentful of the Spaniards' attacks on their religion and their relentless demands for gold. Resistance broke out on one of the lakeside settlements, which Cort\u00e9s tried to quell by having a formal ceremony where the emperor swore allegiance to the Spanish king. He also tried to have the Mexica [[Cult image|idols]] in the [[Templo Mayor|main temple]] replaced by Christian ones or at least put them side by side.<ref name=\"pbs2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_f00.html \n|title= November, 1519 Montezuma Arrested \n|accessdate= 17 October 2008}}</ref> To add to Cort\u00e9s' troubles, the Spanish governor of [[Cuba]] sent an arrest party for Cort\u00e9s, as his orders were not to conquer but simply to trade.

Indian cooperation in the destruction of Aztec power ensured that Cort\u00e9s would have to take allied interests into consideration as well.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> In a number of ways, this made the Spaniards another factor in the ongoing political conflicts between rival native peoples, not to mention that Spanish were vastly outnumbered. For much of the colonial period, parts of Mexico City would remain very indigenous in character, with elements of these cultures surviving into modern times.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> Two separate parts of the capital were under indigenous rule, San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco, with Nahua governors who were intermediaries between the indigenous population and the Spanish rulers, although the capital was designated a ''ciudad de espa\u00f1oles'' (Spanish city).,<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 368</ref>\n\nCort\u00e9s did not establish an independent, conquered territory under his own personal rule, but remained loyal to the [[Habsburg]] Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who was also King of Spain and its associated European territories.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> Although Cort\u00e9s was portrayed to the Spanish court as an ambitious and untrustworthy adventurer by his enemies, he sought to prove his loyalty.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> First, he wrote the ''Five Letters'' to explain what he had done and why, and between 1528 and 1530, he traveled to see the emperor in [[Toledo, Spain]]. However, the emperor decided not to appoint him as governor of [[New Spain]] but instead the noble hereditary title of Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, with vast numbers of tributary Indians there and elsewhere. The first [[viceroy]] Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] of the new [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] arrived in Mexico City fourteen years later. But Mexico City had long since been the major settlement of \"conquerors and immigrant [Spaniards, who] for their own reasons already made ... Mexico City their principal [seat]\" before the establishment of the high court (Audiencia), the archbishop, and the viceroy.<ref>James Lockhart, \"Trunk Lines and Feeder Lines: The Spanish Reaction to American Resources,\" in ''Of Things of the Indies: Essays Old and New in Early Latin American History'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1999, p. 142-43.</ref> The town council (''cabildo'') of the city had power that extended far beyond the city's established borders, due to the existence of areas on the mainland that in the prehispanic period were subordinate to Tenochtitlan. Such was approved by Charles V in 1522, authorizing the city to step into rural affairs to \"protect and benefit\" Indians as well as the Spanish.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nBetween late 1521 and mid-1522, Alonso Garc\u00eda Bravo and [[:es:Bernardino V\u00e1zquez de Tapia|Bernardino V\u00e1zquez de Tapia]] were tasked with the layout of the new Spanish city.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  They were assisted by two Aztecs, but their names are lost to history. The Spaniards decided to keep the main north\u2013south and east\u2013west roads that divided the city into four and the boundaries of the city were set with an area of 180&nbsp;hectares, which was divided into 100 blocks. There were eight principal canals in the Aztec city, including the one that ran on the south side of the main plaza (today [[Z\u00f3calo]]), which were renamed.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nAround the main plaza, which became the Plaza Mayor or [[Z\u00f3calo]] in the colonial period, Cort\u00e9s took over what were the \"Old Houses\" of [[Axayacatl]] and the \"New Houses\" of Moctezuma, both grand palaces, for his own.  Other conquistadors of the highest rank took positions around this square. In the northeast corner, [[Gil Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00e1vila]] built his house at the foot of the old Aztec main temple. To the south, on what is now Avenida Pino Su\u00e1rez were the homes of [[Pedro de Alvarado]], and the Altamirano family, cousins of Cort\u00e9s. To the north of the plaza, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s established a monastery, in an area now known as [[Santo Domingo (Mexico City)|Santo Domingo]]. Most of these houses were built to be residences, warehouses or stores, and fortresses all at once.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nThe Spaniards began to build houses, copying the luxury residences of [[Seville]]. Being of firmer ground and less subject to subsidize, the area east of the main plaza was built up first, with the lake's waters up against the walls of a number of these constructions. The west side grew more slowly as flooding was more of an issue, and it was farther from the city's docks that brought in needed supplies.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nThe Spanish may well have found \"Tenochtitlan\" hard to say. They did shift the accent from Nahuatl pronunciation from Tenocht\u00edtlan (with the standard emphasis on the penultimate syllable) to Tenochtitl\u00e1n.<ref>Ida Altman et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Pearson 2003, p. 7, no.2</ref> and eventually adopted the city's secondary name \"Mexico\", the \"place of the Mexica\" or Aztecs.  For a period, the city was called by the dual name Mexico-Tenochtitlan,<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford University Press 1964, 368.</ref> but at some point, the capital of the viceroyalty's name was shortened to Mexico.  The name \"Tenochtilan\" endured in one of the capital's two indigenous-ruled sections, known as San Juan Tenochtitlan.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs under Spanish Rule'', p. 371.</ref>\n\n==Colonial period 1521\u20131821==\n{{See also|List of colonial churches in Mexico City|Spanish Colonial architecture}}\n[[File:Palacio Nacional, M\u00e9xico D.F., M\u00e9xico, 2013-10-16, DD 119.JPG|thumb|left|[[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace, Mexico City]], built by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and acquired by the Spanish crown to be the palace of the viceroy.]]\n\n===Growth of city===\nAfter the conquest, the Spaniards generally left the existing Nahua city-states or [[altepetl]] largely intact, but Mexico City was an exception since it became the seat of Spanish political power.  It was established as a ''ciudad de espa\u00f1oles'' (city of Spaniards) and initially kept the remnants of its prehispanic place name, being called \"Mexico-Tenochtitlan\".<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 368.</ref> No longer the seat of Aztec power, the Spaniards allowed two areas to be ruled through Nahua governors (''gobernadores'') and town councils (''cabildos''), separate from the Spanish city council.  San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco became the mechanism for the crown to rule through indigenous intermediaries, particularly important in the Spanish capital since it also had a significant indigenous population.  San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco were not called by the Nahuatl term for polity, altepetl, but rather \"partes\" or \"parcialidades\" of Mexico City, with their new place names having a Christian saint's name preceding the [[Precolombian|prehispanic]] designation, in typical colonial fashion.<ref name=\"Gibson, p. 371\">Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', p. 371.</ref> The structure in these two indigenous-ruled sections of the capital were on the same pattern of Indian towns elsewhere in central Mexico.  In the sixteenth century, these indigenous political structures mobilized tribute and labor rendered to the Spanish capital.<ref name=\"Gibson, p. 371\"/> Even though prehispanic Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolco was built on an island in the middle of the major lake system, they had political power over holdings on the mainland, a standard pattern of scattered rather than compact settlement and rule. These mainland holdings or ''estancias'' rendered tribute and labor in the prehispanic period; in the colonial period this pattern continued during the early colonial period, but during the later period (ca. 1650\u20131821), the pattern broke down and estancias were separated.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', p. 371-72.</ref>\n\nThe city grew with buildings all near the same height and with the same terraced roofs ''(azoteas)'', with only the tower and cross of the convent of San Francisco peaking up from above it all. This profile was due to royal decree.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Even the [[Mexico City Cathedral|new cathedral]] being built had limitations as to its height.  Near the end of the 16th century however, there was a proliferation of churches with bell towers, leading to a zigzag profile of the city, which was then later modified by church [[cupola]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} For centuries afterward, this profile remained constant with only the continuous building of the main Cathedral making any change in the [[skyline]]. In the 19th century, the tallest structures were all churches. In addition to the Cathedral, there were the bell towers and cupolas of Santa Teresa la Antigua, the College of Saints Peter and Paul and the chapel of San Felipe Neri as landmarks.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nThe new city inherited much of the old city's look, oriented to the four cardinal directions with both canals and streets to move people and goods.  However, the canals had already begun to shrink due to efforts to make the land streets wider.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}The first public building was called Las Atarazanas, where the [[brigantine]]s used to lay siege to Tenochititlan were kept, at a place called [[Metro San L\u00e1zaro|San L\u00e1zaro]]. Shortly thereafter, the [[Federal District buildings|Palacio de Ayuntamiento]] was started, with the first coin production facilities. Mechlor D\u00e1vila built the [[Old Mercantile Center|Portales de Mercadores]] on the southwest side of the main plaza. Las Casas Consistoriales was built on the south side next to the Palacio de Ayuntamiento, which later became known as the Casa de las Flores.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nThe first extension of the originally-laid city occurred on the north and east sides, taking over lands originally held by native peoples.  One example is the neighborhood known as Lecumberri, founded by Basques, meaning \"new, good land.\"<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nIn 1600, the city grew again, towards the east to what is now the Circuito Interior and to the north towards Tlatelolco, which was then called Real de Santa Ana, stopping at the Calzada de los Misterios, which was a pre-Hispanic processional route to the sanctuary of [[Tonantzin]], the mother of the gods in Tepeyac.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\n===Flooding, the Desag\u00fce, and Environmental Changes===\nSince Mexico City was built on an island in the center of a large but shallow lake system, flooding became a serious issue during the colonial period.  Spaniards denuded hillsides of their trees from the early conquest era on, so that mud and silt made the lake system even shallower, exacerbating the periodic flooding.  Spaniards had not maintained the Aztec drainage system, which included a major dike. Major floods in Mexico City were recorded in 1555, 1580, 1604, and 1607, Indian labor was diverted when crown officials undertook a major project to divert water via a drainage system, known as the ''[[Desag\u00fce]]''. In 1607, 4,500 Indians were drafted to build the 8-mile-long combination drainage ditch and tunnel and 1608, the work was continued with 3,000.<ref>Louisa Schell Hoberman, \"Bureaucracy and Disaster: Mexico City and the Flood of 1629,\" Journal of Latin American Studies, 6(2), November 1974, p. 224.</ref><ref>Richard Boyer, ''La gran inundaci\u00f3n: Vida y sociedad en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (1629\u20131638)'', Mexico: Sep Setentas 1975.</ref><ref>Vera Candiani. \"The Desag\u00fce Reconsidered: Environmental Dimensions of Class Conflict in Colonial Mexico.\" ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 92.1 (2012) 5\u201339.</ref> Flooding was controlled in the short term, and in subsequent years the Desag\u00fce infrastructure was not maintained.  In 1629, rains inundated the capital and flood waters remained in the capital for the next few years. Viceroy Don [[Rodrigo Pacheco, 3rd Marquis of Cerralvo]], the Mexico City council (cabildo), secular and regular clergy, and elite Spanish residents of Mexico City combined efforts to provide immediate relief, and taxes and diversion of Indian labor to construction of the Desag\u00fce aimed at dealing with the long-term problem of flooding. A number of Spaniards moved to dry land to the nearby settlement of [[Coyoac\u00e1n]] (now part of Mexico City), increasing the displacement of Indian ownership of land there. In 1630, there was a serious proposal to move the capital to dry land rather than continue dealing with constant flooding.  Elite Mexico City property owners and the city council opposed the plan, since they would incur huge real estate losses.<ref>Hoberman, ibid. pp. 226\u2013227.</ref> There was another major push to deal with flooding, but the pattern of neglect of the desag\u00fce infrastructure and subsequent inundation of the capital recurred, with flooding in 1645, 1674, 1691, 1707, 1714, 1724, 1747 and 1763.<ref>Hoberman, ibid., p. 228.</ref> Floods continued into the early republic after independence. \n\nFrom the early eighteenth century, the city was able to grow as the waters of the lake receded. In 1700, the city advanced towards the east and south and west, as the north was still bounded by water. To the west, it expanded to what is now Balderas Street. In the latter half of the 18th century the populated area reached eastward to the lakeshore, which then was just beyond the now Circuito Interior and the [[La Merced Market, Mexico City|La Merced Market]]. To the south began to appear houses in an area now called [[Colonia Doctores]]. To the west, following what is now Avenida Chapultepec towards the Ciudadela, now the National Library, near [[Metro Balderas]]. To the north past Tlatelolco and to the south to Topacioa and the now Calzada de la Viga.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nAfter independence, there were continued attempts to complete the drainage project, with activity in the early 1830s.  During the U.S. invasion of the valley of Mexico, its army made a study of the problem, but the withdrawal of U.S. forces with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo put an end to that attempt.  During the Liberal Reform of the 1850s, there was a revived plan for solving the problem, settling on a plan proposed by Francisco de Garay for a series of open canals to channel water out of the capital and through the mountains.<ref>James A. Garza, \"Conquering the Environment and Surviving Natural Disasters,\" in ''A Companion to Mexican History and Culture''. New York: Wiley-Blackwell 2011, pp. 318\u2013319.</ref><ref>M.

MexicoL Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales 1999,40\u201352.</ref> As public health became more of a concern during the Porfiriato, the stench, uncleanliness, and perceived danger from the capital's water renewed efforts to implement the drainage project. D\u00edaz created a commission to oversee work, but the project went further than merely controlling rainwater and stagnation and sought the expansion of water rights under its control for a growing population. This affected indigenous communities around the lake system.<ref name=\"Garza p. 319\">Garza, \"Conquering the Environment,\" p. 319.</ref> The commission sought foreign loans from the British firm of Pearson and Sons and foreign technology was utilized. The government authorized securing land for area through which the canal was to be built. D\u00edaz considered the Desag\u00fce a top priority, since Mexico's capital was considered a very dangerous place in terms of health.<ref name=\"Garza p. 319\"/>\n\nWhen the engineering project was successfully finished the cycle of flooding finally ended.<ref>Hoberman, ibid., 229-30.</ref> The lake waters ceased to threaten the capital as they disappeared in the modern era.<ref name=\"citydata\"/>\n\n===Political power===\n[[File:Castillo de Chapultepec (Museo Nacional de Historia).JPG|thumb|right|[[Chapultepec Castle]], a neo-classical palace commissioned by Viceroy [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], built 1785-7]]\nBy the 1530s, Mexico City was given jurisdiction over other town councils of New Spain{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and quickly established itself as the most populous and powerful city in the Americas. Like that of the Aztecs, the Spaniards' grasp extended well beyond the capital and the Valley of Mexico\u2014only much farther. As the site of the viceroyalty of New Spain and archbishopric of Mexico, as well as economic elites, Mexico City was the center of power.  Socially, the viceregal government and ecclesiastical authorities remained the pillars of Spanish colonialism. Its prestige as representing civilization allowed the colonial system to function during the long period from the 1640s to the 1760s when crown authorities in Mexico City were too weak politically to regulate much of the economic activities over such a vast territory. These institutions' close association with Mexico City also ensured this city's dominance in the political territory of New Spain, providing the links that kept the vast and expanding empire together.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\n===Religious power===\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral}}\n[[File:MexicoCityCathedralSter.jpg|thumb|The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]], which was under construction during most of the colonial period]]\n[[File:PortalInquisDF.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palace of the Inquisition]], built in the early 18th c.]]\nAs the seat of the Archbishopric of Mexico and the site of many diocesan institutions and those of mendicant orders and the Jesuits, and nunneries, Mexico City had a concentration of religious institutional power. The [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] of Mexico City was built over an extended period of time and designed to show the religious power of the Catholic Church. Built on the Plaza Mayor, or [[Z\u00f3calo]], its architecture reflected several styles of [[Spanish Colonial architecture]].\n\nDespite this concentration of Catholic power, the indigenous population's understanding of Catholic doctrine and practice was not thorough, even in the capital itself. Residual native practices survived and were reflected in the natives' practice of the new faith. Franciscan friar [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] suspected that the emerging cult of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]], which is said to have originated with the vision at Tepeyac Hill to the north of the city's borders in 1531, represented a post-Conquest adoption of the Aztec cult of [[Tonantzin]].<ref>Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''General History of the Things of New Spain: Florentine Codex, Introductory Volume''. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, translators. Salt Lake City: University 1982, p. 90</ref> He was also concerned that the prior cult of Quetzalcoatl would find its way into the new religion by equating this god with the Apostle [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], as an earlier attempt to evangelize the Indians before the Spanish conquest.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\nThe Spanish also brought with them the [[Inquisition]] as a social and political tool. Public hangings and even burnings, not unusual in Europe at the time, were also used in New Spain, especially in Mexico City, as demonstrations of the joint power of the Church and the State over individual actions and social status. One group that suffered during this time were the so-called \"crypto-Jews\" of Portuguese descent. Many converted Portuguese Jews came to New Spain looking for commercial opportunities. In 1642, 150 of these individuals were arrested within three or four days, and the Inquisition began a series of trials on suspicion of still practicing Judaism. Many of these were merchants involved in New Spain's principal economic activities. On 11 April 1649, twelve were burned after being strangled and one person was burned alive. A similar fate was in store for those found guilty of homosexuality. Men were burned at the stake in 1568, 1660, 1673 and 1687 after being denounced. While not as likely to be executed, scholars had to be careful at this time, too. Academics such as Fray Diego Rodr\u00edguez who advocated the separation of science and theology found themselves the subject of investigations by the Holy Office. Booksellers who did not have their inventory approved by the Church faced fines and possible [[excommunication]].<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n<gallery>\nFile:MuseoSCPDF.JPG|Palace of the Archbishop of Mexico City, now a [[Museo de la Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico|museum]]\nFile:ChurchSantoDomingoDF.JPG|[[Santo Domingo (Mexico City)|Church of Santo Domingo, Mexico City]]\nFile:TemploSanFelipeNeriDF.JPG|[[Temple of San Felipe Neri \"La Profesa\"]], 17th c.

The elevation of silver mining as a profession and the ennoblement of silver miners was a development of the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon Reforms]]]]\nEconomically, Mexico City prospered as a result of its primacy. It was the capital of the viceroyalty, seat of the archbishopric, residence of civil and religious officials of all ranks, as well as wealthy merchants who engaged in international trade, but also the center of much regional trade.  The establishment of a [[consulado de mercaderes]] (merchant [[guild]]) in Mexico City indicates the concentration and organization of this economic elite.\n\nThe consulado was founded in Mexico City in 1594, controlled by [[peninsulars|peninsular]] wholesale merchants who dealt in long distance trade, who often married into local elite families with commercial ties. Their assets had to amount to at least 28,000 pesos.  Although they were not supposed to deal in local retail trade, they often did some indirectly.<ref>Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson 2003, p. 178.</ref> They mainly lived in Mexico City and had positions on the city council [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]].

They diversified the assets locally, investing in urban real estate.<ref>Altman, et al., ''Early History of Greater Mexico,'' p. 178.</ref> In the eighteenth century, as [[New Spain]]'s economy boomed, consulados were established in the port of [[Veracruz]] and in [[Guadalajara]] Mexico, indicating increased trade and the expansion of the merchant elite.<ref>Altman, et al., ''Early History of Greater Mexico,'' p. 283.</ref><ref>[[David Brading|D.A.

In fact, the [[Philippines]] were colonized and evangelized from Mexico City rather than directly from Spain itself. From the late 1560s until 1813, the annual [[Manila galleon]] took Mexican silver from the port of [[Acapulco]] across the Pacific Ocean to [[Manila]], in exchange for Chinese silks and [[porcelain]] from [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. The viceroy in Mexico City sought to restrict cargoes and frequency on the grounds that the Asiatic trade diverted silver from the principal route which was to Europe. There were also attempts to restrict, then prohibit, trade between Peru and Mexico City in the late 16th and early 17th century, with the objective of keeping control of Peruvian silver. The overall goal was to keep Spain's colonies dependent on trade with the motherland, rather than with each other and even less with colonies of other European powers. Although the viceroy's attempts were not 100%&nbsp;effective, they were effective enough that Mexico City merchants lost control of the Pacific trade, which fell under the control of contrabandists operating from the smaller ports in [[Guatemala]] and [[Nicaragua]].<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\n=== Population of Mexico City ===\n[[File:Vista de la Plaza Mayor de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico - Cristobal de Villalpando.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Plaza Mayor of Mexico city (ca. 1695) by [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando]]. The painting shows the damage to the viceroy's palace following the riot of 1692.]]\n\n====Size====\nPopulation figures for the city are inexact for Spaniards, mixed-race castas, and indigenous.  Some idea of the indigenous can be discerned from tribute records. In 1525, the city had perhaps 22,000 indigenous inhabitants, dropping precipitously starting around 1550. A figure for Tenochtitlan tributaries in 1562 is 12,971.<ref>Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', figure 17, p. 379; Appendix 4, 460\u2013462.</ref> The estimates of the European population in Mexico City is also imprecise, with figures coming from a variety of sources.  In 1525 there were 150 households occupied by Spaniards, with the European population increasing steadily during the entire colonial period.  The highest estimate for the colonial era is by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who estimated ca. 1802 that there were 67,500 whites in Mexico City.<ref>Gibson, ''Aztecs Under Spanish Rule'', table 27 \"Estimates of the White Population in Mexico City\", p. 381.</ref>\n\nThe size of Mexico City's population and its demographic contours have been enduring questions for crown officials as well as modern scholars.  There were major epidemics that affected the population, starting with the smallpox epidemic of 1520 that was a factor in the [[Spanish Conquest of the Aztec Empire]], but there were other major epidemics throughout the colonial period.  There were estimates taken in the late seventeenth century, with the largest and most detailed census mandated by Viceroy [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Revillagigedo]] in 1790.<ref>Dennis Nod\u00edn Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline of the \u2018'Sociedad de Castas'\u2019 in Mexico City.\" PhD dissertation, University of Michigan 1978.

An 1811 census done by the \u2018'Juzgado de Polic\u00eda'\u2019 put the number even higher, at 168,811, which might well reflect displacement from the countryside from the insurgency of [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and his successors.<ref>Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\" p. 55.

In the early period after the conquest, the Spanish population played a pivotal role in the capital.<ref>[[Ida Altman|Altman, Ida]]. \"Spanish Society in Mexico City after the Conquest.\" ''The Hispanic American Historical Review'', vol. 71, no. 3, 1991, pp. 413\u2013445.

The census of the Intendancy is found in the Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n (M\u00e9xico), Impresos Officiales, 51.</ref> The total number of Mexico City residents counted in 1793 was 104,760 (which excludes 8,166 officials) and in the intendancy as a whole 1,043,223, excluding 2,299 officials.  In both the capital and the intendancy, the European population was the smallest percentage, with 2,335 in the capital (2.2%) and the intendancy 1,330 (.1%).  The listing for Spaniard (espa\u00f1ol) was 50,371 (48.1%), with the intendancy showing 134,695 (12.9%). For [[mestizo]]s (in which he has merged the castizos), in the capital there were 19,357 (18.5%) and in the intendancy 112,113 (10.7%).  For the mulatto category, the capital listed 7,094 (6.8%) with the intendancy showing 52,629 (5.0%).  There is apparently no separate category for blacks (Negros).  The category Indian showed 25,603 (24.4%), with the intendancy with 742,186 (71.1).  The capital thus had the largest concentration of Spaniards and [[castas]], with the countryside being overwhelmingly Indian.  The population of the capital \"indicates that conditions favoring mestizaje were more favorable in the city than the outlying area\" and that there were more high status occupations in the city.<ref>Nodin Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\" p. 58.</ref>\n\nFurther analysis of the two censuses found that the population of the capital was older and had more women.<ref>Nodin Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\", Tables 2.3 and 2.4, p.59</ref> Women migrated to the capital in higher numbers than men from the surrounding countryside.<ref>Nodin Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\", p. 60.</ref>\n\n====Racial Residential Patterns====\nIn studying the 1811 census, there is no absolute segregation by race.<ref>Nodin Vald\u00e9s, \"The Decline\" p. 62; Chart 2.5, p. 64. The census is found in Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n (M\u00e9xico), Padrones 53\u201376.</ref> The highest concentration of Spaniards was around the ''traza'', the central sector of the city where the civil and religious institutions were based and where there was the highest concentration of wealthy merchants. But non-Spaniards also lived there.  Indians were found in higher concentrations in the sectors on the fringes of the capital.

A noble title here did not mean one exercised great political power as one's power was limited even if the accumulation of wealth was not.<ref name=\"Ladd\">{{cite book \n|title= Artes de Mexico Palacios de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a The Mexican Nobility \n|last= Ladd \n|first= Doris M \n|year= 1998 \n|publisher= Artes de Mexico y del Mundo \n|location= Mexico City \n|isbn= 978-968-6533-61-3 \n|pages=84\u201386 }}</ref> Between the 16th and 18th centuries, most of those who had titles gained them after their families had accumulated wealth over several generations. Many of these nobles made their money outside of the capital at large haciendas or in mining but spent their fortunes in the capital. Those who made their money in the city were usually wholesalers from lower social backgrounds. The merchant-financiers became almost as prominent as the landowners because they were the decisive element of the city's economy. Many of the leading figures were of Spanish origin, although their principal economic interests and family connections were within New Spain. For example, the [[Andalusia]]n, [[Pedro Romero de Terreros]], who became Count of [[Regla]] in 1768, made his money in silver mining at [[Real del Monte]], near [[Pachuca]], from 1742. This blending of wealth of landowners and merchant-financiers led to a blending of traditional and modern practices. Matrimony and personal ties continued to be the principal means of solidifying business interests. Nephews, other relatives and friends formed broad networks of interest over a wide geographical area from the capital cities into the countryside and through the span of economic activities.  The landowners, however, remained in a slightly higher social position because their livelihoods stemmed from their close working arrangement with the colonial state.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\nSome landowners' holdings were almost kingdoms. Between the 1730s and the 19th century, the Marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo had amassed properties that combined were about two-thirds the size of Portugal, or {{convert|19000000|acre|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Marquesado de San Miguel de Aguayo y su obra indiana |url=http://www.vacarizu.es/d6/articulo/el-marquesado-de-san-miguel-de-aguayo-y-su-obra-indiana |publisher=vacarizu.es }}</ref> These estates were centered in the modern-day state of [[Durango]], and their specialty was sheep-raising. Meat from their stock supplied Mexico City and [[wool]] was sold to various textile workshops. The Aguayos left these estates in the hands of administrators, backed by armed guards to ward off Indian attack, to live off the revenues in Mexico City, where they possessed four palatial residences. Their title had been awarded in 1682, but the land purchases by the family dated from the 1580s.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\nThe concept of [[Mexican nobility|nobility in Mexico]] was not political but rather a very conservative Spanish social one, based on proving the worthiness of the family, not the individual. For an individual to receive a noble title, he would have to prove his family's bloodline as well as their loyalty to God and king for a number of generations prior. Such a quest was costly but once a title was secured the costs did not stop there.<ref name=\"Ladd\"/>\n\nNobles in New Spain had to continually reinforce their devotion to both God and king.  To show their piety, most nobles donated temporal goods to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], by building churches, funding missionary activities and charities. Sometimes nobles would also hold religious office or give one or more children (usually daughters) to a religious vocation but this was relatively rare. Demonstrating loyalty to king meant paying taxes to maintain their titles, sometimes purchasing military rank as well.<ref name=\"Ladd\"/>\n\nTheir last duty was to maintain a certain show of luxury. It was not a case of \"keeping up with the Jones'\", but rather a requirement of the position.  Families that could not keep up a certain level of luxury were scolded by royal officers as not honoring their title. Such [[conspicuous consumption]] manifested itself in dress, jewels, furniture and especially in the building of mansions and palaces.<ref name=\"Ladd\"/>\n\nThe pressure to build the most opulent residence possible reached its height in the last half of the 18th century. Nobles leveled old buildings, using their Aztec stones and Spanish bricks to build more fashionable [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and Neo classic style mansions. Many of the most costly were on what was called San Francisco street (now [[Madero street]]) and near the [[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]].  Near the Alameda were the homes of the Marquis of Guardiola, of the Borda family and the house of the Marquis of Prado Alegre as well as the home of the Counts of the Valley of Orizaba who covered the entire fa\u00e7ade with [[talavera (pottery)|talavera]] tiles from [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. On San Francisco Street, the most famous house was that of the Marquis of Jaral. It was a former convent that the marquis converted into a replica of the royal palace of [[Palermo]] for his daughter and her [[Sicily|Sicilian]] husband. Later it was the home of [[Felix Calleja]] and then [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], who accepted the crown of Mexico from its balcony. Today it is known as the [[Palace of Iturbide]].<ref name=\"Ladd\"/>\n\nMost of these palaces still remain in the city center. Their abundance led [[Charles Joseph Latrobe]], a man of high standing in Australia, to name Mexico City the \"city of palaces\" in his book \"The rambler in Mexico.\"<ref name=\"Marroqui\"/><ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> This moniker is often erroneously attributed to the famous scientist and savant [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who traveled extensively through New Spain and wrote ''The Political Essay of the Kingdom of New Spain'', published in 1804.\n\nSuch need for pomp made for an extreme social class difference. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] reported that foreigners were often horrified at the differences between how the nobles lived and the misery of the common people.<ref name=\"Ladd\"/> In the late 18th century and early 19th century, there was a strong desire among nobles to transform colonial absolutism to something like an autonomous, constitutional state. More specifically, they looked for more power in the rural regions outside of Mexico City where their holdings were. There was an experience in such decentralization in September 1808, when tensions between the metropolis and the other regions of New Spain were high.  Then regional elites used this situation to subvert the colonial government in the city, turning to popular mobilization against the elite of Mexico City when they failed to subvert the colonial militia.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/>\n\n===The urban poor in Mexico City===\n[[File:NatMontePiedadZocaloDF.JPG|thumb|250px|National Monte de Piedad Building off the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City.]]\nMexico City also has a long tradition of urban poverty, while at the same time being home to the largest concentration of wealthy people in [[New Spain]]. There were institutions designed both to control the urban poor, but also aid them, created by private donors, the Church, and the crown.  The establishment of the [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]], the pawnshop still in operation in modern Mexico City, allowed urban dwellers who had any property at all to pawn access to interest-free, small-scale credit. It was set up in 1777, by the Count of [[Regla]], who had made a fortune in silver mining, and the pawnshop continues to operate as a national institution in the twenty-first century, with its headquarters still right off the [[Z\u00f3calo]] in Mexico City with branches in many other places in Mexico.  The Count of Regla's donation is an example of private philanthropy in the late colonial period. A much earlier example was the endowment that conqueror [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] gave to establish the Hospital de Jes\u00fas, which is the only venue in Mexico City that has a bust of the conqueror.  Another eighteenth-century example of private philanthropy that then became a crown institution was the \u2018'Hospicio de Pobres'\u2019, the Mexico City Poor House, founded in 1774 with funds of a single ecclesiastical donor, Choirmaster of the Cathedral, Fernando Ortiz Cort\u00e9s, who became its first director.<ref>Arrom, ''Containing the Poor'', p. 44.</ref> That institution lasted about a century, until 1871, going from a [[poor house]] or [[work house]] for adults to mainly being an orphanage for abandoned street children.<ref>Silvia Arrom, \u2018'Containing the Poor: The Mexico City Poor House, 1774\u20131871. Durham: Duke University Press 2000.</ref> The Mexico City Poor House was partially supported by another eighteenth-century institution, the Royal Lottery.<ref>Arrom, ''Containing the Poor'', p. 55.</ref> There was also a foundling home established in 1767, the \u2018'Casa de Cuna'\u2019 (house of the cradle).<ref>Arrom, \u2018'Containing the Poor'\u2019, p. 14.</ref>\n[[Image:Cabrera 15 Coyote.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Castas]] ''De Mestizo y dd India; Coyote''. [[Miguel Cabrera]], 1763, oil on canvas, Waldo-Dentzel Art Center.]]\nDuring the viceroyalty of [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Revillagigedo]], there were attempts to control the public behavior of the poor in Mexico City.  Ordinances such as forbidding public defecation and urination had little effect, especially since there was no alternative for the poor to relieving one's self on the street. Also forbidden were the discarding of trash buckets, dead dogs and horse in the streets and gutters. A local police force was tasked with creating order and tidiness. The crown also attempted to regulate taverns, where the poor congregated, drank, gambled and in the estimate of elites, generally got up to no good.  Revillagigedo focused special attention on cleaning up the Plaza Mayor and the viceregal palace, removing pulque stalls, garbage, wandering dogs, cows, and pigs, moved the market area elsewhere.  He had the area paved with cobblestones, and the area was illuminated with newly place streetlamps. The Alameda park was cleaned and the entrance to it was guarded to prevent the poorly-clad plebe from entering. Public space was thus regulated cultural space, separating elites from the poor.<ref>Pamela Voekel, \"Peeing on the Palace: Bodily Resistance to Bourbon Reforms in Mexico City,\" ''Journal of Historical Sociology 5, no. 2 (June 1992), 183\u2013208.</ref>\n\nThe founding of the Royal Cigar Factory was another eighteenth-century crown project, part of the establishment of the royal tobacco monopoly, which both brought significant revenue to the crown in the sale of cigars and cigarettes, but the factory in Mexico City and a few other major colonial centers, created thousands of good jobs for the urban poor including women.<ref>Arrom, \u2018'Containing the Poor,\u2019\u2019 p. 15.</ref><ref>Susan Deans-Smith, ''Bureaucrats, Planters, and Workers: The Making of the Tobacco Monopoly in Bourbon Mexico.'' Austin: University of Texas Press 1992.</ref>\n\nAs Mexico experienced a series of droughts and bad harvests in the eighteenth century, the crown set up granaries (''alh\u00f3ndigas'') to store wheat and corn so that the price of basic staples did not soar for the urban poor. It was as much an act of charity as prudent state planning to prevent bread riots.  Mexico City had experienced two major riots in the seventeenth century, one in 1624 that ousted the viceroy who attempted to eliminate excessive profits for grain and other goods by creole traders.<ref>Jonathan I. Israel, ''Race and Class and Politics in Colonial Mexico''. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1975, pp. 150\u2013160.</ref> The other was in 1692 where a mob burned the archbishop's and the viceroy's official residence. A first-hand account of the 1692 riot was recorded by seventeenth-century savant, Don [[Carlos de Sig\u00fcenza y G\u00f3ngora]].<ref>R. Douglas Cope, ''The Limits of Racial Domination: Plebeian Society in Colonial Mexico, 1660\u20131720''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1994.</ref>\n\nOther institutions designed to protect and aid the vulnerable were the General Indian Court, founded in 1591, to give access of Indian communities and individual Indians to justice and supported by a half-real tax to pay for lawyers.<ref>Woodrow Borah, ''Justice by Insurance: The General Indian Court and the Legal Aides of the Half-Real''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1983.</ref> For women who needed protection, the Church created the ''recogimientos de mujeres'', a kind of shelter for healthy women who voluntarily wished to live a sheltered life in a religious atmosphere; some other institutions for women were to reform prostitutes and were not voluntary. Both types were in decline when the Mexico City Poor House was established.<ref>Arrom, \u2018'Containing the Poor''pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\nIn the capital and other Spanish cities in New Spain (and later after independence in 1821), there was a population of  '''''l\u00e9peros''''',<ref>Richard Warren, \"L\u00e9pero\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 3, p. 404. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref><ref>Torcuarto S. Di Tella, \"The Dangerous Classes in Early Nineteenth-Century Mexico,\" ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', vol. 5, no 1 (1973)79\u2013105.</ref> a term elites gave to shiftless vagrants of various racial categories in the colonial hierarchical racial system, the ''sociedad de [[castas]]''.  They were considered a kind of criminal class, contributing to the disorder of Mexico City.  Research has found that they included [[mestizo]]s, Indians, and poor whites (espa\u00f1oles). ''L\u00e9peros'' were viewed as unrespectable people (''el pueblo bajo'') by polite society (''la gente culta''), who judged them as being morally and biologically inferior.<ref>Michael Scardaville, \"Crime and the Urban Poor: Mexico City in the Late Colonial Period.\" PhD dissertation, University of Florida 1977, pp.23\u201324.</ref> L\u00e9peros supported themselves as they could through petty commerce or begging, but many resorted to crime. A study of crime in eighteenth-century Mexico City based on official arrest records of the two police forces of Mexico City indicates that l\u00e9peros were \"neither marginal types nor dregs of the lower classes. They consisted of both men and women; they were not particularly young; they were not mainly single and rootless; they were not merely Indian and casta; and they were not largely unskilled.\"<ref name=\"Scardaville p. 22\">Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 22.</ref> All of the popular stereotypes of a young rootless, unskilled male are not borne out by the arrest records. \"The dangerous class existed only in the collective mind of the colonial elite.\"<ref name=\"Scardaville p. 22\"/> [[Claudio Linati]] depicts a barefoot and shirtless \"l\u00e9pero or vagabond\", in the 1820s, lounging against a wall, smoking a cigarette with his dog gazing up at him. The scene suggests both his vice and laziness.<ref>Claudio Linati, ''Costumes civils, militaires et religieux du Mexique''. \"L\u00e9pero o vagabond\", plate 31. Ed. Justino Fern\u00e1ndez 1828. Reprinted Mexico City: Imprenta Universitaria 1956.</ref>\n\nArrest records are one of the few ways to get at empirical data about the urban poor. Not all arrests led to criminal cases and prosecuted, and not all prosecutions led to convictions. Formal prosecutions usually involved serious crimes against persons (homicide, aggravated assault), but also gambling.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 9.</ref> In the late colonial period, the police actively arrested the largest number of people (both men and women) for tavern violations, drunkenness, gambling, disorderly conduct, and violence, as well as the sexual crimes of \"incontinence\", i.e., what English law calls common-law marriage, living together without marriage, and promiscuity.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 10.</ref> They made arrests for other crimes only when a complaint was filed; these crimes included theft, vagrancy, family offenses, and debt.<ref>''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 10.</ref>\n\nIndians were over-represented in arrest records, that is they were arrested at higher rates than their proportion of the population.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 19.</ref> They were most often arrested for drunkenness, theft, and violence.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 20</ref> Non-Indians (\u2018'gente de raz\u00f3n'\u2019, a category that included Spaniards, mestizos, mulatos, and other mixed-race castas) were arrested for financial crimes (gambling, debt), tavern violations, family offenses, vagrancy, and disorderly conduct.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 20.</ref> Indians and non-Indians were jailed separately.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 12.</ref>\nWomen were arrested less frequently than men, but they were still about a quarter of total arrests.

Arrest records indicate that many of these women had provincial origins and the women migrated to the capital leaving a spouse behind. Their arrests for desertion indicates their spouses wanted them reunited with the family. In trials the women often stated that nonsupport or domestic abuse was the reason they deserted.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 164-65.</ref>\n\nMen also deserted their wives, but were arrested in smaller numbers (perhaps not reflecting the real extent of their desertion); these men abandoning their families did so between the ages of 20 and 49.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 164.</ref> In their trials, many men cited their inability to support their families as the reason for desertion.  The insecurity of employment of the lower classes meant that there was continuous stress on the urban poor families, particularly for unskilled or semi-skilled workers, although artisans also abandoned their families.<ref>Scardaville, ''Crime and the Urban Poor'', p. 165.</ref>\n\n==Independence to the Mexican Revolution==\n\n===Mexican Independence and Iturbide===\n[[File:Iturbide.jpg|thumb|left|Manuel Iturbide]]\n[[File:Entrada del Trigarante.JPG|thumb|Entry of the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] into Mexico City, 27 September 1821]] \n[[File:Proclamaci\u00f3n Iturbide.JPG|thumb|Proclamation of Iturbide as emperor, 18 May 1822]]\n\nWhen [[Mexican War of Independence|rebellion against Spanish rule]] broke out, interests outside of Mexico City would be represented by Father [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] and others. While the nobility in Mexico City also did not like the absolute colonial system, their goal was limited representation and autonomy within the Spanish empire.  They decided to make their stand in 1820, after the rural insurgency had been going on for several years, choosing Colonel [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] to push their interests militarily.  Iturbide had fought against Morelos between 1813 and 1816.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> However, between 1816 and 1820, Iturbide was becoming sympathetic to the idea of some degree of independence for Mexico. In 1821, Iturbide was the supreme commander of the royalist forces and had put down all but one of the major rebels, [[Vicente Guerrero]]. Iturbide decided to meet with Guerrero, after becoming convinced that independence was the only real course for Mexico. However, Iturbide's idea was a Mexican monarchy with ties to King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].<ref name=\"Iturbide\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.casaimperial.org/augustin.htm\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040411084151/http://www.casaimperial.org/augustin.htm\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 11 April 2004\n |title      = Don Agustin de Iturbide\n |accessdate = 20 October 2008\n}}</ref>\nAfter switching sides, Iturbide chose to pressure the colonial government by repeating Hidalgo's strategy of closing in on the city from the surrounding area.  Iturbide was able to succeed where Hidalgo had not because the Spanish-born commanders in the city supported Iturbide's idea of limited autonomy, and many the royalist forces were in the field battling insurgents like Guerrero. Iturbide's [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] (Independence, Union, Religion) entered Mexico City on 21 September 1821.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> On the following 27 September, Mexico was declared independent.<ref name=\"Iturbide\"/>\nThe Mexico City nobles sought to preserve as much of the old as possible, and garnered the support of a substantial section of the royalist army to recreate central power. Their objective was to halt the devolution of power to the regions outside the city and the lower echelons of society.<ref name=\"Hamnett\"/> Shortly after his triumphant entrance into the city, Iturbide declared what is now known as the [[First Mexican Empire]], with himself as emperor, from the palace that now bears his name.<ref name=\"ciudadmexico\"/> The coronation of Agust\u00edn as emperor and his wife Ana Mar\u00eda as empress took place amid much pomp and circumstance on 21 July 1822 at the Cathedral of Mexico City. The [[Archbishop Fonte]] presided over the anointment of the Emperor who following [[Napoleon]]'s example, crowned himself.<ref name=\"Iturbide\"/>\nFollowing his coronation, the new empire was politically and financially unstable. Iturbide was accused of taking too much power for himself, and his main rival was [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]. In the spring of 1823, Iturbide offered his abdication, which was accepted by his political opponents and then left the country for Europe.<ref name=\"Iturbide\"/> \nMexico was then declared a republic. The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|republican constitution of 1824]] established Mexico City as the nation's capital.

General [[Gabriel Valencia]] decided to move his troops from San \u00c1ngel to the then town of [[Magdalena Contreras|Contreras]].

In this place died in the battle the [[Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes]], students of the college with ages from 13 to 19 years. General [[Gideon Pillow]] and his 2,500&nbsp;men led the assault, starting from the Molino del Rey to the west of Chapultepec. General [[John Quitman]] entered in from the south to cut Chapultepec off from reinforcements, while General [[David Twiggs]] fought against positions further east.

Santa Anna's losses to the Americans created great discontent among his political opponents who coalesced to call themselves the Reform movement or the Liberals.  Those who supported Santa Anna's regime and the power of the Catholic Church were called the Conservatives. The [[Reform War]] lasted from 1857 to 1861. For a time, the two factions had parallel governments with the Liberals in Veracruz and the Conservatives in Mexico City.

The intervention, supported by Mexican conservatives, installed [[Maximilian of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]] as the ruler of a newly created monarchy, the [[Second Mexican Empire]].\n\nEmperor Maximilian undertook an accelerated program of urban renovation under the supervision of Mexican architect, Francisco Somera. Somera had served on the city council of the capital and dealt with the city's infrastructure, such as roads, sewers, canals, and pavement.  His portfolio and expertise meant he was concerned with the ongoing problem of flooding in the capital, especially during heavy rains, which the major colonial-era project of drainage, the ''Desag\u00fce'', had not solved. He was also significantly involved with the expansion of the city from its historic urban core.<ref>Mar\u00eda Dolores Morales, \"Francisco Somera y el primer fraccionamiento de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico,\" ''Formaci\u00f3n y desarrollo de la burgues\u00eda en M\u00e9xico'', Ciro Cardoso, ed.

In 1865, Emperor Maximilian had a wide avenue, ''Paseo del Emperador'' or ''Paseo de la Emperatriz'', planned by Francisco Somera, and built to connect the emperor's residence at [[Chapultepec Castle]] with the National Palace in the downtown core. All along this avenue there were plans to place statues of heroes of Mexican history, which were not realized until the regime of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], starting in 1877. However, the thoroughfare extends southwest to northeast, breaking the north\u2013south, east\u2013west orientation of roads before it. With the ouster of the imperial French in 1867 and return to Mexico City of republican president Benito Ju\u00e1rez, the avenue was initially renamed Calzada Degollado and then in 1872 changed to [[Paseo de la Reforma]].<ref>Agostoni, Claudia.

Photo taken on a Sunday when the boulevard is closed to vehicular traffic and used by pedestrians and bicyclists.]]\nPresident [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] ruled the nation for more than three decades between 1876 and 1910. During this time, he developed the city's infrastructure, such as roads, schools, transportation, and communication systems. He also encouraged foreign investment and laid the groundwork for industrial development. In Mexico City, these improvements were most apparent, since this is where government elites, foreign investors, and domestic entrepreneurs lived and worked, while the countryside and smaller cities and pueblos languished.\n\nWith the ouster of the French occupiers and the political exile of their conservative Mexican supporters, liberalism put its stamp on Mexico City in the form of new monuments and the renaming of streets.  Most prominently, the new, wide avenue became Paseo de la Reforma, with statues of liberal heroes and others important to Mexican history lining its route. The monument mania on the Paseo started in 1877 with the [[Monument to Christopher Columbus (Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City)|Monument to Christopher Columbus]] donated by Mexican railway magnate [[:es:Antonio Escand\u00f3n|Antonio Escand\u00f3n]] designed by French sculptor [[Charles Cordier]], followed by the [[Monument to Cuauht\u00e9moc]], both in major traffic circles (''glorietas'').\n\nAs with earlier regimes, Diaz re-purposed a number of older buildings. One was [[Belem Prison]], a colonial-era building that was used to produce pseudoscience about criminals. The police had started to take photos of prisoners in Belem in the 1850s, to identify them in case of an escape. Diaz wanted to professionalize the police and the [[Mexico City Police]] adopted the [[Bertillon method]] to catalogue and identify repeat offenders. The [[Palacio de Lecumberri]] prison in Mexico City drew on the [[panopticon]] concepts of Jeremy Bentham and was completed in 1900. It became symbolic for Diaz's attempt to put criminals under visual [[surveillance]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Public Spectacles of Violence: Sensational Cinema and Journalism in Early Twentieth-Century Mexico and Brazil|last= Navitski|first= Rielle|publisher=Duke University Press |year=2017 |isbn=9780822372899}}</ref>\n\nIn 1910, Mexico celebrated the 1810 Hidalgo revolt that initiated the independence movement in Mexico. D\u00edaz had been in power since 1876 and saw the occasion of the centenary as an opportunity for the creation of new buildings and monuments and to invite world dignitaries to show off Mexico's progress. For buildings, much advance planning and other work was needed to have them completed in time for September 1910. During that month in Mexico City, there were \"inaugurations of a new modern mental hospital, a popular hygiene exhibition, an exhibition of Spanish art and industry, exhibitions of Japanese products and avant-garde Mexican art, a monument to [[Alexander von Humboldt]] at the National Library, a seismological station, a new theater in the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, primary schools, new buildings for ministries, and new large schools for teachers.\"<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''I Speak of the City: Mexico City at the Turn of the Twentieth Century''.

However, the regime concentrated resources and wealth in the hands of a few people. The majority of the nation languished in poverty. Social injustice led to nationwide revolts, and ultimately the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910\u20131917). The city was not untouched by the revolution. Battles were fought on its streets, and thousands of displaced villagers became refugees in the city. During the revolution, the city was briefly taken over by the famous revolutionaries [[Pancho Villa|Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]].<ref name=\"citydata\"/> While most of the Mexican Revolution was not fought within the city, one major episode of this era was. [[La decena tr\u00e1gica]] (\"The Ten Tragic Days\") was a series of events leading to a coup d'\u00e9tat in Mexico City between 9&nbsp;and 22 February 1913 against President [[Francisco I. Madero]] and his vice president, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]]. After deposing President Porfirio D\u00edaz and taking power in 1911, Mexicans expected Madero to make widespread changes in government but were surprised and disappointed to find Madero following many of the same policies and employing the same personnel as the D\u00edaz government. This eventually resulted in revolts against the Madero regime. Madero's fear of these revolts led him to commission [[Victoriano Huerta]] as chief general of the [[Huerta's Federal Army|Federal Army]]. Huerta was effective in putting down rebellions, but had ambitions that Madero was blind to.  Military success gave Huerta power, and he saw an opportunity to make himself dictator.  La decena tr\u00e1gica began when military academy cadets quartered in [[Tacubaya]] revolted and began an attack against the National Palace. Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez returned to the Palace to address the crisis, calling in reserves from other military academies and the forces of [[Felipe \u00c1ngeles]] in [[Cuernavaca]] to assist in defense. Meanwhile, Huerta convinced Madero to allow him to take over defense of the National Palace. Huerta betrayed Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez forcing Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez to sign resignations. On the night of 22 February, Huerta ordered Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez to be transferred to the [[Palacio de Lecumberri|Lecumberri prison]], supposedly to be held for transfer to exile. Before the car reached the prison, it was pulled over by armed men and Madero and Pino Su\u00e1rez were shot and killed.<ref name=\"redescolar\">{{cite web \n|url= http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/sigloxx/xx_dece.htm \n|title= La Decena Tr\u00e1gica, febrero de 1913 \n|language= Spanish \n|accessdate= 19 October 2008 \n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130620151846/http://redescolar.ilce.edu.mx/redescolar/act_permanentes/historia/histdeltiempo/mexicana/sigloxx/xx_dece.htm \n|archive-date= 20 June 2013 \n|url-status= dead \n}}</ref>\n\n==20th century to present==\n===Loss of democracy and recovery===\n[[File:Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas (cropped).jpg|80px|thumb|left|Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]]\nMexico City lost its democratically-elected mayor and legislature/city council in 1928, which left its urban middle class and workers without legislative redress. The [[List of heads of government of Mexico City|mayor]] was appointed by the President of Mexico.  Residents of the densely populated capital became dependent on the newly formed [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Party of National Revolution (PNR)]] to dress its concerns.  During the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas presidency (1934\u201340), the government reduced spending in the capital, leaving infrastructure, such as water, sewage, lighting, without resources. C\u00e1rdenas did not implement rent control or aid urban renters, and in 1938\u201339, renters attempted to gain advantage by organizing rent strikes. The middle class and the urban poor joined in the attempt.<ref>Davis, Diane. \"Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional de Organizaciones Populares, CNOP\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

Many street names were changed to commemorate the deeds of revolutionary heroes, including [[Francisco Madero]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pino Su\u00e1rez]], whose democratically-elected government was overthrown by military coup in 1913.\n\n===Growth of the city===\n[[File:Mexico City seen from Torre Latinoamericana.JPG|thumb|left|Mexico City as seen from the [[Torre Latinoamericana]], looking toward the [[Z\u00f3calo]]]]\nIn 1900, the population of Mexico City was about 500,000.<ref name=\"larosa\"/> By the end of the 19th century, the perimeter of the city had noticeably grown again and by 1929, the boundaries lost any sense of regularity. The city had grown to reach Tacuba, [[Nextengo]], Popotla, east of now [[Metro San L\u00e1zaro]] and [[Metro Tasque\u00f1a]], [[Miguel \u00c1ngel de Quevedo]] to the south and [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] and Azcapotzalco to the west and north as the last of the lake dried up.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> The city continued to modernize at a rapid pace. Old palaces and colonial homes were demolished to make way for new roads and modern buildings. By 1924, [[Avenida de los Insurgentes]], considered today one of the world's longest avenues, was being laid out.<ref name=\"citydata\"/>\n\nThe city would begin to extend south starting in 1905, breaking the [[Chapultepec aqueduct|Avenida Chapultepec/Arcos de Belen]] southern boundary that had existed for centuries. Colonia Hidalgo (now [[Colonia Doctores]]) was being established with [[Colonia Obrera]] and [[Colonia Roma]] being laid out in a rectangular fashion, similar to the older part of the city.  Obrera was named after the artisans that populated the place when it was established, and Roma was for the upper-classes, reaching the height of its splendor between 1917 and 1922.  Another wealthy neighborhood that was established at this time was [[Colonia Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico City|Colonia Ju\u00e1rez]], naming their streets after the capitals of Europe. In the first decades of the 20th century, the city extended north to the R\u00edo de Consulado, east to [[Metro Jamaica]], west to [[Chapultepec]] and south to roughly were the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|Secretariat of Communications and Transportation]] building at Xola is now.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nFrom the 1930s on, Mexico City would see an increase in the rate of growth of the city. Colonias Roma and Ju\u00e1rez prospered rapidly and this with the wide Paseo de Reforma to help with transportation, led to the establishments of colonias heading west such as [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] and [[Condesa|Hipodromo]], extending the city past the Chapultepec forest (now a park). The extension of Insurgentes Avenue southward to where the [[Metro Chilpancingo|Chilpancingo Metro station]] is now, led to the establishment of even more colonias. Between 1928 and 1953, other western colonias such as [[Colonia Anzures|Anzures]], and [[Polanco, Mexico City|Polanco]] for the wealthy, and colonias [[Colonia 20 de Noviembre|20 de Noviembre]], [[Colonia Bondojito|Bondojito]], [[Colonia Gertrudis Sanchez|Gertrudis S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Colonia Petrolera|Petrolera]] for the working class arose with another additional 585 colonias.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/>\n\nBy 1940 Mexico City had become not only the political and economic capital of Mexico, but also the world's largest [[megalopolis]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Planning Latin America's Capital Cities, 1850\u20131950| editors=Arturo Almandoz & Arturo Almandoz Marte|publisher=Psychology Press |year=2002|isbn=9780415272650|pages=140}}</ref> Between 1929 and 1953, growth spread east to establish colonias [[Colonia Federal|Federal]], [[Colonia Moctezuma|Moctezuma]] and [[Colonia Jardin Balbuena|Jard\u00edn Balbuena]], to the north and urban area included all of Azcapotzalco and reached [[Ampliacion Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez]] including Ticoman, [[Zacatenco]] and [[Santa Isabel Tola]]. To the west, the most notable growth was from [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] west to the limits of the [[State of Mexico]]. Areas such as [[Tacubaya]], [[Villa de Guadalupe, Mexico City|Villa de Guadalupe]], [[Coyoac\u00e1n]] and San \u00c1ngel were still considered separate entities.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> A major infrastructure project for mass transit was the ring road, or ''Anillo Perif\u00e9rico'', completed in 1964.

The column with the [[Angel of Independence]] was erected in 1910 for the centenary of Mexican Independence, the ironwork [[Congress of Mexico|Legislative Palace]], [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] and a building called La Nacional.  The first skyscraper, 40-story [[Torre Latinoamericana]] was built in the 1950s. All of these were in the main core of the city, laid out in the sixteenth century.\n\nA major departure in location and scale was the construction of the [[University City of Mexico|Ciudad Universitaria]] from 1950 to 1953 in the south of the city.  It had a noticeable effect on subsequent architecture in the city. The most notable buildings are the Rector\u00eda designed by [[Salvador Ortega]], [[Mario Pani]] and [[Enrique del Moral]], the Library, by [[Juan O'Gorman]], [[Gustavo Saavedra]] and [[Juan Mart\u00ednez de Velasco]] and the Science Building by [[Ra\u00fal Cacho]], [[Eugenio Peschard]] and [[F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez]].<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> Much of what makes the campus culturally significant is its huge murals that decorate the facades of many of the buildings.

There had been proposals for a subway system dating back decades, but political forces in favor of car owners (middle class and elites) blocked the plans for underground mass transit. The subway system allows for movement of large numbers of people to increasingly far flung areas of the city. When the [[University City of Mexico|Ciudad Universitaria]] opened, which relocated [[UNAM]] to the south of the city, there was no metro line.\n\nExplosive growth in the population of the city started from the 1960s, with the population overflowing the boundaries of the Federal District into neighboring state of Mexico, especially to the north, northwest and northeast. Between 1960 and 1980 the city's population more than doubled to 8,831,079.<ref name=\"EncMex2000\"/> Under relentless growth, Mexico City had lost its charm by the 1970s, when the government could barely keep up with services. Mexico City was choking in smog and pollution. Villagers from the countryside who continued to pour into the city to escape poverty only compounded the city's problems. With no housing available, they took over lands surrounding the city, creating huge [[shanty town]]s that extended for many miles.<ref name=\"citydata\"/>\n\nMexico City is still the cultural, economic, and industrial center for the nation. With a metropolitan-area population approaching 20 million, roughly equivalent to the entire state of Texas, it is a magnet of growth. People in large numbers still migrate from rural areas to the city in search of work and the other economic. Many of these immigrants settle illegally in the urban fringe with the hope that the government will eventually provide public services. The provision of water and wastewater service for the growing population of Mexico City is the problem air pollution was in the 1970s and 1980s. Such growth rates and patterns mean substandard potable water supplies and waste water treatment, if they exist at all. Over 70% of Mexico City's potable water from the aquifer below it, which is being [[overexploited]], causing the city to sink.<ref name=\"water\">{{cite book \n|title= Mexico City's Water Supply : Improving the Outlook for Sustainability\n\n|year= 1995 \n|publisher= National Academies Press \n|location= Washington, D.C., USA \n|page= 4 }}</ref>\n\nThe south of the Federal District contains a number of ecological reserves; one of the most important being the [[Ajusco]] reserve. Growth pushing of the edges of this reserve has been causing both economic and political struggles which include fraudulent real estate schemes, illegal development of [[ejido|ejidal]] property, along with popular resistance and opposition movements. A major problem is the illegal movement of the poor building shantytowns, then resisting eviction, often with violence, often until the government gives into demands to build popular-sector housing in the area.  While such housing is needed, the whole process is ecologically destructive.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite book \n|title= Livable Cities? : Urban Struggles for Livelihood and Sustainability \n|editor=Evans, Peter B.\n|year= 2002 \n|location= Ewing, New Jersey, USA \n|pages= 196|publisher =University of California Press }}</ref>\n\n===Decline and revitalization of the city center===\nFrom Aztec times, the [[Centro (Mexico City)|Centro Hist\u00f3rico]] used to be where the wealthy and elite lived.  However, in the early 20th century, these classes began to move to areas west and southwest of the Centro, to neighbourhoods such as [[Colonia Ju\u00e1rez (Mexico City)|Colonia Ju\u00e1rez]], [[Colonia Cuauht\u00e9moc, Mexico City|Colonia Cuauht\u00e9moc]], [[Colonia Roma]] and [[Condesa|Colonia Condesa]]. The Centro remained the commercial, political and intellectual center through the mid 20th century, although it was around this time that [[UNAM]] moved most of its facilities to the new Ciudad Universitaria.<ref name=\"Lonely\"/> The reason for the decline of the city center was partly man-made and partly natural.  In the 1940s, the city government froze rents so that until 1998, when the government repealed the law, tenants were still paying what they were in the 1950s. With no financial incentive to keep up their properties, landlords let their buildings disintegrate. The [[1985 Mexico City earthquake|1985 earthquake]] took its toll on a number of these structures, which were never fixed or rebuilt, leading to slums with and garbage-strewn vacant lots. The result was the loss of about 100,000&nbsp;residents of the \"Colonia Centro\", leaving the area almost deserted at night.<ref name=\"belated\">{{cite journal \n|last=Butler \n|first=Ron \n|date=September 2002 \n|title=Center of Belated Attention \n|journal=Economist \n|volume=364 \n|issue=8290 \n|pages=37 \n}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1980s, so much had fled the Centro that many of its former mansions were either abandoned or turned into tenements for the poor,<ref name=\"Lonely\"/><ref name=\"facelift\">{{cite journal \n|last=Smith \n|first=Geri \n|date=May 2004 \n|title=Mexico City gets a face-lift \n|journal=Business Week \n|issue=3884 \n|id=00077135 \n}}</ref> and its sidewalks and streets taken over by [[pickpocket]]s and milling vendors.<ref name=\"belated\"/><ref name=\"facelift\"/> For many people, especially international visitors, Mexico City's reputation for pollution, traffic and crime has made the city someplace \"get into and out of as fast as you can,\"<ref name=\"facelift\"/> seeing it as little more than an airport through which to make their connecting flights to the more attractive resort areas.<ref name=\"belated\"/><ref name=\"facelift\"/> Until recently, many of the restaurants of the area, even the best, would close early to allow employees time to get home because the area was not particularly safe at night.<ref name=\"newface\">{{cite journal \n|last=Butler \n|first=Ron \n|date=Nov\u2013Dec 1999 \n|title=A New Face for the Zocalo \n|journal=Americas \n|volume=51 \n|issue=6 \n|pages=4\u20136 \n|id=03790940 \n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:AllendeStreetCentroDF.JPG|thumb|Allende Street near Tacuba Street.

Starting in the early 2000s, it infused 500&nbsp;million [[Mexican peso|pesos]] (US$55&nbsp;million) into the Historic Center Trust<ref name=\"belated\"/> and entered into a partnership with a business group led by [[Carlos Slim]], to buy dozens of centuries-old buildings and other real estate to rehabilitate.<ref name=\"facelift\"/> Work began with renovating 34&nbsp;blocks west of the Z\u00f3calo, digging up the antiquated drainage system and improving water supply.

This centralism simply changed hands when the Spanish arrived, The [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI), which came to power after the Mexican Revolution, again consolidated political power to the city, which benefited to the detriment of other parts of the country. The rapid expansion of Mexico City is related to the country's economic development in the period after World War II, the widening of the manufacturing sector, the success of the oil industry, and the country's proximity to U.S. markets. This growth allowed for the tolerance of PRI's authoritarianism.<ref name=\"larosa\"/> It still experienced economic growth up to the 1960s, but problems brought on by the one-party system were beginning to show. In 1968, Mexico City hosted the Summer Olympic Games. The event was meant to signal the prosperity of a developing nation, but serious problems had been masked by the PRI's authoritarian regime. Shortly before the inauguration of the Games, [[Tlatelolco massacre|government troops massacred]] an unknown number of protesting students in Tlatelolco.<ref name=\"citydata\"/> However, the last straw may have been the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]]. On Thursday, 19 September 1985, at 7:19&nbsp;am local time, Mexico City was struck by an earthquake of magnitude&nbsp;8.1.<ref name=\"Campus\">{{cite news\n |first=Yunnven \n |last=Campus \n |title=A 20 a\u00f1os del sismo del 85 \n |url=http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/terremoto/475688.html \n |publisher=Televisa \n |location=Mexico City \n |date=19 September 2005 \n |accessdate=4 October 2008 \n |language=Spanish \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922025641/http://www.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/terremoto/475688.html \n |archivedate=22 September 2008 \n}}</ref> on the [[Richter magnitude scale]].  The event caused between three and four billion USD in damage as 412&nbsp;buildings collapsed and another 3,124&nbsp;were seriously damaged in the city.

This significantly affected politics in the years after the event.<ref name=\"haber\"/> This discontent eventually led to [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]], a member of the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]], becoming the first elected [[mayor of Mexico City]] in 1997.  C\u00e1rdenas promised a more democratic government, and his party claimed some victories against crime, pollution, and other major problems. He resigned in 1999 to run (unsuccessfully) for the presidency. [[Rosario Robles Berlanga]], the first woman to hold the mayoral post, promised she would continue to reverse the city's decline.<ref name=\"citydata\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Index of Mexico-related articles]]\n* [[Timeline of Mexico City]]\n* [[Gentrification of Mexico City]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{see also|Timeline of Mexico City#Bibliography}}\n\n===General===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Agostoni, Claudia.
